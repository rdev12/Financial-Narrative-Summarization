Revenue was up by £31 million, or 1.9 per cent, to £1,720 
million. This increase is lower than the allowed regulated 
price rise for 2014/15 of 3.8 per cent nominal (1.2 per cent 
real price increase, plus 2.6 per cent RPI inflation), mainly 
reflecting the previously announced special customer 
discount which has been applied to this year’s bills.
Underlying operating profit increased by £30 million to 
£664 million, as we continue to tightly manage our cost 
base, despite the expected increase in depreciation and 
other cost pressures, including bad debt. There was also 
a planned, phased reduction in infrastructure renewals 
expenditure in the year, as we completed the five-year 
regulatory period.  
Total dividend per ordinary share for 2014/15 of 37.70 
pence. This is an increase of 4.6 per cent on last year, as we 
delivered our 2010-15 dividend policy.

Customers
Customer satisfaction remains 
a priority and we were the most 
improved water company over the 
2010–15 regulatory period. Our 
improvements have helped reduce 
further the number of customers 
who need to contact us about the 
service they receive by around  75 
per cent over the five-year period. 
We continually review the causes of 
customer dissatisfaction and revise 
our training, policies, processes 
and systems to drive improvement. 
We were pleased that our improved 
customer satisfaction performance 
over the period took us out of Ofwat’s 
service incentive mechanism (SIM) 
penalty zone, thereby also benefiting 
shareholders. 
Ofwat will change the process it uses 
to assess customer satisfaction 
during the next five-year regulatory 
period. This new SIM measure has been 
piloted over the last 12 months and has 
helped us identify that, while customer 
satisfaction with our services is 
continually improving, we could do 
better in keeping customers informed 
whilst we are resolving their issue. 
This will be a key area of focus for 
us in continuing to deliver improving 
satisfaction.
Modern customer relationship 
management (CRM) systems can offer 
a much improved customer experience 
as well as efficiencies in customer-
facing operations. We were pleased to 
receive Ofwat’s support for our plan 
to invest in a new CRM system in the 
2015–20 period and we are already 
in the detailed design phase before 
implementation.
Our assets
The reliable and efficient operation of 
our assets is critical to both customer 
service and our environmental 
performance. 
Targeted investment in our assets, 
processes and the people who operate 
them has supported an improvement 
in our environmental performance as 
measured by the Environment Agency 
(EA), positioning us again as one of the 
best performers in our sector. 
The last 12 month 
period was the fifth 
and final year of the 
2010–15 regulatory 
period. Our objective 
over this period was to 
deliver improved and 
sustainable underlying 
performance for the 
benefit of customers, 
the environment and 
shareholders. We are 
pleased to report that 
we achieved this. 
We were the most 
improved water 
company for customer 
satisfaction over 
2010–15
We invested
£3.8bn
in the renewal and upgrade 
of our assets across the

Performance against indices used by 
the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) 
to measure water quality has also 
improved and we achieved our best 
ever performance over the last year. 
Asset serviceability was assessed as 
stable or improving over the last 12 
months, representing a significant and 
sustained improvement since the start 
of the 2010–15 regulatory period. 
We were delighted to outperform our 
leakage target for the year – the ninth 
successive year in which we have met 
or beaten our target.
The improvements made early in 
the 2010–15 regulatory period to 
our project and risk management 
processes have supported the 
successful delivery of our capital 
programme. We invested a substantial 
£3.8 billion in the renewal and upgrade 
of our assets across the last five years, 
with over £850 million invested over 
the last 12 months. We measure the 
effectiveness of our investment using 
our Time, Cost and Quality index for 
which we scored 97 per cent this year 
– ahead of our targets and consistent 
with the good performance of the 
previous year. 
We have already invested around £40 
million to accelerate project delivery 
relating to schemes due to be delivered 
early in the 2015–20 period and to 
secure associated benefits. 
A difficult economic environment
Although unemployment in the 
North West has reduced over the 
last 12 months, our region has the 
highest proportion of disadvantaged 
households in England and therefore 
customer indebtedness continues to 
be a significant challenge for us.
Our collections team continues to work 
hard to contain bad debt levels. During 
the year we implemented data sharing 
with the credit reference agency 
‘Experian’ and this is helping to identify 
those customers who could pay their 
bill but choose not to. For those 
struggling to pay, we continue to offer 
a wide range of ways to help them back 
into regular payment. This includes 
an independently administered trust 
fund for which we increased our annual 
contribution using a cash tax refund 
from HMRC. We also gained customer 
support to launch a social tariff for 
those customers who receive Pension 
Credit.
Business retail
Having secured a retail licence in 2012, 
we have been a leading competitor in 
the Scottish business retail market 
securing over 200 customers, covering 
over 2,800 sites, and representing 
future annual revenue of £15 million. 
During this period we have seen the 
number of active market participants 
increase to around 18 and as a 
consequence, pricing is becoming 
increasingly competitive. We continue 
to bid selectively for profitable 
business where our value-added 
solutions offer benefits to customers.
The Water Act 2014 confirmed plans 
to open the English business retail 
market for water and wastewater 
services in 2017. Our experience of 
the Scottish business retail market is 
invaluable ahead of the English market 
opening and work is in hand to prepare 
our business retail and wholesale 
teams to address this development. We 
are actively engaged in the creation of 
a market operating company that will 
govern and facilitate  the switching of 
their retailer by business customers.
Strategy
Our Strategic Direction Statement, 
‘Playing our part to support the North 
West’ reflects extensive consultation 
with customers and other stakeholders 
to create our best view of what the 
next 25 years holds for our region. 
This includes economic, social and 
environmental developments such as 
the predicted impact of climate change. 
Our recently updated Water Resources 
Management Plan, which describes the 
projected pattern of water resource 
activity in our region until 2040, was 
approved by the Secretary of State 
in February 2015. This plan projects 
that the majority of the North West 
will be in surplus, benefiting from an 
integrated network that supports 
movement of water around the region 
to accommodate its changing supply 
and demand balance. Our plan includes 
a new Thirlmere pipeline to extend our 
integrated network to encompass West 
Cumbria. This will reduce abstraction 
from Ennerdale, thus protecting 
sensitive ecology, and improve security 
of supply for customers. 
As a lone agent, United Utilities could 
not deliver the scale of required 
environmental improvement at an 
acceptable level of cost. Instead we are 
committed to partnering with others 
who can support the achievement 
of our required outcomes – such as 
our ‘Turning tides’ partnership with 
the EA, local authorities, the Marine 
Conservation Society and other 
interested parties to improve bathing 
waters in the North West.

Chairman’s and Chief Executive  
Officer’s statement
Price Review
The 2015–20 Price Review 
represented a significant departure 
from previous reviews and proved to be 
a demanding period for both companies 
and regulators. Building on some of the 
changes introduced in the Water Act 
2014, the Price Review introduced:
•	 significantly enhanced customer 
consultation on the content and 
pricing of companies’ business 
plans;
•	 a new pricing structure involving 
four price caps: business retail, 
domestic retail, wholesale water and 
wholesale wastewater;
•	 new outcome delivery incentives 
(ODIs) providing penalties or 
rewards for company performance 
in aspects of its performance 
identified by customers as a 
priority; 
•	 a new SIM measure providing 
continuing focus on customer 
satisfaction; and
•	 preparation for full opening of 
the retail market for business 
customers. 
In formulating our 2015–20 business 
plan, we sought the views of over 
27,000 customers, as well as the 
views of our regulators and other 
stakeholders, to shape a plan that 
strikes the right balance for all our 
stakeholders. We worked closely 
with our regulators over the last 
year and our final plan resubmission 
in October 2014 took account of 
Ofwat’s upper-quartile efficiency 
targets across many aspects of our 
operations. Ofwat’s final determination 
in December represented a further 
efficiency challenge of £188 million, 
in the context of a wholesale total 
expenditure (totex) allowance of £5.3 
billion. Whilst challenging to deliver, the 
final determination has not required 
us to revisit the key components of our 
business plan.
In the final analysis, the board 
considered Ofwat’s proposal tough but,  
on balance, acceptable and confirmed 
its acceptance in January 2015.
Attractive to shareholders
We set out to deliver improved 
performance for customers and 
shareholders over the last five-year 
period. We delivered for both sets of 
stakeholders with improved customer 
satisfaction, better underlying 
operational performance and effective 
capital programme management. 
Revenue increased by 1.9 per cent to 
£1.72 billion and underlying operating 
profit was up 4.7 per cent to £664 
million. Underlying earnings per share 
increased by 16 per cent to 51.9 pence. 
We exceeded our outperformance 
targets for the five years, supporting 
our dividend growth target throughout 
the period and building dividend 
cover as we approached the changes 
introduced in the 2015–20 Price Review. 
The board is proposing a final dividend of 
25.14 pence per ordinary share, making 
a total of 37.70 pence per ordinary 
share for the 2014/15 financial year. 
Pictured: Our new £1.5 million purpose-built 
technical training centre in Bolton is part of 
our training and apprenticeship programme 
to source the next generation of water 
engineers. Facilities include mechanical and 
electrical workshops, a laboratory and a 
mock sewer system, with around 70 trainees 
attending each day.
Sharing success
We have sought to share the benefits 
of our improvements over the last 
five years between customers, the 
environment and shareholders. 
Around £200 million of capital 
savings has been reinvested in 
projects that deliver benefits to 
customers or the environment. 
We have also used a portion of our 
financing outperformance to support 
our private sewer network.
We received a cash tax refund 
from HMRC in 2013/14 and we 
have committed to share this with 
customers. We provided a special 
customer discount in 2014/15 
of around £20 million and have 
committed further support to help 
customers struggling to pay their 
bills.
Our customers are set to benefit 
from both continued significant 
levels of investment and below 
inflation growth in average 
household bills for the decade to 
2020.

This represents an increase of 4.6 
per cent compared with last year. The 
final dividend is expected to be paid to 
shareholders on 3 August 2015.
In accepting our final determination, 
the board approved a policy of 
maintaining the existing level of 
dividend and targeting a growth rate of 
at least RPI inflation each year through 
to 2020.
To support the retention of a robust 
capital structure, we aim to maintain 
efficient access to debt capital 
markets throughout the economic 
cycle. The board believes that it is 
appropriate to keep gearing, measured 
as net debt to regulatory capital value, 
within our existing target range of 55 
to 65 per cent. We also aim to maintain, 
as a minimum, our existing credit 
ratings of A3 with Moody’s and BBB+ 
with Standard & Poor’s for United 
Utilities Water Limited.
2015–20 performance
We are focused on continuous 
improvement and our new operating 
model for our wholesale business is 
employing technology and new work 
processes to deliver enhanced customer 
satisfaction and operational efficiency. 
Measurement of our progress across 
the next five years will use a mix of 
existing and new measures, which 
reflect the revised structure and 
features of this price control.  This 
forthcoming period will see a greater 
emphasis on operational excellence as a 
means of earning financial rewards.
We expect that our environmental 
and water quality regulators, the 
EA and the DWI respectively, will 
continue to use a basket of established 
measures to assess our performance. 
New for the next period is a revised 
SIM measure and a series of ODIs, 
to which are attached penalties and 
rewards. We will also focus more on 
total expenditure, rather than on the 
individual measures of opex and capex , 
in line with Ofwat’s move to this way of 
assessing costs. 
We have refined our key performance 
indicators (KPIs) for the 2015–20 
period, which will recognise the 
tougher operational and financial 
targets inherent in the final 
determination settlement. We do 
not intend to set targets for the 
2015–20 period until we have more 
experience of operating under the 
new arrangements. However, more 
detail of these KPIs is provided within 
this report on pages 50 and 51 and 
we intend to publish our performance 
annually.
Responsible business
Our aim is to operate in an 
environmentally sustainable, 
economically beneficial and socially 
responsible manner. In recognition 
of this focus, we retained our ‘World 
Class’ rating as measured by the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index, achieving 
industry leading status in the multi-
utility/water sector in the most recent 
assessment.
We are delighted to have led a 
North West pilot for the Energy and 
Efficiency Industrial Partnership, 
backed by UK Skills, in which we 
leveraged our investment in a new 
apprentice skills training facility 
in Bolton to help young people find 
employment. The programme involves 
skills training, interview technique and 
work experience and early trials have 
shown an over 60 per cent success rate 
in finding full-time employment for 
participants. Following the success of 
the pilot, the programme is now being 
rolled out across the UK. 
Our employees
None of our progress over the last 
12 months would have been achieved 
without the enthusiasm and commitment 
of the people who work for United 
Utilities – both our employees and those 
working for our sub-contracting partners 
that represent us in the field. We would 
like to thank them for their dedication 
and hard work in supporting customers 
and the environment every day of the 
year.
We work hard to sustain high levels of 
engagement by our employees. The 
company has seen significant change 
over the last four years and our plans 
will engage our teams for further 
improvements. Employee engagement 
is 79 per cent, well above the UK 
transitional norm and just below the 
norm for high performing UK companies.
Health and safety remains a key focus 
area. This year we placed greater 
emphasis on the ‘health’ component with 
investment in a new gym at our main 
office, along with measures to assist our 
employees in assessing their health and 
in securing faster access to treatment 
should it be necessary.
Our board
We strive to operate in a manner that 
reflects the highest standards of 
corporate governance. Our company 
structure and governance standards 
are designed to ensure that our 
board continues to provide sound and 
prudent governance in compliance with 
the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
We are pleased to welcome Lord 
Stephen Carter to the board following 
his appointment in September 2014 as 
an independent non-executive director. 
Stephen is Chief Executive at Informa 
plc and his operational expertise and 
previous public services roles will be an 
asset to the board.
Outlook
We are encouraged by our operational 
and customer service performance 
improvements and believe we can 
improve further. Substantial investment 
in our assets will continue, delivering 
additional benefits for our customers 
and the environment. We have made 
significant and sustained performance 
improvements over the last five years 
and, combined with our ‘systems 
thinking’ approach to operating the 
business, this provides a solid foundation 
for the future.

Our vision and strategy
The water industry 
makes a wide-ranging 
contribution to society, 
from the health of people 
and the environment 
to the strength of the 
economy.
Achieving our vision
Our vision is to become a leading North West service provider and one of the best 
UK water and wastewater companies. We will deliver this by providing the best 
service to customers at the lowest sustainable cost and in a responsible manner.
Our 25-year strategy
In order to maintain a reliable, 
high quality water service for our 
customers in the future, we have to 
look a long way ahead and anticipate 
those changes and core issues that  
are likely to impact on our activities. 
Our long-term strategy helps us to 
define what we need to deliver over  
the shorter term.
The water industry makes a wide-
ranging contribution to society, 
from the health of people and the 
environment to the strength  
of the economy.
In the next 25 years, we will face many 
challenges and opportunities including: 
•	 climate change and its implications 
for water resources and flooding;
•	 the emergence of a more open, 
competitive UK water market;
•	 more rigorous environmental 
regulations; and
•	 the ever-present need to combine 
affordable bills with a modern, 
responsive water and wastewater 
service.
By anticipating these changes and 
balancing them with our customers’ 
priorities, we can meet the future with 
confidence.
Our vision is to become a 
leading North West service 
provider and one of the best 
UK water and wastewater 
companies 
Planning for future 
water demand
Our 25-year Water Resource 
Management Plan sets out the 
investment needed to ensure 
that we have sufficient water to 
continue supplying our customers, 
taking into account the potential 
impact of climate change.

How we will achieve our 25-year strategy
Our Strategic Direction Statement, ‘Playing our part to support the North West’ 
(which can be downloaded at corporate.unitedutilities.com/future), sets out our 
long-term strategy for the next quarter century. 
It examines the challenges ahead 
and explains how we will focus our 
resources and talents in order to meet 
them. We consulted with thousands of 
customers and stakeholders to ensure 
their expectations are reflected in our 
plans. 
Their feedback helped create our five 
customer promises which, together 
with the 11 outcomes (shown on  page 
13), will guide the way we deliver our 
services, now and long into the future.
Our customer promises

These customer promises are reflected in our business plan for the next five 
years, which focuses on providing the best service to customers, at the lowest 
sustainable cost and in a responsible manner (see next page).
Our approach to doing business
Our long-term strategy is underpinned by our responsible approach to doing 
business, which is explained on pages 20 and 21.

Our vision and strategy
Each five-year investment 
period is designed to help us 
achieve our longer term vision 
Strategic delivery 
Our five-year plan for 2010–15 was 
focused on improving customer 
satisfaction, meeting our statutory 
obligations and delivering shareholder 
value. This plan was designed to build 
a platform to enable us to effectively 
deliver our long-term strategy.
A summary of our key achievements 
across 2010–15 is shown on pages 30 
and 31.
As we begin the next five-year period 
to 2020 we are looking to build on 
our recent achievements, retaining 
our focus on delivering high levels of 
service to customers at the lowest 
sustainable cost, all whilst acting 
responsibly. This is designed to help 
us achieve our vision of becoming a 
leading North West service provider 
and one of the best UK water and 
wastewater companies.  
Our focus on delivering for our 
customers includes striving to be 
a leading company in the areas our 
regulator benchmarks for the industry, 
such as on customer satisfaction 
(SIM). We also assess our performance 
against other leading organisations 
in the North West through an 
independent brand tracker survey.  
As detailed in the economic regulation 
section on page 29, the regulatory 
environment has evolved for the 2015–
20 period, and our key performance 
indicators are also evolving to 
reflect this.  With the move to a more 
outcomes based approach, the new 
outcome delivery incentives (ODIs) are 
key metrics to assess performance 
across a wide range of operational 
measures. In the now separated 
business retail price control, with the 
expansion of competition, measuring 
the impact of customer gains and 
losses is an important metric.
Metrics for assessing lowest 
sustainable costs include our 
outperformance against the new 
totex model (replacing separate opex 
and capex models for 2010–15) and 
financing levels set by Ofwat. With 
the retail household price control 
now being separated, we are also 
introducing a new KPI to measure our 
costs in this area.  
The degree to which our actions are 
viewed as responsible is taken from 
performance measures set by the 
industry regulator, the Environment 
Agency and those which measure 
global best practice, as defined by the 
Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 
Our KPI performance for 2010–15 is 
shown on pages 32 and 33 and further 
details on our 2015–20 KPIs are shown 
on pages 50 and 51.
In addition, executive bonuses and 
long-term incentives are intrinsically 
linked to our financial and operational 
performance and further details are 
provided on pages 84 to 103.
Our focus remains on  
delivering high levels of 
service to customers at 
the lowest sustainable 
cost, all whilst acting 
responsibly.

How we create value
Pictured: The £100 million Davyhulme sludge 
recycling centre treats the wastewater sludge 
from half the North West’s population, with 
the potential to generate up to 80GWh of 
electricity each year.
Today we benefit from the strategic 
decisions and work delivered by 
our predecessors over the last 150 
years to provide the North West with 
good quality water and to reduce 
the environmental impact of the 
wastewater we treat.
The work we do today will help to 
ensure customers of the North West 
continue to enjoy an effective, efficient 
service for many generations to come.
We create value for our stakeholders 
principally by agreeing and then 
delivering, or outperforming, our 
regulatory contract. The way we use 
our key resources and interact with our 
ever-evolving external environment, 
influenced by our long-term strategic 
approach, helps to achieve value 
creation. This also facilitates the 
delivery of our five customer outcomes 
alongside ensuring investors receive an 
appropriate return.

How we create value
External environment
Economic
Changes in the economy, such 
as inflation, interest rates, or 
unemployment levels, can influence 
our ability to create value. Whilst 
outside of our direct control, we 
can mitigate some of the potential 
adverse impact associated with 
market movements, such as on 
inflation and interest rates, through 
our hedging strategies.  More details 
about the economic environment are 
described on page 29. 
Technological
Advances in technology can be used 
to help deliver improvements in 
the quality or cost of our service.  
Embracing innovation, using modern 
technology or techniques, is at the 
heart of how we do business. For 
example, our Davyhulme sludge 
recycling centre which employed 
a ground-breaking configuration 
of thermal hydrolysis to maximise 
energy generation from sludge, won 
an Annual Institute of Chemical 
Engineers award for innovation in 
2013/14. We also have to be mindful 
of our customers’ ever increasing 
use of technology and we have been 
improving our website and using 
text messages and social media to 
expand communication options with 
customers. More information on how 
we are embracing innovation is shown 
within our 2014/15 performance on 
pages 34 to 45.
Political and regulatory
Over a long time frame the political 
and regulatory environment can 
change significantly. In the 26 
years since the water industry was 
privatised by the UK Government, we 
have seen substantial tightening of 
laws and regulations. Whilst to some 
extent, changes to the regulatory 
environment are outside of our 
direct control, maintaining a good 
reputation is important to enable 
positive participation in regulatory 
discussions. By positively engaging 
and using our industry knowledge, we 
can help influence future policy with 
the aim of achieving the best outcome 
for our customers, shareholders and 
other stakeholders. 
Social
We see some significant societal 
trends that we plan to address in 
our long-term strategy. The North 
West remains the most socially and 
economically deprived region in 
England and so we can anticipate 
continued hardship for a number of 
communities and difficulties for some 
customers in paying their bills. We 
will remain committed to supporting 
these customers through a suite of 
payment assistance schemes and 
looking at new ways to help, like 
the introduction of our social tariff 
in 2015. We anticipate an increase 
in the North West population of 
around 600,000 by 2040 (more than 
the population of a large city such 
as Liverpool). We are planning to 
ensure our services and supporting 
infrastructure meet the needs of this 
growing population,  which will include 
a higher proportion of older people.
Natural
Planning far into the future ensures 
that we are prepared for the changing 
natural environment, most notably 
the effects of climate change. We 
have a responsibility to return water 
to the environment safely and we 
are focused on reducing pollution 
incidents, caused by spills from our 
network. We can make an important 
contribution to protecting and 
enhancing the natural environment by 
using fewer natural resources and we 
are reducing our carbon footprint as 
well as increasing renewable energy 
production. More detail across each 
of these areas is provided within the 
‘Our natural environment’ section on 
page 25.

Key resources
People
Our employees play a critical role 
in increasing long-term value 
generation. Fundamental to the 
decisions we take and operational 
performance we deliver is a skilled, 
engaged and motivated team. 
We place a strong emphasis on 
providing comprehensive training 
and development opportunities. Our 
latest engagement score is reported 
in ‘Our performance 2014/15’ 
on page 38. Management has a 
range of incentives which focus on 
performance over a number of years, 
rather than just the current year, to 
encourage the delivery of benefits 
over the longer term.
Our suppliers and contractors 
provide us with essential services 
which we rely on to deliver our 
strategy. It is vital that we work 
closely with them, for example on 
large capital projects where the 
delivery of projects on time, to 
budget and with minimal customer 
impact has economic, societal and 
environmental benefits. Close 
collaboration is important to help 
support the delivery of these 
benefits and, for example, our 
suppliers contributed significantly 
towards our c£7 billion estimated 
contribution to the regional economy 
over the 2010–15 period. ‘Our 
responsible approach to doing 
business’ on pages 20 and 21 
outlines the standards we expect of 
our suppliers.  
Financing
We aim to maintain a robust and 
responsible capital structure, 
balancing both equity and debt to 
achieve a strong investment grade 
credit rating. Our proactive equity 
and credit investor programmes 
allow us to engage effectively 
with investors. Issuing new debt is 
particularly important as our capital 
investment is largely financed 
through a mix of debt and cash 
generated from our operations. We 
maintain access to a broad range of 
sources of finance in a number of 
markets across which best relative 
value is sought when issuing new 
debt. The European Investment 
Bank is our largest lender with c£1.9 
billion of debt and undrawn facilites.
Locking in long-term debt at good 
relative value can help keep our 
finance costs low and enables 
us potentially to outperform the 
industry-allowed cost of debt. 
Sustained low-cost finance across 
the industry benefits customer 
bills. The average life of our term 
debt is over 20 years. Our prudent 
financial risk management policies 
covering credit, liquidity, interest 
rate, inflation and currency risk 
help reduce the group’s exposure 
to the economic and regulatory 
environment.

How we create value
Assets
Our fixed assets (including all our 
reservoirs, treatment works and pipes) 
have a replacement cost of around £80 
billion which is the estimated amount it 
would cost for another company to build 
similar assets and networks. However, 
it is not the replacement cost of our 
assets upon which we are allowed to 
earn a return, through our revenues. We 
earn a return on our regulatory capital 
value (RCV), a regulatory measure of our 
capital base, which is currently just over 
£10 billion, so it is this asset value which 
is more important economically. 
Many of our assets are long-term in 
nature – for example, our impounding 
reservoirs have a useful economic 
life of around 200 years. By carefully 
reviewing our potential capital projects, 
considering the most efficient long-
term solutions, we can save future 
operating costs, also helping to reduce 
future customer bills. Embracing 
innovation in our asset configuration 
and work processes can help to make 
our future service better, faster or 
cheaper.
Since privatisation in 1989, total capital 
investment of over £14 billion has 
provided substantial benefits to our 
customers and our region’s environment 
as well as contributing to the North 
West economy through job creation, 
both within our company and in our 
supply chain. Disciplined investment, 
along with RPI inflation, also grows our 
RCV , increasing future revenues. 
We need to continue with a substantial 
investment programme for the 
foreseeable future in order to meet 
ever more stringent environmental 
standards and to maintain and improve 
the current standards of our assets and 
services. 
However, in deciding on our investment 
strategy, we have to be mindful of the 
impact on our customers’ bills, and this 
is why, for example, we are spreading 
some of the environmental spend 
required by European legislation over 
the next 15 years.
Natural resources
Whilst rainfall in the North West of 
England is greater than other parts 
of the country, and thus supply 
is not as constrained, it is still in 
everyone’s interest to make the most 
of this precious resource. We have 
encouraged customers to use water 
more efficiently and have increased 
the number of households fitted with 
meters. We also have a regulatory 
annual leakage target which we aim 
to meet each year.
We own over 55,000 hectares 
of land around our reservoirs. 
Through our sustainable catchment 
management programme (SCAMP), 
we can effectively manage these 
catchments to protect and enhance 
water quality and to provide other 
benefits such as an improved natural 
environment. Over the past five 
years we have invested £12 million 
through this programme. Our new 
Catchment Wise project is looking 
at working with others to improve 
the lakes, rivers and coastal waters 
where we return wastewater.
As well as water and our catchment 
land, another key resource is waste. 
Sludge from wastewater can be 
processed to generate renewable 
energy, helping to save power costs 
and protect the environment.  Our 
advanced digestion facility at 
Davyhulme is one of the largest 
works of its type in the world. We 
also recycle waste by supplying 
treated biosolids to agriculture, 
which provides a valuable resource 
to farmers.

Shorter term (up to five years)
Ofwat, our economic regulator, 
determines the prices we can charge 
our customers to provide them with 
water and wastewater services.
Ofwat sets our regulatory contract 
following the receipt of our five-year 
plan proposals (see the ‘Regulatory 
environment’ section on page 26 for 
further details). 
By submitting a robust, balanced 
plan, we can help ensure we receive 
a regulatory contract that allows 
for the best overall outcome for our 
customers, shareholders and the 
environment. 
Once each five-year regulatory 
contract is set, we create value 
principally by delivering or 
outperforming it by providing the 
best service to customers, at the 
lowest sustainable cost and in a 
responsible manner. Investing in 
our people to ensure a committed, 
capable and motivated workforce is 
a major contributor to delivering high 
performance. Some of the key ways 
we create value over this shorter time 
frame are by:
•	 improving customer service – which 
will improve efficiency, reduce costs 
and reduce potential penalties/
increase rewards from Ofwat, under 
its service incentive mechanism 
(SIM); 
•	 enhancing our debt collection 
activities – which will reduce our 
retail costs. Alongside this, we 
continue to provide comprehensive 
support for customers struggling 
to pay;
•	 raising low-cost finance – which 
helps us outperform the finance 
costs allowed in our regulatory 
contract;
•	 implementing our hedging 
strategies, such as fixing medium-
term interest rates and power 
costs, to reduce the volatility of 
these costs, helping us meet our 
regulatory contract;
•	 minimising total costs on a 
sustainable basis, such as on power, 
materials and property rates – which 
helps us meet or outperform totex 
costs allowed in our regulatory 
contract;
•	 delivering our operational and 
regulatory commitments – which 
helps ensure we achieve high 
levels of customer service and 
meet environmental standards.  
Our performance can also result 
in potential financial rewards or 
penalties such as those linked to our 
outcome delivery incentives (ODIs), 
which include reliably delivered 
high-quality water and reducing 
pollution and sewer flooding 
incidents;
•	 meeting our regulatory leakage 
target – which provides water 
resource and customer supply 
benefits and avoids any unfunded 
expenditure requirements from our 
regulators; and
•	 increasing our production of 
renewable energy from waste – 
which helps protect us from rising 
energy costs and reduces our 
carbon footprint.
Over the 2010–15 regulatory period, 
outperformance was generated 
mainly through efficiency savings on 
operating costs, capital expenditure 
and financing costs. Ofwat’s SIM 
assessment also rewarded companies 
who performed well on customer 
service, or penalised companies who 
performed badly, relative to other 
water companies. 
Our KPIs over this period, including 
for 2014/15, were reflective of these 
potential areas for outperformance, 
and how we performed is described 
within the ‘Our performance 2014/15’ 
section on pages 34 to 45. ‘Key 
achievements 2010-15’ on pages 30 
and 31 also outlines our progress over 
the last five years, particularly in the 
important area of customer service.
Ofwat has evolved the regulatory 
framework so that, over the 2015–20 
period, the way we can add value has 
changed. Operating costs and capital 
investment are no longer separately 
assessed as they are now combined 
into a new ‘totex’ methodology. There 
will be additional rewards or penalties 
based on performance as measured 
through a range of ODIs. Ofwat is 
continuing with its SIM assessment 
for household customers with a similar 
incentive and penalty framework. 
Companies are still incentivised to 
outperform in the area of financing 
costs. The progressive opening up 
of the retail market for business 
customers will also encourage 
companies to improve service. We will 
continue to improve our service to help 
us win more out of area customers 
and, importantly, to retain our existing 
customers.
Our KPIs for 2015–20 have evolved to 
reflect the changes in the regulatory 
framework and further details of these 
are shown on pages 50 and 51.

Our responsible approach 
to doing business
We are committed to delivering our services in a responsible way and our 
approach to responsible business practice is outlined in our Business Principles 
document available on our website at corporate.unitedutilities.com/united-
utilities-business-principles. Some of the key components of our approach are 
set out in more detail below:
Customers: Our aim is to protect public 
health and provide excellent services 
to our customers. This means removing 
the need for customers to contact us 
unnecessarily, to taking ownership of 
queries and satisfactorily resolving 
them as quickly as possible, while 
keeping our customers informed along 
the way. We aim to provide bills that 
represent good value for money.
Environment: Whether it’s treating

Delivering good value: We are 
committed to honouring our 
responsibility to our shareholders, 
credit investors and those who provide 
us with goods and services. How we 
create value for our stakeholders is set 
out on pages 14 to 19. We work with 
suppliers whose business principles, 
conduct, and standards align with our 
own. Our key suppliers have committed 
to our Sustainable Supply Chain Charter, 
supporting us in the delivery of wider 
social, economic and environmental 
benefits.
Running our business with integrity
We have procedures and policies in 
place to ensure we act in accordance 
with the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
Given the long life of our infrastructure, 
we take a long-term view of our 
operations and key to the group’s 
strategic objectives is the goal to 
operate in a more sustainable manner. 
Sustainability is fundamental to the 
manner in which we undertake our 
business and the group has, for many 
years, included corporate responsibility 
(CR) factors as a strategic consideration 
in its decision making. Our board-
level CR committee (see pages 82 
and 83) develops and oversees our 
CR strategy and this continuing focus 
helped the group retain our Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index ‘World Class’ rating. 
Business Insight
What our customers  
think of us
This gives us great insight into how to 
make improvements in our customer 
service, whether it’s how we deal with 
water supply problems, bill payments 
or other enquiries. According to 
those surveyed across 2014/15, 
the majority of customers rated our 
service in the highest category of 
‘very satisfied’ . This is supported by 
the improvements we have seen in 
customer satisfaction over recent 
years, as evidenced by Ofwat’s SIM 
assessment – see ‘Key achievements 
2010–15’ on pages 30 and 31. 
However, a minority of customers 
suggested we could have done better 
and we are listening carefully to their 
feedback as we strive for continuous 
improvement. Another valuable 
source of information is provided 
through our programme of proactively 
texting around 1,000 customers a 
day who have recently contacted us 
by mobile phone, inviting them to rate 
our service and provide any feedback.  
Our WOW Awards scheme gives 
customers a forum to say ‘thank you’ 
to any individual employee who has 
provided excellent customer service. 
The forum allows the customers to 
suggest ways in which we can improve 
our overall customer experience. 
Some of the comments have been 
truly inspiring and demonstrate the 
dedication and commitment of our 
staff.
T o assess customers’ perceptions 
of United Utilities and how they 
compare to nine other major service 
providers in our region, every quarter 
we commission an independent  
agency to contact over 1,000 
household and business customers. 
Throughout the quarterly surveys 
we have consistently ranked 3rd out 
of 10 overall for customer service, 
behind only John Lewis and Marks 
& Spencer but ahead of seven 
other major organisations covering 
sectors including utilities, telecoms, 
media and banking services. Across 
2014/15, we ranked particularly 
highly on the attributes of being 
‘Socially responsible’ (2nd out of 10) 
as well as being ‘T rustworthy’ (3rd out 
of 10) and having a ‘Good reputation’ 
(3rd out of 10).  Our lowest ranking 
was on ‘Innovation’ (5th out of 10) 
although this is an area of renewed 
focus for us and customer perceptions 
on this attribute have been gradually 
improving over the last few years.

Our operating environment
Additionally, there are licensed 
companies which provide water-only 
services and tend to be smaller in size. 
As each company in the water sector 
operates as a regional monopoly 
for its services, they are subject to 
regulation in terms of both price and 
performance.
The privatisation of the industry over 
two decades ago has been widely 
perceived as a success, making a 
significant contribution to public 
health. It has led to improvements 
in the quality of services provided 
to customers, higher environmental 
standards and superior quality drinking 
water at lower estimated costs to 
customers than if the water sector 
was still owned by the UK Government. 
The water industry currently 
invests around £80 million a week in 
maintaining and improving assets and 
services.
Pictured: We celebrated 100 years of sewage 
treatment at Davyhulme this year. The ‘activated 
sludge’ process began life at our own Davyhulme 
treatment works back in 1914 and harnessed 
the power of micro-organisms which meant that 
waste from millions of people could be treated 
in a relatively small space.

Our industry and market
Every day, over 50 million household and business consumers in England and

Our customers
United Utilities Water holds licences to 
provide water and wastewater services 
to a population of approximately 
seven million people in the North West 
of England. We provide services to 
approximately three million households 
in our region and this generates around 
two-thirds of our total revenues. We 
also serve approximately 200,000 
businesses, ranging in size from large 
manufacturing companies to small 
shops. Our focus over recent years 
has been on improving customer 
satisfaction.
For our business customers we have 
been extending the range of value-
added services we offer, including 
our on-site engineering solutions and 
water efficiency advice. By offering 
value for money, as well as the 
increased range of services, we have 
been winning customers out of area. 
More details on how we are winning 
customers in the Scottish market, 
which offers attractive margins, can be 
seen on page 28.
Our households pay just over £1 per 
day on average for the combined water 
and wastewater services we provide. 
Our price determination for 2015–20 
means customers will benefit from 
below inflation increases to average 
household bills for the decade to 2020. 
Our objective is to continue to provide 
our customers with high quality 
drinking water to meet all their daily 
needs and environmentally responsible 
wastewater collection and treatment 
at a price that represents good value 
for money.
We are continuing to invest heavily for 
our customers. During the five-year 
period to 2015, we delivered a capital 
investment programme of around £3.8 
billion as we continued to improve our 
asset base, delivering further benefits 
for customers. Capital investment will 
continue at high levels in the 2015–20 
period and is expected to remain high 
beyond 2020 as we continue to:
•	 upgrade our region’s water and 
wastewater networks; 
•	 maintain our ageing assets;
•	 deliver a cleaner environment;
•	 provide high quality water to our 
customers; and
•	 improve our customers’ experience.
We have a strong focus on effective 
delivery of our capital programme, a 
key driver of value, for customers, the 
environment and shareholders.

Our natural environment
We plan far into the future to ensure 
we are prepared for the changing 
natural environment, most notably the 
effects of climate change. With severe 
dry periods becoming increasingly 
common, we must ensure we continue 
to have resilient water resources and 
an infrastructure capable of moving 
water efficiently around the region.  
The potential effect of climate change 
on our future water resources is 
included in our 25-year Water Resource 
Management Plan. We must seek to 
tackle flooding incidents caused by 
the intensive bursts of rainfall, which 
are becoming more frequent due 
to changing weather patterns, and 
ensure we are able to meet increased 
demand on our sewerage network as 
the regional population is expected to 
increase. A phased, long-term approach 
ensures that the necessary work can be 
delivered whilst not placing too much 
pressure on customer bills.
We have a responsibility to return water 
to the environment safely. Spills from 
our network can lead to pollution which 
can damage the natural environment 
and could lead to loss of reputation 
and financial penalties, depending on 
their severity. Our number of serious 
pollution incidents has decreased over 
recent years and it is an important area 
of focus within our 25-year Strategic 
Direction Statement. The Environment 
Agency assesses water companies’ 
performance across a basket of 
measures including pollution and its 
overall assessment is included as one 
of our KPIs (see page 33) with all of the 
pollution sub-measures also reported 
within our Corporate Responsibility 
pages on our website.
We can make an important contribution 
to protecting and enhancing the natural 
environment by using fewer natural 
resources. We have been driving 
down our carbon footprint over the 
last decade and have plans to halve 
emissions by 2035, from a 2005/06 
starting position. Our greenhouse gas 
disclosures can be found on pages 
104 and 105. Less than 10 per cent 
of our waste goes to landfill and our 
use of recycled products is increasing. 
We are increasing our renewal energy 
production with plans to further 
increase this over the longer term, 
including wind and solar opportunities. 
This will provide environmental benefits 
and add value to shareholders through 
energy cost savings.

Our operating environment
Our regulatory environment
Economic regulation
The water industry currently operates 
within five-year planning cycles known 
as Asset Management Plan (AMP) 
periods. Prior to the start of each 
five-year period, companies submit 
their business plans which include 
their projected expenditure in order 
to enhance and maintain their assets. 
Following review of these plans, Ofwat 
sets the prices each company can 
charge their customers across the 
period. We have just finished the  
2010–15 (AMP5) period and price 
controls for the 2015–20 (AMP6) 
period were set in December 2014, 
when Ofwat published their final 
determinations. 
Ofwat assesses companies’ 
operational performance across a wide 
range of measures, including some 
of our key performance indicators 
(KPIs) such as service incentive 
mechanism (SIM), leakage and, 
from April 2015, outcome delivery 
incentives (ODIs). Where performance 
falls short of expectations, Ofwat can 
take measures, such as enforcement 
actions or penalties, in order to protect 
customers’ interests. Operational 
performance and customer service 
remain high priorities for us, as they 
are key contributors in our drive to 
create value, as explained in more 
detail on pages 14 to 19 in the ‘How we 
create value’ section.
Ofwat review 2015–20
Ofwat introduced a number of 
important changes for the 2015–20 
(AMP6) price review, with the aim of 
evolving the sector in order to meet 
future challenges and placing greater 
focus on customers’ needs. 
Moving away from one single price 
control, there are now four separate 
price controls:
•	 wholesale water, covering the 
physical supply of water;
•	 wholesale wastewater, covering 
the removal and treatment of 
wastewater;
•	 household retail, covering customer-
facing activities (principally 
customer contact, billing, meter 
reading and cash collection) for 
household customers; and
•	 non-household retail, covering 
customer-facing activities for 
business customers.
Separate retail price controls should 
provide retail businesses with greater 
incentives and focus on delivering 
more efficient service to business 
customers as competition expands, 
and also to household customers under 
a new average cost to serve approach. 
This new retail household model allows 
each water company only to charge 
its customers an amount based on 
the average costs of the industry 
plus any allowed company-specific 
adjustments, such as our £20 million 
per annum special allowance to reflect 
the very high levels of deprivation 
in the North West (see ‘Economic 
environment’ on page 29). 
The way companies’ operating and 
capital costs are assessed has been 
modified to encourage companies to 
utilise the most efficient, sustainable 
solutions under a new ‘totex’ model. 
There is also a move to a more 
outcomes-based approach, with 
greater emphasis being placed on 
customer engagement to agree the 
outcomes. 
Ofwat (The Water Services 
Regulation Authority) is the 
economic regulator of the water 
and sewerage sectors in England 
and Wales, responsible for 
ensuring the companies provide 
customers with a good-quality, 
efficient service at a fair price.

Environmental and quality regulation
The water and wastewater industry in the UK is subject to substantial domestic 
and European Union regulation, placing significant statutory obligations on water 
and wastewater companies with regard to, among other factors, the quality of 
drinking water supplied, wastewater treatment and the effects of their activities 
on the natural environment. 
We aim to maintain and enhance wide-ranging relationships with key people 
within all of these regulatory bodies to help shape balanced investment 
programmes which address the needs of all of our stakeholders and contribute to 
our ability to create value.
Regulatory risks
Given the complex legal and regulatory environment within which we operate, there 
is a range of risks to which we are exposed. Risks can be in the form of possible 
non-compliance with existing laws or regulations or failure to meet the terms of 
our current 2015–20 regulatory contract. We also face risks in relation to potential 
future changes in legislation or regulation. See pages 52 to 55 for more details in 
respect of these risks.
Impact of environmental legislation 
European Union environmental 
legislation will require us and 
other UK water companies to incur 
additional capital investment to 
ensure compliance with more stringent 
standards. We do, however, recognise 
that in our region we cannot achieve 
this alone and we are partnering with 
others who also have a role to play, 
such as the Environment Agency, local 
authorities and other interest groups 
such as the North West Rivers Trusts.
The revised Bathing Water Directive, 
effective from 2015, sets higher 
standards for bathing waters. Under 
the previous standards North West 
beaches achieved over 90 per cent 
bathing water compliance. The new 
standards are likely to prove very 
challenging to meet. As one of many 
contributors to bathing water and 
shellfish quality we have planned 
investment of over £200 million across 
2015–20 to achieve our ‘Contribution 
to Bathing Waters Improved’ 
performance commitment to help 
ensure compliance with the higher 
standards. We will work in partnership 
with other organisations to ensure 
investment is as efficient as possible.
The Water Framework Directive sets 
an objective that European member 
states should achieve ‘good’ status 
for all surface water beyond 2027. 
Considerable capital investment is 
required to meet this, which we are 
spreading over 12 years, balancing the 
needs of current and future customers. 
Our 2015-20 plan includes around 
£400 million of investment to achieve 
our ‘Contribution to Rivers Improved’ 
performance commitment, which 
includes schemes relating to a number 
of environmental drivers within the 
Water Framework Directive as well as 
other environmental legislation.
The Habitats Directive requires 
member states to maintain biodiversity 
by protecting natural habitats and 
certain wild species. For example, 
one of the key drivers for our planned 
Thirlmere pipeline project is to help 
protect England’s largest species of 
freshwater mussels in West Cumbria.  
See our business insight on page 47.
Defra is the UK Government department responsible for 
water policy and regulations in England and Wales; it also sets 
drinking water quality and environmental standards (many 
based on European law) which water companies must meet. 
www.gov.uk/defra
The Environment Agency controls how much water can 
be drawn from the environment and the quality of water 
returned to rivers and the sea. The EA produces an 
assessment of water and wastewater companies’ annual 
performance, and we include this as one of our KPIs, 
see page 33. www.gov.uk/government/organisations/

The Drinking Water Inspectorate is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with the drinking water quality regulations.

Our operating environment
Our competitive environment
Comparative competition
Our main competitors to benchmark 
our performance against are the other 
nine water and wastewater companies 
(WaSCs) across England and Wales. We 
are the second largest WaSC based on 
the size of our asset base, as measured 
by Regulatory Capital Value (RCV). We, 
along with these other nine companies, 
comprise the vast majority of the 
total water and wastewater sector, as 
depicted on the pie chart on the right.
Although their relative sizes are 
generally far smaller than the water 
and wastewater companies, the 
remaining water-only companies are 
important competitors as their relative 
performances are also included 
in Ofwat’s published comparative 
information. 
We have a strong drive on improving 
both absolute and relative performance 
as we aim to deliver good service to our 
customers, thereby helping to build a 
platform for us to create value.
Away from the water sector, in line with 
our vision to be a leading North West 
service provider, we also benchmark 
our customer service performance 
against other leading service providers 
in our region. In addition, as a publicly 
listed FTSE 100 company, the other 
UK and worldwide listed utilities are 
competitors from an investment 
perspective.
Direct competition
Currently only very large business 
customers are allowed to choose 
their water supplier. Under this 
arrangement, the new water supplier 
would buy water directly from the 
regional water company and be allowed 
to use its network for this water 
supply. Although very few users have 
switched supplier in England, the 2014 
Water Act aims to open up future retail 
competition to all business customers, 
including sewerage as well as water 
services from 2017.
We have been building our capability 
to ensure we are in a strong position 
as the competitive business retail 
market evolves and are very active in 
this expanding market.  After attaining 
a Scottish water supply licence in 
2012, we quickly grew and are one 
of the most successful new entrants 
in Scotland.  We have continued our 
expansion in 2014/15 and have now 
won over 200 customers, covering over 
2,800 sites and representing future 
annual revenue of c£15 million. We 
remain a leading new entrant, although 
our selective bidding for business at 
attractive margins means we are not 
solely focusing on growing market 
share. We also continue to offer and 
develop our range of value-added 
services, such as leak detection and 
repair, waste digestion and wastewater 
system optimisation.
The Water Act also paves the way for 
the future introduction of competition 
for certain parts of the wholesale, 
or upstream, business (for example 
the input of raw or treated water into 
a water company’s network or the 
removal of wastewater for treatment), 
although any such reforms are not 
expected until 2020 at the earliest. 
We are fully engaged with regards to 
market reform, being always mindful of 
the potential impact on our customers 
and the value implications for our 
shareholders.

Our economic environment
Although many economic factors are 
outside of the direct control of the 
group, we do, where appropriate, aim 
to manage the associated risks and 
opportunities, for the benefit of our 
customers and shareholders.
Whilst the North West unemployment 
rate has followed the national trend 
downwards, at 5.7 per cent for the 
quarter ending March 2015, it remains 
above the UK average of 5.5 per cent. 
A report, ‘Department for Communities 
and Local Government, Indices of 
Deprivation 2010’ , published in March 
2011, highlighted that the North West 
had more of the most deprived areas 
in England than any other region. Even 
as the North West economy recovers it 
is unlikely to have a significant impact 
on deprivation, which is the principal 
driver of our higher than average costs 
to serve our household customers. 
This is currently recognised by Ofwat 
through a special allowance for 
deprivation of £20 million per annum 
over the 2015–20 period.  
Bad debts remain a risk to which 
we are exposed, particularly with 
the continuing tightening of real 
disposable incomes and the impact 
of recent welfare reforms likely to 
intensify. Whilst our debt management 
processes have been externally 
benchmarked as efficient and 
effective, we will continue to refine 
and enhance them whilst also helping 
customers back into making regular 
payment through use of manageable 
payment plans.
Interest rates have remained below 
the long-term trend and we have 
benefited from this as we have made 
further drawdowns on our £500 million 
loan signed in 2013/14 and £100 
million of new debt raised in 2014/15. 
Comparatively low interest rates have 
also been beneficial to our future 
cost of debt as we continue with our 
interest rate hedging strategy. 
RPI inflation has declined recently, 
impacted by the significant fall in oil 
prices over the winter, and was 0.9 
per cent at March 2015. The prices we 
charge our customers (and therefore 
revenues), as well as our asset base, 
are linked to RPI inflation, so lower 
RPI will mean slightly lower growth 
on these measures. However, we also 
have a large quantity of index-linked 
debt which means our finance costs 
decrease as inflation falls, providing 
a partial economic offset to revenue 
(although this is not a perfect hedge 
as changes to revenue and index-
linked finance costs are based on 
differing lagged measures of inflation). 
Our pension liabilities are linked to 
inflation, which provides an additional 
economic offset against our asset 
base. Overall, we are currently more 
inflation-hedged than the other listed 
water and wastewater companies 
so we are better protected in a low 
inflation environment.
United Utilities’ total contribution to 
the regional economy over 2010–15 
was estimated at £7 billion. Direct 
economic contributions from our 
activities include the purchase of 
goods and services and providing 
extensive employment. There is also 
an indirect economic contribution, for 
example when our suppliers, in turn, 
make purchases from their suppliers 
and when people whose jobs are 
supported by United Utilities spend 
their personal incomes.

Key achievements 2010–15
75%
Reduction in customer complaints 
over the 2010-15 period.
Our focus on improving customer 
service 
Great customer service relies on 
understanding what our customers 
need, anticipating problems, resolving 
complaints quickly and courteously and 
developing new, innovative services 
that fit into people’s busy lifestyles. 
We want our customers to trust us and 
have confidence in our service.
Over the last five years, we have 
continued to develop our systems and 
processes to deliver the experience 
our customers seek when they need 
to contact us, including multi-channel 
contact centre technology. We have 
placed a strong emphasis on striving 
for first time resolution of customer 
enquiries, keeping customers informed 
of progress until resolution. This has 
been underpinned by investment in our 
people in terms of better training and 
improved systems. We have enhanced 
our customer feedback process to 
help us respond to customers’ evolving 
needs and continuously improve.
The introduction of the service 
incentive mechanism (SIM) as a 
measure of customer satisfaction over 
this regulatory period has provided 
us with a strong benchmark of water 
industry comparative performance. 
SIM results sit alongside our other, 
ongoing, research on customer 
expectations and satisfaction.

Key achievements to date include:
•	 We were the most improved water 
and wastewater company as 
measured under Ofwat’s three-year 
SIM assessment from 2011/12 to 
2013/14 (the chart on the previous 
page shows how we have moved 
from just above the worst performer 
to just below the best performer). 
As well as benefiting customers, this 
improved performance also resulted 
in us avoiding a revenue penalty of 
up to c£80 million in Ofwat’s final  
determination;
•	 Customer complaints reduced by 
approximately 75 per cent over the 
2010-15 period;
•	 Complaints warranting investigation 
by the Consumer Council for Water 
(CCW) reduced from 63 in 2010/11 
to zero in 2012/13 and 2013/14 
and two in 2014/15;
•	 We are consistently third behind 
only John Lewis and Marks & 
Spencer on the customer service 
brand tracker measure out of 10 
leading service providers in the 
North West;
•	 Awarded ‘Best Utility’ in the Top 
50 Contact Centre Awards and 
received the  ‘Service to the Water 
Industry’ award presented by the 
House Builders Federation; and
•	 We are one of the leading water 
retailers in Scotland despite only 
entering the market in 2012/13.
Other operational improvements
We have been working hard to improve 
our performance in achieving statutory 
compliance and on-time delivery of 
schemes contributing to water quality 
and environmental improvement. 
Highlights include:
•	 Delivered stable asset serviceability 
performance or better on all four 
water and wastewater measures for 
2013/14 and 2014/15, avoiding a 
potential serviceability penalty of 
tens of millions of pounds;
•	 Upper quartile sector performance 
on Ofwat’s annual key performance 
indicators and on the Environment 
Agency’s assessment of water and 
wastewater companies 2013/14;
•	 Met or outperformed annual 
leakage targets in each of the last 
nine years;
•	 Efficiency improvements in 
delivering our capital programme 
allowed us to reinvest over 
£200 million of savings into 
projects which improve services 
to customers or benefit the 
environment; and
•	 Sustainable operating cost 
efficiencies have helped us to 
exceed our outperformance  target 
of £50 million over 2010–15 against 
our allowed operating costs. This 
was in addition to efficiency targets 
set by Ofwat of approximately £150 
million over the five years.
Financing outperformance
Our treasury function has continued 
to deliver a good performance, raising 
debt at better rates than allowed by 
the regulator, and we exceeded our 
financing outperformance target of 
£300 million across the 2010–15 
period.
Overall, we are pleased with the 
significant progress we have made over 
the last five years, although we know 
that we still have plenty more to do.
Shareholder returns
Over the 2010-15 period, we have 
delivered  a strong total shareholder 
return (TSR) of 115 per cent, 
outperforming the market. A longer 
term view of our TSR relative to the 
FTSE 100 is shown on page 100.
Efficiency improvements 
in delivering our capital 
programme allowed 
us to reinvest over

Our key performance indicators (KPIs)  
2010–15
We focus on a range of financial and operational KPIs to help assess our performance. We believe that the KPIs defined 
below provide a rounded view as to how we are performing against our primary objectives, helping us on our path to 
reaching our long-term strategic vision. These KPIs encompass the important areas of customer service and environmental 
performance, as well as financial indicators, taking into consideration the interests of all of our stakeholders.
Financial KPIs
In respect of our financial KPIs, we use underlying profit measures as these enable more meaningful comparisons of the 
year-on-year performance of our business.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
We aim to deliver long-term 
shareholder value by providing:
•	 the best service to customers;
•	 at the lowest sustainable cost; and
•	 in a responsible manner.
Throughout the 2010–15 period, 
we demonstrated a strong link 
between performance and employee 
remuneration and we intend to 
continue with this approach across the 
new regulatory period.
Best service to customers
Improving customer service will 
continue to be a significant area 
of management focus and we see 
opportunities to deliver further 
benefits for our customers.
Customer service – our continuing 
strong focus on dealing effectively 
with customer enquiries has helped us 
deliver further improvements in our 
performance, as measured by Ofwat’s 
service incentive mechanism (SIM) and 
outlined in the KPIs section (see panel).  
This is also reflected in a reduction in 
the number of customer complaints 
received, which has contributed to 
improvements in opex efficiency. The 
overall number of customer complaints 
has reduced by approximately 75 per 
cent across the 2010–15 period.    
Our significant improvements over 
the regulatory period were recognised 
by Ofwat in the final determination 
in December 2014, resulting in the 
company avoiding a revenue penalty.  
Over this period, we have continued to 
develop our systems and processes to 
deliver the experience our customers 
seek when they need to contact us, 
including multi-channel contact centre 
technology. We have placed a strong 
emphasis on striving for first time 
resolution of customer enquiries, 
keeping customers informed of 
progress until resolution. This has been 
underpinned by investment in our people 
in terms of better training and improved 
systems. We have also enhanced our 
customer feedback process to help us 
respond to customers’ evolving needs 
and continually improve.
Leading North West service provider 
– we are pleased to have been 
consistently ranked third out of 10 
leading organisations in the North 
West, through an independent brand 
tracker survey which is undertaken 
quarterly. This covers key attributes 
such as ‘reputation’ , ‘trustworthy’ and 
‘customer service’ . We are behind only 
Marks & Spencer and John Lewis, 
and ahead of seven other major 
organisations covering utilities, 
telecoms, media and banking services.  
Robust water supply – our customers 
continue to benefit from our robust 
water supply and demand balance, 
along with high levels of water supply 
reliability. We continue to supply a high 
level of water quality, with mean zonal 
compliance in excess of 99.9 per cent.  
Mitigating sewer flooding – we have 
continued to invest heavily in schemes 
designed to mitigate the risk of flooding 
of our customers’ homes, including 
incidence-based targeting on areas 
more likely to experience flooding and 
defect identification through CCTV 
sewer surveys. Our plan for the 2015–20 
period includes a target of reducing 
sewer flooding incidents by over 40 per 
cent, in line with customers’ affordability 
preferences. Our wastewater network 
will continue to benefit from significant 
investment going forward as we adapt 
to weather patterns likely to result from 
climate change.
Asset serviceability – we have a 
range of actions to help support the 
serviceability of our assets. We are 
improving the robustness of our water 
treatment processes, refurbishing 
service reservoir assets, continuing 
with our comprehensive mains cleaning 
programme and optimising water 
treatment to reduce discoloured water 
events. Our good asset serviceability 
performance over the last few years 
was recognised by Ofwat in the final 
determination, in December 2014, with 
United Utilities not receiving any penalty.   
Ofwat KPIs – our overall good 
operational performance is reflected 
in Ofwat’s latest (2013/14) key 
performance indicators report. 
The balance of ratings for United 
Utilities across the 15 assessment 
measures represented an upper 
quartile performance, in respect of 
the 10 water and sewerage companies. 
Our performance in 2014/15 has 
improved further, although the industry 
comparatives are not available until 
later in the year.
Key performance indicators:
Serviceability – long-term 
stewardship of assets is critical 
and Ofwat measures this through 
its serviceability assessment 
(Ofwat defines serviceability 
as the capability of a system of 
assets to deliver a reference level 
of service to customers and to 
the environment now and in the 
future). We are currently assessed 
as ‘improving’ for our water 
infrastructure and wastewater 
non-infrastructure assets 
and ‘stable’ for our water non-
infrastructure and wastewater 
infrastructure assets. The aim is to 
continue to hold at least a ‘stable’ 
rating for all four asset classes, 
which aligns with Ofwat’s target.
Service incentive mechanism 
(SIM) – United Utilities continued 
its progress on Ofwat’s combined 
(qualitative and quantitative) SIM 
assessment for 2013/14 (latest 
available), moving up to 9th place 
out of the 18 water companies.  
This compares with joint 13th 
position for 2012/13 (although 
Ofwat previously measured out 
of 21 water companies). At the 
start of this regulatory period, 
United Utilities was an outlier 
in last position. Our continued 
progress is encouraging, although 
we recognise that there is still 
more to do. Ofwat is amending its 
SIM methodology for the 2015–20 
period, based on domestic retail 
only and with more emphasis on 
qualitative performance, and 
Ofwat and the water companies 
have been piloting the new 
process. This revised methodology 
is based on a different data 
set and quarterly results may 
well produce wider fluctuations 
compared with the last regulatory 
period.

Our performance 2014/15
Lowest sustainable cost
Power and chemicals – our asset 
optimisation programme continues to 
provide the benefits of increased and 
more effective use of operational site 
management to optimise power and 
chemical use and the development of 
more combined heat and power assets 
to generate renewable energy. We have 
already substantially locked in our 
power commodity costs across 2015–
20, providing greater cost certainty for 
the regulatory period.
Proactive network management – we 
are implementing a more proactive 
approach to asset and network 
management, with the aim of improving 
our modelling and forecasting to enable 
us to address more asset and network 
problems before they affect customers, 
thereby reducing the level of reactive 
work and improving efficiency.
Debt collection – we highlighted in May 
2014 that debt collection was likely to 
become more challenging for United 
Utilities, particularly as our region suffers 
from high levels of income deprivation. 
Notwithstanding our industry-leading 
debt management processes and wide-
ranging schemes to help customers 
struggling to pay, including our trust fund, 
deprivation remains the principal driver of 
our higher than average bad debt and cost 
to serve.  In 2014/15, bad debt expense 
has increased by £16 million, from 2.2 per 
cent to 3.1 per cent of regulated revenue, 
as a result of four main factors:
•	 the cumulative impact of economic 
factors on customers’ ability to pay;
•	 under IFRS accounting, an increase 
in the number of customers re-
commencing payment through our 
help-to-pay initiatives has resulted 
in additional revenue recognition 
and associated bad debt; 
•	 a review of bad debt provisions for 
business customers in preparation 
for systems upgrades, ahead of full 
market opening; and
•	 a review of operational debt 
processes and bad debt provisions 
in domestic retail in preparation for 
the 2015–20 period.
Although bad debts will continue to be 
challenging for us, we do expect the level 
to fall to around 2.5 per cent of regulated 
revenue in 2015/16 as our recent 
reviews have resulted in an additional 
current year charge which is not 
expected to continue at the same level. 
Pensions – United Utilities placed 
its pension provision on a more 
sustainable footing in 2010 and has 
subsequently taken additional steps 
to de-risk the pension scheme further. 
Further details on the group’s pension 
provision are provided in the pensions 
section on page 43.
Capital delivery and regulatory 
commitments – the business is strongly 
focused on delivering its commitments 
efficiently and on time and has a robust 
commercial capital delivery framework 
in place. Regulatory capital investment 
in the year, including £148 million of 
infrastructure renewals expenditure 
and £30 million of transitional spend, 
was £869 million, an increase of £33 
million compared with 2013/14. 
Following our rapid increase in our 
internal Time: Cost: Quality index 
(TCQi) score from around 50 per cent in 
2010/11 to approximately 90 per cent 
in 2012/13, we further improved our 
score and have achieved over 95 per 
cent in both 2013/14 and 2014/15.   
As we strive to improve efficiency 
further, we have implemented new 
contracting arrangements for the 
2015–20 regulatory period to help 
deliver our regulatory capital investment 
programme of over £3.5 billion. We 
have re-tendered our engineering and 
construction partners and selected a 
single engineering partner and four new 
design and construction partners. We 
are involving our partners much earlier in 
project definition and packaging projects 
by type, geography and timing to deliver 
efficiencies. Projects will be allocated 
to partners on an incentive basis or 
competed between the partners and, 
where appropriate, third parties. Early 
results are encouraging. Our partners 
have come forward with a range of 
solutions, innovations and pricing which 
is building our confidence that the final 
determination targets we have accepted 
are tough but within reach.

part in a trial of a new custom-built phone 
application, which aims to makes us an industry 
leader in how we manage our assets.
Key performance indicators:
Financing outperformance – 
United Utilities set a financing 
outperformance target, across 
the 2010–15 period, of at least 
£300 million, based on an average 
RPI inflation rate of 2.5 per cent 
per annum, and we have exceeded 
this target. We have reinvested 
over £30 million of our financing 
outperformance in private sewers 
costs, which were not reflected in 
2010–15 price limits.
Operating expenditure 
outperformance – the business 
targeted total operating 
expenditure outperformance over 
the 2010–15 period of at least 
£50 million, or approximately 
2 per cent, compared with the 
regulatory allowance. This was 
in addition to the base operating 
expenditure efficiency targets set 
by Ofwat, which equated to a total 
of approximately £150 million 
over the five years. We are pleased 
to report that we have exceeded 
our outperformance target.
Capital expenditure 
outperformance – United 
Utilities has delivered significant 
efficiencies in the area of 
capital expenditure and we 
have reinvested over £200 
million of capital expenditure 
outperformance for the benefit 
of our customers and the 
environment.

Business Insight
Energy: increasing       
self-generation
Using less: through a series of 
operational projects and behavioural 
programmes we are targeting energy 
efficiency savings across our water 
and wastewater sites over the next 
five years.
Generating more: we have secured 
planning approvals for two 500kW 
wind generation facilities at two of 
our sites and expect these turbines 
to be generating power in 2015. We 
have a number of potential schemes 
at the early stages of development 
with two schemes currently in the 
planning process. 
Last year we installed 2 megawatts 
of solar panels across four sites. This 
included our Fleetwood treatment 
works, (pictured below), which, with 
5,281 panels, is now one of the 
biggest solar panel installations in 
the North West.
We have a further 8 megawatts of 
solar under construction and plan to 
add a further 20 megawatts of solar 
this year.
Including our sludge to energy 
programmes, we have increased 
energy production from our facilities 
by around a third over the last two 
years and are targeting to increase 
energy self- generation to around 35 
per cent by 2020, contingent on good 
projected returns. Using our own 
energy has helped us avoid energy 
purchase costs of around £13 million 
in 2014/15.
Using smarter: we were the first 
water company to sign up to 
National Grid’s Dynamic Frequency 
Response scheme under which we 
reduce our electricity consumption 
when demand on the network is 
greater than supply or conversely 
to consume energy when supply 
exceeds demand. These schemes 
offer incentives linked to response 
times and availability of service.  
To supplement the electricity we generate from sludge and hydro, we 
have created an energy business to exploit other opportunities using the 
company’s land, assets and skills. This business has three key aims: to use 
less electricity, generate more, and use our assets smarter. This should 
help to save energy costs, which is one of our biggest expenses at around 
£65 million a year, and generate revenue from renewable incentives, which 
currently stands at around £5 million per year.
Responsible manner
Acting responsibly is fundamental 
to the manner in which we undertake 
our business and the group has 
for many years included corporate 
responsibility factors in its strategic 
decision making. Our environmental 
and sustainability performance across 
a broad front has received external 
recognition. United Utilities retained 
its ‘World Class’ rating in the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index for the 
seventh consecutive year, achieving 
industry leading performance status 
in the multi-utility/water sector in the 
most recent assessment. Retaining 
‘World Class’ status for this length 
of time is a significant achievement, 
particularly as the assessment 
standards continue to increase and 
evolve. United Utilities also holds 
membership of the FTSE 350 Carbon 
Disclosure Project Leadership Index.  
We are the only UK water company to 
hold both accolades.  
Leakage – our strong, year round, 
operational focus on leakage and 
the implementation of a range of 
initiatives, such as active pressure 
management, enabled us to again beat 
our leakage target in 2014/15. Our 
leakage performance, alongside the 
network resilience improvements we 
are making, are helping us to maintain 
a robust water supply and demand 
balance, and deliver high levels of 
reliability for our customers.
Environmental performance – this is 
a high priority for United Utilities and 
we are pleased to be an upper quartile 
company in the Environment Agency’s 
latest available performance metrics 
(2013/14), as described in the KPIs 
section on page 38. 
Carbon footprint – we are committed 
to reducing our carbon footprint 
and increasing our generation of 
renewable energy. In 2014/15, our 
carbon footprint totalled 473,708 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.  
We set a target of achieving a 21 per 
cent reduction in carbon emissions 
by 2015, measured from a 2005/06 
baseline. We have achieved significant 
reductions and were pleased to meet 
this target in 2013/14. However, we

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 22027.04      4 June 2015 6:19 AM      Proof 4
Our performance 2014/15
narrowly missed the target in 2014/15, 
being 19 per cent below the baseline, 
impacted adversely by an 11 per 
cent increase in the carbon content 
in the UK energy mix in the year 
which increased our reported carbon 
emissions. Notwithstanding this, in 
2014/15, we have purchased less 
electricity than in any of the previous 
10 years and still achieved our highest 
ever renewable energy production of 
144 GWh. This is the equivalent of 
c18 per cent of our total electricity 
consumption, up from c17 per cent in 
the previous year and c13 per cent in 
2012/13. We are already implementing 
plans to significantly increase self-
generation over the next few years, 
with a target of around 35 per cent of 
our electricity consumption by 2020 
(see business insight on page 37).
Employees – we work hard to sustain 
high levels of engagement by our 
employees. The company has seen 
significant change over the last four 
years and our plans will engage our 
teams for further improvements.  
Employee engagement is 79 per 
cent, well above the norm for UK 
companies going through business 
transition and just below the norm 
for high performing UK companies, so 
our employees demonstrate a strong 
capability to adapt. We continue 
to be successful in attracting and 
retaining people and have continued 
to expand our apprentice and graduate 
programmes, having recruited a further 
22 graduates and 32 apprentices in 
2014/15, taking the current total to 56 
graduates and 97 apprentices. As part 
of our health and safety improvement 
programme, we have implemented a 
number of initiatives which helped 
reduce the employee accident 
frequency rate to 0.112 accidents per 
100,000 hours for 2014/15, compared 
with a rate of 0.137 in 2013/14 and 
0.188 in the previous year. Whilst we 
are pleased with our performance 
improvement, we recognise we still 
have more to do. Health and safety 
will continue to be a significant area 
of focus, as we strive for continuous 
improvement.
Communities – we continue to support 
partnerships, both financially and 
in terms of employee time through 
volunteering, with other organisations 
across the North West that share 
our objectives. We recently set up 
Catchment Wise, our new approach 
to tackling water quality issues in 
lakes, rivers and coastal waters across 
the North West, and our ‘Beachcare’ 
employee volunteering scheme 
helps to keep our region’s beaches 
tidy. We continue to support local 
communities, through contributions 
and schemes such as providing debt 
advisory services and our Community 
Fund, offering grants to local groups 
impacted by our capital investment 
programme. 
Key performance indicators:
Leakage – we met our economic 
level of leakage target for 
the ninth consecutive year in 
2014/15, with a performance of 
454 megalitres per day versus 
the regulatory target of 463 
megalitres per day.
Environmental performance – 
on the Environment Agency’s 
latest assessment (2013/14 
report), which covers a broad 
range of operational metrics, 
United Utilities is an upper 
quartile company. Based on our 
performance across the range of 
metrics, this indicates we were in 
joint 2nd position among the 10 
water and sewerage companies 
and aligns with our medium-term 
goal of being a first quartile 
company on a consistent basis.
Corporate responsibility – we have 
a strong focus on operating in a 
responsible manner and are the 
only UK water company to have a 
‘World Class’ rating as measured 
by the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index. The group has retained its 
‘World Class’ rating and aims to 
retain this rating each year.
Systems thinking approach
T o support the delivery of our 
objectives, we are focused on 
continuous improvement and over 
the last few years have progressively 
instilled a ‘systems thinking’ approach 
into the way we run our business. 
This is an engineering-led approach 
which integrates the use of our assets, 
leverages data intelligence and employs 
technology and new work processes to 
deliver improved customer satisfaction 
and operational efficiency. We have 
made good progress over the last 
few years and this ‘systems thinking’ 
approach is expected to deliver 
benefits of over £100 million over the 
2015–20 regulatory period, which are 
already built into our business plan 
assumptions.  
The step change in performance of 
the business over the 2010–15 period 
has its origins in good management 
practice; constancy of purpose, clear 
objectives, attention to detail, good 
people and performance management. 
However, it was also clear to us that 
we could improve further if we took 
the learning from other sectors to 
transform the way a water company is 
run and we started that transformation 
over three years ago. There are five key 
phases of transformation:
•	 ‘Systems thinking’ – we have 
progressively instilled an 
engineering-led ‘systems thinking’ 
approach which integrates the 
use of our assets, leverages data 
intelligence and employs technology 
and new work processes. We 
have audited our asset base and 
are investing in a new enterprise 
asset management system and 
field force scheduling system, 
supported by the recruitment of 
new people from other sectors 
with experience in these areas. 
By capturing and processing data 
from multiple information points, 
we are aiming for ever-improving 
asset intelligence. We have fitted 
sensors in our water networks to 
provide visibility as to how they 
are performing, helping us to 
reduce burst frequency, and we 
are currently piloting drainage 
system performance monitoring

in our wastewater networks. We 
are building enhanced visibility 
of our assets and more effective 
monitoring and control, enabling 
us to make more informed and 
proactive management decisions.  
This should lead to better modelling 
and prediction of events before 
they occur, reducing reactive work 
and thereby improving efficiency, 
operational performance and, 
importantly, customer service.
•	 Production lines – for the last 
few years we have considered our 
treatment works as ‘factories’ , 
each with its own production 
line. We have over 600 of these 
‘factories’ , small and large, 
producing clean water, bio waste 
and energy. Our business has been 
restructured to create a strong 
focus on accountability and delivery, 
integrating the disciplines often 
found as functional silos in other 
companies. Our managers are 
responsible for the performance 
of their production lines including 
investment of capital to optimise 
operational performance, to deliver 
environmental or water quality 
requirements and to maximise 
energy production, providing a more 
integrated approach.
•	 Organisational structure 
aligned with new price control 
– we recognised that we would 
best address the regulatory 
reform agenda by aligning our 
organisational structure with 
the new price control, with three 
business areas: Wholesale, 
Domestic Retail and Business Retail.  
We did this nearly three years ago 
and recruited a business retail team 
experienced in competitive utility 
markets.
•	 Wholesale business split – we 
subsequently subdivided our 
Wholesale business to concentrate 
on three business areas: Water, 
Wastewater and Energy, with a 
strong focus on increasing our 
renewable and self-generation to 
reduce the amount of electricity we 
purchase. Our people are all aligned 
to this model and our production 
leadership team has responsibility, 
Business Insight
New integrated control 
centre acts as the 
‘digital brain’ of our 
systems
Like many companies in our sector , 
we have no real time view of how our 
gigantic water and wastewater system 
is performing. T oo often our customers 
tell us when the service has failed and 
then we react but incidents are expensive, 
disruptive for us and more importantly for 
our customers.
In April 2015, we opened our new 
integrated control centre (ICC) (pictured 
below) at our head office in Warrington. 
This acts as the ‘digital brain’ of our 
network, providing visualisation of the 
service we are providing right across the 
region.
In preparation, we have been investing 
in a new digital network with over 
3,000 facilities which are now able to 
talk to each other and the ICC over our 
data highway. We are now beginning to 
share real time information about the 
performance of our assets.
With our new ’systems thinking’ approach, 
our goal is to improve both efficiency 
and performance and aim to prevent a 
problem or fix it before a customer’s 
service is disturbed. 
authority and accountability for the 
performance of their assets using 
a total expenditure, whole life cost 
approach to decision management.
•	 Integrated control centre – 
underpinning our ‘systems thinking’ 
ethos is our recently opened 
integrated control centre in 
Warrington (see ‘business insight’ 
below).
This has all been supported by a 
significant cultural change in the 
company over the last few years, which 
has helped United Utilities progress 
into a leading operational performer in 
the sector. A critical enabler has been 
our people and we continue to invest in 
attracting talent and in developing the 
best, giving us a powerful mix of water 
experience and knowledge of other 
sectors.

Our performance 2014/15
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
We have delivered a good set of 
financial results for the year ended 
31 March 2015. Revenue increased 
by £31 million to £1,720 million. This 
increase principally reflects the allowed 
regulated price rise, partly offset by the 
previously announced special customer 
discount of £21 million. 
Operating profit
Underlying operating profit was up £30 
million to £664 million, as we tightly 
managed our cost base despite the 
expected increase in depreciation and 
other cost pressures, including bad debt. 
As planned, there was also a £17 million 
reduction in infrastructure renewals 
expenditure this year as we transition 
from this regulatory period to the next. 
Reported operating profit increased by 
£23 million, to £653 million.
Investment income and finance 
expense
The underlying net finance expense of 
£222 million was £29 million lower than 
last year, primarily reflecting the impact 
of lower RPI inflation on the group’s 
index-linked debt. The indexation of 
the principal on our index-linked debt 
amounted to a net charge in the income 
statement of £47 million, compared 
with a net charge of £83 million last 
year. The group had approximately 
£3.1 billion of index-linked debt as at 
31 March 2015 at an average real rate 
of 1.6 per cent. The lower RPI inflation 
charge contributed to the group’s 
average underlying interest rate of 4.0 
per cent being lower than the rate of 4.6 
per cent for 2013/14.
Reported investment income and 
finance expense of £317 million was 
significantly higher than the £92 million 
expense in 2013/14. This £225 million 
increase principally reflects a change 
in the fair value gains and losses on 
debt and derivative instruments, from 
a £129 million gain in 2013/14 to a 
£105 million loss in 2014/15. The £105 
million fair value loss is largely due to 
losses on the regulatory swap portfolio, 
resulting from a significant decrease 
in medium-term sterling interest rates 
during the period, partly offset by a gain 
from the unwinding of the derivatives 
hedging interest rates to 2015. The 
group uses these swaps to fix interest 
rates on a substantial proportion of 
its debt to better match the financing 
cash flows allowed by the regulator at 
each price review. The group fixed the 
majority of its non index-linked debt for 
the 2010–15 financial period, providing 
a net effective nominal interest rate of 
approximately 5 per cent.
Profit before tax
Underlying profit before tax was £447 
million, £59 million higher than last 
year, due to the £30 million increase 
in underlying operating profit and the 
£29 million decrease in underlying 
net finance expense. This underlying 
measure adjusts for the impact of one-
off items, principally from restructuring 
within the business, and other items 
such as fair value movements in respect 
of debt and derivative instruments. 
Reported profit before tax decreased 
by £202 million to £342 million, 
primarily due to the aforementioned 
fair value movements.  
Taxation 
Consistent with our wider business 
objectives, we are committed to acting 
in a responsible manner in relation to 
our tax affairs.
Our tax policies and objectives, which 
are approved by the board on a regular 
basis, ensure that we:
•	 only engage in reasonable tax 
planning aligned with our commercial 
activities and we always comply with 
what we believe to be both the letter 
and the spirit of the law;
•	 do not engage in aggressive or 
abusive tax avoidance; and
•	 are committed to an open, 
transparent and professional 
relationship with HMRC based 
on mutual trust and collaborative 
working.
Under the regulatory framework the 
group operates within, the majority of 
any benefit from reduced tax payments 
will typically not be retained by the 
group but will pass to customers via 
reduced bills. For 2013/14, the group 
agreed, over and above the normal 
regulatory rules, to voluntarily share 
with customers the one-off net cash 
benefit of £75 million due to the group, 
following the industry-wide agreement 
with HMRC in relation to the abolition 
of industrial buildings allowances in 
2008.
In any given year, the group’s effective 
cash tax rate may fluctuate from the 
standard UK rate due to the available 
tax deductions on pension contributions 
and capital investment. These 
deductions are achieved as a result of 
utilising tax incentives, which have been 
explicitly put in place by successive 
governments precisely to encourage 
such investment. This reflects 
responsible corporate behaviour in 
relation to taxation.
The group’s effective cash tax rate 
may also fluctuate from the standard 
UK rate due to unrealised profits 
or losses in relation to treasury 
derivatives where the corresponding 
profits or losses are only taxed when 
realised. These movements are purely 
timing differences and are expected 
to continue going forward, following 
HMRC’s recent review of the relevant 
tax rules.
The group’s principal subsidiary, United 
Utilities Water Limited (UUW), operates 
solely in the UK and its customers are 
based here. All of the group’s profits are 
taxable in the UK (other than the group’s 
35 per cent holding in T allinn Water 
which generates around £6 million 
profit before tax with around £1 million 
Estonian tax paid).
In 2014/15, we paid corporation tax 
of £62 million, which represents an 
effective cash tax rate of 18 per cent, 
3 per cent lower than the mainstream 
rate of corporation tax of 21 per cent.  
In 2013/14, we paid corporation tax 
of £64 million. For both years, the key 
reconciling items to the mainstream 
rate were allowable tax deductions 
on net capital investment and timing 
differences in relation to fair value 
movements on treasury derivatives. In 
2013/14, the group also received an 
exceptional tax refund of £96 million 
in relation to prior years’ tax matters, 
covering a period of over 10 years in 
total.

Stock Code: UU.

The current tax charge was £57 million 
in 2014/15, compared with a charge 
of £75 million in the previous year. In 
addition, there were current tax credits 
of £10 million in 2014/15 and £141 
million in 2013/14, both following 
agreement with the UK tax authorities 
of prior years’ tax matters.  
For 2014/15, the group recognised 
a deferred tax charge of £14 million, 
compared with a charge of £41 million 
in 2013/14. In addition, in 2014/15 the 
group recognised a deferred tax charge 
of £9 million relating to prior years’ 
tax matters, compared to a deferred 
tax credit of £13 million in 2013/14. 
In 2013/14, the group also recognised 
a deferred tax credit of £157 million 
relating to the 3 per cent staged 
reduction in the mainstream rate of 
corporation tax, substantively enacted 
on 2 July 2013, to reduce the rate to  
20 per cent by 2015/16.  
The total tax charge, excluding one-off 
charges and credits, of £71 million for 
2014/15 represents a rate of 21 per 
cent, similar to the rate in 2013/14.
In addition to corporation tax, the group 
pays and bears further annual economic 
contributions, typically of around 
£140 million per annum, in the form 
of business rates, employer’s national 
insurance contributions, environmental 
taxes and other regulatory service fees 
such as water abstraction charges.
Profit after tax
Underlying profit after tax of £354 
million was £49 million higher than 
for 2013/14, reflecting an increase in 
underlying profit before tax partly offset 
by an increase in underlying tax charge 
due on higher profits. Reported profit 
after tax was £271 million, compared 
with £739 million for 2013/14, impacted 
by the £234 million movement in fair 
value on debt and derivative instruments 
and the £266 million net increase in tax 
between the two periods.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased 
from 44.7 pence to 51.9 pence. This 
underlying measure is derived from 
underlying profit after tax. This includes 
the adjustments for the deferred tax 
credits in 2013/14 associated with 
the reductions in the corporation tax 
rate and an adjustment for the tax 
credit arising from agreement of prior 
years’ tax matters. Basic earnings per 
share decreased from 108.3 pence to 
39.8 pence, for the same reasons that 
reduced profit after tax. 
Dividend per share
The board has proposed a final dividend 
of 25.14 pence per ordinary share in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 
2015. T aken together with the interim 
dividend of 12.56 pence per ordinary 
share, paid in February, this produces 
a total dividend per ordinary share for 
2014/15 of 37.70 pence. This is an 
increase of 4.6 per cent, compared with 
the dividend relating to last year, in line 
with group’s dividend policy of targeting 
a growth rate of RPI+2 per cent per 
annum through to 2015. The inflationary 
increase of 2.6 per cent is based on 
the RPI element included within the 
allowed regulated price increase for 
the 2014/15 financial year (i.e. the 
movement in RPI between November 
2012 and November 2013).  
The final dividend is expected to be paid 
on 3 August 2015 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business  
on 26 June 2015. The ex-dividend date 
is 25 June 2015.
Cash flow 
Net cash generated from continuing 
operating activities for the year 
ended 31 March 2015 was £707 
million, compared with £797 million 
in the previous year. This reduction 
mainly reflects the receipt of the 
aforementioned exceptional tax 
refund in 2013/14. The group’s net 
capital expenditure was £709 million, 
principally in the regulated water and 
wastewater investment programmes. 
This excludes infrastructure renewals 
expenditure which is treated as an 
operating cost under IFRS.  
Net debt including derivatives at 
31 March 2015 was £5,924 million, 
compared with £5,516 million at 
31 March 2014. This increase reflects 
expenditure on the regulatory capital 
expenditure programmes and payments 
of dividends, interest and tax, alongside 
fair value losses on the group’s debt and 
derivative instruments, partly offset by 
operating cash flows.

Our performance 2014/15
Fair value of debt
The group’s gross borrowings at  
31 March 2015 had a carrying value of 
£6,645 million. The fair value of these 
borrowings was £7,350 million. This 
£705 million difference principally 
reflects the significant fall in real 
interest rates, compared with the rates 
at the time we raised our index-linked 
debt.  This difference has increased 
from £267 million at 31 March 2014.

Debt financing and interest rate 
management
Gearing (measured as group net debt 
divided by UUW’s regulatory capital value) 
was 59 per cent at 31 March 2015, an 
increase of 1 per cent compared with the 
position at 31 March 2014, remaining well 
within our target range of 55 per cent to 
65 per cent.    
UUW has long-term credit ratings of A3/
BBB+ and United Utilities PLC has long-
term credit ratings of Baa1/BBB- from 
Moody’s Investors Service and Standard 
& Poor’s Ratings Services respectively.  
The split rating reflects differing 
methodologies used by the credit rating 
agencies. Both agencies have the group’s 
ratings on stable outlook.
The group has access to the 
international debt capital markets 
through its €7 billion euro medium-
term note programme (EMTN). 
On 19 November 2014, the EMTN 
programme was updated adding a 
new financing subsidiary of UUW , 
United Utilities Water Finance PLC 
(UUWF), to issue new listed debt 
on behalf of UUW going forwards 
following UUW’s re-registration as a 
private limited company. The EMTN 
programme provides for the periodic 
issuance by United Utilities PLC and 
UUWF (guaranteed by UUW) of debt 
instruments on terms and conditions 
determined at the time the notes are 
issued. The EMTN programme does not 
represent a funding commitment, with 
funding dependent on the successful 
issue of the notes.
Cash and short-term deposits at  
31 March 2015 amounted to £244 
million. Over 2015–20 we have 
financing requirements totalling around 
£2.5 billion to cover refinancing and 
incremental debt, supporting our 2015–
20 investment programme. In December 
2013, UUW agreed a new £500 million 
term loan facility with the European 
Investment Bank (EIB) and as at  
31 March 2015 UUW had drawn down 
£350 million on this facility, all on a 
floating rate basis. The remaining £150 
million is expected to be drawn down 
during the first half of 2015/16. In 
March 2015, UUW signed a new £250 
million index-linked term loan facility 
with the EIB. This is an amortising 
facility with an average loan life of 10 
years and a final maturity of 18 years 
from draw down and we expect to draw 
the new loan in tranches over the next 
year or so. In the same month, UUW 
arranged a new £100 million, 10-year 
index-linked loan with an existing 
relationship bank, at a real interest 
rate of around 0.5 per cent. The group 
also agreed £150 million of committed 
bank facilities during 2014/15.

Following the year-end, UUWF issued 
two index-linked notes totalling £60 
million, split by a £25 million, 10-year 
maturity and a £35 million, 15-year 
maturity. UUWF also issued a €52 
million note (swapped to floating 
sterling) with a 12-year maturity. All 
these notes were issued via private 
placement off our EMTN programme. 
The group now has headroom to cover 
its projected financing needs into 
2017.  
Long-term borrowings are structured or 
hedged to match assets and earnings, 
which are largely in sterling, indexed 
to UK retail price inflation and subject 
to regulatory price reviews every five 
years.  
Long-term sterling inflation index-
linked debt provides a natural hedge 
to assets and earnings. At 31 March 
2015, approximately 52 per cent of 
the group’s net debt was in index-linked 
form, representing around 31 per cent 
of UUW’s regulatory capital value, with 
an average real interest rate of 1.6 
per cent. The long-term nature of this 
funding also provides a good match to 
the company’s long-life infrastructure 
assets and is a key contributor to the 
group’s average term-debt maturity 
profile, which is over 20 years.
Where nominal debt is raised in a 
currency other than sterling and/or with 
a fixed interest rate, to manage exposure 
to long-term interest rates, the debt is 
generally swapped to create a floating 
rate sterling liability for the term of the 
debt. T o manage exposure to medium-
term interest rates, the group fixes 
underlying interest costs on nominal 
debt out to 10 years on a reducing 
balance basis. This is supplemented by 
fixing substantially all remaining floating 
rate exposure across the forthcoming 
regulatory period around the time of the 
price control determination. 
In line with this, the group has now 
fixed interest costs for substantially all 
of its floating rate exposure over the 
2015–20 period, locking in an average 
annual interest rate of around 3.75 per 
cent (inclusive of credit spreads). For 
2015/16, the rate is slightly higher, 
as we transition between the two 
regulatory periods.
Liquidity
Short-term liquidity requirements are 
met from the group’s normal operating 
cash flow and its short-term bank 
deposits and supported by committed 
but undrawn credit facilities. The 
group’s €7 billion euro medium-term 
note programme provides further 
support. 
In line with the board’s treasury policy, 
United Utilities aims to maintain a robust 
liquidity position. Available headroom at 
31 March 2015 was £616 million based 
on cash, short-term deposits, medium-
term committed bank facilities, along 
with the undrawn portion of the EIB term 
loan facilities, net of short-term debt.  
United Utilities believes that it operates 
a prudent approach to managing 
banking counterparty risk. Counterparty 
risk, in relation to both cash deposits 
and derivatives, is controlled through 
the use of counterparty credit limits. 
United Utilities’ cash is held in the form 
of short-term money market deposits 
with prime commercial banks.
United Utilities operates a bilateral, 
rather than a syndicated, approach to 
its core relationship banking facilities.  
This approach spreads maturities 
more evenly over a longer time period, 
thereby reducing refinancing risk 
and providing the benefit of several 
renewal points rather than a large single 
refinancing requirement.  
Pensions
As at 31 March 2015, the group had 
an IAS 19 net pension surplus of £79 
million, compared with a net pension 
deficit of £177 million at 31 March 
2014. This £256 million favourable 
movement mainly reflects a decrease 
in inflation expectations alongside an 
increase in corporate credit spreads. In 
contrast, the scheme specific funding 
basis does not suffer from volatility 
due to inflation and credit spread 
movements as it uses a  fixed inflation 
assumption via the inflation funding 
mechanism and a prudent, fixed credit 
spread assumption. Therefore, the 
recent inflation and credit spread 
movements have not had a material 
impact on the deficit calculated on a 
scheme specific funding basis or the 
level of deficit repair contributions.
The triennial actuarial valuations of 
the group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes were carried out as at  
31 March 2013 and the overall 
funding position has improved since 
March 2010. Following the de-risking 
measures we have implemented over 
recent years, our pension funding 
position remains well placed and in line 
with our expectations. There has been 
no material change to the scheduled 
cash contributions as assessed at the 
previous valuations in 2010.  
Further detail is provided in note 18 
(‘Retirement benefit obligations’) 
of these consolidated financial 
statements.

Our plans for 2015–20
The final determination 
delivers value for all of 
our stakeholders
The final determination for our 2015–20 price controls was published  by Ofwat 
on 12 December 2014 and, after careful consideration, we accepted these 
proposals on 27 January 2015.
The final determination delivers value 
for all of our stakeholders, with a 
strong focus on customer benefits, 
including reduced bills in 2015/16, 
alongside continued high levels 
of investment which will provide 
further environmental benefits and a 
significant contribution to the regional 
economy.  Household customers are 
also set to benefit from below inflation 
growth in average bills for the decade 
through to 2020.  
We aim to maintain efficient access 
to debt capital markets throughout 
the economic cycle and believe that 
it is appropriate to keep gearing, 
measured as net debt to regulatory 
capital value, within our existing 
target range of 55 per cent to 65 per 
cent. This is supported by our aim to 
maintain, as minimum, our existing 
UUW credit ratings of A3 with Moody’s 
and BBB+ with Standard & Poor’s. We 
are targeting growth in the dividend 
per share, from 2014/15 base, of at 
least RPI inflation each year through to 
2019/20. This target reflects detailed 
analysis and assessment of the final 
determination, including the lower 
allowed regulatory return for 2015-20.
The key features of the delivery plans 
for each of the four price controls are 
set out below.
Wholesale water
The North West benefits from one of 
the youngest water networks in the 
country, with over 50 per cent of our 
network constructed or renewed in the 
last 30 years. This is a consequence of 
significant investment over previous 
regulatory cycles to improve water

quality. We benefit from historic 
investment in the integration of our 
networks to create a core ‘integrated 
supply zone. ’ The most recent addition 
to this was the West–East pipeline 
running approximately 50 kilometres 
between Liverpool and Manchester. As 
a consequence, we are able to provide 
one of the most efficient and flexible 
water services in the sector.
Customers told us they want to retain 
their current level of water services, 
but do not want to pay for water 
service improvements. This has driven 
our proposals for the next five years, 
where our core focus is to continue 
ongoing maintenance of the existing 
service to keep it working reliably 
now and in the future, managing costs 
carefully and reducing the number of 
customer contacts. 
Key features of our plan mean that we 
aim to: 
•	 maintain existing high levels of 
reliability in the delivery of day-
to-day water services, making 
better use of technology to monitor 
remotely and control more of our 
source-to-tap assets; 
•	 maintain existing high levels of 
water quality as measured at 
customers’ taps and our water 
treatment works; 
•	 reduce the number of contacts from 
customers regarding water quality;
•	 maintain leakage at or below the 
sustainable economic level;
•	 limit the impact on customers of 
increases in operating costs, such 
as chemicals and rates, by making 
cost savings elsewhere through 
the continuous improvement in the 
efficiency of our operations; and
•	 commence work to link 150,000 
customers in West Cumbria to 
Thirlmere reservoir to ensure a 
long-term, reliable supply of drinking 
water and to support the sensitive 
ecology in that area (see business 
insight opposite). 
Business Insight
Securing a sustainable 
water supply for Cumbria
The only exception was West 
Cumbria, where we predicted a 
supply/demand deficit.  This was 
driven by the Environment Agency’s 
determination that, in future, we 
will have to extract less water from 
Ennerdale lake in West Cumbria, in 
order to protect England’s largest 
population of freshwater mussels in 
the River Ehen.
With the support of the EA and other 
stakeholders, our plan is to use 
surplus water from our integrated 
resource zone to supply West 
Cumbria to ensure its population 
has a long-term sustainable, secure 
supply of water.  We will build over 
90km of pipeline from Thirlmere 
reservoir to supply West Cumbria as 
shown in the diagram below. A new 
water treatment works is planned 
to be built in Keswick to replace five 
existing water treatment works and 
avoid significant future maintenance 
at these sites. We received funding 
of around £200 million for this 
project over 2015–20, making it our 
largest capital scheme.
Our 25-year Water Resources Management Plan forecast that the vast 
majority of our region (covering 97 per cent of our customer base and 
including our large integrated supply zone) will be in water surplus, despite 
expected increases in population and the impact of climate change.

Our plans for 2015–20
Wholesale wastewater
The region’s geography and weather, 
the legacy of the Industrial Revolution, 
population growth and long-term 
under investment in the region’s 
wastewater infrastructure mean that 
new European environmental legislation 
has a significant impact on our plans 
for the next five years and beyond. 
Furthermore, the North West has one of 
the country’s largest combined waste 
and surface water infrastructures and 
this has significant implications for 
river and bathing water quality in the 
heavy rainfall events anticipated under 
climate change. These are significant 
new challenges for our wastewater 
service and will drive high levels 
of capital expenditure in meeting 
statutory obligations. 
Against this backdrop, customers told 
us that for the most part they wanted 
their wastewater services to remain 
stable. Whilst they want to see progress 
in reducing sewer flooding and in 
improving the environment, they are 
concerned about the impact that service 
improvements will have on their bills. 
We have responded to this by devising 
a balanced programme of work over the 
2015–20 period and beyond that will 
progressively deliver our contribution to 
the UK Government’s compliance with 
European legislation. This also takes 
account of customers’ views on the 
acceptable level of future bill increases. 
In the next five-year period we 
aim to: 
•	 build on the customer satisfaction 
improvements we have already 
delivered. We will continue to 
improve the way we operate our 
wastewater business, making better 
use of technology, automation and 
control to drive better customer 
service at reduced cost; 
•	 reduce the number of our 
customers’ properties exposed 
to sewer flooding by over 40 per 
cent, seeking opportunities to 
work in partnership with others to 
deliver schemes cost-effectively 
and promote the use of more 
sustainable drainage systems; 
•	 improve the region’s bathing waters, 
in light of tougher regulatory 
standards;
•	 work with other organisations 
to support them in delivering 
improvements to our region’s 
beaches; 
•	 improve the water quality in the 
North West’s rivers and lakes 
through investment in our treatment 
works and at overflows, reducing 
pollution. We are engaging with 
stakeholders to explore innovative 
catchment management techniques 
to control diffuse pollution in our 
catchments; 
•	 increase our production of 
renewable energy from waste to 
help protect customers from rising 
energy costs and reduce our carbon 
footprint; and
•	 constrain costs associated with 
taking responsibility for all private 
sewers and private pumping 
stations across the region, through 
improvements to our operating 
model and efficient delivery of our 
programme. 
We are expanding our 
options for assistance 
to hard-pressed 
customers

Household retail
Our focus for the current regulatory 
period has been. and continues to be. 
to improve the customer experience. 
This involves being more proactive 
with customers, anticipating problems 
before they materialise and improving 
our communication channels so that 
we are easier to do business with. 
We aim to reduce further the number 
of complaints and to resolve them 
whenever we can, avoiding the need 
for complaints to be referred to the 
Consumer Council for Water.
We aim to reduce the debt burden on 
the company and its customers by 
engaging with those who are struggling 
to pay, helping them to return to 
sustained payment behaviour. We are 
extending our options for assistance to 
hard-pressed customers by developing 
a social tariff that secures a high level 
of acceptability from customers. We 
remain committed to contributing 
annually to the United Utilities Trust 
Fund, which has proven effective in 
helping customers in difficulty return 
to regular payment. 
Our domestic retail plan also sees us 
continuing our efforts to reduce the 
costs to serve our customers through 
systems and process improvement. 
This is particularly important under the 
new price control methodology which 
uses an industry average retail cost to 
serve to determine part of customer 
bills.
Non-household retail
We welcome the opportunity offered 
through the opening of the English 
non-household retail market to 
competition. Over the last three years 
we have recruited a management team 
with other sector experience to lead 
our business retail area, and separated 
this team from our domestic retail and 
wholesale business areas. This team 
has embarked on a transformation 
programme focused on getting the 
basics right against core customer 
needs, creating the culture of a 
business-to-business retailer. 
Our early progress has been 
encouraging and our success in 
growing our United Utilities Scotland 
business has allowed us to learn 
about the propositions, processes 
and systems required to win, serve 
and retain non-household customers. 
Research has highlighted a need for a 
broader range of services targeted to 
different segments. We are developing 
these in our non-appointed business, 
ensuring that they are only paid for by 
customers who want these services. 
Non-household customers tell us that 
the three most important things they 
look to their water supplier to deliver 
are: value for money; a reliable supply; 
and great customer service. With this 
in mind, through the course of the 
2015–20 period we aim to: 
•	 install meters in all business 
customer premises that give 
automated meter reads (AMR) 
to facilitate billing for actual 
consumption;
•	 build stronger relationships with 
customers to develop tailored plans 
to meet their needs; 
•	 give customers greater choice in 
how they contact and transact with 
us; and
•	 increase first point resolution and 
case ownership, reducing cost to 
serve and improving customer 
satisfaction.

Our key performance indicators (KPIs)  
2015–20
Our financial KPIs will remain the 
same except that we will no longer 
be including capital investment 
specifically due to Ofwat’s move away 
from opex and capex and into the new 
totex-based price control for 2015–20. 
The definitions are as outlined in our 
2010–15 KPIs on pages 32 and 33.
Financial KPIs 2015–20
•	 Revenue
•	 Underlying operating profit 
•	 Underlying earnings per share 
•	 Dividend per share
•	 Gearing: net debt to regulatory 
capital value
Our operational KPIs have evolved 
to reflect the move to a totex price 
control, with a totex outperformance 
measure replacing the previous 
separate opex outperformance and 
capex outperformance measures. 
We are including an outcome delivery 
incentive (ODI) KPI in our wholesale 
business to monitor our performance 
against these important new 
operational measures. This replaces 
the previous serviceability KPI 
which is incorporated within the ODI 
measures.  With the retail household 
price control now being separated, we 
are introducing a new KPI to measure 
our costs in this area.  In the business 
retail price control, with the expansion 
of competition, we are including a new 
KPI measuring the impact of customer 
gains and losses.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 22027.04      4 June 2015 6:19 AM      Proof 4
Our risk profile currently illustrates 
around 200 event-based risks. All event 
types (strategic, financial, operational, 
compliance and hazard) are considered 
in the context of our strategic themes 
(best service to customers; lowest 
sustainable cost; and responsible 
manner). For internal or external drivers, 
each event is assessed for the likelihood 
of occurrence and the negative financial 
or reputational impact on the company 
and its objectives, should the event 
occur. 
Responsibility for the assessment 
and management of the risk (including 
monitoring and updating) is assigned 
to the appropriate individual manager 
who is also responsible for reporting 
on assessment, management and 
control/mitigation at least twice a year, 
in line with the reporting to the group 
board at full and half-year statutory 
accounting reporting periods. 
By their nature, event-based risks in 
the context of our strategic themes 
will include all combinations of high to 
low likelihood and high to low impact. 
Heat maps are typically used in various 
managerial and group reports either 
as a method to collectively evaluate 
the extent of all risks within a certain 
profile or to illustrate the effectiveness 
of mitigation for a single risk by plotting 
the gross, current (net of existing 
controls) and the selected target 
position in an individual risk statement. 
However, reporting a small number of 
event-based risks ranked by combined  
event likelihood and potential impact 
could distort principal risk disclosure 
as it would overlook other risks with 
a lesser individual exposure that, 
if they materialised individually or 
in aggregate, could have a material 
impact on the business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity 
of the group. Equally, event-based 
risks identified as part of our 
internal assessment process can be 
commercially sensitive, the disclosure 
of which could be detrimental to 
competitive advantage or our ability to 
mitigate risk over the longer term. 
In order to address this, further 
understand the nature and extent 
of our entire profile and support the 
disclosure of principal risks, event-
based risks are categorised (based 
on the event), when recorded onto 
the central database, into areas that 
define business activity or contributing 
factors where value can be lost. These 
categories have been set out in the 
table on pages 54 and 55 to reflect the 
principal risks (aggregated), together 
with associated issues or areas of 
uncertainty, potential for material 
effect, the extent of control/mitigation 
and the link to our main business 
objectives. We have also included 
in the three columns ‘Likelihood of 
occurrence’ , ‘Potential aggregated 
net impact’ and ‘Trend’ more detailed 
analysis as explained in the key at the 
top of page 55.
Key features, developments over 
the last year and looking ahead
As expected, following the 2014 
price determination the group’s risk 
profile is returning to one based 
more on operational performance, 
compliance and delivery risk. We have 
challenging demands on customer 
benefits, operational performance and 
investment requirements in light of 
population growth, climate change and 
strict legal/regulatory requirements. 
Competition and market reform 
remain high on the agenda however, 
with the ongoing development of the 
non-household market and uncertainty 
surrounding the impact of upstream 
competition for water and wastewater 
services. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
Our risk management framework aims  
for continuous improvement
We have developed a sophisticated approach to the assessment, management and reporting of risks, with a process aligned  
to ISO 31000: 2009 and a well-established governance structure for the group board to review the nature and extent of 
the risks that the group faces and for the audit committee to review process effectiveness. This process is supported by a 
central database, tools, templates and guidance to drive consistency.

There continue to be two ongoing 
pieces of material litigation worthy of 
note but, based on the facts currently 
known to us and the provisions in our 
statement of financial position, our 
directors remain of the opinion that the 
likelihood of these having a material 
adverse impact on the group’s financial 
position is remote.
•	 In February 2009, United Utilities 
International Limited (UUIL) was 
served with notice of a multiparty 
‘class action’ in Argentina related 
to the issuance and payment 
default of a US$230 million bond 
by Inversora Eléctrica de Buenos 
Aires S.A. (IEBA), an Argentine 
project company set up to purchase 
one of the Argentine electricity 
distribution networks which was 
privatised in 1997. UUIL had a 
45 per cent shareholding in IEBA 
which it sold in 2005. The claim 
is for a non-quantified amount 
of unspecified damages and 
purports to be pursued on behalf of 
unidentified consumer bondholders 
in IEBA. UUIL has filed a defence 
to the action and will vigorously 
resist the proceedings given the 
robust defences that UUIL has been 
advised that it has on procedural 
and substantive grounds.
•	 In March 2010, Manchester Ship 
Canal Company (MSCC) issued 
proceedings seeking, amongst other 
relief, damages alleging trespass 
against United Utilities Water 
Limited (UUW) in respect of UUW’s 
discharges of water and treated 
effluent into the canal. Whilst the 
matter has not reached a final 
conclusion, the Supreme Court has 
found substantively in UUW’s favour 
on a significant element of the claim 
and referred the remainder of the 
proceedings back to the High Court.

Non-compliance with existing or future UK or international laws or regulations 
(especially given the highly regulated environment we operate in) could result 
in additional workload and operating costs in justifying or defending our 
position and financial penalties (including of up to 10 per cent of relevant 
regulated turnover for extreme events) and compensation following litigation 
is also possible, together with additional capital/operating expenditure as a 
result of the imposition of enforcement orders. In more remote but extreme 
circumstances, impacts could ultimately include licence revocation or the 
appointment of a special administrator.
Unlikely  Low
Legislative and regulatory developments are continually monitored. Risk-based training of 
employees is undertaken and we participate in consultations to influence legislative and regulatory 
developments. Funding for any additional compliance costs in the regulated business is sought 
as part of the price determination process. The group also robustly defends litigation where 
appropriate and seeks to minimise its exposure by establishing provisions and seeking recovery 
wherever possible.

Physical and technological security measures combined with strong governance and inspection 
regimes aim to protect infrastructure, assets and operational capability. Ongoing integration of water 
and wastewater networks improves operational resilience and we maintain robust incident response, 
business continuity and disaster recovery procedures. We also maintain insurance cover for loss and

•	 Delivering required employee 
engagement, talent management,

Capacity, capability and effectiveness problems associated with human and 
IT resource will impact the efficiency and effectiveness of business activity, 
the ability to make appropriate decisions and ultimately meet targets. This can 
also affect the ability to recruit and retain knowledge/expertise or to recover 
effectively following an incident. In remote but extreme circumstances there 
is also the potential for higher levels of regulatory scrutiny, financial penalties, 
reputational damage and missed commercial opportunities.
Unlikely  Low
Developing our people with the right skills and knowledge, combined with delivering effective 
technology are important enablers to support the business to meet its objectives. Employees are 
kept informed regarding business strategy and progress through various communication channels. 
Training and personal development programmes exist for all employees in addition to talent 
management programmes and apprentice and graduate schemes. We focus on change programmes 
and innovative ways of working to deliver better, faster and more cost-effective operations.

•	 Inflation/deflation
•	 Financial market conditions, interest 
rates and funding costs
The failure of financial counterparties could result in additional financing 
cost, an adverse impact on the income statement and potential reputational 
damage. Variability in inflation (as measured by the UK Retail Prices Index) and 
changes in interest rates, funding costs and other market risks could adversely 
impact the economic return on the regulatory capital value (RCV) and affect 
our pension schemes with a requirement for the group to make additional 
contributions. In extreme but remote cases adverse market conditions could 
affect our access to debt capital markets and subsequently available liquidity 
and credit ratings.
Unlikely High 
Refinancing is long-term with staggered maturity dates to minimise the effect of short-term 
downturns. Counterparty credit, exposure and settlement limits exist to reduce any potential 
future impacts. These are based on a number of factors, including the credit rating and the size 
of the asset base of the individual counterparty. The group also employs hedging strategies to 
stabilise market fluctuation for inflation, interest rates and commodities (notably energy prices). 
Sensitivity analysis is carried out as part of the business planning process, influencing the various 
financial limits employed. Continuous monitoring of the markets takes place including movements 
in credit default swap prices and movements in equity levels.

Failure to deliver capital or change programmes against relevant time, cost 
or quality measures could result in a failure to secure competitive advantage 
or operating performance efficiency and cost benefits. There is also the risk 
of increased delivery costs or a failure to meet our obligations and customer 
outcomes which, depending on the nature and extent of failure, could result 
in an impact at future price reviews, regulatory or statutory penalties and 
negative reputational impact with customers and regulators.

We have a developed and clear view of our investment priorities which are built into our programmes, 
projects and integrated business and asset plans. We have created better alignment and integration 
between our capital delivery partners and engineering service provider including alignment with our 
operating model. Our programme and project management capabilities are well established with 
strong governance and embedded processes to support delivery, manage risks and achieve business 
benefits. We utilise a time, cost and quality index (TCQi) as a key performance indicator and enhance 
our performance through a dedicated programme change office to deliver change in a structured and 
consistent way. Supply chain management is utilised to deliver end-to-end contract management 
which includes contract strategy and tendering, category management, security of supply, price and 
price volatility and financial and operational service level performance.

Poor service to customers can result in financial penalties issued by the 
regulator through components of the service incentive mechanism for 
domestic customers and loss of revenue associated with commercial churn 
for commercial customers using five megalitres and above per annum. The 
proposed opening of the market for retail services to all non-household 
customers in England from 2017 generates both opportunities and risk 
associated with market share, scale and margin erosion. There is also 
much uncertainty surrounding the form of upstream reform which is now 
anticipated to materialise post-2019. 
Unlikely  Medium
For domestic retail there is a transformation plan in place covering a wide range of initiatives and 
activities to improve customer service, with a number of controls in place to monitor achievement 
against the plan. Similarly, we look to retain existing and acquire new commercial customers 
by striving to meet their needs more effectively. We monitor competitor activity and target a 
reduction in operating costs.

Corporate governance report
Letter from the Chairman
Quick facts
•	 The Chairman met the 
independence criteria as set 
out in the 2012 UK Corporate 
Code (the Code) when he was 
appointed as Chairman
•	 The Code requires that at least 
half of the board is made up 
of independent non-executive 
directors (the test excludes the 
Chairman). At United Utilities, 
five out of the remaining 
seven directors (excluding the 
Chairman) are independent non-
executive directors
•	 The company secretary attends 
all board and committee 
meetings and advises the 
Chairman on governance 
matters. The company 
secretariat team provides 
administrative support
•	 All directors are subject to 
annual election at the AGM 
held in July. Following the 
completion of the annual 
evaluation process all the 
non-executive directors were 
considered by the board to 
be independent and making 
a valuable and effective 
contribution to the board. As a 
result, the board recommends 
that shareholders vote in favour 
of those standing for a further 
term at the forthcoming AGM

Our intention is to hand 
over the business to our 
successors in a better and 
more sustainable position for 
the future
Dear shareholder,
Our year
The focus of the board has been 
in the planning for United Utilities 
Water’s (UUW’s) next five-year 
regulatory period for 2015 to 2020, 
and endeavouring to ensure the long-
term success of the company and the 
group for that period and beyond. The 
board has concentrated on pursuing 
the company’s continuing strategy to 
provide the best service to customers, 
at the lowest sustainable cost and in a 
responsible manner, and in meeting the 
challenges of the financial year ended 
31 March 2015. 
Having the same directors on both 
the UUG and UUW boards (with the 
addition of Steven Fraser, managing 
director of UUW’s Wholesale business, 
on the UUW board) reflects our vision 
which is to focus on our core water and 
wastewater business and become a 
leading North West service provider. 
So, whilst both the UUG and UUW 
boards’ agendas have been dominated 
by the next regulatory period, the UUG 
board has also been addressing the 
strategic and directional challenges of 
the group. Our governance processes 
also address Ofwat’s published 
principles on board leadership, 
transparency and governance, and our 
statement can be found on our website 
at corporate.unitedutilities.com/
corporate-governance
We have achieved considerable 
progress against our strategy, 
particularly in customer service, 
although this is still a primary 
area of focus for the board. The 
implementation of our new operating

model for our wholesale business 
employing new technology and new 
work processes will support us in 
achieving this target. The board iss 
determined to maintain the rate of 
progress that has been achieved to 
date as we enter the next five-year 
period. 
In January 2015, the UUW board met 
to consider the best course of action 
in terms of accepting or rejecting 
Ofwat’s 2015–20 final determination. 
The board concluded that, although 
this was a challenging price control, 
we have plans in place to maintain and 
improve services for customers and 
provide an appropriate return for our 
investors. 
Our approach
As individual directors we are 
cognisant of our statutory duties and 
in particular to promote the long-term 
success of our company. Our role as 
the board is to set the strategy of 
the group, and ensure its long-term 
success and create shareholder value. 
Our intention as directors is to hand 
over the business to our successors 
in a better and more sustainable 
position for the future. Information on 
our vision and strategy and the way in 
which we create value is included in the 
strategic report on pages 4 to 55.
Our governance structure
We held eight scheduled board 
meetings during the year, which 
were attended by all directors. 
There were also a number of ad hoc 
board meetings held which directors 
attended either in person or via 
telephone conferencing facilities, 
a number of which related to the 
board’s involvement in the price 
review process. A diagram showing 
the inter-relationships of the various 
board committees can be found on 
page 64, and reports from each of the 
committee chairs about their work 
can be found on the following pages. 
The diagram also describes some of 
the group’s principal management 
committees. 
Our people
Nick Salmon retired as a director at 
the AGM  on 25 July 2014 and at that 
time Mark Clare replaced him as senior 
independent director. We welcomed 
Stephen Carter to the board as an 
independent non-executive director 
and member of the audit committee 
on 1 September 2014.  On Stephen’s 
appointment, Mark Clare stepped 
down from the audit committee and 
was appointed as a member of the 
remuneration committee. 
Stephen brings to the board table 
a strong career in government and 
regulation, having held a number of 
public sector roles, including serving 
a term as the founding chief executive 
of Ofcom. He is currently group chief 
executive at Informa plc, a FTSE 250 
listed company. Further information on 
the process for Stephen’s appointment 
can be found in the report of the 
nomination committee on pages 68 to 
72.
We have maintained our target of 
at least 25 per cent of our board 
comprising of women, and in terms 
of diversity of experience, skills and 
personal attributes, we have great 
diversity around our board. Good 
board dynamics are vital to the proper 
interaction and working of a board 
of directors. Board directors need to 
work together effectively for the good 
of the company and, in short, they 
need to get on with each other; clashes 
of personality are to be avoided as 
they do not facilitate constructive 
debate and challenge and effective 
communication. 
Collectively, the directors have many 
years of experience gained across 
a variety of areas and industries. 
Some have spent part of their careers 
overseas, and whilst there is a huge 
diversity in their skills and experience, 
they have predominantly worked in 
regulated industries, as is appropriate.  
Around our board table, I believe we 
have individuals who will apply their 
skills and experience to the benefit 
of our business and speak up if they 
disagree but, equally, listen to the 
views of others. 
The focus of the group 
has been in the planning 
for UUW’s next five-
year regulatory period 
for 2015 to 2020 and 
endeavouring to ensure 
the long-term success 
of the company and the 
group for that period and 
beyond.

Corporate governance report
Letter from the Chairman
Although there are time constraints 
for non-executive directors who 
also have an executive role, these 
individuals bring valuable current 
market experience to any board table. 
Similarly, we encourage our executive 
directors to serve as a non-executive 
director elsewhere to help broaden 
their experience, although this is 
restricted to one other directorship in 
a company which does not conflict with 
United Utilities’ business.
Our CEO, Steve Mogford, has made 
some changes during the year to the 
structure of his executive team of 
senior managers. This has resulted in a 
change of reporting lines and a related 
change in the male:female ratios of the 
executive team (excluding the CEO and 
CFO) of 4:3, (2014: 5:5). 
Our ethos and culture
One of our key core values, both at 
board level and as a company, is to 
act with integrity, by applying the 
highest standards of responsible 
business practice. The company has 
complied with the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code in accordance with 
the FCA ’s Listing Rules with which we 
were required to comply for the year 
ended 31 March 2015. For the period 
from 25 July 2014 (on the retirement 
of Nick Salmon) until 1 September 
2014 (on the appointment of 
Stephen Carter), there were only two 
independent non-executives directors 
appointed to the remuneration 
committee,  notwithstanding the 
fact that the Code requires that 
three independent non-executive 
directors be appointed. During this 
time no meetings of the remuneration 
committee were scheduled or held and 
as a result we do not regard this as 
being an incident of non-compliance 
with the Code.   
Our approach to risk
We adopt a prudent approach to 
the way we manage the risks to our 
business; we feel this is appropriate 
for an organisation such as ours 
that provides a vital service to 
its customers, and is an approach 
that permeates the culture of our 
business. That being said, we are a 
commercial organisation operating 
within a regulated framework, and 
accepting some level of risk is a 
normal consequence of doing business. 
It is the board’s and the executive 
team’s role to understand the risks 
associated with each activity of the 
business and that actions are taken 
to mitigate these risks as they feel 
appropriate. The greatest risk to our 
business is ensuring that we get the 
constituent elements of our five-yearly 
business plans correct to ensure our 
financeability, and that they are agreed 
by Ofwat in its final determination, as 
we are bound by these plans for the 
following five-year period with limited 
opportunity to change them. 
Our investors
The remuneration committee, under 
Sara Weller’s leadership, has been 
instrumental in updating the executive 
directors’ remuneration packages to 
ensure they align the directors’ and 
senior managers’ interests with the 
long-term interests of the company 
and its shareholders. At the time the 
changes were introduced in 2013, 
the committee went to considerable 
effort to consult on the changes with 
a number of the company’s large 
investors. At the 2014 AGM, 98.48 
per cent of the vote was in favour of 
the directors’ remuneration policy and, 
although only an advisory vote, 99.39 
per cent of the votes cast were in 
favour of the directors’ remuneration 
report, which would suggest that our 
investors are comfortable with our 
approach to reward.
We welcome any feedback you may 
have on this annual report -

Governance structure for  
our board and our committees 
In line with the Code, the board delegates 
certain roles and responsibilities to its 
various principal board committees, as 
shown in the diagram  on page 64. Whilst 
the board retains overall responsibility, 
a sub-committee structure allows 
these committees to probe the subject 
matter more deeply and gain a greater 
understanding of the detail, and then 
report back to the board on the matters 
discussed. The reports of the principal 
board committees required by the Code 
can be found on the subsequent pages. 
Minutes of the board and principal 
committee meetings (with the exception 
of the remuneration committee) are 
tabled at board meetings and the chairs 
of each of the board committees verbally 
report to the board on their activities.
The executive team is chaired by the 
CEO, and its members are the senior 
managers who have a direct reporting 
line to the CEO. The executive team 
meets monthly and  is responsible for 
operational matters and implementing 
the strategies that the board has set, and 
the day-to-day running of the business. 
Short biographies of the executive 
team can be found on our website at 
corporate.unitedutilities.com/united-
utilities-executive-team
The structure chart shown on page 64 
also shows the principal management 
committees and a brief description of 
their roles. These committees enable 
senior management to understand and, 
if necessary, challenge the business in 
its interpretation of the implementation 
of the strategies the board has set. The 
board received reports from the CEO and 
CFO at every scheduled board meeting, 
providing the board with an updated 
overview of the business and its financial 
position.

Corporate governance report
Attendance at board and 
committee meetings
Eight scheduled board meetings were 
planned and held during the year 
(2014: eight). A number of other board 
meetings and telephone conferences 
were also held during the year, as the 
need arose. The table below shows 
the actual number of scheduled 
meetings attended and the maximum 
number of scheduled meetings which 
the directors could have attended.
As directors, our intention is always 
to attend all scheduled board 
and committee meetings; only in 
exceptional circumstances would we 
not do so. Similarly, every effort is 
made to attend ad hoc meetings either 
in person or via the use of video or 
telephone conferencing facilities if 
needs be. None of our non-executive 
directors have raised concerns over 
the time commitment required of them 
to fulfil their duties. 
On the evening before each scheduled 
board meeting all the non-executive 
directors meet together with the CEO; 
this time is usefully spent enabling us 
to share views and cross-check our 
understanding of certain issues.

Code principle: Effectiveness
Board evaluation
We engaged Lintstock Consultants 
(Lintstock) to undertake our external 
evaluation; they also conducted the 
external evaluation in 2012. Other 
than conducting the 2012 evaluation, 
Lintstock had no other connection with 
the company.
The process, facilitated and evaluated 
by Lintstock, was based on the 
completion of online questionnaires 
by board members addressing the 
performance of the board and its 
committees, the Chairman and 
individual directors.
In addition to board members, other 
members of the executive team 
who regularly attend and support 
committee meetings were asked to 
complete the same questionnaires. 
The anonymity of all respondents was 
ensured throughout the process in 
order to encourage an open and frank 
exchange of views. The results were 
then analysed by Lintstock;  were 
then discussed with the Chairman, 
the chair of the relevant committee, 
and the company secretary; tabled at 
a meeting of the relevant committee; 
and then presented to the board.

A summary of Lintstock’s analysis of the 2014/15 evaluation is as follows:
Board composition and 
expertise
Board members’ skills and expertise were felt to be appropriate, and in particular the 
board members’ knowledge and understanding of the regulatory environment the company 
operates within, along with their understanding of the views of regulators, customers and 
investors.
Board agenda The allocation of time spent on the key strategic issues of the price review during the year 
was appropriate as were the other topics devoted to board discussion. With the completion 
of the price review, more time could now be allocated to address the advent of further 
market reform and competition in the sector.
Board support Presentations to the board and the timeliness of board documentation were appropriate, 
although improvements could be made to the content and format of papers. The support 
and training needs of board members continued to be addressed.
Wider strategic oversight The involvement of the board in the development of the strategic direction of the group was 
considered to be appropriate. The board would consider what improvements could be made 
to the format of the board strategy day.
Risk management and 
internal control
The board’s approach to the management of risk was considered to be appropriate, with 
suggestions being made to refine the management and oversight of risk overall.
Succession planning and 
human resource management
Board members felt that the senior management structure and the succession planning for 
executive and key management positions supported the strategic objectives. The visibility 
by the board of potential internal candidates for succession should be maintained and 
enhanced.
Committees The composition and performance of the audit, remuneration, nomination, corporate 
responsibility and treasury committees were considered to be appropriate.
Individual directors The individual performance of the directors was assessed; all of which were considered to 
be effective and all directors demonstrated the expected level of commitment to the role. 
The review of the Chairman’s performance, led by the senior independent director and that 
of Catherine Bell concluded that both continued to demonstrate an independent approach, 
notwithstanding they had each served in excess of six years as a director.
The internal evaluation conducted in 2013/14 identified the following actions:
•	 There was a need to improve further the visibility and engagement of the executive team and a wide range of senior 
managers with the board and provide more opportunities for such engagement; and
•	 Maintain the strong focus on succession planning for executives and those in critical posts in the talent pipeline.
Whilst progress has undoubtedly been made during the year, these are enduring themes which will continue to be pursued.
Training
Specific training has been provided to the directors during the year on a number of areas including regulatory matters 
and changes in reporting and governance requirements and their responsibilities in accordance with the Goods Vehicles 
(Licensing of Operators) Act 1995. On the appointment as a director to the UUG and/or the UUW board, directors receive 
information on the key duties of being a director of a regulated water company including the role of the regulated company’s 
holding company. This information is kept continually under review.

Dear shareholder,
We have, for the fourth successive 
year, undertaken the recruitment of 
a new non-executive director, which 
culminated in the appointment of 
Stephen Carter to the board on 
1 September 2014. 
We feel as we move forward into 
a new regulatory period that our 
directors have an excellent mix of 
skills and experience for leading the 
company into the new five-year period. 
The combination of relatively new 
directors, coupled with those that have 
served for a number of years, provides 
us with the benefit of new ideas, whilst 
not losing sight of what has gone in 
the past. We have maintained a 25 per 
cent gender diversity ratio, and the 
board gender diversity policy is taken 
into account during every candidate 
selection process. Ultimately, we strive 
to appoint the person we believe is 
best matched to the role in terms of 
what they have to offer the company 
and to make a positive contribution 
to the board conversation and board 
dynamics.
With the retirement of Nick Salmon, 
Mark Clare took over the role of senior 
independent director. When Stephen 
Carter joined the board he replaced 
Mark Clare as a member of the audit 
committee and Mark joined the 
remuneration committee.

What has been on the committee’s 
agenda during the year
1. Board succession
The committee:
•	 considered the succession 
requirements of the board; 
•	 appointed executive search 
consultants Russell Reynolds 
Associates (Russell Reynolds) to 
begin the process of the recruitment 
of a non-executive director and 
provided a brief to Russell Reynolds  
setting out the attributes of a 
preferred candidate; 
•	 considered and reviewed the long list 
of candidates and identified those to 
be shortlisted for interview initially 
with the Chairman, CEO and the 
business services director. A number 
of candidates were then invited to 
meet with the other non-executive 
directors and the CFO; and 
•	 discussed the candidates and the 
‘best fit’ with the skills matrix (as 
shown below); took into account 
the board diversity policy and 
the specification provided to the 
executive search consultants; 
and duly made a recommendation 
to the board to appoint Stephen 
Carter as the successful candidate. 
Stephen brings to the board table 
a strong career in government and 
regulation, having held a number 
of public sector roles including 
serving a term as the founding chief 
executive of Ofcom. He is currently 
group chief executive at Informa plc, 
a FTSE 250 listed company. 
Russell Reynolds is a signatory to the 
voluntary code of conduct on gender 
diversity for executive search firms; it has 
no other connection with the group other 
than being used on previous occasions for 
executive search purposes.
2. Refreshing the membership of 
the principal committees
Nick Salmon’s departure from the 
board left a vacancy on each of the 
board’s principal committees. 
The conclusion was reached that this 
provided us with an opportunity to 
switch Mark Clare to the remuneration 
committee and to appoint Stephen 
Carter to the audit committee given 
his familiarity with the role of the 
audit committee from his time as a 
non-executive director at Informa 
plc. Stephen was also appointed as a 
member of the corporate responsibility 
committee.
3. Board diversity
We have retained the 25 per cent 
gender diversity ratio on our board, in 
accordance with our board diversity 
policy, and the recruitment process for 
a new non-executive director was in 
line with the policy in terms of gender 
diversity. Of the 10 candidates in the 
long list, two were female, and of the 
shortlist of four, one was female.

Gaining an insight into the 
culture of the company
How has your induction process 
so far been insightful?
My induction has provided a 
reassuring window into the 
company’s culture. It has been 
thorough, detailed, professional 
and enjoyable. At all levels within 
the business, I have been met with 
individuals committed to delivering 
for their customers, open to change, 
and excited about the future of this 
industry. 
Have your perceptions of United 
Utilities changed since you 
joined the board?
Like many people, I associate 
water and wastewater services 
with a simple turn of the tap or 
flush of the loo! The deeper I 
delve into the business, gaining a 
greater understanding of what lies 
behind the service delivery, the 
commitment to the environment, 
and the large capital demands 
placed on a business like United 
Utilities, the more I recognise the 
importance of a clear strategy, 
effective leadership and a coherent 
board providing oversight and 
constructive challenge.
In what way do you think you 
can best share your previous 
experience with United Utilities?
My experiences in technology 
industries and in regulation 
are directly relevant to United 
Utilities, today and even more so 
in the future. We are seeing the 
ever-increasing deployment of 
monitoring technology, increasingly 
demanding customers, both 
in business and residentially, 
and critically, a new regulatory 
landscape emerging across the 
water industry.
Having seen and participated 
in major regulatory change in 
another industry that was broadly 
successful and helped deliver, 
in both telecommunications and 
media, real investment, innovation 
and significant price reductions, 
I recognise the importance of 
ensuring that the incentives and 
the level of return are right for both 
consumers and the industry.
Finally, as CEO of a business that is 
facing a different set of challenges, 
but many the same, I hope to be able 
to contribute another perspective 
on leadership and strategy to the 
executive team.
Q&A - Stephen Carter
Whilst the committee was mindful of 
the benefits of gender diversity, it was 
felt that Stephen was the strongest 
candidate and had the most relevant 
experience.
We are keen to develop our female 
senior managers so that, over time, 
they can be considered for board 
appointments at United Utilities or as 
potential candidates for non-executive 
directorships in other companies. We 
believe a non-executive appointment 
provides an excellent opportunity for 
both personal and career development 
and is a way of gaining valuable 
experience that may be applied at 
United Utilities.
As is the case in many UK companies, 
certain activities remain more widely 
populated by men (e.g. in operational 
and engineering activities) or women 
(e.g. customer contact centre roles and 
support services). United Utilities is 
no exception, but we are continuing our 
activities to try and address gender 
imbalances at all levels and in all areas 
of our business. 
Summary of board 
diversity policy
Ensure the selection process for 
board candidates provides access 
to a range of candidates, although 
any appointments will be made on 
the basis of equal merit but with due 
regard for the benefits of diversity 
on the board, including gender 
diversity
Ensure that the policies adopted by 
the group will, over time, promote 
gender diversity among senior 
managers who will in turn aspire to a 
board position
In selecting candidates for board 
positions, only use the services of 
executive search firms who have 
signed up to the voluntary code of 
conduct for executive search firms 
as recommended by Lord Davies
Adopt measurable objectives from 
time to time for achieving gender 
diversity at board level – which shall 
currently be to maintain at least 25 
per cent female representation

Improving gender diversity across the talent pool
Our graduate scheme continues to be successful in 
attracting female applicants. This year the number of 
female graduates offered roles with United Utilities 
increased to 42 per cent. The overall number of female 
graduates on the scheme has also increased from 35 per 
cent to 39 per cent.
In 2014, there was a 34 per cent increase in female 
applications to our apprentice scheme and an overall 
increase in the number of female apprentices joining the 
company. The 2014 intake was 25 per cent female and our 
overall apprentice population is now 14 per cent female. 
This is above the national industry average of seven per 
cent.  Research from the Sector Skills Council for Science, 
Engineering and Manufacturing T echnologies shows the 
average number of women in apprenticeships is between 
five and seven per cent.
In our executive team of nine (including the CEO and 
CFO), three are women, namely Sue Amies-King (business 
retail director), Sally Cabrini  (business services director) 
and Gaynor Kenyon (corporate affairs director). We are 
actively working with these individuals on their personal 
development plans, which include building their external 
portfolio. 
Women hold 23 per cent of senior leadership positions. 
For this group, we actively support their individual 
personal development plans, which include encouraging 
them to broaden their external network. We have run 
a number of successful events for our female talent 
population, including an Army leadership day. Gary 
Dixon, our domestic retail director and a member of our 
executive team, is the executive sponsor of our diversity 
activities. 
This year we have launched our women’s network and a 
number of our senior managers have hosted events and 
explained how they have developed their own careers 
and overcome barriers. In addition, we have invited guest 
speakers from external organisations to share their 
career experiences. This has inspired the group to set up a 
self-managed women’s network group.
We have an active partnership with the Energy and 
Efficiency Industrial Partnership (EEIP) which has enabled 
us to leverage initiatives which align and support our 
diversity plans.
A great example of this is Charlotte Cottam, one of our 
female apprentices who we have nominated to support an 
EEIP skills social media campaign to promote employment 
opportunities  in  the utility sector to girls. 
This campaign was launched at the opening of our  Bolton 
training and technology centre by the then Employment 
Minister, Esther McVey. Charlotte was interviewed by 
media sources who then promoted her story in National 
Apprentice Week. All of our apprentices are supported by a 
senior manager as part of their career development with us.
“What appealed to me about United 
Utilities is that it’s such an important 
company. We’re always going to need 
water – it’s a vital commodity. I love 
being employed in a sector that I know 
has a long-term future. ”
Charlotte Cottam, apprentice engineer, working  
with the team looking after our sewer network  
on Merseyside
We have widened our diversity focus and we have 
joined Race for Opportunity (RfO), part of Business in 
the Community and the leading organisation for ethnic 
diversity and inclusion.
In 2014, we participated in the RfO benchmarking survey 
which assesses the effectiveness of our policies and 
processes across recruitment, development, leadership, 
pay, and customer and supplier management. We achieved 
a bronze award. Our aspiration to improve our score in 
2015 is underpinned by an action plan.
The employee-run lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
network has recently been relaunched, and  a number of 
employee events are being planned for 2015.
What have we done in 2014/15?

Corporate governance report
Nomination committee
Jo Matzen, who has a degree in 
Biomedical Science, has worked for 
United Utilities for 20 years. 
She started her career as a business 
analyst and has successfully 
progressed through a range of 
operational and technical roles. 
Three years ago she was selected 
for one of the newly created area 
business manager (ABM) roles which 
form a key part of our operating 
model. 
As an ABM, Jo is accountable for the 
effective and efficient delivery of 
the wastewater operations and asset 
planning across the Merseyside 
area. Within Jo’s patch is Liverpool 
wastewater treatment works 
situated on the banks of the River 
Mersey. The facility has recently 
been refurbished and is in the 
process of being extended at a cost 
of around £200 million. Construction 
work is well underway; treated 
water leaving the new plant will be 
cleaner and greener, helping the 
continuing rejuvenation of the River 
Mersey and ensuring that it meets 
strict European standards for water 
quality. 
Jo has actively mentored many 
colleagues at United Utilities 
throughout her time at the company 
and she continues to be committed 
to supporting others in developing 
their careers. 
Jo says: “I thoroughly enjoy 
working for United Utilities and am 
extremely proud to work in such a 
vital service industry. ”

4. Conflicts of interest
The company’s articles of association 
contain provisions which permit 
unconflicted directors to authorise 
conflict situations. Each director is 
required to notify the Chairman of any 
potential conflict, and the board reviews 
the position of each director annually. 
No changes were recorded which would 
impact the independence of any of the 
directors.
5. Wider succession and talent 
management
As part of succession planning a number 
of changes were made to the membership 
of the executive team. The membership 
as a whole was reduced to nine (2014:12) 
including the CEO and CFO, with a ratio of 
six males to three females.
Pictured: Members of our female leadership 
talent pool taking part in a team building 
day with the Army at Fulwood Barracks in

a range of leadership, communication and 
problem solving skills, all of which will be 
invaluable in their roles as future leaders of 
our business.

Corporate governance report
Code principle: 
Relations with shareholders
The board as a whole accepts its 
responsibility for engaging with 
shareholders and is kept fully informed 
about information in the marketplace 
including:
•	 Makinson Cowell produces an annual 
survey of investors’ views and 
perceptions about United Utilities, 
the results of which are presented 
and discussed by the board;
•	 the board receives regular updates 
and feedback on activities within 
investor relations and reports from 
sector analysts to ensure that the 
board maintains an understanding 
of investors’ priorities; and
•	 the board welcomes engagement 
with institutional investors. The 
executive and non-executive 
directors are available to meet with 
major shareholders; in fact, this 
is one of the specific roles of the 
senior independent director.
Institutional investors 
We are always keen to hear the views 
of and engage with our shareholders 
and investors and we have an active 
investor relations programme. The 
activities of the programme include:
•	 the CEO and CFO have a regular 
schedule of meetings with 
representatives from major 
shareholders. This is supplemented 
with meetings hosted by our 
investor relations team. During the 
year, the programme covered over 
100 institutions based in the UK, 
Europe, North America and Asia 
Pacific region;
•	 the CEO and CFO undertake 
presentations to groups of 
institutional shareholders and 
investors, both on an ad hoc basis 
and linked to our half and full year 
results announcements;
•	 the board receives regular feedback 
on the views of its institutional 
investors following on from the CEO 
and CFO’s meetings;
•	 close contact is also maintained 
between the investor relations team 
and a range of City analysts that 
research United Utilities; and
•	 in total, we met or offered to 
meet with 39 per cent by value 
of the overall shareholder base, 
which represents 72 per cent 
of the targetable institutional 
shareholder base (when adjusting 
for shareholders who do not 
typically meet with companies, such 
as indexed funds).
In meetings with investors, frequent 
areas of common interest include 
operational and environmental 
performance, customer service, capital 
investment, efficiency initiatives 
and regulatory outperformance. 
Investors are always keen to observe 
financial stability, and investors are 
interested in the level of gearing 
versus regulatory assumptions, cost 
of finance, debt portfolio and maturity 
profile, future financing requirements 
and dividends. The outcome of the 
price review, covering the 2015–20 
period, was also a key area of interest 
for them. Looking ahead, investors 
will be keen to understand how the 
company is performing relative to the 
price review allowances and targets.
Retail shareholders
Despite the privatisation process being 
over 25 years ago, we have retained 
a large number of shareholders with 
registered addresses in the North West 
of England – in fact around 41 per cent. 
We have historically always held our 
AGM in Manchester, which enables our 
more local shareholders to attend the 
meeting. These shareholders are also 
our customers.
There is a considerable amount 
of information on our website, 
including our online report which 
provides information on our key 
social and environmental impacts and

Relations with other providers  
of capital 
Running a water and wastewater 
business, by its very nature, requires 
a long-term outlook. Our regulatory 
cycle is based on five-year periods, 
and we raise associated funding in 
order to build and improve our water 
and wastewater treatment works and 
associated network of pipes for each 
five-year cycle. We are heavily reliant 
on successfully acquiring long-term 
funding from banks and debt capital 
markets to fund our capital investment 
programme. 
This requires a long-term commitment 
and involvement from our credit 
investors who lend us the funds with 
the company paying them a return for 
doing so. We arrange term debt finance 
in the bond markets (with maturities 
typically ranging from seven years to 
up to 50 years at issue). Debt finance 
is raised via the group’s London listed 
multi-issuer Euro Medium Term Note 
Programme, which gives us access 
to the sterling and euro public bond 
markets. Committed credit facilities 
are arranged with various relationship 
banks on a bilateral basis. Additionally, 
the European Investment Bank (EIB), 
which is the financing arm of the 
European Union, is our single biggest 
lender, currently providing circa £1.9 
billion of term funding (of which circa 
£1.5 billion has been advanced and 
£400 million remains available to draw 
down) used to support our capital 
investment programme. The group 
currently has gross borrowings of 
£6,645 million.

Code principle: Accountability
Board’s approach to risk 
management and internal control
The board is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the risks that it 
is willing to take to achieve its strategic 
objectives. The board is also responsible 
for ensuring that the company’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems are effectively managed across 
the business and that they receive an 
appropriate level of scrutiny and board 
time.
The group’s risks are predominantly 
those of all regulated water and 
wastewater companies. One of the 
most significant is that of failing to 
achieve our regulatory performance 
targets or failing to fulfil our 
obligations in any five-year planning 
cycle, leading potentially to the 
imposition of fines and penalties. 
2014/15 has been an important 
year for the company in managing 
this risk as this year we submitted 
our business plan to Ofwat for the 
2015–20 period. The board engaged 
fully with the process to ensure the 
plan’s robustness so that, having 
received the final determination, we 
are confident that the business can be 
managed within the parameters of the 
determination for the next five-year 
cycle.
The board, following the review by the 
audit committee,  concluded that it 
was appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting. Similarly,  
and as will be required in future 
years in applying the principles of the 
2014 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the 2014 Code), 
the board concluded, following a 
recommendation from the audit 
committee, that it was appropriate to 
provide a long-term viability statement 
(both statements are set out on page 
75). Assurance supporting these 
statements was provided by the review 
of: the group’s key financial measures; 
the key credit financial ratios; the 
group’s liquidity and UUW’s ongoing 
ability to meet its financial covenants; 
and the contingent liabilities of the 
group. 
As part of the assurance process, 
the board also took into account the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the company, and the actions taken to 
mitigate those risks. These principal 
risks and uncertainties are detailed 
on pages 52 and 55, as are the risk 
management processes and structures 
used to monitor and manage them. 
Biannually, the board receives a report 
detailing management’s assessment 
of the most significant risks facing 
the company. The report gives an 
indication of the level of exposure, 
subject to the mitigating controls in 
place, for the risk profile of the group. 
The board also receives information 
during the year from the treasury 
committee (to which the board has 
delegated matters of a treasury 
nature – see the structure diagram 
on page 64) including such matters 
as liquidity policy, the group’s capital 
funding requirements and interest rate 
management. 
Review of the effectiveness of 
the risk management and internal 
control systems
Taking into account the information 
on principal risks and uncertainties 
provided on pages 54 and 55, and the 
ongoing work of the audit committee 
in monitoring the risk management 
and internal control systems on 
behalf of the board (and for whom the 
committee provides regular updates, 
see pages 80 and 81), the board:
•	 is satisfied that it has carried 
out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the company, 
including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; 
and
•	 has reviewed the effectiveness of 
the risk management and internal 
control systems including all 
material financial, operational and 
compliance controls (including those 
relating to the financial reporting 
process) and no significant failings 
or weaknesses were identified.
In the review of  the 
effectiveness of risk 
management and internal 
controls systems the 
board also took into 
account the:
•	 biannual review of significant 
risks;
•	 oversight of treasury matters;
•	 reviewing and assessing the 
activities of internal audit and 
the external assessment of its 
activities;
•	 reviewing management’s 
internal control self-
assessment;
•	 reviewing  reports from the 
GARB; 
•	 reviewing the outcome of 
annual business unit risk 
assessment process; and
•	 reviewing the corporate risk 
management framework.

Going concern basis of accounting 
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the group has 
adequate resources for a period of 
at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements 
and have therefore assessed that the 
going concern basis of accounting is 
appropriate in preparing the financial 
statements and that there are no 
material uncertainties to disclose.
This conclusion is based on a review of 
the resources available to the group, 
taking account of the group’s financial 
projections together with available 
cash and committed borrowing 
facilities as well as consideration 
of the group’s capital adequacy, 
consideration of the primary legal duty 
of UUW’s economic regulator to ensure 
that water and wastewater companies 
can finance their functions, and any 
material uncertainties. In reaching this 
conclusion, the board has considered 
the magnitude of potential impacts 
resulting from uncertain future events 
or changes in conditions, the likelihood 
of their occurrence and the likely 
effectiveness of mitigating actions 
that the directors would consider 
undertaking.
Long term viability statement 
The directors have assessed the 
viability of the group over a five-year 
period to March 2020, taking account 
of the group’s current position and 
the potential impact of the principal 
risks documented in the strategic 
report. Based on this assessment, 
the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to March 2020.
In making this statement the directors 
have considered the resilience of the 
group, taking account of its current 
position, the principal risks facing 
the business in severe but reasonable 
scenarios, and the effectiveness of any 
mitigating actions. This assessment 
has considered the potential impacts 
of these risks on the business model, 
future performance, solvency and 
liquidity over the period. 
The directors have determined that 
the five-year period to March 2020 
is an appropriate period over which 
to provide its viability statement. In 
making their assessment, the directors 
have taken account of the group’s 
robust capital solvency position 
with a debt to RCV ratio of around 
60 per cent, its ability to raise new 
finance in most market conditions, 
its key potential mitigating action of 
restricting dividend payments and 
the protections which exist under the 
regulatory model that a primary legal 
duty of UUW’s economic regulator is 
to ensure that water and wastewater 
companies can finance their functions.
Code principle: Remuneration
Our remuneration policy has been 
designed in order to promote the 
long-term success of the company.

committee can be found on pages 84

*The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014.
Dear shareholder,
It has been another year of evolution for 
the work of audit committees, with the 
publication by the FRC of the 2014 version 
of the Code and the publication by the 
Competition and Markets Authority of the 
Statutory Audit Services Order 2014*.  
At the request of the board, the audit 
committee (‘the committee’) has considered 
the new requirements.  
We are not required to report against the  
2014 Code until our next financial year . 
However , we decided that it was appropriate 
for the board to provide the long-term 
viability statement (see page 75) applying 
the principles of the 2014 Code, given the 
long-term nature of our business.  For the 
2015/16 financial year the committee’s 
terms of reference have been amended 
to reflect the 2014 Code requirements, 
and we are committed to ensuring that 
the committee’s agenda is kept under 
review and keeps abreast of relevant 
developments.
There have been a number of changes 
during the year to the membership of 
the committee. As planned, Nick Salmon 
stood down at the AGM in July 2014 and 
Stephen Carter joined the board and the 
committee on 1 September 2014. I am 
pleased to welcome Stephen as a member 
of the committee, his views and previous 
experience will add considerable breadth 
of knowledge to the committee. On Nick 
leaving, Mark Clare replaced him on the 
remuneration committee, stepping down 
from the audit committee on 1 September 
2014. Although Mark’s time on the 
committee was relatively short, I would like 
to thank him for his valuable contribution. 
Although audit committees have specific 
responsibilities rooted in reviewing the 
group’s financial statements and reviewing 
the internal assurance work and external 
audit of those financial statements, the 
committee also reviews the internal 
control and risk management processes, 
leaving the review of the significant risks 
to be undertaken by the board. A lot of 
the work of the committee is necessarily 
targeted at the regulated activities of 
UUW , which represents over 98 per cent of 
group revenues. This is a reflection of our 
commitment to safeguarding the interests 
of our customers; all the members of the 
committee are also independent non-
executive directors of UUW . Details of the 
committee’s activities over the past year are 
set out on the opposite page.
We have again worked to enhance this 
report and make it more informative for the 
reader and we continue to be committed 
to providing meaningful disclosure of the 
committee’s activities. 
The following report was approved by the 
committee at its meeting held on 14 May 
2015.

What has been on the committee’s 
agenda during the year 
In addition to fulfilling its ongoing 
duties, the committee has an extensive 
agenda of items addressing issues 
relating to the day-to-day activities 
of the business which it deals with in 
conjunction with senior management, 
the auditor, the internal audit function 
and the financial reporting team. There 
were four scheduled meetings of the 
committee during the year. Items on 
the agenda included:
•	 considering the issues and findings 
brought to the committee’s 
attention by the internal audit 
team and satisfying itself that 
management has resolved or is 
in the process of resolving any 
outstanding issues or concerns;
•	 reviewing the assurance work 
undertaken by internal audit relating 
to: the content of the regulatory 
business plan and the processes 
supporting the preparation of the 
plan; and the annual regulatory 
reports;
•	 reviewing the reports from the 
financial reporting team on the 
financial statements, including the 
UUW financial statements and other 
regulatory reports, and considering 
matters such as the accounting 
judgements and policies being 
applied; 
•	 reviewing the audit reports from 
KPMG on the financial statements 
and tasking management to resolve 
any issues relating to internal controls 
and risk management systems;
•	 reviewing the going concern 
and longer term viability 
assessments prior to making its 
recommendations to the board;
•	 annual review and approval of 
the policy on non-audit services 
provided by the auditor including 
the continued use during 2014/15 
of Makinson Cowell (now owned by 
KPMG);
•	 monitoring incidents of 
whistleblowing and fraud reporting;
•	 biannual oversight and monitoring 
of the group’s compliance with the 
Bribery Act which the board reviews 
annually; 
•	 overseeing and approving the 
strategic internal audit planning 
approach;
•	 an externally facilitated review of 
the quality and effectiveness of 
internal audit; and
•	 reviewing the committee’s terms 
of reference and the conclusions of 
the committee’s annual evaluation. 
The externally facilitated evaluation 
was undertaken as part of the 
overall board evaluation (see page 
66). The review explored: time 
management and the composition 
of the committee; the committee’s 
processes and support; and the 
agenda and work of the committee. 
It was concluded that the committee 
was effective.
How we assessed whether ‘the 
annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides 
the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess 
the company’s position and 
performance, business model and 
strategy’ 
The committee, further to the board’s 
request, has reviewed the annual 
report and financial statements with 
the intention of providing advice to 
the board on whether, as required 
by the Code, ‘the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy’ . 
To make this assessment, all members 
of the committee received copies 
of the annual report and financial 
statements to review early in the 
drafting process to ensure that the 
key messages being followed in the 
annual report were aligned with the 
company’s position, performance 
and strategy being pursued; and that 
the narrative sections of the annual 
report were consistent with the 
financial statements. The significant 
issues considered by the committee 
in relation to the financial statements 
were consistent with those identified 
by the external auditor in their report 
on pages 114 to 117.
The main responsibilities of the 
committee are:
•	 to make a recommendation to 
the board for the appointment 
or reappointment of the auditor, 
and to be responsible for the 
tender of the audit from time to 
time and to agree the fees paid 
to the auditor;
•	 to establish policies for the 
provision of any non-audit 
services by the auditor;
•	 to review the scope and the 
results of the annual audit 
and report to the board on 
the effectiveness of the 
audit process and how the 
independence and objectivity 
of the auditor has been 
safeguarded;
•	 to review the half-year and 
annual financial statements and 
any announcements relating to 
financial performance, including 
reporting to the board on the 
significant issues considered by 
the committee in relation to the 
financial statements and how 
these were addressed; 
•	 to review the scope, remit and 
effectiveness of the internal 
audit function and the group’s 
internal control and risk 
management systems; 
•	 to review the group’s 
procedures for whistleblowing, 
reporting fraud and other 
inappropriate behaviour and to 
receive reports relating thereto; 
and
•	 to report to the board on 
how it has discharged its 
responsibilities.

Corporate governance report
Audit committee
The presentation of the company’s 
business model (on pages 14 to 19) 
has been reformatted to make it 
more  understandable for the reader 
and there are clear linkages to the 
company’s strategic objectives 
throughout the document.
The committee concluded that the key 
performance indicators (KPIs) included 
in the strategic report (see pages 
32 and 33) were, amongst others, 
those used by management and, for 
consistency and comparative purposes, 
should be retained unamended (other 
than to reflect regulatory reporting 
changes) up until the 31 March 2015 
financial year-end. As is described 
on page 51 of the strategic report, 
management have refined the KPIs 
used for 2015–20 reflecting the new 
measures to be monitored by Ofwat 
during that period. 
In addition, the committee was 
satisfied that all the key events and 
issues which had been reported to 
the board in the CEO’s monthly report 
during the year, both good and bad, 
had been adequately referenced or 
reflected within the annual report. 
How we assessed the effectiveness 
of the external audit process
The committee, on behalf of the board, 
is responsible for the relationship with 
the external auditor, and part of that 
role is to examine the effectiveness of 
the audit process. 
Audit quality is a key requirement. 
Prior to the statutory audit at the half-
year, KPMG presented the strategy 
and scope of the audit for the financial 
year, highlighting any areas requiring 
special consideration. KPMG then 
reported against this audit scope at 
subsequent committee meetings. 
On completion of the audit at the full-
year, all members of the committee, 
as well as key members of the senior 
management team, were required to 
complete a questionnaire seeking their 
views on how well KPMG performed 
the year-end audit. The views of the 
respondents was sought in respect of: 
the robustness of the audit process; 
the quality of the delivery of the 
audit; the expertise of the audit team 
conducting the audit and that the 
degree of professional scepticism 
applied by the auditor was appropriate; 
the quality of the service they gave; 
and their views on the quality of 
the interaction between the audit 
partner and audit manager and the 
company. The feedback was collated 
and presented to the committee’s 
meeting in November 2014, at which 
the conclusions were discussed and 
any opportunities for improvement 
brought to the attention of the 
external auditor.
Private meetings are held at each 
committee meeting between the audit 
committee and the representatives 
of the external auditor without 
management being present in order 
to encourage open and transparent 
feedback by both parties. The 
committee was satisfied that the 
overall external audit process and 
services provided by KPMG were 
effective.
How we assessed the 
independence of our external 
auditor
There are two aspects to the auditor 
independence test that the committee 
monitors.
First, in accordance with the Auditing 
Practices Board Ethical Standards, 
KPMG has to implement rules and 
requirements such that none of its 
employees working on our audit can 
hold any shares in United Utilities 
Group PLC. KPMG is also required 
to tell us about any significant facts 
and matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on its independence or 
on the objectivity of the lead partner 
and the audit team. The lead partner 
must change every five years and the 
quality review partner, who reviews the 
judgements of the audit team actually 
doing the audit, rotates every seven 
years along with the key audit partner. 
Secondly, the committee considers 
and approves all the fees that it 
pays for audit, audit-related and 
non-audit services from KPMG. 
KPMG is prohibited from providing 
certain services to the group, such 
as operational consulting, internal 
audit services and strategic planning 
support, as it is felt that these 
types of services could impede their 
independence. Furthermore, auditor 
independence is also safeguarded 
by limiting the value of non-audit 
services performed by the external 
auditor which should not ordinarily 
exceed 100 per cent of the audit 
fee. The committee has discretion in 
exceptional circumstances or where 
a compelling commercial justification 
can be provided for this cap on non-
audit fees to be exceeded. The CFO can 
pre-approve expenditure in respect 
of non-audit services, such as tax 
compliance work of up to £100,000 (as 
was the figure for the year ended 31 
March 2015) thereafter, any fees for 
non-audit services up to 100 per cent  
of the audit fee cap can be approved by 
the committee chair. Any such fees are 
reviewed and, if appropriate, ratified 
by the committee.
For a number of years, the group 
has engaged the consultancy firm 
Makinson Cowell to provide it with 
investment research and advice. As 
reported in the 31 March 2014 annual 
report, Makinson Cowell was acquired 
by KPMG in June 2013, therefore the 
fees paid to Makinson Cowell are 
included in the total of ‘other non-audit  
services’ paid to KPMG (see the bar 
chart on page 79). As part of the annual 
review by the committee of the non-
audit services policy the engagement 
of Makinson Cowell was considered. 
The committee took into account the 
board’s satisfaction with the services 
provided by Makinson Cowell and 
concluded that it was appropriate for 
their services to be retained  for the 
year ended 31 March 2015. 
As part of UUW’s licence conditions 
it is required to prepare audited 
regulatory accounts, which are 
derived from the statutory financial 
statements. Given the audit of the 
statutory financial statements is 
already undertaken by KPMG, there are 
efficiencies and cost savings if KPMG 
also audits the regulatory accounts. 
Fees paid to KPMG also include audit 
related services in relation to UUW 
regulatory assurance work as shown in 
the bar chart opposite.

Taking into account our findings in 
relation to the effectiveness of the 
audit process and in relation to the 
independence of KPMG, the committee 
was satisfied that KPMG continues 
to be independent, and free from 
any conflicting interest with the 
group. As a result, the committee 
recommended to the board that KPMG 
be proposed for reappointment at the 
forthcoming AGM in July 2015. There 
are no contractual obligations that 
restrict the committee’s choice of 
external auditor and no auditor liability 
agreement has been entered into.
Audit tender
The external audit was last 
competitively tendered in March 
2011 when KPMG was appointed and 
completed the audit for the year ended 
31 March 2012. The committee has 
considered the final Statutory Audit 
Services Order 2014 published by the 
Competition and Markets Authority 
which came into effect on  
1 January 2015. The committee’s terms 
of reference already provided for the 
competitive tender of the external 
audit contract every 10 years, and for 
the committee to be responsible for 
overseeing the tender process and 
agreeing the scope of the audit, but 
they have been amended to reflect that 
the committee shall be responsible 
for agreeing the audit fee and the 
appointment of the audit engagement 
partner. Terms of reference can be 
found at corporate.unitedutilities.
com/corporate-governance. 
The committee is also mindful of the 
EU Audit Directive and Regulation of 
the Audit of Public Interest Entities 
on which the FRC has issued a 
consultation, the outcome of which 
was awaited at the time of writing this 
report.
Significant issues considered by 
the committee in relation to the 
financial statements and how 
these were addressed 
In relation to the group’s financial 
statements, the committee reviewed 
the following principal areas of 
judgement (as noted in the  
accounting policies): 
Capitalisation of fixed assets
Fixed assets represent a subjective 
area, particularly in relation to costs 
permitted for capitalisation and 
depreciation policy.
•	 The committee considered the 
capital overhead rate which 
management proposed to apply 
for the next five-year regulatory 
period. The capital overhead rate 
historically has been established at

regulatory period and is applied as a

to capital projects. Management 
explained the basis upon which the 
proposed capital overhead rate for 
the next five-year regulatory period 
had been determined and why it was 
considered an appropriate rate to

The committee challenged 
management over the factors which 
had been considered in determining 
the rate and its consistency against 
rates applied previously. In addition, 
the committee considered the 
views of KPMG, particularly that 
the proposed capital overhead rate 
was within the range used by other 
utility companies of which they were 
aware. The committee concluded 
that management had taken 
appropriate steps in determining 
the future rate to be applied.
•	 The committee requested that 
management provide it with an 
update on the implementation 
of a new reactive work order 
scheduling and settlement system 
and specifically the realisation of 
the financial reporting benefits the 
system would bring in automating 
the process and enhancing cost 
allocation accuracy. Management 
reported to the committee that in 
May 2014 functional changes had 
been successfully implemented. The 
committee noted the improvements 
resulting from the new system. 
Revenue recognition and allowance 
for doubtful receivables
Due to the nature of the group’s 
business, the extent to which revenue 
is recognised and doubtful customer 
debts are provided against is an 
area of considerable judgement and 
estimation.
•	 The committee considered the 
appropriateness of the existing 
revenue recognition policy which 
derecognises revenue for certain 
customers who have not paid their 
bills within a particular period of 
time. After reviewing cash collection 
history and practice, the committee 
concluded the revenue recognition 
policy was appropriate.

Corporate governance report
Audit committee
•	 The committee also questioned the 
current levels of doubtful debt and 
credit note provisioning (see note 
15 for more detail).  The committee 
challenged management over the 
adequacy of the overall levels of 
provisioning following these reviews 
and were satisfied that the resulting 
net debtor balance was appropriate.  
Provisions and contingencies
The group makes provisions for 
contractual and legal claims which 
by their nature are subjective and 
require management to arrive at a best 
estimate as to the probable outcomes 
and costs associated with each 
individual case.
•	 The committee received regular 
updates on new and existing claims 
being made against the group 
and the extent to which these 
have been provided for (see note 
20 for details). The committee 
focused their attention on the more 
significant items and discussed the 
judgements made by management in 
arriving at appropriate provisions in 
relation to these matters.
•	 Based on the facts behind each 
provision and taking account of 
any relevant legal advice that may 
have been received as well as the 
past experience of management 
in making such provisions and 
challenging where necessary the 
views taken by management and 
through the assurance provided 
by KPMG who cover these as part 
of their audit, the committee 
concluded that the provisions 
management had made were 
appropriate.
Retirement benefit obligations
The group’s defined benefit retirement 
schemes are an area of considerable 
judgement and the performance and 
position of which is sensitive to the 
assumptions made.
•	 The committee sought from 
management an understanding 
as to the factors which led to the 
significant improvement in the 
IAS19 net retirement benefit 
position during the period and noted 
that the scheme-specific funding 
basis had not been impacted by this 
volatility. Management presented 
an explanatory note (see page 
154) in order to communicate 
most effectively what is a complex 
area for the benefit of the group’s 
stakeholders. The committee was 
satisfied with the explanations 
provided by management 
and following a review of the 
explanatory note approved its 
inclusion in the financial statements.
•	 The committee reviewed the 
methodology and assumptions 
used in calculating the defined 
benefit scheme positions (see 
note A4 for more details). The 
committee employs the services 
of an external actuary to perform 
these calculations and determine 
the appropriate assumptions 
to make. The external actuary 
prepared a report showing how the 
assumptions applied compared 
to their client base and this was 
summarised for the committee’s 
information.  In addition, KPMG 
audit these assumptions and 
provide their own report showing 
how the assumptions applied 
compare against other companies. 
After considering the above, the 
committee concluded that the 
approach taken and assumptions 
made were appropriate and fairly 
balanced in determining the net 
retirement benefit surplus.
Derivative financial instruments
The group has a significant value 
of swap instruments, the valuation 
of which is based upon models 
which require certain judgements 
and assumptions to be made. The 
committee requires management to 
perform periodic checks to ensure that 
the model derived valuations agree 
back to third party valuations and that 
KPMG check a sample against their 
own valuation models. It was confirmed 
to the committee that such testing 
had been undertaken during the year 
and there were no significant issues 
identified.
Taxation
The committee considered the tax 
risks that the group faces and the key 
judgements made by management 
underpinning the provisions for 
potential tax liabilities and deferred 
tax assets. In addition, the committee 
took account of KPMG’s assessment of 
these provisions. Based on the above, 
the committee was satisfied with the 
judgements made by management.
The main features of the 
group’s internal controls and 
risk management systems are 
summarised below:
a. Internal audit function
The internal audit function is a key 
element of the group’s corporate 
governance framework. Its role is to 
provide independent and objective 
assurance advice and insight on 
governance, risk management and 
internal control to the audit committee, 
the board and to senior management.  
It supports the organisation’s vision 
and objectives by evaluating and 
assessing the effectiveness of risk 
management systems, business 
processes and internal controls.  
In addition to reviewing the 
effectiveness of these areas and 
reporting on aspects of the group’s 
compliance with them, internal audit 
makes recommendations to address 
any key issues and improve processes. 
Once any recommendations are agreed 
with management, it monitors their 
implementation and reports to the 
committee on progress made at every 
meeting.
A five-year strategic audit planning 
approach has been developed 
and adopted during the year. This 
facilitates a more efficient deployment 
of internal audit resource in providing 
assurance coverage over time across 
the whole business. Following approval 
by the audit committee, this strategic 
approach supports the annual audit 
plan, which is then endorsed by 
management, and which the committee 
also approves. The plan focuses the 
team’s work on those areas of greatest 
risk to the business. Building on the 
strategic planning approach, the

Stock Code: UU.
unitedutilities.com 
80 22027.04      4 June 2015 6:19 AM      Proof 4
development of the plan considers 
risk assessments, issues raised by 
management, prior audit findings 
and a cyclical review programme. 
The in-house team is expanded as 
and when required with additional 
resource sourced from external 
providers – primarily PwC at present. 
The committee keeps the relationship 
with PwC under review to ensure the 
independence of the internal audit 
function is maintained. In the course 
of its work, the internal audit function 
also liaises with the statutory auditor, 
discussing relevant aspects of their 
respective activities which ultimately 
supports the assurance provided to the 
audit committee and board. 
The effectiveness of the internal 
audit function’s work is continually 
monitored using a variety of inputs 
including the ongoing audit reports 
received, the audit committee’s 
interaction with the head of audit 
and risk, an annual review of the 
department’s internal quality 
assurance report, annual stakeholder 
surveys in which committee members 
also participate as well as any other 
periodic quality reporting requested. 
In addition, during 2015, the quality 
and effectiveness of the internal audit 
function was externally assessed. 
Following this assessment, the 
committee concluded that the internal 
audit function was effective and 
appropriate resources available as 
required. 
Internal audit, led by the head of 
audit and risk, covers the whole of the 
group’s activities and reports to the 
committee and functionally to the CFO. 
The head of audit and risk attends 
all scheduled meetings of the audit 
committee, and has the opportunity to 
raise any matters with the members 
of the committee at these meetings 
without the presence of management. 
He is also in regular contact with the 
chair of the committee outside of the 
committee meetings. 
b. Risk management systems 
The committee receives updates 
and reports from the head of audit 
and risk on activities relating to the 
company’s risk management systems 
and processes at every meeting. These 
are then reported to the board, as 
appropriate. The group designs its 
risk management activities in order 
to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve its strategic 
objectives.
The CFO has executive responsibility 
for risk management and is supported 
in this role by the head of audit and 
risk and the corporate risk manager 
and his team. The group audit and risk 
board (GARB) is a sub-committee of 
the executive team. The GARB meets 
quarterly and reviews the governance 
processes and the effectiveness and 
performance of these processes along 
with the identification of emerging 
trends and themes within and across 
the business. The work of the GARB 
then feeds into the information and 
assurance processes of the audit 
committee and into the board’s 
assessment of risk exposures and the 
strategies to manage these risks.
The annual business unit risk 
assessment process (BURA) seeks to 
identify how well risk management is 
embedded across the different teams 
in the business. The BURA involves 
a review of the effectiveness of the 
controls that each business unit has 
in place to mitigate risks relating to 
activities in their area of the business, 
to encourage the identification of new 
and emerging risks and generally to 
facilitate improvements in the way 
risks are managed. The outcome of 
the BURA process is communicated 
to the executive team and the board. 
This then forms the basis of the 
determination of the most significant 
risks that the company faces which are 
then reviewed by the board. During the 
year, new risk management software 
was developed  and is in the process of 
implementation across the business 
with a view to enhancing the company’s 
risk management process.
A five-year strategic 
audit planning approach 
has been developed and  
adopted to facilitate 
a more efficient 
deployment of internal 
audit resource in 
providing assurance.
c. Internal controls 
The committee reviews the group’s 
internal control systems and receives 
updates on the findings of internal 
audit’s investigations at every meeting, 
prior to reporting any significant 
matters to the board. Internal control 
systems are part of our ‘business as 
usual’ activities and are documented in 
the company’s internal control manual 
which covers financial, operational and 
compliance controls and processes. 
Internal control systems are the 
responsibility of the CFO, with the 
support of the GARB, the internal audit 
team and the financial control team, 
although the head of audit and risk and 
his team are directly accountable to 
the audit committee. 
Confirmation that the controls 
and processes are being adhered 
to throughout the business is the 
responsibility of managers, but is 
continually tested by the work of the 
internal audit team as part of its annual 
plan of work which the committee 
approves each year. Compliance 
with the internal control system is 
confirmed annually by the completion 
of a self-assessment checklist by 
senior managers in consultation with 
their teams. The results are then 
reviewed and audited by the internal 
audit team and reported to the 
committee.

Corporate governance report
Corporate responsibility committee
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to report on the work of 
the corporate responsibility committee 
(CRC) over the past 12 months. 
There have been a number of changes 
during the year to the membership of 
the committee. As planned, Nick Salmon 
stood down at the AGM in July 2014 and 
Stephen Carter joined the board and 
the committee on 1 September 2014. 
I am pleased to welcome Stephen as a 
member of the committee. His views 
and previous experience on corporate 
responsibility issues in other businesses 
have added valuable perspective to the 
work of the committee.
The committee examined progress 
made by the company in delivering its 
objectives to provide the best service 
to customers, at the lowest sustainable 
cost and in a responsible manner. Acting 
responsibly helps us to be a successful 
long-term business for shareholders and 
customers.
We measure ourselves against 
national and international benchmarks, 
independently and externally assessed. 
We were delighted to retain ‘World Class’ 
status in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index for the seventh consecutive year 
and, for the first time, we became the 
leader in the multi-utility and water 
sector. Given our long-term stewardship 
role in managing water and wastewater, 
we also assess our effectiveness 
in the management of the risks and 
opportunities linked to climate change. 
In 2014, we achieved our best ever 
result in the Carbon Disclosure Project 
in which over 90 per cent of the FTSE 
100 participate to describe their

approach to climate change; we are now 
members of their Disclosure Leadership 
Index. And very recently we secured 
the Carbon T rust Water Standard for 
our efforts to reduce water use in West 
Cumbria.
In addition to these external 
benchmarks, last year the board 
approved the development and 
publication of a detailed corporate 
responsibility (CR) performance 
scorecard, to give greater transparency 
to responsible business performance 
for those working in the company 
and for external stakeholders. 
Performance against the CR scorecard 
was reported in the United Utilities 
2014 corporate responsibility 
report:  corporateresponsibility2014.
unitedutilities.com. This showed 
strong performance on most of the 
measures. As we begin the next five-
year investment period, this year the 
CRC will reset the responsible business 
measures and targets out to 2020, 
recognising the importance of setting 
targets for the long term. One particular 
area for sustained scrutiny through 
the corporate responsibility lens 
will be the impact of the company’s 
investment programme on customer 
needs and environmental goals. Further 
progress on our corporate responsibility 
programme will be reported periodically 
on our website. 
The CRC also looked closely at how 
acting responsibly impacts the way 
stakeholders, including customers, see 
the company. We concluded that our CR 
programme is important in sustaining 
the reputation of the company and helps 
build trust and confidence over the long 
term. As we begin the next five-year 
investment period, the CRC will continue 
to examine the relevance and value of 
our CR programme to United Utilities, 
its customers and shareholders.

What has been on the committee’s 
agenda during the year
In carrying out its duties, in the past 
12 months the CRC has paid particular 
attention to the following:
•	 governance – the flow of 
information to the board was 
further improved through specific 
reports on responsible business 
performance provided quarterly by 
the CEO to the board;
•	 measuring and reporting CR 
performance – the CRC approved 
the publication of a comprehensive 
update on how well we are 
meeting our responsible business 
commitments in the 2014 CR 
annual report. The committee noted 
strengthening performance on the 
majority of measures in the CR 
scorecard;
•	 trust and reputation – how the 
company is addressing the 
challenges of governance, trust and 
transparency. The company’s key 
reputation indicators for brand and 
media were discussed and good 
progress was noted; and
•	 preparing for the 2015-20 period 
– the committee discussed how 
the CR agenda and United Utilities’ 
strategic intentions for the next five 
years should be aligned.
Specific topics included:
•	 CR benchmarks – the committee 
reviewed the challenge and value of 
external CR benchmarking indices 
as a measure of United Utilities’ 
responsible business performance;
•	 delivering sustainability benefits 
through investment and efficiency 
programmes – the CRC considered 
how the company’s investment in 
transforming its wholesale business 
activities will bring customer and 
environmental benefits, whilst at 
the same time reducing operational 
cost;
•	 affordability – given the impact of 
continuing challenging economic 
conditions in the North West, the 
CRC examined what this means for 
debt, affordability and the payment 
assistance schemes offered by the 
company;
•	 retail competition – the CRC looked 
at building trust with business 
customers, and how the United 
Utilities’ brand, underpinned by 
strong CR credentials, is helping 
deliver value in the competitive 
market; and
•	 trends in corporate reporting – the 
CRC supported the recommendation 
that the 2015 annual report 
should present the CR themes in 
a way which is integrated with the 
company’s strategic aims.
Looking to the next year, as the water 
industry begins its next five-year 
investment programme, the CRC will:
•	 agree the responsible business 
measures and targets set out to 
2020, aligned with the group’s 
2015–20 business plan;
•	 review a number of key CR 
strategies including:
 — carbon reduction and waste 
strategy; 
 — debt and affordability;
 — talent and young people;
 — diversity and inclusion; and
 — how community spend is 
targeted. 
•	 continue its focus on the interaction 
between CR, communications and 
reputation. 
The board approved a slightly 
modified set of terms of reference 
(ToR) for the CRC in April 2015. The 
main duties are to: 
•	 consider and recommend to the 
board the broad CR policy taking 
into account the company’s 
desired CR positioning;
•	 keep under review the group’s 
approach to CR and ensure it 
is in alignment with the group 
strategy;
•	 review CR issues and objectives 
material to the group’s 
stakeholders and identify and 
monitor the extent to which they 
are reflected in group strategies, 
plans and policies;
•	 monitor and review compliance 
with the board’s CR policy and 
scrutinise the effectiveness of 
the delivery of the CR policy 
requirements;
•	 develop and recommend to 
the board CR targets and key 
performance indicators and 
receive and review reports 
on progress towards the 
achievement of such targets and 
indicators;
•	 review all approved specific 
giving where the aggregate 
financial contribution exceeds 
£100,000 over the period of the 
proposed funding and to review 
all community giving expenditure 
annually; and
•	 review the profile of the 
charitable donations directed by 
the United Utilities Trust Fund.
One of the small changes to the 
CRC ToR approved by the board 
related to approval of the company’s 
CR report. This has been changed 
from production of an annual 
report to a yearly performance 
statement, supported by year-round 
regular reporting of the company’s 
responsible business activities in 
enhanced CR pages on the United 
Utilities website.

annual-report-2014
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the directors’ 
remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 March 2015, which includes 
my statement, an abridged version 
of the directors’ remuneration policy 
which took effect from the date of our 
2014 AGM, and the annual report on 
remuneration for the year ended  
31 March 2015.
A successful five-year regulatory 
period from 2010–15 has been 
reflected both in total shareholder 
return (TSR) of around 115 per cent 
and in executive pay outcomes. Over 
this period the company has delivered 
its regulatory outperformance 
targets alongside significant progress 
in operational performance and a 
step change in customer service 
(reducing customer complaints 
by approximately 75 per cent and 
being the most improved water and 
wastewater company as measured 
under Ofwat’s three-year service 
incentive mechanism (SIM) assessment 
from 2011/12 to 2013/14). At the 
same time, customers have benefited 
from below inflation growth in average 
household bills.
As we enter a new regulatory period, 
the committee is committed to 
continuing to align executive pay with 
the company’s strategy of delivering 
value by providing the best service to 
customers, at the lowest sustainable 
cost and in a responsible manner. We 
seek to achieve this by strongly linking 
pay with performance, at both an 
individual and company level, and by 
encouraging a significant investment 
in company shares. We also recognise 
that a long-term focus is essential to 
creating value and therefore require 
executives to defer a significant 
proportion of their incentives.

At a glance summary: Executive directors’ remuneration
Strong alignment of performance 
and pay in 2014/15
During the year, performance was strong 
overall with underlying operating profit 
growing by five per cent, continued 
improvement in customer service 
and successful delivery of the capital 
investment programme. The company’s 
asset serviceability performance has 
also been good and we were pleased that 
the company retained its ‘World Class’ 
status in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index for the seventh successive year. 
The company did not, however, meet 
its bad debt recovery targets with debt 
collection continuing to be challenging, 
particularly as our region suffers from 
high levels of income deprivation.
This level of financial and operational 
performance, together with the 
achievement of a number of stretching 
personal objectives, has resulted in 
bonus payments of around 77 per cent 
of maximum for the executive directors. 
As the same bonus measures are used 
throughout the company, employees at 
all levels have also benefited from this 
success, receiving bonuses totalling  
£15 million for the year.  
The long-term incentive awards which 
were granted in 2012, and whose 
performance was measured over the 
three years to 31 March 2015, vested 
at 97.5 per cent. This followed a period 
of strong share price growth which, 
together with the dividend policy to 
grow dividends each year by RPI plus two 
per cent, resulted in a total shareholder 
return of around 80 per cent over the 
three years. The company also delivered 
excellent results against its operational 
and capital expenditure targets over the 
same period.
Key changes for 2015/16
In accordance with our continued 
conservative approach to overall 
remuneration, there will be no changes 
to the quantum of incentive plans for 
2015/16, nor to the structure of the 
Long T erm Plan (L TP), last reviewed in 
2013, and it is expected that executive 
salary increases will continue to be in 
line with those applied across the wider 
workforce.
Following the company’s acceptance 
in January 2015 of Ofwat’s final 
determination for 2015–20, the 
committee reviewed the annual bonus 
measures to ensure that they fully 
incentivise delivery of our business 
strategy and annual plan, and reflect the 
importance and challenge of regulatory 
commitments for the next regulatory 
period. These new bonus measures will 
apply not only to the executive directors, 
but also to all managers and employees 
throughout the company, to ensure 
alignment to delivery of the business 
plan at all levels.
The changes to the bonus measures 
are:
•	 the introduction of a measure 
based on newly introduced outcome 
delivery incentives (ODIs, see page 
86);
•	 changes to the time, cost and quality 
(TCQi) measure, which measures the 
extent to which we deliver our capital 
projects on time, to budget and to 
the required standard, to reflect the 
move to a new totex model and to 
make it more stretching with respect 
to large capital projects; and 
•	 the removal of three measures 
(regulatory capital expenditure, 
serviceability and bad debt) which do 
not form part of the new regulatory 
regime or the delivery of which 
are considered to be adequately 
incentivised via the other bonus 
measures. 
Further details of the bonus measures 
for 2015/16 are given in the annual 
report on remuneration on page 94 and 
their alignment to the business strategy 
is shown on page 86.
The performance targets for the 2015 
L TP are expected to be as for the 
2014 awards, with the exception of 
the sustainable dividend performance 
measure. Following the announcement 
by the board in January 2015 of our 
dividend policy for the 2015–20 period, 
the measure will switch focus to dividend 
cover, with the delivery of our dividend 
policy as an underpin.
And finally, to provide further alignment 
with shareholder interests, the board 
agreed in May 2015 to increase the 
shareholding guideline for executive 
directors from 100 per cent to 200 
per cent of base salary. Both executive 
directors have a shareholding in excess 
of this level.
The committee concluded that no 
changes to the policy approved at last 
year’s AGM were necessary and so there 
will not be a separate vote on it at this 
year’s AGM.
Agenda for 2015/16
During 2015/16 the committee will 
continue to keep executive remuneration 
arrangements under review, although 
no substantial changes are expected. 
As always, we continue to welcome 
feedback from shareholders.
I hope we will receive your support for 
the resolution relating to remuneration 
at the 2015 AGM.

New bonus measure
As part of the development of 
our business plan for 2015–20, 
we spoke to more than 30,000 
customers across the North West 
to ask them what they valued 
most about our service, and what 
they wanted to see improved. This 
feedback helped to inform five 
customer promises, which are at 
the heart of our strategy for the 
next five years and beyond.
We have established a set of 
performance commitments to 
make sure that we are on track 
to meet our customer promises. 
There are 26 performance 
commitments in total – 18 of 
which relate to our wholesale 
business and carry a financial 
incentive or penalty (known as an 
‘outcome delivery incentive’) which 
were agreed as part of Ofwat’s 
final determination. Rewards and 
penalties will be accumulated 
throughout 2015–20, and applied 
by Ofwat in the following five-year 
period from 2020. The size of the 
reward or penalty is weighted 
according to the value that 
customers place on each measure.

Directors’ remuneration pol  icy (abridged)
Policy table for directors 
Base salary  
Purpose and link to strategy: To attract and retain executives of the experience and quality required to deliver the 
company’s strategy. 
Operation Maximum opportunity
Reviewed annually, effective 1 September.
Significant increases in salary should only take place 
infrequently, for example where there has been a material 
increase in:
•	 the size of the individual’s role;
•	 the size of the company (through mergers and 
acquisitions); or
•	 the pay market for directly comparable companies (for 
example, companies of a similar size and complexity).
On recruitment or promotion to executive director, the 
committee will take into account previous remuneration 
and pay levels for comparable companies when setting 
salary levels. This may lead to salary being set at a lower  
or higher level than for the previous incumbent.
Current salary levels are shown in the annual report on 
remuneration.
Executive directors will normally receive a salary increase 
broadly in line with the increase awarded to the general 
workforce, unless one or more of the conditions outlined under 
‘operation’ is met.
Where the committee has set the salary of a new hire at a 
discount to the market level initially, a series of planned 
increases can be implemented over the following few years to 
bring the salary to the appropriate market position, subject to 
individual performance.
Performance measures
None.
Benefits  
Purpose and link to strategy: To provide market competitive benefits to help recruit and retain high calibre executives.
Operation Maximum opportunity
Provision of benefits such as:
•	 health benefits;
•	 car or car allowance;
•	 relocation assistance;
•	 life assurance;
•	 group income protection;
•	 all employee share schemes (e.g. opportunity to join  
the ShareBuy scheme);
•	 travel; and
•	 communication costs.
Additional benefits might be provided from time to time 
if the committee decides payment of such benefits is 
appropriate and in line with emerging market practice.
As it is not possible to calculate in advance the cost of all 
benefits, a maximum is not pre-determined.
Performance measures
None.

This part of the directors’ remuneration report sets out an abridged version of the remuneration policy which was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM on 25 July 2014. The policy took formal effect from the date of approval and is intended to apply until 
the 2017 AGM.
A full version of the policy can be found in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 
annualreport2014.unitedutilities.com/site-essentials/downloads/annual-report-2014 
Overview of remuneration policy
The company’s remuneration arrangements are designed so that the overall level of remuneration (including salary and 
benefits, together with the short and long-term incentive opportunities) is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executives 
of the quality required to run the company successfully. The company does not pay more than is necessary for this purpose. 
The committee recognises that the company operates in the North West of England in a regulated environment and therefore 
needs to ensure that the structure of executive remuneration reflects both the practices of the markets in which its executives 
operate, and stakeholder expectations of how the company should be run.
A significant proportion of senior executives’ remuneration is performance related. Senior executives are incentivised to 
achieve stretching results which are delivered with an acceptable level of risk. There is a strong direct link between incentives 
and the company’s strategy and if the strategy is delivered, senior executives will be rewarded through the annual bonus and 
long-term incentives. If it is not delivered, then a significant part of their potential remuneration will not be paid.

Pension  
Purpose and link to strategy: To provide a broadly mid-market level of retirement benefits.
Operation Maximum opportunity
Executive directors are offered the choice of:
•	 a company contribution into a defined contribution 
pension scheme; or
•	 a cash allowance in lieu of pension; or
•	 a combination of a company contribution into a defined 
contribution pension scheme and a cash allowance.
External hires will not be eligible to join a defined benefit 
pension scheme.
Internal promotees who are active members of a United 
Utilities defined benefit scheme will be offered the choice 
of staying in that scheme or of choosing one of the above 
options
(1)
. 
•	 25 per cent of salary into a defined contribution scheme; or
•	 cash allowance of 22 per cent of base salary; or
•	 a combination of both such that the cost to the company is 
broadly the same.
Under the defined benefit schemes, a maximum future accrual 
of 1/80th pension plus 3/80ths lump sum of final pensionable 
salary for each year of service
(1)
.
Performance measures
None.
Annual bonus  
Purpose and link to strategy: To incentivise performance against personal objectives and selected financial and operational 
KPIs which are directly linked to business strategy. Deferral of part of bonus into shares aligns the interests of executive 
directors and shareholders.
Operation Maximum opportunity
50 per cent paid as cash.
50 per cent deferred into company shares under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for three years. 
DBP shares accrue dividend equivalents.
Not pensionable.
Bonuses are subject to clawback or malus in the event of a 
material overstatement in the financial statements of the 
company because of fraud or error.
Deferred shares under the DBP are subject to malus in 
such negative circumstances as the committee considers 
is appropriate. For example: material misstatement 
of audited financial results, serious failure of risk 
management or serious reputational damage.
Maximum 130 per cent of salary bonus potential, for the 
achievement of stretching performance objectives.
Performance measures
Payments predominantly based on financial and operational 
performance, with a minority based on achievement of personal 
objectives.
Targets set by reference to the company’s financial and 
operating plans.
Target bonus of 50 per cent of maximum bonus potential and 
bonus of 25 per cent of maximum for threshold performance.
(1) In 2010 the company made a number of changes to defined benefit pension provision including a restriction on salary increases which count for pension 
purposes. Since that time salary increases above inflation (RPI), including those relating to any promotions, are no longer pensionable.

Long Term Plan (LTP)  
Purpose and link to strategy: To incentivise long-term value creation and alignment with longer term returns to 
shareholders.
Operation Maximum opportunity
Awards under the Long Term Plan are rights to receive 
company shares, subject to certain performance 
conditions. 
Each award is measured over a three-year performance 
period starting at the beginning of the financial year in 
which awards are granted. 
An additional two-year holding period applies after the  
end of the three-year performance period.
Vested shares accrue dividend equivalents.
Shares under the L TP are subject to malus in such 
negative circumstances as the committee considers 
are appropriate. For example: material misstatement 
of audited financial results, serious failure of risk 
management or serious reputational damage.
130 per cent of salary per annum.
In exceptional circumstances the committee retains the 
discretion to grant awards up to plan limits of 200 per cent of 
salary. 
Performance measures
One-third of awards vest based on relative total shareholder 
return (TSR), one-third based on customer service excellence 
and one–third based on a sustainable dividends performance 
condition.
Any vesting is also subject to the committee being satisfied 
that the company’s performance on these measures is 
consistent with underlying business performance.
100 per cent of awards vest for stretch performance,  
25 per cent of an award vests for threshold performance and 
no awards vest for below threshold performance.
Non-executive directors’ fees and benefits  
Purpose and link to strategy: To attract non-executive directors with a broad range of experience and skills to oversee the 
development and implementation of our strategy.
Operation Maximum opportunity
The remuneration policy for the non-executive directors 
(with the exception of the Chairman) is set by a separate 
committee of the board. The policy for the Chairman is 
determined by the remuneration committee (of which  
the Chairman is not a member). 
Fees are reviewed annually taking into account the levels 
of fees paid by companies of a similar size and complexity. 
Any changes are effective from 1 September.
Additional fees are paid to the chairs of certain board  
sub-committees and for the senior independent non-
executive director.
No eligibility for bonuses, long-term incentive plans, 
pension schemes, healthcare arrangements or employee 
share schemes.
The company repays any reasonable expenses that a non-
executive director incurs in carrying out their duties as a 
director. In addition, travel, hospitality-related and other 
modest benefits will be payable on occasion.
Current fee levels are shown in the annual report on 
remuneration. 
The value of benefits may vary from year to year according to 
the cost to the company.
Performance measures
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any 
performance-related arrangements.

Directors’ remuneration policy (abridged)
Notes to the policy table
Selection of performance measures and targets
Performance measures for the annual bonus are selected annually to align with the company’s key strategic goals for the 
year and reflect financial, operational and personal objectives. ‘Target’ performance is typically set in line with the business 
plan for the year, following rigorous debate and approval of the plan by the board. Threshold to stretch targets are then 
set based on a sliding scale on the basis of relevant commercial factors. Only modest rewards are available for delivering 
threshold performance levels, with rewards at stretch requiring substantial outperformance of the business plan. Details of 
the measures used for the annual bonus are given in the annual report on remuneration.
L TP targets are set taking into account a number of factors, including reference to market practice, the company business 
plan and analysts’ forecasts where relevant. The LTP will only vest in full if stretching business performance is achieved.
Annual bonus and long-term incentives – flexibility, discretion and judgement
The committee will operate the company’s incentive plans according to their respective rules and consistent with normal 
market practice, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant, including flexibility in a number of regards. 
Any discretion exercised (and the rationale) will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report.
Scenarios for total remuneration
The charts below show the payout under the remuneration policy for each executive director under three different 
scenarios. Please note that the charts have been updated from those in the policy approved at the AGM on 25 July 2014 to

Service contracts and letters of appointment
Executive directors’ service contracts are subject to up to one year’s notice period when terminated by the company and at 
least six months’ notice when terminated by the director. A company notice period longer than one year may be provided if 
necessary for recruitment, but reducing to a rolling one-year period after the initial period has expired.
The policy on payments for loss of office is set out in the next section. 
The Chairman and other non-executive directors have letters of appointment rather than service contracts. Their 
appointments may be terminated without compensation at any time. All non-executive directors are subject to re-election 
at the AGM. 
Copies of executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the company’s registered office during normal hours of business and will be available at the company’s AGM. 
Copies of non-executive directors’ letters of appointment can also be viewed on the company’s website.
Shareholding guidelines
The committee believes that it is important for a significant investment to be made by each executive director in the shares 
of the company to provide alignment with shareholder interests. Executive directors are encouraged to build up and retain 
a targeted shareholding of at least 100 per cent of base salary, normally within five years of appointment. There is an 
expectation that executive directors will continue to build a shareholding throughout their period of employment with the 
company, after the target shareholding is reached.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s 
approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. 
Buy-out awards
In addition, the committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements (on a one-time basis or ongoing) when 
it considers these to be in the best interests of the company (and therefore shareholders). Any such payments would be 
limited to a reasonable estimate of value of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect the 
delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or share-based), time horizons and whether performance requirements are attached to 
that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
Maximum level of variable pay
The maximum initial level of long-term incentives which may be awarded to a new executive director will be limited to the 
maximum Long Term Plan limit of 200 per cent of salary. Therefore, the maximum initial level of overall variable pay that 
may be offered will be 330 per cent of salary (i.e. 130 per cent annual bonus plus 200 per cent Long Term Plan). These limits 
are in addition to the value of any buy-out arrangements which are governed by the policy above.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to 
pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other previously 
awarded entitlements would continue and be disclosed in the next annual report on remuneration. 
Base salary and relocation expenses
The committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new appointment at a discount to the market level initially, with 
a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the appropriate market 
position, subject to individual performance in the role. 
For external and internal appointments, the committee may agree that the company will meet certain relocation expenses 
as appropriate. 
Appointment of non-executive directors
For the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the 
approved remuneration policy in force at that time. Non-executive directors’ fees are set by a separate committee of the 
board; the Chairman’s fees are set by the remuneration committee.
Payment for loss of office
The circumstances of the termination (taking into account the individual’s performance) and an individual’s duty and 
opportunity to mitigate losses are taken into account in every case. Our policy is to stop or reduce compensatory 
payments to former executive directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the 
compensation period. A robust line on reducing compensation is applied and payments to departing employees may be 
phased in order to mitigate loss. A full version of the policy can be found in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for 
the year ended 31 March 2014 annualreport2014.unitedutilities.com/site-essentials/downloads/annual-report-2014

(1) For executive directors, benefits include: a car allowance of £14,000; health, life and income protection insurance; travel costs and communication costs. 
The 2014 benefits for Steve Mogford were understated by £3,000 in last year’s report.
(2) 50 per cent of bonus was deferred into shares for three years under the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP). See page 93 for further details of bonus outcomes.
(3) The performance period for the 2012 Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Matching Share Award Plan (MSAP) awards ended on 31 March 2015 and the 
awards vested on 19 May 2015. The final vesting of those awards was 97.5 per cent resulting in 128,191 shares vesting for Steve Mogford and 80,087 
shares vesting for Russ Houlden. The value of these shares shown in the table above has been calculated using the closing share price on date of vesting, 
which was 1004 pence per share. See page 96 for further details.
(4) The performance period for the 2011 PSP and MSAP awards ended on 31 March 2014 and the awards vested on 20 May 2014. The final vesting of those 
awards was 93.5 per cent, resulting in 98,686 shares vesting for Steve Mogford and 72,724 shares vesting for Russ Houlden. The value of these shares 
shown in the table above has been calculated using the closing share price on date of vesting, which was 854 pence per share. 
(5) Cash allowance of 22 per cent of base salary paid in lieu of pension.
(6) During the year there were extended restrictions in place on buying and selling shares due to the regulatory price review which meant that executive 
directors were unable to exercise their vested 2011 PSP and MSAP awards before the record date for the August 2014 dividend. In line with the 
shareholder approved policy (see page 90), the committee considered it appropriate not to penalise employees (including executive directors) for this lost 
dividend and exercised its discretion to pay a cash payment in lieu of these dividends forgone (on a net-of-tax equivalence basis). The figures in this column 
also include the value of matching shares under the ShareBuy scheme which vested in the year, valued using the closing share price on the day they vested 
(the company offers a one-for-five match on partnership shares bought by employees under ShareBuy which cease to become forfeitable one year after 
they are awarded).
(7) The company recognises that its executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of companies outside the company and exposure 
to such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge, which would be of benefit to the company. Any external appointments are subject to 
board approval (which would not be given if the proposed appointment was with a competing company, would lead to a material conflict of interest or could 
have a detrimental effect on a director’s performance). Steve Mogford is the senior independent director of Carillion PLC for which he receives and retains 
an annual fee of £60,200. Russ Houlden is an independent member of the supervisory board, and audit committee chairman of Orange Polska SA for which 
he receives and retains fees estimated annually at around PLN 323,000 (around £60,000).
Pay and performance
A significant proportion of the executive directors’ pay is performance related. Over the last three years, strong operational 
performance has supported our dividend growth of RPI plus two per cent and driven significant share price growth (our market 
capitalisation increased from £4.1 billion to £6.4 billion over this period). The committee considers that the remuneration 
received for the year ended 31 March 2015 fairly recognises the executive directors’ contribution in delivering this 
performance.
The chart below shows that around 70 per cent of executive directors’ total remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2015 
was delivered in variable pay and 19 per cent related to share price growth and dividends on their vested long-term incentive 
awards.

Annual report on remuneration
Annual bonus in respect of financial year commencing 1 April 2015
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2015/16 will remain unchanged at 130 per cent of base salary.
As referred to in the remuneration committee chair’s annual statement (see pages 84 and 85), during the year the 
committee reviewed the annual bonus measures to ensure that they are aligned to the delivery of the business strategy for 
the next regulatory period 2015–20 (Ofwat’s final determination having been accepted by the company in January 2015).
The performance measures, weightings and targets for the executive directors’ annual bonus for the year commencing 
1 April 2015 are set out in the table below, along with a description of why the committee considers the measures to be 
appropriate. Please note that certain targets are considered commercially sensitive, and consequently these will only be 
disclosed after the end of the 2015/16 financial year in the 2015/16 annual report on remuneration.

TCQi , including extending coverage to relevant non-regulatory commitments, measuring cost in terms of total expenditure (totex) and giving a greater 
weighting in the cost element to our biggest capital projects. This resulted in a recalibration of the index. The committee is satisfied that the range of TCQi 
targets for the 2015/16 annual bonus is appropriate and sufficiently stretching.

Long-term incentives
Summary of long-term incentives for executive directors
The Long Term Plan (L TP) was introduced in 2013 following an extensive review and shareholder consultation. The L TP 
replaced two long-term incentive plans – the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Matching Share Award Plan (MSAP). 
The structure of the L TP awards to be granted in 2015 will remain the same as for the 2014 awards, with the exception of a 
switch to dividend cover as the differentiator of performance under the sustainable dividends performance measure.
A summary of the long-term incentives referred to in this report is set out in the table below:

Performance for vested awards
2012 awards with a performance period ending 31 March 2015 (audited information) 
The long-term incentive amount included in the single total figure of remuneration on page 92 is in respect of the 2012 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Matching Share Award Plan (MSAP) awards which vested on 19 May 2015. The overall 
vesting outcome was 97.5 per cent of maximum which reflects strong total shareholder return (TSR) of 80 per cent over the 
three-year performance period and excellent operational and capital expenditure performance.
The targets and achievement against those targets are set out in the table below.

2011 awards with a performance period ending 31 March 2014 
In last year’s report the vesting outcome was disclosed for the 2011 Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Matching Share 
Award Plan (MSAP) awards which vested on 20 May 2014. At that time the directors considered it commercially sensitive 
to disclose targets for the opex outperformance and capex outperformance conditions and committed to disclosing the 
targets in this year’s report, after the end of the 2010-15 period. 
For the opex outperformance measure (measuring opex outperformance versus Ofwat’s allowed operating costs for the 
period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2014), outperformance was £77.7 million which was just below the stretch target of £81.3 
million (resulting in 88 per cent vesting for this element).
For the capex outperformance measure (measuring capex outperformance versus Ofwat’s allowed operating costs for the 
period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2014), outperformance was greater than the stretch target of £41.0 million (resulting in 
100 per cent vesting for this element).

(33.3%)
It is a key strategic objective to provide 
the best service to customers. This is 
fundamental to delivering our vision of 
becoming a leading North West service 
provider and one of the UK’s best 
water and wastewater companies. This 
measure has a direct financial impact 
on the company as our regulator can 
apply financial incentives or penalties 
depending on our customer service 
performance
•	 Stretch vesting (100%) for upper decile position 
•	 Intermediate vesting (80%) for upper quartile 
position 
•	 Threshold vesting (25%) for median position 
(1) Straight line vesting applies between these points, with nil vesting below threshold performance.
(2) For details of the comparator companies see page 95.
(3) Based on Ofwat’s customer service measure (currently the service incentive mechanism). Vesting is based on ranking position in the final year compared to 
the other water and wastewater companies (currently 18 companies including United Utilities).
The committee will have the flexibility to make appropriate adjustments to the performance targets in exceptional 
circumstances, to ensure that the award achieves its original purpose.
Any vesting is also subject to the committee being satisfied that the company’s performance on these measures is 
consistent with underlying business performance.

Performance targets for future awards
2015 awards with a performance period ending 31 March 2018
The performance targets for the 2015 Long Term Plan (L TP) are expected to be as for the 2014 awards outlined above, 
with the exception of the sustainable dividend performance measure. Following the announcement by the board in January 
2015 of our dividend policy for the regulatory period 2015–20, the measure will switch focus from dividend growth as 
the differentiator of performance with dividend cover as an underpin, to dividend cover being the differentiator with the 
delivery of our dividend policy as an underpin. 
Executive directors’ interests in shares 
Executive directors’ shareholding (audited information)
To provide further alignment with shareholder interests, in May 2015 the board agreed to increase the shareholding 
guidelines for executive directors from 100 per cent to 200 per cent of base salary. Executive directors are  normally 
expected to reach this shareholding within five years of appointment. There is also an expectation that they will continue to 
build a shareholding throughout their period of employment with the company after the guideline is reached.
Details of beneficial interests in the company’s ordinary shares as at 31 March 2015 held by each of the executive directors 
and their connected persons are set out in the table below along with progress against the target shareholding guideline 
level. The table shows that both Steve Mogford and Russ Houlden have already exceeded the target shareholding.

(2) Executive directors were required to defer 50 per cent of their 2013/14 bonus into shares for three years under the DBP . The deferral period will end on  
30 June 2017. There were no service or performance conditions attached, however deferred bonuses are subject to malus provisions (see page 88 for 
further information).
(3) The face value of the DBP awards made in 2014 have been calculated using the closing share price on 27 June 2014 (the dealing day prior to date of grant) 
which was 880.5 pence per share.
(4) 93.5 per cent of the 2011 PSP and MSAP awards vested. See page 96 for further detail.

(6) The face value of the L TP awards made in 2014 has been calculated using the closing share price on 27 June 2014 (the dealing day prior to date of grant) 
which was 880.5 pence per share. 25 per cent of the award vests for threshold performance and performance is measured over the period 1 April 2014 to 
31 March 2017. Details of the performance measures and targets are given on page 97.
(7) Full details of the one-off matched share investment scheme award for Steve Mogford, introduced as a necessary part of his terms of appointment, were 
disclosed in the 2010/11 report. Shares under this scheme will vest on 5 January 2016, subject to him still being employed by the group at that date. 
(8) Under ShareBuy, matching shares vest provided the employee remains employed by the company one year after grant. During the year Steve Mogford 
purchased 204 partnership shares and was awarded 41 matching shares (at an average share price of 870 pence per share). Russ Houlden purchased 205 
partnership shares and was awarded 41 matching shares (at an average share price of 870 pence per share).
(9) Full details of the one-off matched share investment scheme award for Russ Houlden, introduced as a necessary part of his terms of appointment, were 
disclosed in the 2010/11 report. Shares under this scheme will vest on 1 October 2015, subject to him still being employed by the group at that date.

Business model
A description of the company’s 
business model can be found within the 
strategic report on pages 14 to 18.
Greenhouse gas emissions
We measure our emissions over the 
financial reporting year against a 
footprint covering the operational 
activities of the water and property 
services businesses in the UK. All 
figures stated are in line with the latest 
UK Government carbon reporting 
guidance. Our reporting is compliant 
with the international carbon reporting 
standard ISO 14064, Part 1 and 
assured to a reasonable standard by 
the Certified Emissions Measurement 
and Reduction Scheme certification.
In 2010 we stated our short-term 
target to reduce our emissions by 21 
per cent by 2015, against a 2005/06 
baseline. As stated in the performance 
report, last year our emissions were 
473,708 tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (tCO
2
e), 19 per cent below 
our 2005/06 baseline, so narrowly 
missing our short-term target. Missing 
this target is extremely disappointing 
as we purchased less electricity 
than in any of the last 10 years and 
generated our highest ever amount of 
renewable energy. However, we could 
not counteract the impact of the 11 per 
cent increase in the carbon content of 
the UK’s electricity supply.

The trend in our overall emissions continues to be downwards even though they 
have fluctuated over the past few years – as they can be affected by weather, 
operational conditions and the carbon content of the UK’s electricity supply. We 
are currently assessing what our next carbon targets should be, covering our 
emissions up to 2020 and beyond, taking both our plans and the impact of UK 
energy and carbon policy into account. 
We expect the trend in our emissions to remain downwards reflecting our efforts 
to use less energy and increase renewable energy generation, alongside projected 
decreases in the carbon content of the UK’s energy supply. It is likely there will be 
some fluctuation as a result of operational responses to weather conditions and 
wider trends in the energy market affecting the carbon content of UK electricity.

Dividends
Our directors are recommending a final dividend of 25.14 pence per ordinary share for 
the year ended 31 March 2015, which, together with the interim dividend of 12.56 pence, 
gives a total dividend for the year of 37.70 pence per ordinary share (the interim and final 
dividends we paid in respect of the 2013/14 financial year were 12.01 pence and 24.03 
pence per ordinary share respectively). Subject to approval by our shareholders at our

the close of business on 26 June 2015.
Directors
The biographical details, together with the skills and experience of our directors who 
served during the financial year ended 31 March 2015, can be found on pages 58 and 59. 
During the year, Nick Salmon retired from the board at our AGM on 25 July 2014 and we 
appointed Stephen Carter to the board on 1 September 2014. 
Reappointment
Our articles of association provide that our directors must retire at the third annual 
general meeting following their last election or reappointment by our shareholders. 
However, our board, being mindful of the recommendation contained within the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in 2012 (‘the 2012 Code’) that all directors should 
be subject to annual election by shareholders, has decided that all of our directors will 
retire at the 2015 AGM and offer themselves for election/reappointment, as happened at 
the AGMs in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Information regarding the appointment of our 
directors is included in our corporate governance report on pages 68 to 72.
Interests
Details of the interests in the company’s shares held by our directors and persons 
connected with them are set out in our directors’ remuneration report on pages 84 to 103 
which is hereby incorporated by reference into this directors’ report.
Corporate governance 
statement
The corporate governance report on pages 57 to 103 is hereby incorporated by reference 
into this directors’ report. Further details of our compliance with the 2012 Code is given on 
pages 57 to 103. Our statement includes a description of the main features of our internal 
control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process and 
forms part of this directors’ report. A copy of the 2012 Code, as applicable to the company 
for the year ended 31 March 2015, can be found at the Financial Reporting Council’s website

of the main board committees can be found on our website: corporate.unitedutilities.com
Our corporate governance statement also includes the consideration given by our 
directors to the factors relevant to the adoption of the going concern basis of accounting 
and a long term viability statement. We can confirm that during the financial year 
2014/2015 there have been no breaches of our anti-bribery and competition policies and 
no investigations or enforcement activity against us in respect of these matters.

Share capital
At 31 March 2015, the issued share capital of the company was £499,819,926 divided 
into 681,888,418 ordinary shares of five pence each and 273,956,180 deferred shares 
of 170 pence each. Details of our share capital and movements in our issued share capital 
are shown in note 22 to the financial statements on page 142. The ordinary shares 
represented 71.3 per cent and the deferred shares represented 28.7 per cent respectively 
of the shares in issue as at 31 March 2015. 
All our ordinary shares have the same rights, including the rights to one vote at any of our 
general meetings, to an equal proportion of any dividends we declare and pay, and to an 
equal amount of any surplus assets which are distributed in the event of a winding-up. 
Our deferred shares convey no right to income, no right to vote and no appreciable right to 
participate in any surplus capital in the event of a winding-up. The rights attaching to our 
shares in the company are provided by our articles of association, which may be amended or 
replaced by means of a special resolution of the company in general meeting. The company 
renews annually its power to issue and buy back shares at our AGM and such resolutions 
will be proposed at our 2015 AGM. Our directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK 
legislation and by the company’s articles. At the AGM of the company on 25 July 2014, the 
directors were authorised to issue relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£11,364,806 and were empowered to allot equity securities for cash on a non pre-emptive 
basis to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,704,721.
Voting
Electronic and paper proxy appointment and voting instructions must be received by our 
registrars (Equiniti) not less than 48 hours before a general meeting and when calculating 
this period, the directors can decide not to take account of any part of a day that is not a 
working day. 
Transfers
There are no restrictions on the transfer of our ordinary shares in the company, nor any 
limitations on the holding of our shares in the company, save (i) where the company has 
exercised its right to suspend their voting rights or to prohibit their transfer following the 
omission of their holder or any person interested in them to provide the company with 
information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006; or 
(ii) where their holder is precluded from exercising voting rights by the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 
There are no agreements known to us between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. All our issued shares are fully paid.
Major shareholdings
At 20 May 2015, our directors had been notified of the following interests in the

Purchase of own shares
At our last AGM held on 25 July 2014, our shareholders authorised the company to 
purchase, in the market, up to 68,188,841 of our ordinary shares of five pence each. We 
did not purchase any shares under this authority during the year. We normally seek such an 
authority from our shareholders annually. At our 2015 AGM, we will seek authority from 
our shareholders to purchase up to 68,188,841 of our ordinary shares of five pence each 
with such authority expiring at the end of our AGM held in 2016.
Change of control
As at 31 March 2015, Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited was the trustee that administered 
our executive share plans and had the ability to exercise voting rights at its discretion 
which related to shares that it held under the trust deed constituting the trust. In the event 
of a takeover offer which could lead to a change of control of the company, the trustee 
must consult with the company before accepting the offer or voting in favour of the 
offer. Subject to that requirement, the trustee may take into account a prescribed list of 
interests and considerations prior to making a decision in relation to the offer, including 
the interests of the beneficiaries under the trust. 
In the event of a change of control, the participants in our share incentive plan (ShareBuy) 
would be able to direct the trustee of the share incentive plan, Equiniti Share Plan Trustees 
Limited, how to act on their behalf.
Information required by UK 
listing rule 9.8.4
Details of the amount of interest capitalised by the group during the financial year can 
be found in note 5 to the financial statements on page 130. In line with current UK tax 
legislation, the amount is fully deductible against the group’s corporation tax liability 
resulting in tax relief of £4.4 million. 
There are no other disclosures to be made under listing rule 9.8.4.
Directors’ indemnities 
and insurance
We have in place contractual entitlements for the directors of the company and of its 
subsidiaries to claim indemnification by the company in respect of certain liabilities which 
might be incurred by them in the course of their duties as directors. These arrangements, 
which constitute qualifying third party indemnity provision and qualifying pension scheme 
indemnity provision, have been established in compliance with the relevant provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and have been in force throughout the financial year. They include 
provision for the company to fund the costs incurred by directors in defending certain claims 
against them in relation to their duties as directors of the company or its subsidiaries. The 
company also maintains an appropriate level of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
Political donations We do not support any political party and do not make what are commonly regarded 
as donations to any political party or other political organisations. However, the wide 
definition of donations in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 covers 
activities which form part of the necessary relationship between the group and our political 
stakeholders. This includes promoting United Utilities’ activities at the main political parties’ 
annual conferences, and occasional stakeholder engagement in Westminster.
The period 2014/15 saw us engage with our stakeholders along a number of policy themes 
as the Water Bill made its way through Parliament and Market Reform planning continued. 
The group incurred expenditure of £21,600 (2014: £12,235) as part of this process. At the 
2014 AGM, an authority was taken to cover such expenditure. A similar resolution will be 
put to our shareholders at the 2015 AGM to authorise the company and its subsidiaries to 
make such expenditure.

taking action to improve how they feel about the company and understand its direction. Employees are 
provided with regular information to enable them to understand the financial and economic factors 
affecting the company’s performance. The board encourages employees to own shares in the company 
through the all employee share incentive plan (ShareBuy). For further information on our average

Environmental, social 
and community matters
Details of our approach to corporate responsibility, relating to the environment and social and 
community issues, can be found in the ‘Our responsible approach to doing business’ section  
on page 20.
Essential contractual 
relationships
Certain suppliers we use contribute key goods or services, the loss of which could cause 
disruption to our services. However, none are so vital that their loss would affect our viability as 
a group as a whole nor are we overly dependent on any one individual customer.
Approach to technology 
development
We are committed to using innovative, cost-effective and practical solutions for providing high 
quality services and we recognise the importance of ensuring that we focus our investment 
on the development of technology and that we have the right skills to apply technology to 
achieve sustainable competitive advantage and also that we continue to be alert to emerging 
technological opportunities.
Financial instruments Our risk management objectives and policies in relation to the use of financial instruments can 
be found in note A3 to the financial statements.
Property, plant and 
equipment
The group holds significant land assets; however, the vast majority of these are water catchment 
assets which are an integral and essential part of the operation of the group’s regulated 
business. The nature of these assets, which are primarily moorland areas and which could not be 
sold by the group, means that it is impracticable to obtain meaningful market values for the land. 
Other land owned by the group, the majority of which relates to operational sites, does not have 
a market value materially different from historic cost.
Events occurring after 
the reporting period
Details of events after the reporting period are included in note 25 to the consolidated financial

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report and the 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare group and parent  company 
financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law they 
are required to prepare the group 
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements 
on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent 
company and of their profit or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the 
group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required 
to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a strategic report, directors’ 
report, directors’ remuneration report 
and corporate governance statement 
that complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the 
directors in respect of the annual 
financial report
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
•	 the strategic report (contained 
on pages 4 to 55) includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
•	 the directors consider the annual 
report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of United Utilities Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2015 set out on pages 
118 to 162. In our opinion: 
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 March 2015 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
•	 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•	 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit were as follows: 
Capitalisation of costs relating to the capital programme (£728.5 million)
Refer to page 79 audit committee report, page 125 accounting policies and note 10 financial disclosures.
The risk Our response
The group has a substantial capital programme which has 
been agreed with the Water Services Regulation Authority 
(Ofwat) and therefore incurs significant annual expenditure 
in relation to the development and maintenance of both 
infrastructure and non-infrastructure assets. Expenditure 
in relation to increasing the capacity or enhancing the 
network is treated as capital expenditure. Expenditure 
incurred in maintaining the operating capability of the 
network is expensed in the year in which it is incurred. Capital 
projects often contain a combination of enhancement and 
maintenance activity which are not distinct and therefore 
the allocation of costs between capital and operating 
expenditure is inherently judgemental. Within the costs of 
the capital programme is an allocation of overhead relating 
to the proportion of time that the group’s support functions 
spend which relates directly to the capital programme. This 
allocation is also inherently judgemental. For these reasons 
there remains a risk that capital and operating expenditure 
may be significantly misstated and so the group’s capital 
programme is an area of focus for our work.
In this area our principal audit procedures included the 
following: 
•	 we assessed the group’s capitalisation policy for 
compliance with relevant accounting standards;
•	 we tested controls over the application of the policy to 
spend incurred on projects within the capital programme 
in the period including attending capital approval 
meetings to observe the judgements made; for a 
sample of capital projects we assessed the appropriate 
application of the capitalisation policy to actual spend 
incurred;
•	 we assessed, also for a sample of projects, variances in 
actual expenditure to budgeted capital and operating 
expenditure and where significant variances were 
identified we tested the proportionate allocation of costs 
between capital and operating expenditure;
•	 we agreed overhead costs incurred to supporting 
documentation on a sample basis and performed 
comparative analysis of overheads absorbed into capital 
projects by category to assess consistency with the policy 
and with prior years; and
•	 we tested a sample of capital accruals to assess the 
existence and accuracy of the costs being capitalised.
We also assessed the adequacy of the group’s disclosures of 
its capitalisation policy and other related disclosures.
UNITED UTILITIES GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STA TEMENTS 2015
Stock Code: UU.
unitedutilities.com 
114 Revenue recognition (£1,720.2 million) and provision for customer debts (£100.5 million)
Refer to page 79 audit committee report, page 125 accounting policies, and note 15 financial disclosures.
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition remains one of the key judgemental 
areas for the audit, particularly in relation to:
•	 the estimate of the revenue value of water supplied to 
metered customers between the last meter reading and the 
period end; and
•	 supplies to properties where there is little prospect of 
revenue being realised through the occupier not being able 
to be identified or due to a past history of non-payment of 
bills relating to that property.
A proportion of the group’s customers do not or cannot pay 
their bills which results in the need for provisions to be made 
for non-payment of the customer balance. Due to the level 
of judgement and the complexity of the calculation which 
could lead to revenue and provision for customer debt being 
misstated, this is considered a key audit risk.
In this area our principal audit procedures included the 
following:
•	 we assessed whether appropriate revenue recognition 
policies are applied through comparison with relevant 
accounting standards and industry practice, including 
the policy of not recognising revenue where there is little 
prospect of revenue being realised;
•	 we tested the group’s controls over revenue recognition, 
including reconciliations between sales and cash receipts 
systems and the general ledger;
•	 we recalculated the metered accrued income calculation 
with the support of our own modelling specialists;
•	 we assessed the appropriateness of the customer debt 
provisioning policy based on historical cash collections, 
credits, re-bills and write off information which we 
assessed through testing the data in the billing system 
and analysed by comparing the data to that which we 
collect independently across the industry;
•	 we assessed the extent to which historical trends are 
taken into account and applied in the customer debt 
provision calculation; and
•	 we remodelled the customer debt provision calculation to 
assess the mathematical accuracy with the support of our 
own modelling specialists.
We also assessed the adequacy of the group’s disclosures 
of its revenue recognition, customer debt provisioning 
policy, disclosures in relation to the estimation uncertainty 
involved in calculating the provision and other related 
disclosures.
Retirement benefit surplus (£79.2 million)
Refer to page 80 audit committee report, page 126 accounting policies and notes 18 and A4 financial disclosures.
The risk Our response
Significant estimates are made in valuing the group’s 
retirement benefit surplus. Small changes in assumptions 
and estimates used to value the group’s net pension surplus 
(2014: deficit) would have a significant effect on the group’s 
financial position. 
Our principal audit procedures included the following: we 
tested the controls over the maintenance of the schemes’ 
membership data and we challenged the key assumptions 
supporting the group’s retirement benefit surplus valuation 
with input from our own actuarial specialists, comparing the 
discount rate, inflation rate, salary, pension increase rates 
and life expectancy assumptions used against externally 
derived data. We also assessed the group’s disclosure in 
respect of the sensitivity of the surplus to changes in the 
key assumptions.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION GOVERNANCE

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivative financial instrument valuations (£477.4 million)
Refer to page 80 audit committee report, page 126 accounting policies, and note A3 financial disclosures. 
The risk Our response
The group has significant derivative financial instruments, 
the valuation of which is determined through the application 
of valuation techniques which often involve the exercise of 
judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates. Due 
to the significance of financial instruments and the related 
estimation uncertainty, this is considered a key audit risk.
Our audit procedures included the following:
•	 we assessed controls over the identification, 
measurement and management of derivative financial 
instruments and assessed the methodologies, inputs and 
assumptions used by the group in determining fair values;
•	 we compared observable inputs into valuation models 
such as quoted prices to externally available market data; 
and
•	 we recalculated valuations utilising our own valuation 
specialists.
Additionally, we assessed whether the financial statement 
disclosures of fair value risks and sensitivities appropriately 
reflect the group’s exposure to valuation risk.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
In establishing the overall audit strategy and performing the audit, materiality for the group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £25.0 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit before taxation, normalised to exclude 
net fair value losses on debt and derivative instruments, of £104.7 million, of which it represents 5.6 per cent. 
We report to the audit committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.5 million, in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The group consists of five reporting components, of which the most significant is United Utilities Water Limited which 
makes up the vast majority of the assets, liabilities, income and expense of the group. Audits for group reporting purposes 
were performed by the group audit team of four of the five components, using component materialities which ranged from 
£1.8 million for the smallest component to £24.0 million for United Utilities Water Limited, determined having regard to the 
mix of size and risk profile of the group across the components. These audits covered 99 per cent of group revenue, 
100 per cent  of group profit before taxation and 99 per cent of group total assets.
4. Our opinion on the other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:  
•	 the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006;
•	 the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
•	 information given in the corporate governance statement set out on pages 58 to 103 with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements.

116 5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs) we are required to report to you if, based on the

inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading.

•	 we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
•	 the audit committee section of the corporate governance report does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the audit committee.

•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•	 a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company.

•	 the part of the corporate governance statement on pages 58 to 103 relating to the company’s compliance with the 10 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of responsibilities
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 111, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description 
of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.

On the group’s transition to IFRS in the year ended 31 March 2006, the other reserve arose from the uplift to fair value of 
the infrastructure assets. This reserve is a component of retained earnings and, as such, has been transferred and presented 
within retained earnings during the year.
The merger reserve arose in the year ended 31 March 2009 on consolidation and represents the capital adjustment to 
reserves required to effect the reverse acquisition of United Utilities PLC by United Utilities Group PLC.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU). These have been 
prepared on the going concern basis and the directors 
have set out factors considered in concluding the 
appropriateness of this presentation in the corporate 
governance report on page 75.
The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial 
instruments, accounting for the transfer of assets from 
customers and the revaluation of infrastructure assets to 
fair value on transition to IFRS.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity 
with IFRS, requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
periods presented. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from these 
estimates.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The adoption of the following standards and 
interpretations, at 1 April 2014, has had no material impact 
on the group’s financial statements. Had the standards not 
been applied in the current year, basic earnings per share 
from continuing and discontinued operations would have 
remained unchanged.
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
The standard replaces IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ 
and removes the option previously taken by the group to 
proportionately consolidate its joint ventures, requiring 
instead the application of the equity method. Under the 
equity method, the group’s interests in the profit after 
taxation and net assets of its joint ventures are presented 
as one line in the consolidated income statement and the 
consolidated statement of financial position respectively. 
The application of the standard is retrospective and, hence, 
requires the restatement of the comparative period ended 
31 March 2014. 
The impact on the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of financial position and the 
consolidated statement of cash flows is detailed in the 
following tables.

operating activities (8.1)
Decrease in net cash used in investing 
activities 6.5
Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (1.6)
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
The standard builds on existing principles by identifying the 
concept of control as the determining factor in whether an 
entity should be included within the consolidated accounts 
of the parent company. The standard provides additional 
guidance to assist in the determination of control where 
this is difficult to assess.
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’
The standard includes disclosure requirements for all 
forms of interest in other entities, including subsidiaries, 
associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated 
structured entities.
Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’
This amendment provides clarification on the application of 
the offsetting rules affecting financial assets and financial 
liabilities in the event that relevant offsetting transactions 
occur.
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’
The standard clarifies that the obligating event that gives 
rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the 
relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy.

124 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying its accounting policies, the group 
is required to make certain estimates, judgements and 
assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the 
information available. These judgements, estimates and 
assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the amounts 
of revenues and expenses recognised during the reporting 
periods presented.
On an ongoing basis, the group evaluates its estimates 
using historical experience, consultation with experts and 
other methods considered reasonable in the particular 
circumstances. Actual results may differ significantly 
from the estimates, the effect of which is recognised in 
the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision 
become known.
The following paragraphs detail the estimates and 
judgements the group believes to have the most significant 
impact on the annual results under IFRS.
Property, plant and equipment
The group recognises property, plant and equipment (PPE) 
on its water and wastewater infrastructure assets where 
such expenditure enhances or increases the capacity of the 
network, whereas any expenditure classed as maintenance 
is expensed in the period it is incurred. Determining 
enhancement from maintenance expenditure is a subjective 
area, particularly when projects have both elements 
within them. In addition, management capitalise time and 
resources incurred by the group’s support functions on 
capital programmes.
The estimated useful economic lives of PPE are based 
on management’s judgement and experience. When 
management identifies that actual useful economic lives 
differ materially from the estimates used to calculate 
depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively. Due to 
the significance of PPE investment to the group, variations 
between actual and estimated useful economic lives could 
impact operating results both positively and negatively, 
although historically few changes to estimated useful 
economic lives have been required.
The group is required to evaluate the carrying values of 
PPE for impairment whenever circumstances indicate, in 
management’s judgement, that the carrying value of such 
assets may not be recoverable. An impairment review 
requires management to make subjective judgements 
concerning the cash flows, growth rates and discount rates 
of the cash generating units under review.
Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful receivables
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of 
delivery and when collection of the resulting receivable 
is reasonably assured. When the group considers that 
the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for a 
transaction, revenue recognition is delayed until such time 
as collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received 
in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred 
income.
United Utilities Water Limited raises bills in accordance 
with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the 
limits established by the periodic regulatory price review 
processes. For water and wastewater customers with water 
meters, the receivable billed is dependent on the volume 
supplied including the sales value of an estimate of the 
units supplied between the date of the last meter reading 
and the billing date. Meters are read on a cyclical basis and 
the group recognises revenue for unbilled amounts based 
on estimated usage from the last billing through to each 
reporting date. The estimated usage is based on historical 
data, judgement and assumptions; actual results could 
differ from these estimates, which would result in operating 
revenues being adjusted in the period that the revision to 
the estimates is determined. For customers who do not 
have a meter, the receivable billed and revenue recognised 
is dependent on the rateable value of the property, as 
assessed by an independent rating officer.
At each reporting date, the company and each of its 
subsidiaries evaluate the recoverability of trade receivables 
and record allowances for doubtful receivables based on 
experience. These allowances are based on, amongst other 
things, a consideration of actual collection history. The 
actual level of receivables collected may differ from the 
estimated levels of recovery, which could impact operating 
results positively or negatively.
Provisions and contingencies
The group is subject to a number of claims incidental to the 
normal conduct of its business, relating to and including 
commercial, contractual and employment matters, which are 
handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. 
The group routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse 
judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges 
of probable and reasonably estimated losses. 
Reasonable estimates involve judgements made by 
management after considering information including 
notifications, settlements, estimates performed by 
independent parties and legal counsel, available facts, 
identification of other potentially responsible parties and 
their ability to contribute, and prior experience. A provision 
is recognised when it is probable that an obligation exists 
for which a reliable estimate can be made after careful 
analysis of the individual matter. The required provision 
may change in the future due to new developments and 
as additional information becomes available. Matters 
that either are possible obligations or do not meet the 
recognition criteria for a provision are disclosed as 
contingent liabilities in note 24, unless the possibility of 
transferring economic benefits is remote.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Retirement benefits
The group operates two defined benefit schemes which are 
independent of the group’s finances. Actuarial valuations of 
the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees 
at intervals of not more than three years. The pension 
cost under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ is assessed in 
accordance with the advice of a firm of actuaries based on 
the latest actuarial valuation and assumptions determined 
by the actuary. The assumptions are based on information 
supplied to the actuary by the company, supplemented 
by discussions between the actuary and management. 
The assumptions are disclosed in note A4. Profit before 
taxation and net assets are affected by the actuarial 
assumptions used. The key assumptions include: discount 
rates, pay growth, mortality and increases to pensions in 
payment and deferred pensions, and may differ from actual 
results due to changing market and economic conditions 
and longer or shorter lives of participants.
Derivative financial instruments
The model used to fair value the group’s derivative financial 
instruments requires management to estimate future cash 
flows based on applicable interest rate curves. Projected 
cash flows are then discounted back using discount factors 
which are derived from the applicable interest rate curves 
adjusted for management’s estimate of counterparty and 
own credit risk, where appropriate.
Taxation
Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires 
judgements to be made regarding the application of tax law 
and the result of negotiations with, and enquiries from, tax 
authorities in a number of jurisdictions.
For further information on accounting policies see note A6.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, 
the following relevant standards and interpretations were 
in issue but not yet effective. All of the standards in issue 
but not yet effective have been endorsed by the EU except 
where noted. The directors anticipate that the group 
will adopt these standards and interpretations on their 
effective dates.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following 
standards and interpretations may have a material impact 
on the group’s financial statements.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
The standard is effective for periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2018 but has not yet been endorsed by the 
EU. Under the provisions of this standard, where the group 
has chosen to measure borrowings at fair value through 
profit or loss, the portion of the change in fair value due to 
changes in the group’s own credit risk will be recognised 
in other comprehensive income rather than within profit 
or loss. If this standard had been adopted in the current 
year, £4.6 million of losses would have been recognised in 
other comprehensive income rather than within the income 
statement. 
The standard also broadens the scope of what can be 
included within a hedge relationship, which may enable the 
group’s regulatory swaps to be designated within cash flow 
hedge relationships. If the standard had been adopted in 
the current year, with all such swaps being designated and 
all hedges being fully effective, £133.5 million of fair value 
losses would have been recognised in other comprehensive 
income rather than within the income statement.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following 
standards and interpretations will have no material impact 
on the group’s financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
This amendment represents the International Accounting 
Standard Board’s (IASB) first step in its disclosure initiative, 
is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2016, but has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The narrow-
focus amendments clarify, rather than significantly change, 
existing requirements within the standard. 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
This standard is effective for periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2017, but has not yet been endorsed by 
the EU. The standard introduces a new revenue recognition 
model and replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ , IAS 11 ‘Construction 
Contracts’ , IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ , 
IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’ , 
IFRIC 18 ‘Transfer of Assets from Customers’ and SIC-
31 ‘Revenue - Barter Transactions Involving Advertising 
Services’ .
Improvements to IFRS 2014
This is a collection of amendments to four standards as 
part of the IASB’s programme of annual improvements. 
The improvements, issued in September 2014, are yet 
to be endorsed by the EU and are effective for periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2016.
Improvements to IFRS (2012) and IFRS (2013)
This is a collection of amendments to 11 standards as 
part of the IASB’s programme of annual improvements. 
The improvements were issued in December 2013 and are 
effective for periods commencing on or after 1 February 
2015 and 1 January 2015 respectively.
All other standards and interpretations, which are in issue 
but not yet effective, are not considered relevant to the 
activities of the group.

126 1 REVENUE AND SEGMENT REPORTING
The group’s revenue predominantly arises from the provision of services within the United Kingdom, with less than one 
per cent of external revenue and non-current assets being overseas.
The group has a large and diverse customer base and there is no significant reliance on any single customer.
The board of directors of United Utilities Group PLC (the board) is provided with information on a single segment basis for 
the purposes of assessing performance and allocating resources. The board reviews revenue, underlying operating profit 
(see page 44), operating profit, assets and liabilities, regulatory capital expenditure and regulatory capital value (RCV) 
gearing at a consolidated level. In light of this, the group has a single segment for financial reporting purposes and therefore 
no further detailed segmental information is provided in this note.

Notes:
(1) ‘Fair value losses/(gains) on debt and derivative instruments’ includes foreign exchange gains of £10.5 million (2014: £60.3 million), excluding those on instruments measured at fair 
value through profit or loss. These gains are largely offset by fair value losses on derivatives.
(2) Includes a £4.6 million loss (2014: £11.1 million) on the valuation of debt reported at fair value through profit or loss due to changes in credit spread assumptions.
(3) These swap contracts are not designated within an IAS 39 hedge relationship and are, as a result, classed as ‘held for trading’ under the accounting standard. These derivatives form 
economic hedges and, as such, management intend to hold these through to maturity.
(4) Includes fair value movements in relation to other economic hedge derivatives relating to debt held at amortised cost.
(5) Includes £4.0 million income (2014: £8.1 million) due to interest on swaps and debt under fair value option. 
Interest payable for the year ended 31 March 2015 is stated net of £20.9 million (2014: £19.4 million) borrowing costs 
capitalised in the cost of qualifying assets within property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the year. This 
has been calculated by applying a capitalisation rate of 3.1 per cent (2014: 3.8 per cent) to expenditure on such assets as 
prescribed by IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ .

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations represent the retained obligations of businesses sold in prior years. During the year ended 
31 March 2015, the profit after taxation from discontinued operations was £nil (2014: £0.8 million); the prior year balance 
related primarily to the release of accrued costs of disposal in respect of certain elements of the group’s non-regulated 
disposal programme.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit after taxation for the financial year attributable to equity holders 
of the company by 681.9 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year (2014: 681.9 million). 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit after taxation for the financial year attributable to equity holders 
of the company by 683.3 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year including dilutive 
shares (2014:  683.2 million).
The difference between the weighted average number of shares used in the basic and the diluted earnings per share 
calculations represents those ordinary shares deemed to have been issued for no consideration on the conversion of all 
potential dilutive ordinary shares in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’ .
The weighted average number of shares can be reconciled to the weighted average number of shares including dilutive 
shares as follows:

144 A3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Risk management 
The board is responsible for treasury strategy and governance, which is reviewed on an annual basis. The annual treasury 
strategy review covers (as applicable) the group’s funding, liquidity, capital management and interest rate management 
strategies, along with the delegation of specific funding and hedging authorities to the treasury committee.
The treasury committee, a sub-committee of the board, has responsibility for setting and monitoring the group’s adherence 
to treasury policies, along with oversight in relation to the activities of the treasury function.
Treasury policies cover the key financial risks: liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk (inflation, interest rate, electricity price 
and currency) and capital risk. These policies are reviewed by the treasury committee for approval on at least an annual 
basis, or following any major changes in treasury operations and/or financial market conditions.
Day-to-day responsibility for operational compliance with the treasury policies rests with the treasurer. An operational 
compliance report is provided monthly to the treasury committee, which details the status of the group’s compliance with 
the treasury policies and highlights the level of risk against the appropriate risk limits in place.
The group’s treasury function does not act as a profit centre and does not undertake any speculative trading activity.
Liquidity risk 
The group looks to manage its liquidity risk by maintaining liquidity within a board approved duration range. Liquidity 
is actively monitored by the group’s treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the 
operational compliance report.
At 31 March 2015, the group had £1,244.0 million (2014 restated: £1,015.8 million) of available liquidity, which comprised 
£244.0 million (2014 restated: £115.8 million) cash and short-term deposits, £600.0 million (2014: £500.0 million) of 
undrawn committed borrowing facilities, and £400.0 million (2014: £400.0 million) of undrawn term loan facilities. Short-
term deposits mature within three months and bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The group had available committed borrowing facilities as follows:
Group
2015 
£m
2014 
£m
Expiring within one year 50.0 50.0
Expiring after one year but in less than two years 150.0 50.0
Expiring after more than two years 400.0 400.0
Undrawn borrowing facilities 600.0 500.0
These facilities are arranged on a bilateral rather than a syndicated basis, which spreads the maturities more evenly over 
a longer time period, thereby reducing the refinancing risk by providing several renewal points rather than a large single 
refinancing point.
Company
The company did not have any committed facilities available at 31 March 2015 or 31 March 2014.

Notes:
(1) Forecast future cash flows are calculated, where applicable, utilising forward interest rates based on the interest environment at year-end and are therefore susceptible to changes 
in market conditions. For index-linked debt it has been assumed that RPI will be three per cent over the life of each instrument.
(2) The carrying value of debt is calculated following various methods in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and therefore this adjustment 
reconciles the undiscounted forecast future cash flows to the carrying value of debt in the statement of financial position.
Company
The company has total borrowings of £0.4 million (2014: £1,584.3 million), which are payable within one year, and 
£1,609.4 million (2014: £nil), which are payable within one to two years.

146 A3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Credit risk 
Credit risk arises principally from trading (the supply of services to customers) and treasury activities (the depositing of 
cash and holding of derivative and foreign exchange instruments). The group does not believe it is exposed to any material 
concentrations of credit risk.
The group manages its risk from trading through the effective management of customer relationships. Concentrations of 
credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the group’s customer base consisting of a large number of 
unrelated households and businesses. The Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Industry Act 1999) prohibits 
the disconnection of a water supply and the limiting of supply with the intention of enforcing payment for certain premises 
including domestic dwellings. However, allowance is made by the water regulator in the price limits at each price review for 
a proportion of debt deemed to be irrecoverable. Considering the above, the directors believe there is no further credit risk 
provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables (see note 15).
The group manages its risk from treasury activities by establishing a total credit limit by counterparty, which comprises 
a counterparty credit limit and an additional settlement limit to cover intra-day gross settlement cash flows. In addition, 
potential derivative exposure limits are also established to take account of potential future exposure which may arise under 
derivative transactions. These limits are calculated by reference to a measure of capital and credit ratings of the individual 
counterparties and are subject to a maximum single counterparty limit. A control mechanism to trigger a review of specific 
counterparty limits, irrespective of credit rating action, is in place. This entails daily monitoring of counterparty credit 
default swap levels and/or share price volatility. Credit exposure is monitored daily by the group’s treasury function and is 
reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report. 
At 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, the maximum exposure to credit risk for the group and company is represented by 
the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position:

The credit exposure on derivatives is disclosed gross of any collateral held. At 31 March 2015, the group held £117.5 million 
(2014: £75.0 million) as collateral in relation to derivative financial instruments (included within borrowings in note 17). 
Market risk 
The group’s exposure to market risk primarily results from its financing arrangements and the economic return which it is 
allowed on the regulatory capital value (RCV). 
The group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, in order to manage the exposure to these risks.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Inflation risk
The group earns an economic return on its RCV , comprising a real return through revenues and an inflation return as an uplift 
to its RCV. To the extent that nominal debt liabilities finance a proportion of the RCV, there is an asset liability mismatch 
which potentially exposes the group to the risk of economic loss where actual inflation is lower than that implicitly locked in 
through nominal debt. 
The group’s index-linked borrowings, which are linked to RPI inflation, form an economic hedge of the group’s regulatory 
assets, which are also linked to RPI inflation. In particular, index-linked debt delivers a cash flow benefit compared to 
nominal debt, as the inflation adjustment on the index-linked liabilities is a deferred cash flow until the maturity of each 
financial instrument, providing a better match to the inflation adjustment on the regulated assets, which is recognised as a 
non-cash uplift to the RCV .
In addition, the group’s pension obligations also provide an economic hedge of the group’s regulatory assets. The pension 
schemes’ inflation funding mechanism (see note A4) ensures that future contributions will be flexed for movements in RPI 
and smoothed over a rolling five-year period, providing a natural hedge against any inflationary uplift on the RCV.
The group seeks to manage this risk by identifying opportunities to amend the economic hedge currently in place where 
deemed necessary and subject to relative value. Inflation risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee in the 
operational compliance report.
The carrying value of index-linked debt held by the group is as follows:

Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the 
amount of index-linked debt in place as at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 respectively. As a result, this analysis relates 
to the position at the reporting date and is not indicative of the years then ended, as these factors would have varied 
throughout the year. The following table details the sensitivity of profit before taxation to changes in the RPI on the group’s 
index-linked borrowings:

This table excludes the hedging aspect of the group’s regulatory assets which, being property, plant and equipment, are not 
financial assets as defined by IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and are typically held at cost or deemed cost less 
accumulated depreciation on the consolidated statement of financial position. In addition, the table excludes the hedging 
aspect of the group’s pension obligations.
The analysis assumes a one per cent change in RPI having a corresponding one per cent impact on this position over a 
12-month period. It should be noted, however, that there is a time lag by which current RPI changes impact on the income 
statement, and the analysis does not incorporate this factor. The portfolio of index-linked debt is calculated on either 
a three or eight-month lag basis. Therefore, at the reporting date the index-linked interest and principal adjustments 
impacting the income statement are fixed and based on the annual RPI change either three or eight months earlier.
Company
The company had no material exposure to inflation risk at 31 March 2015 or 31 March 2014.

Interest rate risk
The group’s policy is to structure debt in a way that best matches its underlying assets and cash flows. The group earns an 
economic return on its RCV , comprising a real return through revenues, determined by the real cost of capital fixed by the 
regulator for each five-year regulatory pricing period, and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV.
The preferred form of debt therefore is sterling index-linked debt which incurs fixed interest, in real terms, and forms a 
natural hedge of regulatory assets and cash flows.
Where conventional long-term debt is raised in a fixed-rate form, to manage exposure to long-term interest rates, the debt 
is generally swapped at inception to create a floating rate liability for the term of the liability through the use of interest 
rate swaps. These instruments are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge.
To manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group fixes underlying interest rates on nominal debt out to 
10 years in advance on a reducing balance basis. This is supplemented by managing residual exposure to interest rates 
within the relevant regulatory price control period by fixing substantively all residual floating underlying interest rates 
on projected nominal debt across the immediately forthcoming regulatory period at around the time of the price control 
determination.
The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining its interest rate exposure within a board approved range. Interest rate 
risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the 
amount of net debt and the interest rate hedge positions in place at the reporting date. As a result, this analysis is not 
indicative of the years then ended, as these factors would have varied throughout the year.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the interest sensitivity analysis:
•	 fair value hedge relationships are fully effective;
•	 borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss are effectively hedged by associated swaps;
•	 the sensitivity excludes the impact of interest rates on post-retirement obligations;
•	 management has assessed one per cent as a reasonably possible movement in UK interest rates; and
•	 all other factors are held constant.

Electricity price risk
The group is allowed a fixed amount of revenue by the regulator, in real terms, to cover electricity costs for each five-year 
regulatory pricing period. To the extent that electricity prices remain floating over this period, this exposes the group to 
volatility in its operating cash flows. The group’s policy, therefore, is to manage this risk by fixing a proportion of electricity 
commodity prices in a cost-effective manner.
The group has fixed the price on a substantial proportion of its anticipated net electricity usage out to the end of the AMP in 
2020, partially through entering into electricity swap contracts. 
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the 
amount of the group’s electricity swaps in place at the reporting date and, as a result, this analysis is not indicative of the 
years then ended, as this factor would have varied throughout the year.

Currency risk
Currency exposure principally arises in respect of funding raised in foreign currencies. 
To manage exposure to currency rates, foreign currency debt is hedged into sterling through the use of cross currency 
swaps and these are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge. 
The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining currency exposure within board approved limits. Currency risk in 
relation to foreign currency denominated financial instruments is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the 
operational compliance report.
The group and company have no material net exposure to movements in currency rates.
Capital risk management 
The group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain efficient access to debt capital markets throughout the 
economic cycle. The board therefore believes that it is appropriate to maintain gearing, measured as group consolidated net 
debt to regulatory capital value (RCV) of United Utilities Water Limited (UUW), within a target range of 55 per cent to 65 
per cent. As at 31 March 2015, group consolidated gearing was 59 per cent, which is comfortably within this range. 
Assuming no significant changes to existing rating agencies’ methodologies or sector risk assessments, the group aims to 
maintain, as a minimum, its existing credit ratings of A3 with Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and BBB+ with Standard 
& Poor’s Ratings Services (Standard & Poor’s) for UUW and debt issued by its financing subsidiary, United Utilities Water 
Finance PLC.
In order to maintain existing credit ratings, the group needs to manage its capital structure with reference to the ratings 
methodology and measures used by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The ratings methodology is normally based on a 
number of key ratios (such as RCV gearing, adjusted interest cover and Funds from Operations (FFO) to debt) and threshold 
levels as updated and published from time to time by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The group looks to manage its risk 
by maintaining the relevant key financial ratios used by the credit rating agencies to determine a corporate’s credit rating, 
within the thresholds approved by the board. Capital risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the 
operational compliance report.
Further detail on the precise measures and methodologies used to assess water companies’ credit ratings can be found in 
the methodology papers published by the rating agencies.

Note:
(1) These derivatives form economic hedges and, as such, management intend to hold these through to maturity. Derivatives forming an economic hedge of the currency exposure on 
borrowings included in these balances were £152.2 million (2014: £83.2 million). 
•	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
•	 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable).
The group has calculated fair values using quoted prices where an active market exists, which has resulted in 
£4,672.9 million (2014: £3,179.0 million) of ‘level 1’ fair value measurements. In the absence of an appropriate quoted price, 
the group has applied discounted cash flow valuation models utilising market available data in line with prior years.
In respect of the total change during the year in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through 
profit or loss, of a £65.0 million loss (2014: £32.6 million gain), a £4.6 million loss (2014: £11.1 million) is attributable to 
changes in own credit risk. The cumulative amount recognised in the income statement due to changes in credit spread 
was £59.0 million profit (2014: £63.6 million). The carrying amount is £131.6 million (2014: £66.6 million) higher than the 
amount contracted to settle on maturity.

A4 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Defined benefit schemes
The group participates in two major funded defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom – the United Utilities 
Pension Scheme (UUPS) and the United Utilities PLC group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS), both of which 
are closed to new employees. The assets of these schemes are held in trust funds independent of the group’s finances. 
The trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The trustees are required by law to act in 
the interests of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the 
day-to-day administration of the benefits.
The group also operates a series of unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit schemes. The costs of these schemes are 
included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out below.
Information about the pension arrangements for executive directors is contained in the directors’ remuneration report.
Under the schemes, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement. Benefits are also payable on death and following 
other events such as withdrawing from active service. No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.
The latest actuarial valuations of UUPS and ESPS were carried out as at 31 March 2013. The results of these valuations have 
been adjusted to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ in order to assess the position at 31 March 
2015 by projecting forward from the valuation date by the independent actuary, Aon Hewitt Limited.
Funding requirements
The latest funding valuations of the schemes as at 31 March 2013 reported a deficit. The basis on which liabilities are valued 
for funding purposes differs to the basis required under IAS 19. Under UK legislation there is a requirement that pension 
schemes are funded prudently.
The group has a plan in place with the schemes’ trustees to address the funding deficit by 31 December 2020, through a series 
of annual deficit recovery contributions.
The group and trustees have agreed long-term strategies for reducing investment risk in each scheme.
For UUPS this includes an asset liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension 
plan by investing in assets such as fixed income swaps which perform in line with the liabilities so as to hedge against changes 
in swap yields. For ESPS, a partial hedge is in place to protect against changes in swap yields.
In addition, the group has had an Inflation Funding Mechanism (IFM) in place since 2010; details of this are outlined in the 2011 
annual report. In 2013, it extended the mechanism to the ESPS, and increased the fixed percentage rate used to 3.0 per cent 
per annum from 2.75 per cent per annum. T o the extent that inflation, as measured by the RPI index at each 31 March preceding 
the payment due date, is different from 3.0 per cent per annum, the inflation reserve will increase/decrease. Additional 
contributions are then payable annually based on the size of the inflation reserve. 
The duration of the combined schemes is around 20 years. The schemes’ duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time 
until benefit payments are settled, taking account of the split of the defined benefit obligation between current employees, 
deferred members and the current pensioners of the schemes.
The group expects to make contributions of £55.7 million in the year ending 31 March 2016, comprising £29.2 million to UUPS  
and £4.1 million to ESPS in respect of accelerated deficit repair contributions, and £21.4 million and £1.0 million in respect of 
regular contributions to UUPS and ESPS respectively.
Impact of scheme risk management on IAS 19 disclosures
Under the prescribed IAS 19 basis, pension scheme liabilities are calculated based on current accrued benefits. Expected cash 
flows are projected forward allowing for RPI and the current member mortality assumptions. These projected cash flows are 
then discounted by an AA corporate bond rate, which comprises an underlying interest rate and a credit spread.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A4 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued
The group has de-risked its pension schemes through hedging strategies applied to the underlying interest rate and the 
forecast RPI. The underlying interest rate has been largely hedged through external market swaps, the value of which is 
included in the schemes’ assets, and the forecast RPI has been largely hedged through the IFM, with RPI in excess of 
3.0 per cent per annum being funded through an additional schedule of deficit contribution.
As a consequence, the reported statement of financial position under IAS 19 remains volatile to changes in credit spread which 
have not been hedged, primarily due to the difficulties in doing so over long durations; changes in inflation, as the IFM results 
in changes to the IFM deficit contributions rather than a change in the schemes’ assets; and, to a lesser extent, changes in 
mortality as management has decided not to hedge this exposure due to its lower volatility in the short-term and the relatively 
high hedging costs. 
In contrast, the schemes’ specific funding basis, which forms the basis for regular (non-IFM) deficit repair contributions, is 
unlikely to suffer from volatility due to credit spread or inflation. This is because a prudent, fixed credit spread assumption is 
applied, and inflation-linked contributions are included within the IFM.
In the IAS 19 assessment of financial position at 31 March 2015, price inflation fell by 0.3 per cent and, although the discount 
rate has fallen by 1.2 per cent, this masks a credit spread increase of 0.1 per cent. The price inflation reduction and credit 
spread increase results in substantially all of the reported £256.6 million improvement. During the year ended 31 March 2015, 
there has not been any significant change in the deficits on a scheme specific funding basis that impacts the level of deficit 
repair contributions.
Sensitivity of the key scheme assumptions
The measurement of the group’s defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in key assumptions, which are described 
below. The sensitivity calculations presented below allow for the specified movement in the relevant key assumption, whilst all 
other assumptions are held constant. This approach does not take into account the inter-relationship between some of these 
assumptions or any hedging strategies adopted.
•	 Asset volatility 
If the schemes’ assets underperform relative to the discount rate used to calculate the schemes’ liabilities, this will create a 
deficit. The schemes hold some growth assets (equities, diversified growth funds and emerging market debt) which, though 
expected to outperform the discount rate in the long-term, create volatility in the short-term. The allocation to growth 
assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes’ long-term objectives.
•	 Discount rate 
An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 0.1 per cent would have resulted in a £60.1 million (2014: £49.1 million) 
decrease/increase in the schemes’ liabilities at 31 March 2015, although as long as credit spreads remain stable this will 
be largely offset by an increase in the value of the schemes’ bond holdings and other instruments designed to hedge this 
exposure. The discount rate is based on AA corporate bond yields of a similar duration to the schemes’ liabilities.
•	 Price inflation 
An increase/decrease in the inflation assumption of 0.1 per cent would have resulted in a £56.6 million (2014: £47.0 
million) increase/decrease in the schemes’ liabilities at 31 March 2015, as a significant proportion of the schemes’ 
benefit obligations are linked to inflation. In some cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect 
against extreme inflation. The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning 
that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. Any change in inflation out-turn results in a change to the cash 
contributions provided under the IFM.
•	 Life expectancy 
An increase/decrease in the mortality long-term improvement rate of 0.25 per cent would have resulted in a £36.7 
million (2014: £37.3 million) increase/decrease in the schemes’ liabilities at 31 March 2015. The majority of the schemes’ 
obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and, as such, the schemes’ liabilities are sensitive to these 
assumptions.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP). The UK Government intends 
to implement legislation which could result in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would increase the defined 
benefit obligation of the schemes. At this stage, until the Government develops its proposals and publishes guidance, it is not 
possible to quantify the impact of this change.

Reporting
The results of the latest funding valuations at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted in order to assess the position at 31 March 
2015, by taking account of experience over the period, changes in market conditions, and differences in the financial and 
demographic assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service costs, were 
measured using the projected unit credit method.
The main financial and demographic assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the defined benefit surplus/(obligations) of 
UUPS and ESPS were as follows:
Group
2015 
% pa
2014 
% pa
Discount rate 3.1 4.3
Pensionable salary growth and pension increases 3.0 3.3
Price inflation 3.0 3.3
In assessing the financial assumptions, the group has taken into account the average duration of the schemes’ liabilities. 
Demographic assumptions
Mortality in retirement is assumed to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation’s (CMI) S1NA year of birth 
tables with a one-year age rating for males, reflecting actual mortality experience; and CMI 2014 (2014: CMI 2013)  
long-term improvement factors, with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5 per cent per annum. The current life 
expectancies at age 60 underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the schemes are:
2015 
years
2014 
years
Retired member – male 26.6 26.6
Non-retired member – male 28.3 28.4
Retired member – female 30.2 30.0
Non-retired member – female 32.0 31.9

The fair values in the table above are all based on quoted prices in an active market, where applicable.
The assets, in respect of UUPS, included in the table above, have been allocated to each asset class based on the return 
the assets are expected to achieve as UUPS has entered into a variety of derivative transactions to change the return 
characteristics of the physical assets held in order to reduce undesirable market and liability risks. As such, the breakdown 
shown separates the assets of the schemes to illustrate the underlying risk characteristics of the assets held.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A4 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued
Both of the schemes employ a strategy where the asset portfolio is made up of a growth element and a defensive element. 
Assets in the growth portfolio are shown as equities and other non-equity growth assets above, while assets held in the 
defensive portfolio represent the remainder of the schemes’ assets.
The ‘other’ element of the portfolio is set aside for collateral purposes linked to the derivative contracts entered into, 
as described above. The collateral portfolio, comprising cash and eligible securities which are readily converted to cash, 
provides sufficient liquidity to manage the derivative transactions and is expected to achieve a return in excess of LIBOR.
Movements in the fair value of the schemes’ assets were as follows:
2015

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A6 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial 
statements of the company and entities controlled by the 
company (its subsidiaries), and incorporate the results 
of its share of joint ventures using the equity method of 
accounting. The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in 
the consolidated income statement from the date control 
is obtained or until the date that control ceases, as 
appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used under the relevant local GAAP into line with those used 
by the group.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control is 
achieved where the group is exposed to, or has the rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement in an entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. In the parent company accounts, investments are 
held at cost less provision for impairment.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at 
the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of 
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the group holds an 
interest on a long-term basis and which are jointly controlled 
with one or more parties under a contractual arrangement. 
The group’s share of joint venture results and assets and 
liabilities are incorporated using the equity method of 
accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in a 
joint venture is initially recognised at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognise the group’s share of the profit or 
loss.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of the income receivable 
in the ordinary course of business for goods and services 
provided. Where relevant, this includes an estimate of the 
sales value of units supplied to customers between the date 
of the last meter reading and the period end, exclusive of 
value added tax and foreign sales tax.
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of 
delivery and when collection of the resulting receivable 
is reasonably assured. Should the group consider that 
the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for a 
transaction, revenue recognition would be delayed until 
such time as collectability is reasonably assured. Payments 
received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as 
deferred income.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging operational 
expenses but before investment income and finance 
expense.
Borrowing costs and finance income
Except as noted below, all borrowing costs and finance 
income are recognised in the income statement in the period 
in which they are accrued.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability 
are included in the initial fair value of that instrument.
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs 
are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Taxation
The taxation expense represents the sum of current 
taxation and deferred taxation.
Current taxation
Current taxation is based on the taxable profit for the 
period and is provided at amounts expected to be paid 
or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Current taxation is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the taxation is also dealt 
with in equity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, using 
the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences 
at each reporting date. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where 
the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Notes to the financial statements – appendices
UNITED UTILITIES GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STA TEMENTS 2015
Stock Code: UU.
unitedutilities.com 
158 A6 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary 
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at each reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and is reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the deferred taxation is 
also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprise water and 
wastewater infrastructure assets and overground assets 
(including properties, plant and equipment).
The useful economic lives of these assets are primarily as 
follows:
•	 Water and wastewater infrastructure assets:
 – Impounding reservoirs 200 years;
 – Mains and raw water aqueducts 30 to 300 years;
 – Sewers and sludge pipelines 60 to 300 years;
 – Sea outfalls 77 years;
•	 Buildings 10 to 60 years;
•	 Operational assets 5 to 80 years; and
•	 Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 40 years.
Employee and other related costs incurred in implementing 
the capital schemes of the group are capitalised.
Water and wastewater infrastructure assets
Infrastructure assets comprise a network of water 
and wastewater pipes and systems. Expenditure on 
the infrastructure assets, including borrowing costs 
where applicable, relating to increases in capacity or 
enhancements of the network is treated as additions. 
Amounts incurred in maintaining the operating capability 
of the network in accordance with defined standards of 
service are expensed in the year in which the expenditure is 
incurred. Infrastructure assets are depreciated by writing 
off their cost (or deemed cost for infrastructure assets held 
on transition to IFRS), less the estimated residual value, 
evenly over their useful economic lives.
Other assets
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at 
historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items, including 
relevant borrowing costs, where applicable, for qualifying 
assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are charged to the income statement 
during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are 
not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated by writing 
off their cost, less their estimated residual value, evenly 
over their estimated useful economic lives, based on 
management’s judgement and experience.
Depreciation methods, residual values and useful economic 
lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes 
are accounted for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on 
the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in other operating 
costs.
Transfer of assets from customers and developers
Where the group receives from a customer or developer an 
item of property, plant and equipment (or cash to construct 
or acquire an item of property, plant and equipment) that 
the group must then use, either to connect the customer 
to the network, or to provide the customer with ongoing 
access to a supply of goods or services, or to do both, 
such items are capitalised at their fair value and included 
within property, plant and equipment, with a credit of the 
same amount to deferred grants and contributions. The 
assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives and 
the deferred contributions released to revenue over the 
same period (or where the receipt of property, plant and 
equipment is solely to connect the customer to the network, 
the deferred contribution is released immediately to 
revenue). This interpretation has been applied to transfers 
of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.
Assets transferred from customers or developers are 
accounted for at fair value. If no market exists for the assets 
then incremental cash flows are used to arrive at fair value.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives. The carrying amount is reduced by any 
provision for impairment where necessary.
On a business combination, as well as recording separable 
intangible assets already recognised in the statement of 
financial position of the acquired entity at their fair value, 
identifiable intangible assets that arise from contractual 
or other legal rights are also included in the acquisition 
statement of financial position at fair value.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION GOVERNANCE
159
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A6 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Internal expenditure is capitalised as internally generated 
intangibles only if it meets the criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible 
Assets’ . 
Intangible assets, which relate primarily to computer 
software, are amortised over a period of three to ten years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
Intangible assets with definite useful economic lives 
and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets may have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell, and value in use. Value in use represents the net 
present value of expected future cash flows, discounted 
on a pre-tax basis, using a rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses in 
respect of non-current assets are recognised in the income 
statement within operating costs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
reversal is recognised in the income statement and the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but not so as to exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and 
derecognised on the group’s statement of financial position 
on the trade date when the group becomes/ceases to be a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits include cash at bank and 
in hand, deposits and other short-term highly liquid 
investments which are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash, have a maturity of three months or less 
from the date of acquisition and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in value. In the consolidated 
statement of cash flows and related notes, cash and cash 
equivalents include cash and short-term deposits, net of 
bank overdrafts.
Financial investments
Investments (other than interests in associates, 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and fixed deposits) are initially 
measured at fair value, including transaction costs. 
Investments classified as available for sale in accordance 
with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are measured at subsequent reporting dates 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time 
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity 
is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less 
any impairment for irrecoverable amounts. Estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience  
of the receivables balance.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group 
after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings
The group’s default treatment is that bonds, loans and 
overdrafts are initially measured at fair value being the 
cash proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. They 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost applying 
the effective interest method. The difference between the 
net cash proceeds received at inception and the principal 
cash flows due at maturity is accrued over the term of the 
borrowing.
The default treatment of measuring at amortised cost, 
whilst associated hedging derivatives are recognised at 
fair value, presents an accounting measurement mismatch 
that has the potential to introduce considerable volatility 
to both the income statement and the statement of 
financial position. Therefore, where feasible, the group 
takes advantage of the provisions under IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ to fair value its 
borrowing instruments to reduce this volatility and better 
represent the economic hedges that exist between the 
group’s borrowings and associated derivative contracts.
Notes to the financial statements – appendices
UNITED UTILITIES GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STA TEMENTS 2015
Stock Code: UU.
unitedutilities.com 
160 A6 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Where feasible, the group designates its financial 
instruments within fair value hedge relationships. In 
order to apply fair value hedge accounting, it must be 
demonstrated that the hedging derivative has been, and will 
continue to be, a highly effective hedge of the risk being 
hedged within the applicable borrowing instrument. 
Borrowings designated within a fair value hedge 
relationship
Where designated, bonds and loans are initially measured at 
fair value being the cash proceeds received net of any direct 
issue costs. They are subsequently adjusted for any change 
in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged at each 
reporting date, with the change being charged or credited to 
finance expense in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the 
hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
where the hedge relationship no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting.
Borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss
Designation is made where the requirements to designate 
within a fair value hedge cannot be met at inception despite 
there being significant fair value offset between the 
borrowing and the hedging derivative. Where designated, 
bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value being 
the cash proceeds received and are subsequently measured 
at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair 
value being charged or credited to finance expense in the 
income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair 
value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value 
being charged or credited to finance expense in the income 
statement. The group enters into financial derivatives 
contracts to manage its financial exposure to changes in 
market rates (see note A3).
Derivatives and borrowings – valuation
Where an active market exists, designated borrowings and 
derivatives recorded at fair value are valued using quoted 
market prices. Otherwise, they are valued using a net 
present value valuation model. The model uses applicable 
interest rate curve data at each reporting date to determine 
any floating cash flows. Projected future cash flows 
associated with each financial instrument are discounted to 
the reporting date using discount factors derived from the 
applicable interest curves adjusted for counterparty credit 
risk where appropriate. Discounted foreign currency cash 
flows are converted into sterling at the spot exchange rate 
at each reporting date. Assumptions are made with regard 
to credit spreads based on indicative pricing data.
The valuation of debt designated in a fair value hedge 
relationship is calculated based on the risk being hedged 
as prescribed by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’ . The group’s policy is to hedge its 
exposure to changes in the applicable underlying interest 
rate and it is this portion of the cash flows that is included 
in the valuation model (excluding any applicable company 
credit risk spread).
The valuation of debt designated at fair value through the 
profit or loss incorporates an assumed credit risk spread 
in the applicable discount factor. Credit spreads are 
determined based on indicative pricing data.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. For properties held for resale, cost 
includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites, 
including borrowing costs where applicable.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Employee benefits
Retirement benefit obligations
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, 
which are independent of the group’s finances, for its 
employees. Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried 
out as determined by the pension scheme trustees using 
the projected unit credit method at intervals of not more 
than three years, the rates of contribution payable and 
the pension cost being determined on the advice of the 
actuaries, having regard to the results of these valuations. 
In any intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing 
appropriateness of the contribution rates.
Defined benefit assets are measured at fair value while 
liabilities are measured at present value. The difference 
between the two amounts is recognised as a surplus or 
obligation in the statement of financial position.
The cost of providing pension benefits to employees 
relating to the current year’s service (including curtailment 
gains and losses) is included within the income statement 
within employee benefits expense. The net interest on 
the schemes’ surplus/obligation is included in the income 
statement within investment income or finance expense.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised outside 
the income statement in retained earnings and presented in 
the statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, the group also operates a defined contribution 
pension section within the United Utilities Pension Scheme. 
Payments are charged as employee costs as they fall due. 
The group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION GOVERNANCE

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A6 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Share-based compensation arrangements
The group operates equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, issued to certain employees. The 
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest. Fair value is based on simulation 
models, according to the relevant measures of performance. 
The group has the option to settle some of these equity-
settled share-based payments in cash.
At each reporting date, the group revises its estimate of the 
number of options that are expected to become exercisable 
with the impact of any revision being recognised in the 
income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to 
equity over the remaining vesting period.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Expenditure that relates to an existing condition 
caused by past operations that does not contribute to 
current or future earnings is expensed. 
Foreign currency translation
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
exchange rates applicable on the dates of the transactions. 
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the relevant rates of exchange applicable on that 
date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included 
in net profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences 
arising on investments in equity instruments classified as 
available for sale are included in the gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value which are recognised directly in 
equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange 
risks, the group enters into derivative instruments (see 
note A3).
Group companies
On consolidation, the statements of financial position of 
overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures (none of which has 
the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) are translated 
into sterling at exchange rates applicable at each reporting 
date. The income statements are translated into sterling 
using the average rate unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly in which case the exchange rate at the date 
the transaction occurred is used. Exchange differences 
resulting from the translation of such statements of 
financial position at rates ruling at the beginning and end of 
the period, together with the differences between income 
statements translated at average rates and rates ruling at 
the period end, are dealt with as movements on the group’s 
cumulative exchange reserve, a separate component of 
equity. Such translation differences are recognised as 
income or expense in the period in which the operation is 
disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing 
rate. The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
implementation of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (1 April 
1999) as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Grants and contributions
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of property, 
plant and equipment are treated as deferred income, which 
is credited to the income statement over the estimated 
useful economic lives of the related assets.
Leases
Leases are classified according to the substance of the 
transaction. Operating leases are leases that do not 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
lease.

Dividends paid direct to your bank
Why not make life easy and 
have your dividends paid 
straight into your bank?
•	 The dividend goes directly into 
your bank account and is available  
straight away
•	 No need to pay dividend cheques 
into your bank account
•	 No risk of losing cheques in the 
post
•	 No risk of having to replace spoiled 
or out-of-date cheques
•	 It’s cost-effective for your 
company
To take advantage of this, please 
contact Equiniti via shareview.co.uk 
or complete the dividend mandate 
form that you receive with your next 
dividend cheque.
If you choose to have your dividend 
paid directly into your bank account 
you’ll receive one tax voucher each 
year. This will be issued with the 
interim dividend normally paid in 
February and will contain details of 
all the dividends paid in that tax year. 
If you’d like to receive a tax voucher 
with each dividend payment, please 
contact Equiniti.

Class’ status in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability index for the seventh 
consecutive year and, for the first time, 
we became leader in the multi-utility

ever result in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project and are now members of the

secured the Carbon Trust Water 
Standard for our efforts to reduce 
water use in West Cumbria.

Chairman’s Statement
Alexander Abramov
Dear Stakeholders,
It gives me much pleasure to present our 
Annual Report for 2012. 
The year 2012 proved to be another 
challenging phase for the global steelmaking 
industry which operated in a highly uncertain 
and volatile environment. Despite this, EVRAZ 
delivered creditable operational and financial 
results which serve to illustrate the intrinsic 
resilience of the Company.
Corporate governance
Since our admission to the FTSE 100 in 
December 2011, we have undertaken a 
number of initiatives to further strengthen  
our corporate governance. These include the 
adoption of a new Code of Business Conduct 
which is currently being embedded across the 
Group, together with specific anti-corruption 
policies and initiatives designed to ensure 
compliance with the UK Bribery Act, including 
improved training and the implementation  
of refined internal procedures for employees. 
Furthermore, we have strengthened our  
Board with the appointment of Alexander 
Izosimov as an independent Non-Executive 
Director in February 2012, thereby increasing 
the ratio of independent Directors on the 
Board to 50%. We have also introduced 
changes to the composition of the Audit  
and Remuneration Committees in order  
to accommodate a better representation  
of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
I have every confidence that the professional 
experience, leadership skills, integrity  
and balance of interests reflected in the 
membership of the current Board and 
Committees represents the right blend to 
promote the development of the Company and 
set ambitious challenges for management. 
As the Chairman of the Board I fully recognise 
the importance of ensuring that my fellow 
Directors understand and take into account 
the views of our investors while deliberating 
Board decisions. In order to facilitate and 
strengthen the relations and communication 
between shareholders and the Board,  
Sir Michael Peat, our Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, began a programme  
of proactive communications with our major 
investors. In particular, Sir Michael has held  
a number of meetings with representatives  
of large investment funds which have been 
mandated to vote and/or engage in dialogue 
on behalf of investment institutions on 
matters related to corporate governance  
and sustainability.
Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”)
Regretfully, the number of fatalities increased 
in the reporting year despite such focus and 
our ongoing investment in safety programmes. 
Sadly, there were some additional fatalities 
since the beginning of 2013. This experience 
reinforces my view that the Board still has 
much to do to drive the all-important changes 
to mindsets and safety culture within our 
operations. We remain committed to further 
improvements in the Company’s HSE policies 
alongside increased training for employees 
and a continuation of our zero-tolerance policy 
with regard to non-compliance with safety 
rules. Led by the Board’s HSE Committee,  
we have already drawn up additional 
programmes to mitigate the risk of such 
accidents in the future and the Board will 
continue to provide leadership in this area, 
monitoring HSE performance and working 
closely with management.
Furthermore we are fostering and overseeing  
a programme which will result in a more 
comprehensive level of non-financial reporting, 
including the publication of greenhouse gas 
emissions in anticipation of the introduction  
of the new UK regulation. Our intention is to 
create a sound platform designed to ensure 
responsible and sustainable development  
on the part of the Company. 
Strategy
The Board’s priorities in the prevailing 
business climate were to preserve the 
Company’s long-term competitive advantages 
and protect shareholder value in the face of 
diverse potential macroeconomic scenarios. 
Having reviewed and refined our strategic 
development plan we chose to concentrate our 
efforts on programmes designed to promote 
operational excellence at existing facilities, 
while adhering to strict capital disciplines  
with regard to new projects.
We are approaching the conclusion of a major 
modernisation programme at our Russian 
steelmaking facilities and are currently 
commissioning a number of mining projects. 
One of the principal highlights related  
to the purchase of a controlling interest in  
the Raspadskaya coking coal company, a 
transaction that establishes EVRAZ as the 
largest producer of coking coal in Russia.  
The approximately US$964 million acquisition, 
which will yield major benefits through 
enhanced vertical integration, was primarily 
funded through equity, thereby avoiding a 
commensurate cash outflow. The transaction 
was successfully completed in mid-January 
2013. A key objective for the Board during 
2013 is to ensure the smooth integration of 
Raspadskaya into EVRAZ’s operating model 
and the maximisation of operational synergies.
We constantly monitor the progress of major 
investment projects versus initial expectations 
and external market factors, a process that 
allows us to maintain flexibility in conjunction 
with our long term approach of sustaining  
a balance between financial stability, growth 
and shareholder returns. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Overview Strategy Operating Review
Corporate  
Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
In addition, management continued to focus 
on streamlining our business model and 
assessing options designed to increase free 
cash flow. In line with this, we disposed of 
EvrazTrans, a transport subsidiary, to a third 
party for cash consideration of approximately 
US$306 million. This divestment enabled us 
to exit from a non-core asset while securing 
our transportation needs for the foreseeable 
future on advantageous terms. The Board 
intends to pursue further attractive 
opportunities to improve return on capital 
employed. We gave careful consideration  
to the performance of our assets and the 
strategic options available and decided to 
classify certain underperforming assets as 
assets-held-for-sale, namely EVRAZ Vitkovice 
Steel and EVRAZ Highveld Steel and 
Vanadium, thereby paving the way for ongoing 
options. In March 2013 we made the next 
step in this process by announcing the 
execution of a non-binding term sheet on  
the sale of our stake in EVRAZ Highveld  
to a consortium of South African investors.
Dividends
In 2012, EVRAZ continued to make dividend 
payments in line with the Company’s stated 
dividend policy of targeting a long-term  
average dividend payout ratio of at least  
25% of consolidated net profit adjusted for 
non-recurring items. In July 2012, following 
shareholder approval at the AGM, EVRAZ  
paid a final dividend in respect of 2011 in the 
amount of 17 cents per share (US$228 million 
in total). In addition, in August 2012, EVRAZ’s 
Board declared an interim dividend of 11 cents 
per share (US$147 million in total) based  
on the results for the first half of 2012. The 
Board, having reviewed the results in respect 
of the financial year to 31 December 2012  
and after taking into account the substantial 
deterioration in the respective prices of steel 
and steel raw materials towards the year-end, 
has decided to forgo the recommendation  
of a final dividend in respect of 2012 in order 
to preserve the financial standing of the 
Company and provide greater flexibility to 
manage the current market environment. 
EVRAZ’s 20th anniversary
Two decades ago my partners and I set  
up a small trading house which has evolved 
into one of the largest global steelmaking 
companies in the world with operations 
spanning four continents and seven countries. 
The scale of growth and the success of the 
Company would have been inconceivable had 
it not been for the hard work and dedicated 
support of our stakeholders – shareholders, 
employees, clients and trading partners.  
I would like to take this opportunity to  
express the Board’s sincere appreciation  
and congratulate you all on this shared 
anniversary. I am confident that the Company 
is well placed to continue to deliver value  
to all stakeholders through the delivery  
of operational excellence and sound  
financial results.

conﬁdence that  
the professional

to promote the

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Report
Dear Stakeholders,
The year 2012 was characterised by challenging 
trading conditions for the global steelmaking 
industry. Although some recovery was seen 
during the first half of the year, there was a 
significant deterioration in sentiment towards  
the year end. As a result, steel and raw material 
markets remained highly volatile with global  
steel industry capacity experiencing substantial 
underutilisation.
The subdued steel and raw materials pricing 
environment took its toll on EVRAZ’s financial 
performance. Although the Company 
demonstrated respectable operating results,  
we experienced a 10% decline in revenues to 
US$14,726 million against 2011, while EBITDA 
was 31% lower at US$2,012 million.
Overview of Health, Safety  
and Environmental performance
Throughout 2012 we brought a strong focus  
to bear on safety and risk management but, 
although we have made some progress in this 
area over recent years, we still have a long way  
to go. 
In order to improve the accuracy of our statistics 
in respect of lost time incidents we pursued a 
rigorous policy of zero-tolerance with regard to  
the concealment and/or misrepresentation of 
health and safety incidents throughout the year. 
Although the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
indicator showed an increase in 2012 compared 
with 2011, we believe that this partly reflected 
the consequent increase in reporting activity. 
However, I am firmly of the opinion that the 
efforts brought to bear by management on health 
and safety issues, typified by an intensified focus 
on the thorough investigation of all incidents prior 
to the implementation of necessary corrective 
actions across the Group, will ultimately lead  
to sustainable improvement in this area. 
Tragically, we recorded 25 separate fatal 
accidents at our operations in 2012 and 6 more 
since the beginning of 2013. We continue to 
implement additional training and improve our 
HSE culture to ensure that relevant issues are 
addressed in a timely and adequate manner.  
The underlying causes of any accidents are  
now evaluated and shortcomings addressed  
on a more consistent basis, with the ultimate 
objective of operating a zero harm environment. 
Our current priority is to appreciably heighten  
our employees’ awareness and understanding  
of HSE issues at all levels.
2012 market environment  
and business performance
During 2012 the global macro environment 
remained highly imbalanced and uncertain  
in both the emerging and developed markets. 
Many countries faced deep financial issues, 
encompassing the sovereign debt crisis and 
economic difficulties in the Eurozone, uncertainty 
in relation to the fiscal cliff in the US and a 
slowdown in the Chinese economy, particularly 
during the second half of the year, all of which 
weighed on world markets. As a result, overall 
world economic growth decelerated in the 
reporting year.
The negative macro sentiment affected almost  
all commodity markets, with the steel market 
proving no exception. The demand outlook  
for steel products deteriorated substantially 
during the course of the year. Volatility in 
steelmaking raw material prices promoted 
caution and led to destocking on the part  
of market participants. 
As a result of these factors, a promising start  
to 2012 gave way to a year characterised by 
challenges and we are therefore cautious about 
near-term prospects. However, EVRAZ’s strong 
competitive cost base, superior operating 
efficiency and flexible investment programme 
enable me to view the Company’s long-term 
outlook with confidence.
Steel segment
Global steel prices continued to soften 
throughout much of 2012 with steel demand 
subdued as a result of the uncertain 
macroeconomic environment. Despite this,  
we continued to run our Russian and North 
American steelmaking facilities at high levels  
of utilisation due to the cost efficient nature  
of our operations and the resilience of some  
of our niche products.
EVRAZ derives significant benefits from  
its ability to adjust production plans and 
strategically adapt output to meet market 
conditions. The location of key steelmaking 
facilities allows the Company to efficiently  
deliver steel products to Russia, CIS, Asia  
and Middle East regions, thus taking full 
advantage of a favourable situation in a  
particular geographical market. In Russia  
we decreased the ratio of export sales  
during 2012 in order to take advantage  
of the ongoing momentum in steel demand  
from the domestic construction industry.
Good progress was made in terms of our 
commercial objectives and management’s  
focus on maintaining our position as a low  
cost producer was reflected in the ongoing 
implementation of pulverised coal injection (PCI).
We also undertook a large scale modernisation 
programme in our railway product group which 
necessitated the suspension of operations at the 
EVRAZ ZSMK rail mill from April 2012 to January 
2013. The rail mill is now fully operational and,  
as a result, EVRAZ has increased its overall rail 
capacity in Russia to 1.5 million tonnes per 
annum and improved the quality and other 
characteristics of the rails produced. In addition, 
we established a separate division for railway 
products in order to concentrate the operational 
and sales effort, as well as to focus on product 
development in this important market. 
We also derive considerable benefits from  
the favourable locations of our steel facilities  
in the Western US and Canada which allow  
us to offer customers shorter lead times than 
competitors and save on transportation costs. 
This proved particularly important during 2012 
when demand in North America remained  
strong, especially for rails, while regional prices 
for tubular products also held firm. We have 
successfully implemented our expansion into 
high value added steel products (such as head 
hardened rails, premium connection OCTG tubes 
and heat treated seamless pipe) and we also 
succeeded in increasing the internal supply  
of steel slabs in Russia to serve our operations  
in Europe and North America.
Poor end-user sentiment continued to dominate 
European markets as the weak economic outlook 
and financial uncertainty persisted amid attempts 
to find a solution to the Eurozone debt crisis.
Our performance in South Africa during 2012  
was negatively impacted by industrial action, 
which interrupted production in mid-year before 
giving way to a prolonged ramp up period. Overall 
demand for steel in the African region proved 
sluggish. As part of our continued effort to 
improve allocation of capital, we decided to 
dispose of our South African steel operation – 
EVRAZ Highveld and signed a non-binding term 
sheet in March 2013. 
While we expect 2013 to continue to provide challenging 
short-term risks, we are committed to investing in our 
future growth by increasing mining volumes, improving 
our product mix and reducing costs. EVRAZ plc

Mining segment
During the year we completed a number of 
significant initiatives which, we believe, will 
secure cost efficient long-term supplies of  
iron ore and coking coal for our core Russian 
steelmaking facilities. 
We achieved a solid performance in iron ore, 
reflected in relatively flat production year-on-year, 
together with the continuation of a high 
self-coverage ratio. The principal highlight was 
the successful ramp up of EVRAZ KGOK to 56 
million tonnes of iron ore per annum (9.7 million 
tonnes of saleable products) -- the lowest cost 
asset in the Company’s iron ore mining portfolio. 
This was accompanied by a number of initiatives 
designed to reduce costs and optimise iron ore 
mining operations. For more detailed information 
please refer to pages 43 to 44.
Coking coal production increased with our 
Yuzhkuzbassugol coal mining subsidiary 
producing 8.5 million tonnes of raw coking coal in 
2012 compared with 6.3 million tonnes in 2011. 
This is the result of continued management focus 
on operational improvements at all of our coal 
mining operations. For more detailed information 
please refer to pages 46 to 48.
Construction of the new Yerunakovskaya VIII 
coking coal mine, which enjoys a nameplate 
capacity of 2.5 million tonnes of raw coal per 
annum, was completed in 2012. We expect  
the mine, which was commissioned in February 
2013, to ramp up to full production in 2014. 
We have also secured project financing for the 
development of Phase I of the Mezhegey coal 
deposit which will serve to increase EVRAZ’s 
production of hard coking coal by a further  
1.5 million tonnes per annum. Mezhegey will 
produce hard coking coal which is in short  
supply in the Kuzbass region of Russia.  
In addition, Mezhegey benefits from a relatively 
low methane content resulting in improved  
safety and cost performance.
One of the major developments of 2012  
was the agreement to purchase a controlling 
interest in Raspadskaya, one of Russia’s  
largest independent coking coal companies,  
a transaction which closed in January 2013.  
The consideration largely comprised EVRAZ 
equity, a factor that served to lower cash outflow.  
I have every confidence that the purchase of 
Raspadskaya will secure the long-run low cost 
position of EVRAZ’s coking coal business while, 
at the same time, providing us with a strategic 
option to increase volumes with relative ease. 
Consequent to the acquisition of Raspadskya, 
EVRAZ’s self-coverage in coking coal surpassed 
100% and our intention is to deliver excess 
coking coal production to the market, while 
securing those grades of coal which are in  
deficit for our operations.
Vanadium segment
In 2012 we continued to be the only major 
producer of vanadium in Russia with an important 
share of the global market. Overall, EVRAZ’s 
vanadium business experienced a mixed year, 
with labour issues in South Africa and shortages 
of third party feedstock in the United States 
impacting negatively, while Russian operations 
ran at full utilisation rates to meet demand. 
Embedding a new culture throughout EVRAZ
We began the critical process of changing the 
Company’s culture through the introduction of  
the EVRAZ Business System (“EBS”) in 2011. 
EBS represents a radical transformation of  
the way EVRAZ conducts its business and I am 
delighted to report that we made good progress 
in embedding this new methodology across our 
operations in 2012. 
By way of example, I would like to cite two  
pilot areas at EVRAZ ZSMK which were chosen 
for the implementation of a new maintenance 
system – a section in both the long product  
rolling mill and the blooming mill – where more 
efficient organisation of work processes resulted 
in enhanced productivity and savings on spare 
parts and the optimisation of stocks which 
amounted, in total, to more than RUB121 million 
(US$4 million).
Another successful example is EVRAZ KGOK, 
where the repair times in certain shops were 
drastically reduced and productivity improvement 
projects have led to savings of approximately 
RUB37 million (US$1.2 million). For more detailed 
information on the results achieved through the 
utilisation of EBS please refer to pages 24 to 25.
Capital expenditure, debt position and liquidity
In 2012, capital expenditure totalled US$1.3 
billion with development capex mainly channelled 
to the development of the Yerunakovskaya VIII 
mine (US$135 million), PCI projects at Russian 
steelmaking facilities (US$109 million), the major 
rail mill modernisation programme at EVRAZ 
ZSMK (US$143 million) and the construction  
of mini-mills in the south of Russia and in 
Kazakhstan (US$72 million). 
As at the year end, our total debt amounted  
to US$8.2 billion with cash of US$2.1 billion 
(including short-term financial assets). This allows 
us to comfortably fulfil scheduled redemptions  
of US$1.1 billion in 2013. The current liquidity 
position underpins the manageable debt 
structure of the Company with the next major 
debt maturities scheduled for Q4 2014. 
Nevertheless, we continued to consider new 
funding options during the year, including the 
US$195 million project finance loan obtained for 
the development of the Mezhegey coal project 
Phase I. The structure of this loan provides for 
proper risk mitigation in respect of the enterprise, 
while enhancing the overall investment profile of 
the Company.
During the year we also continued to streamline 
the structure of our public debt covenants 
through the removal of a net leverage ratio 
maintenance covenant under a Eurobond issue, 
which served to align this issue with other 
Eurobond issues. 
2013 Outlook
Despite a positive start to 2013 in certain 
international steel markets we remain  
cautious with regard to the outlook for steel. 
Notwithstanding some recent signs of 
stabilisation, global prospects remain fragile,  
with strong downside risks and volatility likely  
to persist throughout the year. As a result,  
both producers and customers are waiting for 
clearer indications of sustainable trends.
Due to our attractive position on the global  
cost curve, we anticipate that our steelmaking 
facilities will continue to operate at high 
utilisation rates and, as a result, we expect our 
steel production volumes in 2013 to be broadly  
in line with the 2012 performance. Steel prices 
have been volatile since the beginning of the year 
while iron ore price has grown moderately, coking 
coal price stagnated. We are anticipating an 
uptick in the demand of steel construction 
products in the Russian market as the new 
construction season approaches.
Stock levels are well managed across our 
business. Export sales volumes are currently 
booked for over one month’s production and 
inventories at traders and at our mills and ports 
remain low.
In 2013, we expect to reduce capex spending  
by ca. 10% vs. 2012, as we approach the 
completion of key investment projects.  
The Company maintains sufficient flexibility  
in its investment plans to be able to respond 
adequately to a potential worsening of the macro 
environment.
While we expect 2013 to continue to provide 
challenging short-term risks, we are committed  
to investing in our future growth by increasing 
mining volumes, improving our product mix and 
reducing costs. Although the full benefit of these 
investments will be realised in the medium to 
long-term, we anticipate some positive impact  
in 2013.
EVRAZ’s leaders were ambitious in their plans  
for the Company when they founded the 
enterprise 20 years ago. Although the scale  
of the Company’s operations has grown 
considerably since then, we retain the same 
ambitions to develop EVRAZ into one of the most 
prominent steel producers in the world. EVRAZ 
enjoys a strong array of inter-aligned assets 
which leaves us well positioned to achieve our 
long-term objective of maximising shareholder 
value through a balance of investment, financial 
stability and dividend distributions. I would  
like to congratulate all our stakeholders on  
this anniversary and thank each of you for  
your ongoing support for management’s efforts 
and development plans.

Market Review
Global economic growth of 3.3%  
in 2012 was primarily driven by the 
BRICs countries, and in particular  
China and India, which grew by 7.6% 
and 5.1% respectively. In contrast, 
macroeconomic conditions in 
developed countries remained 
challenging with the EU-27 economy 
contracting 0.5% while the US economy 
demonstrated a modest improvement 
with growth of 2%.
During 2012, global industrial output mirrored 
the overall strong GDP growth within emerging 
markets, while in developed markets industrial 
production levels were weaker. 
The contrasting economic conditions between 
the developed world and emerging markets 
have resulted in the latter becoming the main 
driver of demand for commodities including 
iron ore, coal and steel. This trend has been 
especially pronounced in China and Asia in 
general, where a number of significant 
infrastructure development projects are 
underway, and is expected to continue during 
2013. 
Economic growth in developed countries is 
expected to rebound in 2013, driven by the 
continuing recovery in the USA, where markets 
for housing, vehicles and consumer products 
are starting to show positive momentum.

Steel Industry in 2012
The global steel industry in 2012 
remained structurally oversupplied, with 
average global utilisation rates below 
80%. As a result steel prices significantly 
softened during 2012, especially in the 
second half of the year. 
Steel producers were heavily exposed to the 
European Union, where the continuing debt  
crisis impacted heavily on industrial activity and 
apparent steel consumption. More broadly, the 
market developments in numerous segments of 
the global steel industry were uneven and varied 
greatly between different geographical markets. 
While emerging markets were enjoying healthier 
demand growth, steelmakers in the developed 
world were focusing on differentiation through  
the production of more niche products.
According to Metall Expert consumption of long 
products in Russia increased in 2012 by 8.8%, 
including increases in rebar and beam 
consumption by 19%. The main drivers of the 
growth in consumption were construction (+13% 
y-o-y), fabrication of metal structures (+13%) and 
seamless pipes (+8%). The Russian construction 
sector is expected to grow by 4% in 2013, which 
will continue supporting Russian steel demand, 
with overall apparent consumption of steel 
anticipated to exceed 22 million tonnes based  
on estimates from CRU (+5%).
In the United States consumption of long 
products, one of EVRAZ’s key product groups, 
grew by over 10% compared to 2011. Restocking 
efforts throughout the supply chain and 
heightened end-user demand contributed to a 
sharp increase in US long product consumption 
during the first part of 2012. However these gains 
were partially offset by intensified US market 
uncertainty, towards the middle and end of the 
year, due to ongoing concerns surrounding the 
Eurozone debt crisis and economic deceleration in 
China. In 2013, US steel consumption growth is 
expected to exceed the rest of developed world, 
including the EU and Japan.
Growth in the large diameter gas pipeline market 
in North America remained constrained as low 
natural gas prices have led to a reduction in 
natural gas drilling activity, with a 44% decrease in 
active gas rigs compared to 2011, according to 
data from Baker Hughes. Should the US 
Government approve legislation to allow liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) exports, demand for natural gas 
pipelines over the next 3-5 years should be 
spurred.
Imports of oil country tubular goods (OCTG) to the 
US were up 25% in 2012 from 2,608 thousand 
tonnes to 3,258 thousand tonnes, and accounted 
for approximately 55% of the US OCTG 
consumption according to Pipelogix. The reliance 
by the USA on OCTG imports provides the potential 
for substitution with locally made products, as 
produced by EVRAZ in North America. world crude steel production

Iron ore production in 2012
1.8bt
While iron ore market volumes 
remained largely flat in 2012, prices 
deteriorated throughout the year as a 
result of the subdued demand from the 
steel industry. Destocking of both steel 
and raw materials throughout the 
majority of 2012 also put further 
downward pressure on prices.
The seaborne market is the largest constituent 
of global trade in iron ore, with an overall 
volume of 1.1 billion tonnes in 2012. China 
dominates seaborne demand with imports of 
720 million tonnes in 2012, while Australia 
and Brazil are the largest exporters of iron ore. 
During 2012, Chinese imports grew more 
rapidly than consumption, as the lower pricing 
environment resulted in the displacement of 
some higher cost domestic tonnage. 
On the supply side, the Australian producers 
continued to ramp-up production volumes, 
with an increase of 8% compared to 2011, 
which offset the respective 9% and 27% falls 
in Chinese and Indian production. 
On the supply side, the Australian producers 
continued to ramp-up production volumes, 
with an increase of 8% compared to 2011, 
which offset the respective 9% and 27% fall  
in Chinese and Indian production.
The benchmark price for China CFR iron ore 
fines fell by 23% in 2012 as global steel 
production growth stalled and major 
steelmakers continued to rely on inventories  
to sustain near term production volumes. Iron 
ore prices reached a low of under US$90/t  
in September 2012, although had recovered 
to above US$140/t by December 2012, 
following an improved near term pricing 
outlook as a result of increased restocking 
and a further slump in Indian iron ore  
export levels.

Total coking coal exports in 2012
294mt
In 2012 the global coking coal market 
remained in oversupply, as price 
settlements above US$300/t in prior 
years had created more incremental 
supply than the market has been able 
to absorb. In addition to increased 
supply, the environment of high prices 
caused a structural shift in the 
steelmaking industry with steelmakers 
researching new technologies to limit 
consumption of coking coal by 
replacing it with cheaper coal grades, 
such as PCI coal.
All major coking coal exporting countries 
added capacity in 2012, with Australia, which 
represents nearly half of total global exports, 
up 8% to 144 million tonnes, North America up 
5% to 95 million tonnes and Russia up 13% to 
16 million tonnes. In addition to increased 
supply from the established producers, 2012 
also saw the emergence of two new frontier 
coking coal suppliers – Mongolia and 
Mozambique, which jointly added 5 million 
tonnes of incremental supply. Overall global 
coking coal exports increased by 8% in 2012 
to 294 million tonnes.
Coking coal import growth was relatively 
subdued during 2012, with volumes up just 
3%, to 278 million tonnes, and largely flat 
compared to 2010 levels. China and India 
accounted for 31% of global coal imports in 
2012 and remained the key drivers of demand 
growth, with import levels increasing by 15% 
(51 million tonnes) and 8% (36 million tonnes) 
respectively during the year. In other regions, 
imports of coking coal either remained flat or 
decreased compared to 2011 levels.
Market imbalance and excess supply of coking 
coal continued to put downward pressure on 
prices in 2012, with the benchmark price of 
contract and spot FOB Australian HCC falling 
by nearly 30% over the course of the year to 
US$170/t.

V anadium Market in 2012 
Vanadium is predominantly used as an 
alloying agent to increase the strength 
of steel. Nearly 85% of the vanadium 
used in this process is ferrovanadium, 
which is used as an alloying agent for 
iron and steel, while vanadium 
pentoxide is used as a catalyst for the 
production of sulphuric acid. Vanadium 
demand is heavily aligned with levels of 
steel production, particularly high-
strength steel grades.
Global vanadium demand in 2012 was 
estimated at 81,000 tonnes with 92% 
consumed in the steel industry. 
Vanadium production in 2012 was estimated 
at 70,000 tonnes with China supplying nearly 
half of global production. 
Market imbalances drawing on the large 
volumes of inventories continued to provide 
pricing support throughout 2012. 
Ferrovanadium prices recorded an average 
20% increase in 2012 and reached a high of 
US$28/kg at the end of December (European 
Fe-V price).

EVRAZ’s Business Model
The health and safety of its employees is the 
primary focus of all decision making at EVRAZ. 
The Company also places great emphasis  
on the recruitment and development of its 
workforce, as this provides the backbone  
for all of EVRAZ’s operations.
EVRAZ’s value chain 
1. Iron ore
EVRAZ’s iron ore supplies are fully vertically 
integrated for its key steelmaking facilities. 
The Company mines and processes iron ore to 
produce high quality marketable concentrate. 
EVRAZ’s iron ore assets are located close to 
the Company’s steelmaking facilities which 
minimises associated transportation costs. 
EVRAZ is currently 100% self-covered in  
iron ore.
2. Coking coal
EVRAZ is a leading coking coal producer in 
Russia. The Company operates underground 
mines and processing plants in Kuzbass, the 
primary coking coal region of Russia. EVRAZ 
consumes a proportion of the coking coal 
produced at its core steelmaking plants in CIS 
and the remainder is sold domestically or 
exported to Asia and Europe. As part of the 
Company’s drive for increased coking coal self-
coverage, EVRAZ acquired a controlling stake 
in the Raspadskaya coal mining company. On 
a pro forma basis, coking coal self-coverage of 
the combined entity would have been about 
142% in 2012.
3. Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the core of EVRAZ’s business. 
The Company produces steel from proprietary 
iron ore and coking coal, as well as collected 
scrap. Due to the close proximity of its raw 
materials base and efficient operation of its 
steelmaking plants, EVRAZ produces high 
quality steel at a low cost. Semi-finished steel 
products can be further rolled into finished 
products at EVRAZ’s worldwide processing 
facilities or sold to third parties in Europe,  
Asia and Middle East.
4. Rolling 
EVRAZ specialises in production of 
construction (long) steel products in CIS. 
These products, including rebar and H-beams 
are used for construction of bridges, stadiums, 
offices and residential buildings. EVRAZ is 
also a world leader in railway products both  
in terms of quality and volume produced. 
5. Sales
The Company strives to market its products 
directly at local and international markets.  
This gives EVRAZ an in-depth understanding of 
its customers’ needs and the opportunity to 
rapidly adjust production volumes to market 
trends.
6. Vanadium 
Vanadium is a valuable ferroalloy which is 
added to steel in order to make it stronger. 
Due to the unique geological characteristics of 
EVRAZ’s iron ore reserves in Russia and South 
Africa the Company is able to extract 
vanadium from by-products at its steelmaking 
plants at very low cost. 
EVRAZ creates value by processing its proprietary mineral resources  
into high-end steel products for its large scale global infrastructure  
clients. Efficient operations, continued pursuit of economically attractive  
asset development and search for value-enhancing M&A transactions  
are the fundamental features of EVRAZ’s approach.
Distinctive capabilities and sources  
of competitive advantages
Proprietary mineral resource base
Historically EVRAZ’s operations were designed 
as a single production chain consisting of  
a proprietary mineral resource base and  
a steelmaking facility. EVRAZ’s steelmaking 
plants are the most natural consumers of  
the Company’s own iron ore and coking coal 
as they are have been designed to process 
unique components of the raw materials  
and are located in close proximity to the 
resource base.
Unique product mix  
& presence in key markets
EVRAZ produces a superior portfolio of 
products, and is the leading producer of 
construction steel products in the CIS,  
a global player in railway products and a major 
constituent of the North American tubular 
product market. The Company creates value 
by applying its technical expertise to the 
production of high quality steel products, for 
sophisticated applications, and to secure 
market leading positions. The Company’s 
production facilities are located close to key 
markets, reducing transportation costs, 
decreasing working capital requirements and 
allowing EVRAZ to react flexibly and swiftly to 
changes in customers’ requirements.
Geographical diversiﬁcation
EVRAZ’s operations are spread over 7 
countries in 4 continents. The Company’s 
global presence provides it with the ability  
to monitor market developments both along 
the production chain and geographically.  
This ability has become especially important 
following the divergence of economic growth 
and steel consumption between developed 
and emerging markets over recent years.
Low cost & efﬁcient operations 
The major steelmaking facilities of EVRAZ are 
located in CIS, which is structurally a low cost 
region for steel production due to low prices 
on key inputs such as gas and labour. This 
provides EVRAZ an opportunity to create value 
when exporting steel produced in CIS to either 
proprietary rolling facilities in Europe and USA 
or to customers globally. EVRAZ also creates 
value by maximising efficiently at its 
operations, using the EVRAZ Business 
System, which minimises processing costs 
and the production cycle.
Leading global vanadium producer
EVRAZ delivers value in its vanadium business 
as a result of its unique low cost position on 
the global cost curve. This position is secured 
by the historical combination of iron ore and 
steelmaking facilities in Russia and South 
Africa as well as by the fact that vanadium is 
produced efficiently as a by-product of its main 
steelmaking operations.

EVRAZ’s Strategy
Given the context of the global steel industry 
in which EVRAZ operates, achieving this core 
aim depends upon delivering a number of 
Commercial Objectives: 
 Further vertical integration and 
development of the raw materials base
 Strengthening of competitive positions  
in key markets
 Development of the product portfolio
 Enhancement of cost leadership positions 
in steelmaking 
In view of the scale of ongoing improvement in 
a business as large as EVRAZ, which spans 
four continents and employs more than 
110,000 people, it is important to establish 
and adopt a clear set of Development 
Principles. These principles, which demonstrate 
the Company’s commitment to change, 
consist of five elements which, together, 
provide a solid foundation for long term 
sustainable development. 
The Development Principles cover:
1. Health, Safety and Environment
2. Human Capital
3. Customer Focus
4. EVRAZ Business System
5. Growth
By delivering on the first four principles EVRAZ 
will achieve growth. Well managed growth will 
ultimately lead to EVRAZ delivering on the 
commitment to create long term value for 
shareholders.
Commercial objectives
Further vertical integration and development 
of raw materials base
2012 was a highly volatile year for 
commodities including coking coal and iron 
ore. However, EVRAZ believes that these 
fluctuations and subdued pricing were 
short-term and of a temporary nature. At the 
same time, all fundamentals remain intact: 
China, being the largest consumer of 
commodities, continues to experience a 
structural lack of resources; and iron ore and 
coking coal markets are still concentrated on 
the supply side, which allows the major 
players to react swiftly to changes in demand. 
These factors should continue to support 
prices of iron ore and coking coal for the next 
5 to 10 years.
Given the market outlook and competitive 
advantages of EVRAZ, arising from the 
geographical proximity of the proprietary 
mineral resource base and key steelmaking 
facilities, the Company has set long term 
targets of 120% self-coverage in iron ore and 
130% in coking coal excluding production 
volumes of Raspadskaya. This implies total 
production of 22 million tonnes of saleable 
iron ore products per annum and 15 million 
tonnes of raw coking coal per annum from 
2016. The Company intends to maximise the 
intragroup consumption of proprietary key raw 
materials and sell the excess in the open 
market. 
Coking coal
EVRAZ continues to develop the coking coal 
business both organically and through the 
transformational acquisition of Raspadskaya, 
which was completed in January 2013. The 
pipeline of organic development projects 
includes the construction of the 
Yerunakovskaya VIII mine with a production 
capacity of 2.5 million tonnes of raw coking 
coal per annum and the Mezhegey project 
with a projected production capacity of 6.5 
million tonnes of hard coking coal per annum.
In 2012, the Company completed the 
construction of the Yerunakovskaya VIII mine 
in the Kuzbass region for the production of 
semi-hard coking coal. The first coal was 
mined in February 2013, with total annual 
production projected to reach 1.2 million 
tonnes in 2013. The ramp-up to full capacity 
of 2.5 million tonnes per annum will take 
place in 2013 with the mine reaching 
nameplate capacity by 2014. Coal washing

will take place at the existing facilities and the 
coal concentrate will be utilised by EVRAZ’s 
steelmaking plants in Russia. Proven and 
probable reserves of Yerunakovskaya VIII 
mine under JORC classification amount to 85 
million tonnes of semi-hard coking coal. Total 
capital spending under the project amounted 
to US$310 million, which is almost 20% below 
the budget target. The estimated cash cost of 
raw coal production is US$40 per tonne, 
which places Yerunakovskaya VIII mine in  
the lowest quartile of CIS producers in  
terms of the cash cost curve. Coal from the 
Yerunakovskaya VIII mine will be utilised 
intragroup and sold in the market.
EVRAZ continues to work on the Mezhegey 
Phase I project, a world class coking coal 
deposit located in the largest undeveloped 
coal province in Russia. Total reserves of 
deposits covered by EVRAZ’s licences amount 
to 763 million tonnes of hard coking coal 
based on exploration works of prior periods. 
During the first stage EVRAZ envisages 
mining 1.5 million tonnes of raw coking coal 
using room-and-pillar technology, thereafter 
utilising road haulage to the railway station 
and subsequently transporting the coal to 
proprietary coal washing plants in the 
Kuzbass region of Russia. The total capital 
budget for the first stage is US$195 million, 
funded principally through project finance 
from Gazprombank with limited recourse to 
EVRAZ plc. Cash costs of production of raw 
coking coal, including transportation to the 
coal washing plant, is estimated at US$70 
per tonne, which is comparatively low for the 
production of hard coking coal in Russia. The 
first coal is expected to be mined in October 
2013, with ramp-up to full capacity scheduled 
for 2014. The majority of production will be 
utilised by EVRAZ ZSMK.
The Mezhegey Phase II project involves both 
mining and coal washing facilities at the mine 
site. The main trigger for execution of the 
second stage will be the completion of the 
construction of a 400 km railway connecting 
the area with the Trans-Siberian railroad. The 
construction of the rail link is expected to be 
financed by the Russian government.
In 2012, EVRAZ made a major commitment 
to non-organic investment in coking coal 
assets via the agreement in respect of the 
acquisition of the Raspadskaya coal company. 
The Company has been a JV partner with the 
management of Raspadskaya since 2005 
and has been actively involved in the strategic 
decision making process. Hence, the 
acquisition of Raspadskaya not only 
complements the Company’s strategy to 
expand the mining business, but also 
captures operational synergies based on the 
aforementioned knowledge of Raspadskaya’s 
assets. The integration of Raspadskaya into 
EVRAZ’s business strengthens EVRAZ’s 
market positions in Russia and Ukraine, 
significantly increases intragroup coal 
consumption and consolidates Asian export 
sales through the logistics infrastructure of 
Nakhodka Sea Port. For more information  
on Raspadskaya please refer to page 23.
Iron ore
EVRAZ’s major iron ore projects include  
the brownfield development of the 
Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye deposit and  
the Timir greenfield project located in the 
Yakutia region. 
In 2012 the Company finalised the feasibility 
study of the Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye 
deposit and received government approvals in 
February 2013. The 6.9 billion tonnes of iron 
ore confirmed by the Russian State 
Commission on Mineral Reserves provide 
140 years of stable output at EVRAZ KGOK. 
Development of the deposit will enable EVRAZ 
to sustain the level of annual iron ore 
production at EVRAZ KGOK at 56 million 
tonnes. Total capex to realise the first stage 
of the project until 2016 is in excess of 
US$240 million. EVRAZ KGOK plans to 
commence production of iron ore at 
Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye in 2015. The 
iron ore mined will be sufficient to cover the 
needs of EVRAZ NTMK’s production facilities 
in the foreseeable future.
In April 2013 EVRAZ signed an agreement to 
acquire the stake in the Timir company which 
holds licences for four iron ore deposits in 
Southern Yakutia with total reserves under 
the Russian classification of 3.5 billion tonnes 
of iron ore (Russian geological categories of 
A+B+C1). Among these deposits, the 
Tayozhnoye deposit is considered to be the 
most attractive with 341 million tonnes of 
fully explored reserves for open pit mining, 
with ore grades of 38-40% Fe and near to  
the existing infrastructure (located 4 km  
from railway, 6 km from power grid). In 2012, 
EVRAZ finalised a scoping study for the 
project with current estimates indicating a 
capital budget of US$1.8 billion. The mining 
capacity of the Tayozhnoye open pit is 
estimated at 15 million tonnes of iron ore per 
annum with first ore scheduled to be mined in 
2018. Convenient geographical location of 
the Tayozhnoye deposit on a railway 
connected to the TransSiberian railroad 
provides for competitive delivery of iron ore 
products to EVRAZ ZSMK and Southeast 
Asian countries through the Far East of 
Russia. 
Strengthening of competitive positions in 
key markets and development of product 
portfolio
EVRAZ expects that global steel consumption 
will grow at a moderate rate over the next two 
years due to uncertain economic conditions 
across the globe. Nevertheless, this provides 
the Company with an opportunity to increase 
its focus on specific niche products in key 
markets, i.e. enhance the leading global 
market position in railway products and in  
the CIS construction steel products’ market.
In 2012, EVRAZ completed the modernisation 
programme at the rail and beam mill at 
EVRAZ ZSMK, which is now capable of 
producing high quality rails, including 100 
metre rails suitable for high-speed railways. 
As a result of this project, EVRAZ is targeting 
growth in production capacity from the rail mill 
at EVRAZ ZSMK from 750 thousand tonnes to 
950 thousand tonnes per annum with total 
available railway capacity at EVRAZ’s Russian 
assets of 1.5 million tonnes. The full ramp-up 
of the rail mill at EVRAZ ZSMK is expected by 
mid-2013. 
In 2013, EVRAZ plans to commission a new 
rolling mill, Vostochniy, in Kazakhstan, with a 
total annual capacity of 450 thousand tonnes 
of rebar thus strengthening our position in 
this growing market. EVRAZ is looking to 
expand its sales in Kazakhstan from the 
current level of 210 Ktpa to 300 Ktpa by 
2015. The feedstock (square billet) for the 
mill will be delivered from EVRAZ ZSMK 
allowing the Company to manage sales of 
semi-finished products between domestic and 
export market with greater flexibility. The 
launch of the second rolling mill, in Russia, 
– Yuzhniy – with a total capacity of 450 
thousand tonnes of rebar and sections per 
annum, is targeted for 2014.
At the beginning of 2013 EVRAZ North 
America embarked on a project to expand 
heat-treatment capacity at the Calgary mill in 
Western Canada from 80 thousand tonnes to 
200 thousand tonnes per annum in order to 
strengthen margins. Mill modernisation will 
also provide for a 65 thousand tonne increase 
in mill welding capacity. The project is 
expected to be completed by 2014. EVRAZ plc

EVRAZ’s Strategy (Continued)
Enhancement of cost leadership positions in 
steelmaking 
EVRAZ has maintained its key competitive 
advantage of being a low cost steel producer 
through operational and strategic initiatives.
The management believes that CIS is one of 
the lowest cost regions for steel production in 
the world, enabling EVRAZ to benefit from 
lower production costs compared to some of 
its global competitors, i.e. EVRAZ benefits 
through both sales of low-cost Russian slabs 
to global markets and through synergies 
created by being able to supply feedstock to 
certain of its non-Russian subsidiaries. 
In 2012 EVRAZ completed construction of the 
pulverised coal injection (PCI) project at 
EVRAZ NTMK. The consumption of natural 
gas is estimated to reduce by 50%, coke by 
20% and the increase in capacity for pig iron 
production should amount to 100 thousand 
tonnes per annum. The project is expected to 
reach designated parameters during the first 
half of 2013. A similar PCI project is underway 
at EVRAZ ZSMK which is expected to be 
completed by mid-2014 with a similar 20% 
decrease in coke consumption, full 
elimination of natural gas consumption and 
additional pig iron capacity of 260 thousand 
tonnes per annum. 
In 2012 EVRAZ approved a plan to enhance 
the effectiveness of EVRAZ DMZ Petrovskogo. 
The Company intends to adopt the standard 
upgrades that have been successfully 
implemented at the Russian steelmaking 
facilities. These include: PCI technology 
aimed at fully eliminating natural gas 
consumption, improvements to blast furnace 
productivity through a new air separation unit, 
and debottlenecking of processes at the 
sinter screening and structural mill stages. 
The implementation of PCI projects and 
improvements at the blast furnace will 
contribute to the growth of pig iron production 
from 860 thousand tonnes to 1.35 million 
tonnes per annum by 2014 and to a reduction 
of ca. 20% in the cash costs of billet 
production. 
Development principles
1. Health, Safety and Environment. During 
the last two years EVRAZ has significantly 
increased its focus on health, safety and 
environment (HSE) performance. The 
long-term target of HSE policy is to prevent 
all fatal accidents and to comply with 
environmental standards. To achieve 
these targets EVRAZ has implemented 
programmes which ensure compliance 
with rigorous safety standards in every 
EVRAZ workplace and which provide all 
employees with relevant safety training. 
The Company has established a dedicated 
corporate HSE function at management 
level and has linked the remuneration of 
senior executives to the achievement of 
safety performance targets. In addition, 
the Board HSE Committee reviews the 
Company’s performance in this area and 
recommends improvements where 
appropriate.
2. Human capital. EVRAZ perceives the 
attraction and retention of high calibre 
employees as an integral element of the 
Company’s sustainable success. As well 
as providing competitive levels of 
remuneration by industry standards, 
EVRAZ provides significant professional 
development support for its employees. 
For instance, the Company cooperates 
with the leading Russian Skolkovo 
Business School annually through the 
EVRAZ New Leader programme which 
provides management learning 
opportunities based on global best 
practice. This initiative is a part of 
EVRAZ’s human capital strategy with an 
ultimate goal of comprehensively 
supporting the development of middle 
management to create a pool of qualified 
successors to fulfil the management 
challenges of the future and adopt senior 
roles within the Company.
3. Customer focus. Given the versatile 
industry landscape, EVRAZ takes into full 
account the importance of customer 
loyalty. The Company’s long-term target is 
to minimise customer claims, late delivery 
and incomplete orders. The results of 
2012 provide evidence that the Company 
is on track in meeting its long-term 
targets, with a quadrupled decrease in 
late delivery and incomplete orders 
compared to 2011, and visibly improved 
customer satisfaction with the quality of 
claim processing. EVRAZ’s strategic effort 
includes the development of new products 
designed to match evolving customer 
requirements and generate additional 
value from tailored solutions. The goal is 
to expand the proportion of new products 
to 5% of the total product mix. Priority 
niche segments are identified based on 
rigorous research and selection. As a first 
step in this programme, EVRAZ has 
launched a new product development pilot 
project at the railway shop of EVRAZ 
NTMK. Similar projects will be initiated  
at other operations during the course  
of 2013.
4. EVRAZ Business System. As a part of 
EVRAZ’s comprehensive efforts to reduce 
costs at key industrial facilities, the 
Company continues to implement the 
EVRAZ Business System. The core of this 
programme is comprised of a set of Lean 
production practices affecting various 
areas including safety, work flow and 
maintenance optimisation, and warehouse 
management. The key objective is the 
elimination of production losses due to 
unplanned machine downtime with the  
aim of decreasing cash costs on a 
sustainable basis. A detailed breakdown 
of the elements which make up the  
EVRAZ Business System can be found  
on page 24.
5. Growth. The pursuit of growth options  
is confined to the key areas of EVRAZ’s 
expertise, such as development of the raw 
materials base, the promotion of further 
vertical integration, strengthening of the 
competitive positions in key markets, 
development of the product portfolio and 
the enhancement of cost leadership 
positions in steelmaking.
Research and development
EVRAZ constantly seeks to improve 
operations at its facilities, principally through 
enhancing operating efficiency, reliability and 
capacity. The majority of these measures 
constitute incremental improvements to 
current activities and, as a result, are 
undertaken in conjunction with regular 
operational maintenance and monitoring. 
Where appropriate, EVRAZ seeks to register 
any rights to intellectual property that may 
result from these efforts.  EVRAZ plc

Overview of Raspadskaya’s Business
Following completion of the acquisition 
of Raspadskaya, EVRAZ has become 
the largest producer of coking coal in 
Russia and is expected to generate 
substantial operational synergies 
including the optimisation of different 
coal grades in the combined coal 
products’ portfolio. The acquisition 
increases EVRAZ’s coking coal 
self-coverage, which is consistent with 
the Company’s strategy of increasing 
its resource base of raw materials 
needed for steelmaking.
Raspadskaya is located in the Kemerovo 
region of Russia and consists of three 
underground mines and an open-pit mine,  
a coal washing plant, a coal transportation 
network and a number of integrated 
infrastructure companies. 
The Raspadskaya’s coking coal washing plant 
is the largest in Russia, with a production 
capacity of 15 million tonnes per annum and 
includes technology which allows for the coal 
blend to be adjusted and an integrated quality 
control laboratory. 
In 2012, Raspadskaya mined 7 million tonnes 
of raw coal, with sales volumes of coal 
products (semi-hard coking coal concentrate 
and hard raw coking coal) totalling 
approximately 5 million tonnes. 
As at 31 December 2011, the Raspadskaya 
had over 1.3 billion tonnes of high quality 
coking coal reserves, which is sufficient to 
sustain production for over 90 years. 
Additionally, Raspadskaya has a proven track 
record of reserve base expansion, with ca. 
533 million tonnes of high quality coking coal 
reserves added since 2006.
Raspadskaya has a diversified customer 
base, supplying coking coal to the majority of 
the Russian steel majors, such as EVRAZ, 
MMK, NLMK, Koks, Mechel, etc., as well as 
customers in the Asia-Pacific region and 
Eastern Europe (Ukraine). EVRAZ plc

EVRAZ Business System
The EVRAZ Business System (“EBS”) is the 
practical expression of EVRAZ’s vision which 
aims to reduce costs, improve quality and 
safety and eliminate waste*. EBS 
incorporates the business principles and 
tools of the Lean management philosophy to 
manage change and create a culture of 
continuous improvement within the Company. 
It consists of a set of principles that define 
the way the Company operates and the way 
people think and act. EBS applies in every 
part of the business and every process in the 
organisation.
The main objectives of EBS are to design out 
overburden and inconsistency and to 
eliminate waste. The most significant effects 
on process value delivery are achieved by 
designing a process capable of delivering 
personal customer requirements and 
business results smoothly.
EBS objectives
 Grow leaders who thoroughly understand 
the work, live the philosophy, and teach it 
to others.
 Develop exceptional people and teams who 
follow Company’s philosophy.
 Respect the extended network of partners 
and suppliers by challenging them and 
helping them improve.
 EVRAZ understands customer value and 
focuses its key processes to continuously 
increase it. The ultimate goal is to provide 
perfect value to the customers through a 
perfect value creation process that has 
zero waste.
The Company uses the following tools in order 
to apply the Lean philosophy throughout 
EVRAZ and involve the workforce in improving 
their business:
 Strategy Development and Deployment 
Matrix – a form used to show relationships 
between 3-5 year objectives, improvement 
priorities, targets, resources required and 
benefits to the organisation;
 Value Stream Analysis to analyse and 
design the flow of materials and 
information required to bring a product or 
service to a consumer;
 A3 Thinking provides for a systematic 
method to identify opportunities for 
improvements in the workplace, realise 
them daily as well as make the 
transformation planning and problem 
solving;
 Cell Development is the area where work is 
performed and improvement is made. This 
area includes such items as 6S, Flow, 
Standard Work, Pull and Visual 
Management, which ensure a safe and 
effective work environment.
EBS in action
In two years since the introduction of the 
EVRAZ Business System the Company has 
achieved significant results in the 
improvement of its processes and 
procedures. 
While in 2011 the Company mostly 
concentrated on introducing the principles of 
Lean philosophy and deploying some of the 
basic Lean tools and instruments, 2012 was 
focused on expanding that knowledge and 
consolidating it in so-called lean “pilots” with 
the aim of increasing the efficiency of various 
work areas at sites and offices. This allowed 
the Company not only to develop specific 
areas but also provided key examples of how 
to implement the EVRAZ Business System in 
practical terms.
A large part of that effort was concentrated 
on building cells, especially those dedicated 
to maintenance and repairs. The first pilot 
area was the continuous caster #4 at EVRAZ 
NTMK, one of the most critical pieces of 
equipment of the plant. The result was an 
increase in the speed and quality of repairs  
of bender rolls for the shop.
Cells also laid the ground for changing the 
Company’s current function-oriented 
approach to management to team based 
problem solving that allows the cross 
functional members to determine the root 
cause to problems and develop concrete 
countermeasure plans to resolve them. 
In 2012, EVRAZ initiated a study into aligning 
the organisation along product lines to create 
a system where marketing, sales, finance, 
product development and operations can 
work across the Company tackling various 
processes with the goal of making them less 
wasteful and more cost-effective.

Risk register within EBS
With risk being a critical element in the ability 
to achieve business strategies EVRAZ is 
incorporating the risk register as a key 
element in the Company Mission Control 
Rooms. This process allows the management 
to assess the risks and develop counter 
measures thus to align the organisation and 
maintain the trajectory of improvement toward 
the Company’s True North Goals. This is a 
significant step for EVRAZ as the Lean 
principles are deployed within the EVRAZ 
Business System.
EVRAZ will take a measured approach to risk 
management that enables: 
 an understanding of the level of risk 
exposure that can be tolerated 
 an understanding of the type of risks faced 
and how to measure them 
 where the level of risk exposure is too high 
that a suitable level of mitigation exists 
 the ongoing assessment of the 
effectiveness of mitigation 
 prompt action where existing arrangements 
are found to be inadequate or ineffective 
 an awareness of risk at all levels within 
EVRAZ to ensure that risks can be 
escalated to a level of management  
that can effectively respond to them 
Key targets for 2013
As EVRAZ strives to enhance quality and 
efficiency, the Company has set a goal for 
2013 to develop a Lean maintenance and 
procurement system for 20% of critical 
equipment at all sites. While efforts in 2012 
were concentrated on the deployment of 6S,  
in 2013 the focus will be shifted to increasing 
the 6S score of the Company to a minimum of 
50%. Management also plan to increase the 
amount of training and recognition for 
improvements by employees (one EBS target 
is 100% recognition of all improvement efforts 
in the Company). Finally, the management of 
EVRAZ intends to set up a model Lean facility 
for each of the divisions which will give each 
business unit an example of what a Lean 
production site should look like. This initial 
enterprise will lead the way for other EVRAZ 
sites to follow suit in due course.

for part of volumes of raw coking coal 
processed at coal washing plants of other 
companies (not Yuzhkuzbassugol).
We use cash cost as a measure, because 
EVRAZ considers cost leadership as key to 
its competitive advantage. 
Environmental Fines (US$ million)
We record all environmental incidents at our 
operations to measure compliance with 
environmental standards covering: water 
discharges; air emissions; waste; and 
general work activity. This KPI measures 
environmental performance in the broadest 
possible way and sets out the total sum of 
fines imposed on EVRAZ in the year.
EVRAZ is committed to minimising its 
impacts upon the environment and have a 
target of achieving zero incidents.
Note:    In 2012, revenue was excluded from reported KPIs due to a renewed focus by management on efficiency rather than gross metrics of operating and financial performance. 
KPIs on average cash cost for slabs and billets at Russian operations have replaced average cash cost of Russian rolled steel products as a better metric for comparison 
of the cost performance of the Group with the peer group. Cash costs of washed coking coal and cash cost of Russian iron ore products (rebased to 58% Fe content) were 
added to reflect the performance of the Mining segment of the Group.
Average Cash Cost of Russian 
Iron Ore Products (Fe 58%)  
(US$/tonne)
Cash cost is defined as the cost of 
revenues and SG&A expenses less 
depreciation and other non-cash items,  
the result is divided by sales volumes. 
Adjustments are made for iron ore products 
containing various grades of Fe (pellets, 
sinter, iron ore concentrate) to reflect 
average Fe content 58%. Cash costs are  
on an EXW basis. 
We use cash cost as a measure, because 
EVRAZ considers cost leadership as key to 
its competitive advantage.  EVRAZ plc

Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
Effective management of risk is essential to achieving EVRAZ’s objective 
of delivering long-term value to shareholders and to the protection of its 
assets, people and reputation. Identifying, evaluating and managing 
business risks are integral to the way EVRAZ runs its business.
Strategic Risks
Risk Type Risk Mitigation
Impact of Global 
Macroeconomics and 
Industry Cyclicality
EVRAZ’s sales, profits, balance sheet and potentially the 
economic viability of projects and investments could be 
adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors such as: 
 The cyclical nature of the steel, mining and vanadium 
industries with prices strongly influenced by economic 
conditions; 
 Potential disparities between global steel and raw 
material production capacity which could influence 
pricing; and 
 Adverse fluctuations in RUB/USD exchange rates and 
other foreign currencies. 
EVRAZ’s operations are diversified across a number of 
geographic markets thereby providing some protection 
from adverse economic conditions. Production is 
focused primarily on the infrastructure segment of the 
steel markets where the Company commands leading 
market shares and benefits from high barriers to entry.
EVRAZ’s vertically integrated business model serves 
to protect the Company from higher raw material input 
prices and various pricing formulas are utilised in 
respect of contracts. In addition, products are sold 
under a range of contracts, some of which are linked 
to raw material prices. A proportion of products are 
supplied on long-term contracts. 
EVRAZ’s operations are generally low cost in comparison 
with much of the Company’s peer group, a factor which 
provides some mitigation against economic fluctuations.
EVRAZ’s main foreign exchange risk is the potential 
impact on the asset value of the Group’s Russian 
operations; this risk is mitigated in that all products are 
priced in US dollars or on a USD related price. 
Safety Safety risks are inherent to the Company’s principal 
business activities of steelmaking and mining.
EVRAZ employees face a range of risks including the 
potential dangers of fire, explosions and electrocution. 
Additional risks, specific to individual mines, include 
methane levels, rock falls caused by geological 
conditions, and accidents involving equipment and/or 
vehicles. EVRAZ faces risks including regulatory fines, 
penalties and adverse impacts on reputation and, in the 
extreme, the withdrawal of mining or plant environmental 
licences thereby curtailing operations for an indefinite 
period.
EVRAZ has instigated a programme to improve the 
management of safety risks across all business 
units and embed a new culture at all levels within 
the Company, supported by operational manuals and 
detailed procedures. This system is subject to oversight 
at Group and site level in order to ensure all HSE 
systems are aligned and that response to safety risks is 
co-ordinated, consistent and complete.
EVRAZ has reviewed the Group’s training activities in 
order to ensure that all employees can provide strong 
and professional leadership with regard to safety issues. 
EVRAZ reviews the performance of all contractors 
against Group policies and contractual safety 
requirements. In the event of non-compliance by 
contractors the Group takes appropriate action, 
including contract termination.
An operational safety assessment represents a primary 
aspect of all new projects, particularly new mines where 
measures to contain methane levels are a priority. EVRAZ plc

Capital Projects  
and Expenditures
The advancement of EVRAZ’s strategic objectives 
is, in large part, dependent upon the completion of a 
number of important projects designed to enhance 
the Company’s key product delivery, reduce production 
costs and increase the vertical production of our raw 
material inputs. 
The economic viability of capital projects could be 
impacted by increases in capital costs due to delays and 
other factors, unforeseen changes to future metal and 
metallic coal prices and the acquisition and retention of 
relevant operating licences. In addition, the profitability 
of new projects could be impacted by higher than 
expected operating and Life of Mine (LOM) costs due to 
variables such as lower than expected coal and iron ore 
quality, coal seam economics and technical processing 
and engineering factors. 
In addition, the cost to EVRAZ of maintaining current 
mines is subject to various factors which are outside the 
Company’s control, including the price of consumables.
EVRAZ reviews all proposed capital projects on a risk 
return basis. The Group sets expected internal rates of 
return (IRR) for each project as thresholds for approving 
the allocation of capital based on the net present value 
(NPV) of expected cash flows from invested capital. The 
IRR and NPV are also reviewed based on sensitised 
cash flows using variables for commodity prices, inputs 
and sales, and volumes (mines).
Before undertaking the development of a mine, EVRAZ 
takes into account a range of considerations and 
utilises independent experts to review various factors 
such as: resource estimates; studies of ore quality in 
relation to market demand and value; mine development 
costs; mining techniques (open pit or underground) 
and associated investments; logistic options, including 
transport and power; environmental impacts; and labour 
availability. Cash costs and full sustainable cash costs 
over LOM are also reviewed compared to local and open 
market metrics.
Each project is presented for approval against the 
Group’s risk matrix to assess the downside in respect  
of each project and any potential mitigating actions. 
Project delivery is closely monitored against project 
plans to ensure that investments are on time and on 
budget and to assess any changes in project and capital 
expenditure against the approved NPV.
Environmental 
Incidents
Mining and steel production carry an inherent risk 
of environmental impacts and incidents, relating to 
issues as diverse as water usage and quality of water 
discharged, air emissions, metallurgical waste recycling, 
tailings management and community discontent.
Consequentially, EVRAZ faces risks including regulatory 
fines, penalties and adverse impacts on reputation 
and, in the extreme, the withdrawal of mining or plant 
environmental licences thereby curtailing operations for 
an indefinite period.
EVRAZ has put strong environmental systems, 
procedures and controls into place. Environmental risks 
are the responsibility of the regional business units with 
oversight from the Group’s HSE team, HSE Committee 
and, ultimately, EVRAZ’s Board. 
The majority of EVRAZ’s operations are certified under 
ISO 14001 and the Company continues to work towards 
bringing the remaining plants to certification. EVRAZ is 
currently compliant with REACH requirements.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties (Continued)
Strategic Risks
Risk Type Risk Mitigation
Human Resources EVRAZ’s employees represent a key resource and are 
critical to the delivery of the Company’s objectives. 
Principal risks involve the selection, recruitment, training 
and retention of employees, together with securing 
appropriately qualified executives with regard to current 
and new operations. Succession planning in respect of 
EVRAZ’s senior management is under constant review 
although this does not preclude issues in relation to key 
roles.
Whereas the aforementioned issues are applicable 
throughout the Group’s global operations, the ongoing 
expansion of mining operations in Russia has led to a 
particular shortage of experienced and skilled mining 
professionals. This risk is exacerbated by the climatic 
conditions and/or remote locations pertaining to 
certain of the Company’s current and potential mines. 
Certain regulatory and cultural factors can also prove 
disincentives in terms of recruitment from outside 
Russia.
There is a risk of employee union action, as witnessed 
at the Group’s South African operations during 2012, 
although such action is not indicative of the overall 
state of labour relations at EVRAZ which are largely 
favourable. However, this cannot preclude the risk of 
future industrial disputes.
EVRAZ continually assesses its human resources 
requirements and seeks to meet its leadership and 
skills needs through the retention of employees and 
internal promotion. EVRAZ maintains structured 
and professional internal mentoring and external 
development programmes including EVRAZ’s New 
Leaders programme, focused on high potential 
employees, and Talent management supervision 
conducted by the Company’s Talent Committee. 
The Company has instigated clearly assigned 
responsibilities and programmes designed to maintain 
close relationships with employee unions throughout its 
operations. EVRAZ seeks to be proactive and timely in 
response to the needs and concerns of trade unions.
Business Interruption Steel making and mining operations are subject to a 
number of operational risks which have the potential to 
cause prolonged production delays or shut-downs.
These include equipment failure, regulatory 
requirements in respect of safety concerns, geological 
and technical challenges, climatic conditions, 
interruptions to power supplies and disruptions to 
transportation services.
Additionally, long-term business interruption may result 
in loss of customers and damage to the Company’s 
reputation.
EVRAZ has established protocols and procedures 
across all of its activities to mitigate the effects of 
business interruption. The Company has initiated 
planned maintenance programmes at the majority of its 
plants and records of minor interruptions are reviewed 
for the purpose of identifying prospective problems 
of greater magnitude. KPIs are utilised at each of the 
Group’s plants, units and mines, encompassing all 
significant interruptions. 
All of the Company’s operations possess disaster 
recovery plans which are reviewed regularly by Internal 
Audit. The Group also carries business interruption 
insurance, excluding mining operations.
Potential Actions by 
Governments
EVRAZ operates in a number of countries and there is 
a risk that governments or government agencies could 
adopt new laws, regulations or other requirements which 
could have an adverse impact on the Group’s operations 
and business. Such developments could also have the 
effect of limiting the Group’s ability to obtain financing in 
international markets.
EVRAZ and its executive teams are members of various 
national industry bodies and, as a result, contribute 
to the thinking of such bodies and, when appropriate, 
participate in relevant discussions with political and 
regulatory authorities.
EVRAZ also has programmes in place across the 
Group’s operations to support the Company’s “good 
corporate citizen” credentials.  EVRAZ plc

Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
Strategic Risks
Risk Type Risk Mitigation
Treasury Risk As with many other large multinational companies, 
EVRAZ faces various treasury risks including liquidity, 
credit, and interest rate risks.
Adverse events in global financial markets could affect 
the Group’s ability to raise new debt, refinance existing 
debt and/or lead to higher debt service costs.
The Group’s current debt facilities include certain 
covenants in relation to equity, net debt and interest 
expense. A breach of these covenants could result in 
certain of the Group’s borrowing facilities becoming 
repayable immediately. 
EVRAZ is subject to significant counter-party risk via 
receivables from commercial and financial institutions.
EVRAZ manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
cash and borrowing facilities, as well as through cash 
management procedures that continually monitor 
forecast and actual cash flows and by matching 
funding with the Group’s cash needs and re-financing 
obligations. 
Covenant compliance is managed by close monitoring 
of the overall Group’s business performance and, again, 
with the continual review of forecast and actual cash 
flow. Free cash flow, net of capital expenditure, total 
funding, maturity profile and covenants are considered 
at each EVRAZ Board meeting. 
With regard to risk management of funding cost, the 
majority of the Company’s funding has been secured on 
a fixed interest basis.
The Group manages counter-party risk with commercial 
customers through a combination of letters of credit 
and, where creditworthiness is uncertain, by pre-
payments. In the event that credit terms are longer 
than the Group’s standard payment terms, collateral is 
sought. There is no significant concentration of credit 
risk within EVRAZ’s customer base. 
The credit worthiness of all financial institutions with 
which EVRAZ has cash balances or places deposits is 
kept under regular review.
The majority of the Group’s funding is denominated in 
US dollars. Major funding in other currencies, primarily 
the Russian rouble, is substantially dollar hedged with 
financial institutions. 
Cost Competiveness Most product groups in the steel industry are highly 
cost competitive and this is particularly relevant to the 
Groups’ key markets in Russia and North America. 
Although EVRAZ is active in the manufacture and sale 
of niche products, the Group is able to focus on specific 
geographic regions and enjoys certain cost advantages 
linked to customer proximity, volume and quality, the 
majority of the Group’s steel production remains cost 
and price sensitive.
Steel making is a high capital cost industry and the 
impact of lower plant utilisation increases the underlying 
cost per tonne of crude and rolled steel, reducing any 
profit margin.
At the Group’s Russian plants, employees tend to 
represent the majority of the local community’s active 
workforce. Changing production requirements can, 
therefore, lead to local political and social challenges. 
The majority of the Group’s recent investments have 
been designed to significantly reduce costs, as 
illustrated by the Company’s utilisation of PCI technology 
within its steelmaking operations in order to reduce 
energy costs and enable the use of cheaper, lower 
quality carbon (coal/coke) inputs; the focus on the 
development of the Group’s key cost competitive rail and 
beam production for both domestic and export markets; 
investment in the production of high quality slab which 
can be further processed by the Group’s international 
plants, particularly for the North American market; and 
the expansion and control of the Company’s Russian 
domestic steel distribution network. 
The Group continues to develop a number of new 
greenfield and brownfield mining operations which will 
produce higher quality coal and iron ore at a lower cash 
cost, thereby benefiting the Company’s overall steel 
making cost per tonne.  EVRAZ plc

Operating Performance Overview
EVRAZ groups its operations into four 
principal operating segments: Steel, 
Mining, Vanadium and Other. Within 
each of these operating segments 
there are dedicated management 
teams which focus on particular 
geographies and/or product lines. 
The steel operating segment represents the 
core of EVRAZ’s business with operations 
spread over 4 continents. The Company is a 
prominent participant in multiple steel product 
markets with a specialised focus on the 
infrastructure sector. In 2012, consolidated 
output of crude steel totalled 15.9 million 
tonnes, a 5% decrease compared to 2011, 
while gross production of steel products fell by 
4% to 15.7 million tonnes. These decreases in 
steel output were the result of a variety of both 
internal and macroeconomic factors.
The most important of these internal factors 
was the large scale modernisation programme 
implemented at the Company’s Russian 
assets, which included an upgrade of the rail 
mills at EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK, an 
overhaul of the electric arc furnace at EVRAZ 
ZSMK and the implementation of PCI projects 
at both EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK. The 
completion of this ambitious investment 
programme will allow EVRAZ to benefit from 
superior prices, an increased volume of high 
value added products in the product mix  
and improved efficiency and safeguard the 
competiveness of the Company’s long run  
cost position. 
EVRAZ’s North American steelmaking facilities 
enjoyed a healthy demand for all product 
groups in 2012, which led to a strong 
performance, particularly in tubular and long 
products. Meanwhile, EVRAZ’s European 
operations suffered from temporary 
suspensions and the Company’s South  
African operations were adversely impacted by 
labour strikes and the subdued macro outlook 
in the region. EVRAZ mining operations cover a 
substantial portion of Company’s consumption 
of iron ore and coking coal, with major mining 
facilities located in Russia, Ukraine and South 
Africa. In 2012 EVRAZ’s self-coverage in iron 
ore was almost 100% and 73% (excluding 
Raspadskaya) in coking coal. Following the 
completion of acquisition of Raspadskaya, the 
Company’s self-coverage in coking coal 
increased to 142% (based on 2012 results).
In 2012, EVRAZ’s total iron ore products’ 
output decreased by 2% to 20.8 million 
tonnes, predominately due to a lower output  
of saleable concentrate in Russia, where 
processing of third party raw iron ore was 
terminated due to unfavourable economic 
conditions, and the suspension of  
Evrazruda’s Irba mine. The Company’s 
Ukrainian iron ore operations demonstrated  
a strong performance in 2012, recording a  
7% growth in output of lump iron ore  
following improvements to the mine’s 
processing facilities. Raw coking coal 
production at Yuzhkuzbassugol increased by 
35% to 8.5 million tonnes in 2012 and 
Raspadskaya also demonstrated strong 
growth with production increasing by 12% to 
7.0 million tonnes (on 100% basis). 
The agreement on acquisition of a controlling 
interest in Raspadskaya was a significant 
milestone for EVRAZ’s coal mining business in 
2012, and following completion of the 
transaction in January 2013 the effective 
interest of EVRAZ increased to 82%. The 
Raspadskaya’s coal mining business 
complements the Company’s existing coal 
operations, enhances EVRAZ’s self-coverge in 
raw materials for steelmaking and progresses 
the Company’s strategy of growing its mining 
presence. 
EVRAZ’s vanadium business experienced a 
mixed 2012, with labour issues in South Africa 
and shortages of third party feedstock in the 
United States negatively affecting operations, 
while Russian operations ran at full utilisation 
rates to meet demand. Total production of 
vanadium slag increased by 2% and exceeded 
21,000 tonnes in 2012, while total 
ferrovanadium produced at EVRAZ’s own 
facilities reached 7,259 tonnes.
Operational highlights at EVRAZ’s other 
businesses during 2012 included the 
expansion of cargo handling capacity at EVRAZ 
NMTP (Nakhodka Trade Sea Port) in the Far 
East of Russia, which is the main route for 
exports of EVRAZ’s steel products and coking 
coal to Asian markets. In 2012 the trading  
and distribution arms of EVRAZ focused on 
improvements to the customer experience 
across the whole product range and in all  
key local markets. A further highlight during 
the year was the sale of EvrazTrans as part of 
the continued effort by EVRAZ’s management 
to streamline the business and optimise 
capital allocation. 
In November 2012, following the careful review 
of the Company’s strategic priorities the Board 
decided to consider options with respect to 
EVRAZ Highveld and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel.  
As of 31 December 2012, these subsidiaries 
were classified as assets held for sale. In 
March 2013 the Company announced the 
execution of a non-binding term sheet in 
respect of the sale of its 85% stake in EVRAZ 
Highveld to a consortium of South African 
investors for an indicative cash consideration 
of approximately US$320 million. The 
consolidated operating results of EVRAZ for 
2012 include 454,000 tonnes of crude steel 
and 638,000 tonnes of steel products 
produced by EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel. In addition 
to this, in 2012 EVRAZ Highveld’s output 
totalled 572,000 tonnes of crude steel and 
461,000 tonnes of steel products.

Operational Highlights:
 completion of the PCI project at EVRAZ 
NTMK which will result in a reduction of 
coke consumption by 20% and natural gas 
by 50% through the use of an additional 
150 kg of PCI coal per tonne of pig iron. 
Design and construction works on PCI 
project at EVRAZ ZSMK continued;
 ramp-up of steel production capacity at 
EVRAZ NTMK to 4.5 million tonnes per 
annum;
 a further step towards the long-term target 
of product mix expansion to high value 
added products, with the start of production 
of new beams from continuously cast 
billets;
 improved recovery rates of vanadium from 
slag at EVRAZ NTMK – 83.5% vs. budgeted 
75.8%;
 increase electricity generation capacity of 
the EVRAZ ZSMK power plant by almost 
10% or 350,000 kWh compared to 2011.
2012 Production
In 2012 EVRAZ ZSMK (EVRAZ Consolidated 
West Siberian Metallurgical Plant) produced 
5.7 million tonnes of pig iron, 7.3 million 
tonnes of crude steel and 6.5 million tonnes of 
steel products.
EVRAZ NTMK (EVRAZ Nizhny Tagil 
Metallurgical Plant) processes unique 
vanadium rich iron ore which serves as an 
alloying component of steel and allows for 
production of steel and finished goods with 
improved physical characteristics. Vanadium 
slag extracted from pig iron at the converter 
stage is also used as a raw material by 
producers of ferroalloys and vanadium 
products. In 2012, EVRAZ NTMK produced 4.8 
million tonnes of pig iron, 4.3 million tonnes of 
crude steel and more than 4.3 million tonnes 
of steel products. 
Overall, in 2012 crude steel output at EVRAZ’s 
Russian operations decreased by 4% 
compared to 2011 to 11.7 million tonnes due 
to the major modernisation of an electric arc 
furnace and upgrade of the rail mill at EVRAZ 
ZSMK. EVRAZ’s other Russian steel plant, 
EVRAZ NTMK, operated at utilisation rates of 
almost 100% throughout the year.
Efforts to reduce operating costs at EVRAZ 
NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK during 2012 were 
focused on improvements to regular 
maintenance works and streamlining of 
dealings with third party service providers, 
which allowed for cost savings amounting to 
almost US$83 million (RUB 2.5 billion) during 
the reporting year. The 2013 cost saving 
initiatives will be targeted towards an overhaul 
of the Company’s procurement system to 
increase inventory turnaround, lower storage 
costs and improve productivity.
Pursuant to the long-term contract for supply 
of industrial gases to EVRAZ NTMK signed two 
years ago with Praxair Rus, the latter is building 
new modern air separation plants at the 
EVRAZ NTMK site. Upon completion, Praxair 
will supply EVRAZ NTMK with more than 3,000 
tonnes of oxygen, nitrogen and argon daily. As 
a result, the Company will also increase its 
energy efficiency by more than 30%. By the 
end of 2012 most construction works have 
been completed, more than 90% of the 
equipment has been delivered, major large- 
size units are being installed. The new plants 
are scheduled to commence operation at the 
end of 2013. The project is financed by Praxair. 
In 2012, EVRAZ continued the implementation 
of its customer focus strategy. A number of 
measures have been developed in order to 
promote customer loyalty, provide better 
service and ensure a timely response to 
changing market conditions. These include, 
but are not limited, to introduction of an 
enhanced technical support system, a more 
flexible approach to pricing, an extension of 
truck deliveries and closer cooperation with 
project institutes and end-users. In order to 
improve customer knowledge of EVRAZ and its 
products, customers will also have an 
opportunity to visit the Company’s steel mills 
and participate in product seminars.
EVRAZ continued to dominate the Russian 
long products market during 2012, with its 
market share in beams totalling 80%, 
structural shapes (angles and channels) 45% 
and rebars 19%. Generally the Russian long 
products market demonstrated healthy 
demand dynamics in 2012, with rebars and 
beams recording a growth of 19% compared to 
2011. This demand was mostly driven by 
increased infrastructure and industrial 
construction activity. In contrast, the Russian 
market for hot-rolled sections ended 2012 
with a minor reduction in demand with 
historically low flat steel prices causing an 
increase in hollow section use in applications, 
where substitution is possible.
During 2012, prices for all long products, 
except railway products, were suppressed by 
weak underlying pricing for billets in 
international markets.
2013 Targets:
 ramp-up of PCI project at EVRAZ NTMK to 
achieve nameplate capacity;
 completion of construction works on PCI 
project at EVRAZ ZSMK;
 increased customer focus and enhanced 
delivery flexibility and options;
 review of investment projects for the 
construction of an additional converter shop 
at EVRAZ NTMK in addition to the 
installation of a ball rolling mill and 
modernisation of a wire rolling mill at the plant.

Railway products: Russia
Operational Highlights:
 completion of the major modernisation of 
the rail mill at EVRAZ ZSMK boosting 
capacity and allowing for the production of 
100 meter rails;
 the upgrade of the rail mill at EVRAZ NTMK 
and subsequent increased capacity of 
510,000 tonnes per annum and start of 
production of rails with extended life cycles 
and enhanced warranties;
 an increase in the EVRAZ NTMK wheel 
shop’s capacity to 540,000 wheels per 
annum, as part of the expansion of the 
mill’s mechanical treatment area.
2012 Production
In 2012, EVRAZ established a new Railway 
products business unit to enhance the 
management structure and marketing 
capability for one of the Company’s key 
product groups.
EVRAZ accounts for over 90% of production of 
rails and 35% of rail wheels in Russia, and 
supplies a wide range of related products for 
railway infrastructure, a number of which are 
produced in Russia by EVRAZ only.
In 2012, output of railway products by EVRAZ 
ZSMK and EVRAZ NTMK decreased by 14% to 
1.3 million tonnes, following the closure of the 
rail mill at EVRAZ ZSMK for modernisation 
from April 2012 until the end of the year. The 
mill’s modernisation will allow the Company to 
expand the railway product mix with new 100 
meter rails, which it will be the first Russian 
mill to produce, and enhance the rail mill’s 
capacity to 950,000 tonnes per annum. 
Following the completion of modernisation 
project in January 2013 EVRAZ has started 
hot tests of the equipment and the 
certification of new railway products.
 
Due to the closure of the EVRAZ ZSMK rail mill 
in 2012, the Russian rail market moved into a 
significant supply deficit and Russian Railways, 
one of EVRAZ’s largest customers, was forced 
to place some orders internationally. However 
the Company expects to supply over 80% of 
Russian Railways orders in 2013 following the 
ramp up at EVRAZ ZSMK rail mill. Rails 
remained a key product for EVRAZ in 2012, 
accounting for approximately 10% of total 
Russian steel product output.
In 2012 EVRAZ signed a memorandum of 
understanding with Russian Railways outlining 
key provisions of a 5-year supply contract that 
becomes valid from 2013. The supply contract 
commits EVRAZ to supplying major volumes of 
rail products to Russian Railways, including 
rails up to 100 meters long. 
EVRAZ continues to enjoy a geographical 
advantage for its railway wheels output, has 
benefitted from high product quality following 
the production facilities upgrade and has 
long-term relationships with customers. In 
2012, the share of EVRAZ wheel shipments to 
CIS countries increased by 12% with a slight 
increase in the high margin segment of wheels 
for maintenance needs. In addition, EVRAZ 
signed a 5-year contract with Uralvagonzavod, 
Russia’s biggest railcar manufacturer, for the 
supply of railway wheels and steel sections for 
railcars.
During 2012, EVRAZ continued the expansion 
of its product range and started deliveries of 
wheels to the United States and Europe. 
EVRAZ’s long-term memorandum with 
GHH-Valdunes, one of the leading European 
wheel manufacturers, aimed at supporting 
EVRAZ’s expansion into the European wheel 
market was one of the segment’s milestones 
of the year. Additionally, EVRAZ received 
approval from AAR (Association of American 
Railroads) to supply a trial batch of railway 
wheels to the North American market with first 
shipments effected in Q4 2012.
In 2012 average prices for railway products 
enjoyed positive developments due to EVRAZ’s 
improved product mix following the rail mill 
upgrade at EVRAZ NTMK.
2013 Targets:
 ramp-up of the rail mill at EVRAZ ZSMK with 
a target output of 720,000 tonnes for 
2013;
 commencement of production of 100 meter 
and head-hardened rails at EVRAZ ZSMK;
 increase of railway wheel production 
volumes by 10% compared to 2012.

EVRAZ North America is a leading steel 
manufacturer in the United States and 
Canada. The business of EVRAZ North 
America is organised into three primary 
divisions: flat products, tubular products and 
long products.
Operational Highlights:
 Flat product group – completion of 
investments in air permits and the reheat 
furnace upgrades at EVRAZ Claymont to 
ensure its compliance with environmental 
standards;
 Tubular product group – significant 
improvements in productivity with Camrose 
electric resistance weld mill improving its 
first pass yield by 16% compared to 2011. 
Regina Spiral weld line improved by 14% 
and Red Deer weld line improved by 8%. 
Additionally, Regina and Portland spiral mills 
were restarted and a premium thread line at 
the Red Deer facility was launched;
 Long product group – commencement of 
improvements to the rail mill in Pueblo, 
Colorado. Engineering and design works 
were successfully carried out and the 
project is on track for completion in 2013. 
EVRAZ also acquired scrap yards in 
Colorado to secure scrap needs of Pueblo 
rail mill.
Production 2012
In 2012, EVRAZ’s North American steel mills 
demonstrated strong performance in all 
product segments with total output of flat, 
tubular and long steel products exceeding 2.6 
million tonnes, with utilisation rates high 
throughout the reporting year.
In 2012, EVRAZ North America identified and 
evaluated a number of major capital projects 
that will be instrumental to the long-term 
growth of the North American business of 
EVRAZ, including construction of spiral double 
joiner in Portland, an increase in incremental 
capacity of premium thread line at Red Deer 
and an upgrade of rail mill and steelmaking 
capacity at Pueblo.
In markets for Flat product group, EVRAZ 
North America enjoys a 20% share of the 
North American plate market by physical 
volumes and has a significant competitive 
advantage in the Western US and Canada due 
to the favourable location of the Portland 
facility. This enables EVRAZ to offer the 
market shorter lead times than competitors. 
On the East coast of US, the flexibility and 
domestic origin of Claymont’s products  
allow EVRAZ to serve bridge and other 
non-residential construction markets,  
while niche products distinguish EVRAZ  
from competitors in the railcar industry.
Demand from railcar manufactures has 
increased due to continued urbanisation and 
increased construction in western Canada  
and USA. At the same time overall plate price 
levels remained weak and showed steady 
decline throughout the year, with EVRAZ  
North America being no exception to this.
In Tubular product group, 2012 was a difficult 
year with many American large diameter 
product mills either idled or on reduced crews. 
However, EVRAZ North America’s large 
diameter mills have been operating at close to 
maximum capacity. Moreover, due to high 
demand for large diameter products, EVRAZ 
restarted the Portland Spiral mill during the 
first half of 2013. 
EVRAZ has maintained a leading position in 
OCTG in Western Canada, with an approximate 
40% market share and an estimated 12% 
market share for heat treated (alloy) OCTG 
pipe. EVRAZ’s proximity of production 
compared to its major Western Canadian 
competitors continued to be a differentiating 
factor, both in terms of lead time advantages 
and responsiveness to local customers’ 
demands. EVRAZ has announced an 
expansion of heat treating and threading at 
the Calgary facility, to increase the heat treat 
capacity by 150% and threading capacity by 
40%. 
In 2012, EVRAZ recorded growth in high-
quality heat treated (alloy) pipe and premium 
connections. Horizontal/directional wells, 
which require more high-quality, high-strength 
alloy products and premium connections, 
increased to 73% of the total U.S. rig activity 
(up from 69% in 2011). The increase in 
horizontal/directional wells is expected to lead 
to a 6% increase in 2013 OCTG consumption, 
according to OCTG Situation Report. Overall 
average annual prices for the Tubular product 
group remained largely flat in 2012.
In the Long product group, EVRAZ Pueblo rail 
mill set record volumes of 490,000 tonnes in 
2012. EVRAZ market share continued to 
increase, despite growing imports and intense 
domestic competition, due to the Company’s 
advanced head hardening technology and 
overall quality improvements. The rail market 
continues to be strong, as the Class One 
railroads continue to invest in infrastructure to 
support growth in the oil and gas industry.
In the reporting year, EVRAZ’s rod and bar 
business grew in spite of significant increases 
in imports from China and Brazil. Continued 
quality improvements, the addition of a third 
crew at the rod and bar mill and record 
steelmaking production ensured an 
improvement of EVRAZ’s market position. Rod 
and bar prices softened slightly during 2012.
In 2012, EVRAZ North America continued to 
focus on its customers with significant 
improvements in on-time in-full performance 
as well as the introduction of new products. 
EVRAZ North America’s long products enjoyed 
on-time performance of over 90% through the 
year.
2013 Targets:
 Increase in steelmaking capacity and quality 
improvements at Pueblo. Billet production 
capacity will be expanded by 52,000 tonnes 
upon completion of the project in 2013.  
The project is also expected to improve 
conversion costs and the steel produced is 
to be re-rolled by the Tubular and Long 
product groups;
 Flat product group – growth of capacity, 
lowering cost position and improvement of 
operational stability; 
 Tubular product group – further focus on 
areas critical for profitability (productivity, 
first pass yield, working capital 
management) and the start of major capital 
projects in heat treating and threading;
 Long product group – improvements in rail 
quality (strengthening of surface, etc.) and 
ramp-up of capacity to 580,000 tonnes per 
annum.

Steel: Europe
2012 Production 
In 2012 EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli mill was 
running at rates close to full capacity with 
production totaling 417,000 tonnes. 
In 2012, EVRAZ streamlined and consolidated 
management functions of EVRAZ Palini e 
Bertoli and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel. The sales 
function was also restructured, targeting more 
efficient geographic coverage and increased 
support for customers in the domestic 
markets and Germany.
The extensive cost cutting programme 
undertaken by management delivered 
significant improvements to yields, lowered 
fixed and transportation costs, with overall 
savings of almost US$10 million in 2012. 
In 2012 EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli continued to 
operate in an extremely challenging 
macroeconomic environment. The production 
of steel fell by 4.7% in the European Union in 
2012, while the world steel output rose by 
1.2%. European steelmakers were impacted 
by subdued demand as a result of the 
Eurozone debt crisis and an uncompetitive 
cost position compared to the rest of the 
world. Meanwhile, EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli 
maintained a strong competitive position in 
core product groups during 2012, due to 
rigorous quality commitments, efficient and 
flexible production process and strong 
relationships with customers. The facility also 
benefits from its ability to serve a wide range 
of customers in Europe, Middle East and North 
Africa. In 2012, prices for EVRAZ Europe’s 
products decreased due to deteriorating 
market conditions in Europe and a shorter 
spread between plate and slab prices.
2013 Targets:
 increased focus on timely and proper 
deliveries, meeting demand for high value 
added products and improved customer 
experience in core Italian and German 
markets.

Production 2012
In 2012 the output of EVRAZ DMZ 
Petrovskogo totalled 820,000 tonnes of crude 
steel and 702,000 tonnes of steel products. 
This was a 5% reduction compared to 2011 
and was a result of planned maintenance 
works at blast furnaces, the oxygen generation 
unit and the basic oxygen furnace shop. 
In 2012, EVRAZ’s management enacted a 
two-stage investment programme for the 
modernisation of the steel plant, which 
includes an upgrade of steelmaking facilities 
and the introduction of PCI technology. An 
additional programme, focused on cost 
reduction through the decentralisation of the 
compressed air supply, was launched and a 
water recycling system was commissioned for 
crude steel casting machines.
In 2012, EVRAZ Bagliykoks disposed of the 
DKHZ coke plant as part of the Company’s 
optimisation programme allowing EVRAZ 
Bagliykoks to secure higher coke batteries’ 
usage (82% in 2012 vs. 66% in 2011). 
One of the highlights of the reporting year at 
EVRAZ Bagliykoks was the launch of a key 
ecological project aimed at lowering volumes 
of water discharged. Furthermore, a project to 
implement an automated system for 
environmental monitoring by EVRAZ Bagliykoks 
was developed and agreed with state 
authorities during 2012.
In terms of customer focus, in 2012 EVRAZ 
DMZ Petrovskogo implemented numerous new 
products, several of which were designed 
specifically for European market. The facility  EVRAZ plc

Additionally, EVRAZ Bagliykoks tailored its coal 
mix for specific customers in order to secure 
attractive prices.
In 2012, new consumers of coke nuts were 
secured following alteration of crushing 
process, and overall customer base widened 
in Ukraine and Russia.
Average selling prices for steel products in 
2012 declined due to the European sovereign 
debt crisis.
2013 Targets:
 EVRAZ DMZ Petrovskogo – commencement 
of the approved investment programme and 
continuing efforts towards higher volumes 
of water recycling;
 EVRAZ Bagliykoks – the completion of the 
plant’s ecological project, further 
operational improvements and installation 
of a pilot automated system for

Operational Highlights:
EVRAZ’s iron ore mining unit made good 
progress on a number of projects to maintain 
existing operations, develop new sources of 
production and improve operating efficiencies 
during 2012. Examples of these projects 
include:
 completion of the EVRAZ KGOK expansion 
which increased production capacity by 
approximately 10% to 55 million tonnes of 
iron ore per annum;
 confirmation by the Russian State 
Commission on Mineral Reserves of a 6.9 
billion tonnes iron ore reserve with an Fe 
grade of 16% at the Sobstvenno-
Kachkanarskoye iron ore deposit at EVRAZ 
KGOK, followed by receipt of approvals from 
government agencies in early 2013 to begin 
its development;
 appointment of key contractors for the 
construction of a new tailings dump and 
thickening facilities at EVRAZ KGOK 
following a project optimisation process and 
detailed feasibility study;
 integration of the Kachkanar Heat and 
Power Station into EVRAZ KGOK’s 
operations and the completion of a 
pre-feasibility study on its modernisation;
 successful ramp-up of backfilling facilities 
at Evrazruda’s Tashtagol mining operation 
allowing access to pockets of rich iron ore;
 completion of a debottlenecking programme 
at the Abagur beneficiation plant at 
Evrazruda resulting in the elimination of 
losses at the beneficiation stage and a 
substantial growth in iron ore concentrate 
output during winter periods;
 ongoing production ramp-up at the highly 
promising Sheregesh mining operation from 
the current 1.9 million tonnes of iron ore per 
annum to 4.8 million tonnes per annum by 
2017. The implementation of modern mining 
and iron ore transportation methods at 
Sheregesh, which is part of Evrazruda, will 
ensure a long-term cost of production of 
saleable iron ore concentrate at USD 70 per 
tonne; and
 finalisation of a feasibility study on the 
modernisation of Evrazruda’s Abakan mining 
operation to upgrade mining and iron ore 
transportation methods with the aim of 
achieving long-term production costs for 
saleable iron ore concentrate of USD 70 per 
tonne.
 
2012 Production
In 2012, EVRAZ KGOK mined 56 million 
tonnes of ore with a total output of saleable 
products of 9.7 million tonnes, including 6.1 
million tonnes of pellets and 3.6 million tonnes 
of sinter. The key customer of EVRAZ KGOK is 
EVRAZ NTMK. In 2012, the share of external 
sales was approximately 9%. 
As at 1 July 2011, total proven and probable 
iron ore reserves of the Gusevogorskoye 
deposit under the JORC Code were 
approximately 1,136 million tonnes with an 
average Fe grade of 16%. In addition EVRAZ 
KGOK holds a licence to develop the 
contiguous Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye 
titanium magnetite deposit which has a 
mineral resource base of 8.2 billion tonnes of 
iron ore. The licence for development of this 
deposit is valid till 2026.
In 2012, Evrazruda mined 11.0 million tonnes 
of iron ore resulting in production of 4.4 million 
tonnes of iron ore concentrate, all of which 
was delivered to EVRAZ ZSMK. As of 1 July 
2011, total proven and probable iron ore 
reserves of Evrazruda under the JORC Code 
were estimated at approximately 249 million 
tonnes grading 31.8% Fe. 
In November-December 2012 the Irba mining 
operation of Evrazruda was suspended due to 
unfavourable market conditions. 
As a result of an impairment test in the new 
pricing environment, the Company has 
recognised an impairment loss of US$356 
million related to the current operations of 
Evrazruda as of 31 December 2012. For more 
details please refer to note 6 of the Financial 
Statements. At the same time, the Company 
continues to evaluate options to increase the 
efficiency of this operation and implement 
development plans.
In 2012, EVRAZ VGOK mined 4.6 million 
tonnes of iron ore resulting in production of 
1.2 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate and 
1.1 million tonnes of sinter. EVRAZ VGOK 
supplies finished products to EVRAZ’s steel 
plants, primarily to EVRAZ ZSMK and EVRAZ 
NTMK and insignificant volumes to third 
parties. 
As of 1 July 2011, total proven and probable 
iron ore reserves of EVRAZ VGOK under the 
JORC Code were estimated at approximately 
110 million tonnes with an average grade of 
27.8% Fe. 
2013 Targets:
 implementation of operational improvement 
and productivity enhancement programmes 
at EVRAZ KGOK;
 finalisation of technical project 
documentation on the development of the 
Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye deposit and 
commencement of work on EVRAZ KGOK’s 
tailing dump; and
 restructuring of Evrazruda’s operations to 
optimise production costs by, amongst 
other things, increasing iron ore mining 
volumes at the most efficient mining 
operations (Sheregesh and Abakan) and the 
suspension of production at higher cost 
operations.

Overview Strategy Operating Review
Corporate  
Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
Operational Highlights: 
Following a strategic review significant 
progress was made at Yuzhkuzbassugol to 
support the long-term viability of operations 
during 2012, including the approval of 
investment projects to maintain long-term 
mining volumes at the Osinnikovskaya, 
Uskovskaya and Alardinskaya mines:
 two sets of longwall equipment were 
acquired and brought into operation at the 
Uskovskaya and Alardinskaya mines ahead 
of schedule;
 Osinnikovskaya mine successfully 
shortened the period for longwall 
repositioning to 60 actual days vs planned 
80 days;
 a debottlenecking programme at 
Osinnikovskaya and Abashevskaya mines 
resulted in improved mine performance; 
 construction of the Yerunakovskava VIII 
mine was completed ahead of schedule 
with operations commencing in February 
2013;
 completion of construction and installation 
of equipment at the Raspadskaya mine 
aboveground facilities; and 
 signing by Raspadskaya of the 
memorandum of understanding with 
Hyundai Steel.
In addition, significant work to modernise  
and enhance operations at Yuzhkuzbassugol 
continued with a focus on improving gas 
drain-out, ventilation, speed of penetration, 
longwall repositioning and the mechanisation 
of roof-bolting. It is expected that this work  
will result in improved safety and reliability, 
increased productivity and improved mining 
volumes as a result of reduced operating 
costs. 
At the Mezhegeyugol joint venture (EVRAZ’s 
interest 60%), which is developing two 
significant greenfield hard coking coal deposits 
in Tyva in the south of Siberian region, EVRAZ 
completed planned geological exploration, 
design works and began construction of power 
infrastructure at the site. EVRAZ also secured 
project financing for continued development 
works with limited recourse to the parent 
company.
2012 Production
Yuzhkuzbassugol
Yuzhkuzbassugol mined 8.5 million tonnes of 
coking coal in 2012 (100% of the planned 
volumes), 35% more than in 2011. This 
increase was due to improved mine 
performance following the successful 
implementation of operational improvement 
programmes, with key activities described 
above. In total, 2.3 million tonnes of steam 
coal were mined, or 91% of the production 
plan, with the shortfall primarily due to the 
suspension of mining at the Gramoteinskaya 
mine in Q4 2012 following a methane gas 
burst. 
Key customers of Yuzhkuzbassugol comprise 
EVRAZ ZSMK, EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ DMZ 
Petrovskogo. 
Estimated proven and probable reserves at 
Yuzhkuzbassugol under the JORC Code were 
equal to approximately 624 million tonnes of 
coking coal as at 1 April 2012.
Raspadskaya 
As at 31 December 2012 EVRAZ held a 41% 
effective interest in Raspadskaya. On 16 
January 2013 EVRAZ increased its interest in 
Raspadskaya to 82%.
In 2012, raw coking coal output by 
Raspadskaya increased by 12% to 7 million 
tonnes in spite of a challenging market 
environment. This included 2.7 million tonnes 
of raw coal mined at faces 4-9-23 and 4-7-25 
of the Raspadskaya mine.
Raspadskaya’s 2012 total sales volume for 
coal products was approximately 5.0 million 
tonnes, a 8% increase compared to 2011.  
An increase in Russian sales and the delivery 
of additional volumes under contract options, 
combined with increased export shipments 
resulted in Q4 2012 sales volumes growing  
by 40% compared to Q3 2012. 
In October 2011, Raspadskaya began to  
sell coal to Ukraine, and in mid-April 2012  
it resumed sales to Asia. During 2012, 
Raspadskaya also worked to resume export 
sales and begin selling its products into new 
markets. Raspadskaya’s export shipments 
increased significantly in the second half of 
2012 and the Raspadskaya brand was 
promoted through direct contacts, coking coal 
testing and shipping to numerous Asian 
countries. In 2012 the share of exports in total 
sales volumes totalled 15%, while the share of 
sales to Asia-Pacific reached one third of all 
export volumes.
On 8 October 2012 Raspadskaya signed a 
memorandum of understanding with Hyundai 
Steel to supply up to 300,000 tonnes of coal 
products per year, from April 2013. In March 
2013, the respective contract was executed 
by Raspadskaya and Hyundai Steel.
As of 31 December 2011, Raspadskaya had 
proven and probable coking coal reserves of 
1,314 million tonnes, measured and indicated 
resources of 1,809 million tonnes and inferred 
resources of 262 million tonnes, according to 
a report from IMC.

Raspadskaya mine’s Rehabilitation
The underground fire at the Raspadskaya mine 
following the May 2010 explosions has been 
completely sealed by blast-resistant walls. To 
control the content of air in the mine, reduce 
dangerous gas levels in the sealed area and 
extinguish fires from the surface, Raspadskaya 
drilled new shafts and injected a large volume 
of nitrogen and inert foam into the areas of the 
mine affected by the fires. Drilling of shafts to 
the sealed area of the mine and the periodic 
injections of nitrogen and inert foam into this 
area are continuing. By the end of 2012, the 
following initiatives had been undertaken to 
contain and eliminate the fire:
 pumping in 12,000 cubic meters of sludge 
material;
 pumping in 1.9 million cubic meters of 
nitrogen gas; and
 pumping in over 260 million cubic meters of 
inert foam.
Further work on the reconstruction of the mine 
targets principal objectives to eliminate all 
dangers relating to the accident: reducing the 
size of the mine’s sealed area where fires 
continue through the construction of new 
blast-resistant walls and extinguishing the fires 
in the sealed area of the mine, through 
continued drilling of new shafts to the sealed 
area and further injections of nitrogen and 
inert foam.
Independent technical consultant IMC has had 
extensive discussions with senior managers 
and Directors of Raspadskaya about the 
explosion, its aftermath and the progressive 
rehabilitation programme and considers that a 
very responsible and detailed approach has 
been adopted. All initiatives and suggestions 
have been considered utilising all the national 
and international expertise available. 
Coal washing plants
The operating performance of EVRAZ’s coal 
washing plants during the year tracked raw 
coking coal production of Yuzhkuzbassugol. 
Additional processed volumes of coking coal 
were purchased from third parties, including 
deliveries from Raspadskaya in the amount of 
667,000 tonnes, of which 428,000 tonnes 
were shipped to Ukrainian operations.
Internal consumption of coking coal 
concentrate by EVRAZ’s plants amounted to 
2.3 million tonnes. Intragroup sales of coking 
coal concentrate totalled 3.3 million tonnes in 
2012. External sales comprised 668,000 
tonnes of coking concentrate shipped to 
domestic consumers and 34,000 tonnes sold 
in international markets. 
2013 Targets:
 The key targets for EVRAZ’s Russian coal 
mining operations in 2013 include: 
 The gradual ramp-up of the Yerunakovskaya 
VIII mine to reach an estimated output of  
1 million tonnes of semi-hard coking coal  
by the end of 2013;
 Realisation of Mezhegey Project Phase I, 
including the completion of design 
documentation, completion of the power 
infrastructure and work camp as well as 
construction of the main industrial facilities 
with first coal expected by the end of 2013;
 Implementation of ongoing projects aimed 
at maintaining and developing the mining 
capacity of major coking coal mines – 
Osinnikovskaya, Uskovskaya and 
Alardinskaya;
 Execution of a pilot project on draining-out 
of gases with long directional boreholes at 
Alardinskaya mine;
 Integration of the Raspadskaya business in 
the operational model of EVRAZ;
 Continuation of the Raspadskaya mine 
reconstruction programme; 
 Increase of coal production at Raspadskaya 
by approximately 40% compared to 2012; 
and
 Increase of Raspadskaya’s export coal 
concentrate sales to 35% of total sales.

Operational Highlights: 
In 2012, a programme of operational 
improvements was undertaken at  
EVRAZ Vanady Tula, which focused on 
debottlenecking and increasing vanadium 
pentoxide production capacity. Additional 
works on EVRAZ Vanady Tula’s pulp filtration 
plant continued, with the aim of improving 
working conditions, increasing mechanisation, 
cutting operational losses and increasing 
pentoxide production volumes in 2013. EVRAZ 
Vanady Tula also continued to increase tailing 
utilisation levels, and during the year the 
volume of tailings recycled exceeded annual 
production levels.
In 2012, the key challenge of EVRAZ Stratcor 
was to secure additional sources of feedstock 
following significant disruptions to supplies as 
a result of a major explosion at a third party’s 
operation. To mitigate the adverse impact of 
disruptions, a project to enable the processing 
of vanadium slag from EVRAZ NTMK was 
approved in the second half of 2012 with 
construction works scheduled to start in 
2013.
Additionally, in 2012 EVRAZ worked with US 
Federal authorities to successfully revoke  
a 17 year old anti-dumping duty on imports of 
Russian ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium.
In 2012, production at EVRAZ Vametco was 
impacted by stoppages resulting from the 
breakages of key equipment at the beginning 
of the year and a lack of slag supply in the 
middle of the year.
2012 Production
In 2012, EVRAZ Vanady Tula produced 7,117 
tonnes of vanadium pentoxide and 2,715 
tonnes of ferrovanadium. EVRAZ Vanady Tula’s 
domestic sales of FeV amounted to 47% of 
production, including intragroup deliveries of 
12% to EVRAZ ZSMK, EVRAZ NTMK, and 
EVRAZ DMZ Petrovskogo.
In 2012, EVRAZ Nikom produced 4,544 
tonnes of ferrovanadium. EVRAZ Nikom 
delivers most of its products to North America 
(approximately 58%), Europe (20%), Asia, 
South America and CIS. 
In 2012, EVRAZ Vametco produced 3 
thousand tonnes of modified vanadium oxide 
and 2 thousand tonnes of its proprietary 
Nitrovan® product.
2013 Targets:
The key targets of EVRAZ’s vanadium 
operations in 2013 include: 
 increasing vanadium output at all EVRAZ 
plants;
 completing the pulp filtration project and the 
implementation of a new enhanced 
maintenance system at EVRAZ Vanady Tula;
 increasing production capacity at EVRAZ 
Nikom through the modernisation of the 
current production line; and
 completion of the project to use slag from 
EVRAZ NTMK to alleviate feedstock 
shortages at EVRAZ Stratcor and increase 
the output of specialty high value added 
vanadium chemicals.

Key challenges
Upon review of the business, EVRAZ has 
identified the four most significant ongoing 
CSR challenges as:
 Health and safety – the health and safety  
of Company’s employees are of paramount 
importance. The steel and mining industries 
have inherent risk that needs to be 
managed effectively to ensure a safe 
working environment. EVRAZ constantly 
strives to improve the performance by 
avoiding or mitigating these risks.
 Environmental footprint – the Company’s 
operations can have a significant impact on 
the environment. EVRAZ is committed to 
meeting or exceeding legal requirements in 
order to reduce its environmental footprint, 
thus making the world a cleaner place.
 Human capital management – retaining the 
best talent requires investment in the 
development of the Company’s employees 
in order to secure long-term stability of the 
business and drive technological 
development.
 Community relations – EVRAZ is a 
long-term investor in its areas of operation 
and is committed to ensuring that local 
communities benefit from Company’s 
presence. 
Review of 2012 performance
Health and Safety Performance
In 2012, the Company adopted a number of 
new Group-wide policies and requirements in 
order to standardise and improve HSE 
management system: 
 alcohol, drugs and smoking policy;
 work at heights requirements; 
 personal protective equipment requirements;
 contractors’ management requirements; 
 occupational risk assessment requirement; 
 induction training on labour protection, 
industrial safety, fire safety and the 
environment;
 fundamental environmental requirements;
 corporate environmental reporting 
guidelines.
Developed in 2011, the EVRAZ HSE reporting 
system has led to improved incident reporting 
and a full year of consistent data in 2012. HSE 
performance data is now submitted by 
subsidiaries to the corporate HSE directorate 
on a monthly basis to ensure permanent 
monitoring. Information on any significant 
incidents is immediately escalated to 
management in order to enable appropriate 
investigations to take place, with further 
development of preventative and corrective 
actions. 
As a result, statistics on lost time incidents for 
2012 are more comprehensive and accurate 
than in previous years. This has partially 
contributed to the 20% reported increase in 
LTIFR (lost time injury frequency rate 
calculated as number of lost working hours 
due to injuries per 1 million hours worked) 
seen in 2012. EVRAZ remains committed to 
achieving a long-term downward trend in LTIFR.
Regrettably in 2012 the Company recorded 25 
separate fatal accidents at EVRAZ operations 
during the year. The key hazardous factor 
leading to 40% of EVRAZ fatalities in 2012 
was the influence of mobile equipment or 
parts thereof. Another 40% is composed of 
rock falls in coal and ore, falling objects and 
falling from heights taken together. At the 
same time, the analysis of lost time injuries 
(LTI’s) demonstrates that two categories of 
LTI’s – fall-overs and equipment related 
injuries - contribute to 42.5% of all LTI’s 
recorded in 2012. 
Based on thorough analysis the Company  
has identified opportunities to reduce safety 
incidents. To tackle these key problems,  
two company wide programmes are being 
launched in 2013. EVRAZ will take reasonable 
measures to ensure the walkways at all 
Targets
After determining the key challenges and focus areas, EVRAZ has set the following 5 year targets for its sustainability performance.

facility managers will analyse all walkways 
from the point of view of hazardous factors 
and will make sure that all hazards - including 
moving machinery, high-voltage electricity, 
steam and gas pipelines, etc. - are effectively 
fenced off from the pathways employees are 
using on a regular basis. Secondly, the Group 
will focus on working at heights’ safety 
measures for employees and contractors.
2013 Targets
In 2013 the Company aims to reduce LTIFR by 
20% in comparison with 2012 and has a clear 
target to reduce fatalities in the ongoing 
journey to achieve zero fatalities and serious 
injuries.
Environmental performance
Steelmaking and mining sites use substantial 
amounts of energy and water and can affect 
water quality, air quality, waste and land use. 
EVRAZ’s environmental strategy is to minimise 
the negative impact of its operations and use 
natural resources efficiently, seeking optimal 
solutions for industrial waste management.

2  The rate between amount of waste recycled or used vs. annual waste generation, not including mining waste. It can exceed 100% due to recycling of prior periods’ waste. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

In 2012 EVRAZ spent approximately US$35 
million on measures to ensure environmental 
compliance (including US$18 million on  
water management projects) and more  
than US$30 million on projects to improve  
its environmental performance. In the period 
from 2013 to 2017, the Group is committed  
to spending more than US$300 million on 
environmental programmes across its 
operations. 
In the course of 2012, the Company reviewed 
the environmental strategy using risk 
assessment tools, and set the following 
five-year targets: 
 5% reduction in air emissions; 
 15% decrease in fresh water consumption;
 100% of non-mining waste recycled or used.
Although environmental fines across the Group 
increased in 2012, no significant 
environmental incidents were recorded. EVRAZ 
is committed to continuing strengthening the 
environmental management system and 
increasing the number of operations compliant 
with ISO 14001. Now EVRAZ has 13 ISO 
14001 certified sites, including the largest 
facilities: EVRAZ NTMK, EVRAZ ZSMK, EVRAZ 
DMZ Petrovskogo, EVRAZ Highveld, EVRAZ 
Vítkovice and EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli.
EVRAZ supports the human health and the 
environment goals of REACH Regulation

,  
and EVRAZ entities completed the registration 
procedure for all of the products which fall 
within the scope of the law (within the 
registration deadlines) and gained all 
necessary registration numbers at the end  
of 2010. In compliance with the requirements 
of the regulation and its amendments, all 
necessary safety data sheets for EVRAZ 
entities’ products were developed according to 
the new EU format on languages of countries 
of supply and sent to our customers. EVRAZ is 
currently preparing for the next key stage being 
the registration of 2013 substances in close 
cooperation with customers, associations, 
consortia and respective SEIF members. 
Air emissions
Reduction of air emissions is one of EVRAZ’s 
main environmental objectives. Emissions 
primarily comprise nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
sulphur oxides (SOx), dust and volatile organic 
compounds. The Company has made 
significant progress in reducing air emissions 
through investments in modern technologies 
and withdrawal of obsolete equipment. As a 
result air emissions from steelmaking 
operations have declined by 25% since 2009 
and by 1.5% in 2012.
In 2012, EVRAZ completed a number of 
upgrades of existing operations and developed 
a new programme for reducing air emissions 
at EVRAZ ZSMK. Another key project finalised 
in 2012 was the upgrade of air pollution 
control equipment at EVRAZ Claymont Steel  
in the United States. The site installed 
additional equipment to capture and control air 
contaminants and reduce air emissions from 
the melt shop. The project was implemented 
over the course of the last three years and 
required investment of US$17 million. 
In 2012, the Group undertook a project to 
reduce its carbon dioxide emissions within the 
framework of the Joint Implementation (JI) 
mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. The project 
specifies reconstruction of EVRAZ NTMK 
plant’s blast furnaces #5 and #6 with the 
introduction of efficient resource saving 
technologies for pig iron production to reduce 
fuel consumption. This also resulted in CO2 
emission reductions. Projects which are 
eligible to participate in JI must comply with 
certain monitoring and measurement 
requirements, to generate a volume of 
Emissions Reduction Units (ERUs), equivalent 
to the volume of emissions reductions 
achieved, which can be sold in the 
international market. EVRAZ NTMK generated 
1.9 million ERUs generating revenues of  
US$6 million that will be re-invested into 
environmental improvement projects.
The main emissions issue associated  
with the Company’s coal mining operations  
is  
the release of methane gas after mine 
degasification. The concentration of methane 
is low and therefore there is no available and 
economically viable technology to capture  
and utilise this gas at present. However, 
EVRAZ continues to investigate solutions for 
minimising the quantity of methane emitted 
from the coal mining operations. 
Water consumption and wastewater 
discharge 
The objective of the Company is to use  
water resources efficiently and to prevent  
any negative impacts on water quality  
through environmental incidents.
In 2012 almost 87% of all water intakes were 
from surface sources, such as rivers, lakes 
and reservoirs. The total fresh water intake in 
2012 was 422.3 million cubic metres. This is 
6.5% less than in 2011 (451.6 million cubic 
metres). 
The water pumped from mines (mine 
dewatering process) is not included in the 
fresh water intake target, although pumped 
water is in part used for technology needs.  
In 2012, 46.7 million cubic metres of mine 
water were pumped out in comparison with 
44.0 million cubic metres in 2011. 
In 2012 EVRAZ adopted a new water 
management strategy for EVRAZ ZSMK  
and Yuzhkuzbassugol which is expected to 
significantly improve the water management 
performance of these operations. 
Waste management
Mining and steelmaking operations produce 
significant amounts of waste including waste 
rock, spent ore and tailings (waste from 
processing ore and concentrates). EVRAZ 
aims to reduce the amount of waste it 
produces, to reuse natural resources where 
possible and to dispose of waste in a manner 
that minimises the environmental impact 
whilst maximising operational and financial 
efficiency. Until recently much of the waste 
EVRAZ produced was simply stored in landfills, 
however the Company is developing a strategy 
to reduce waste storage volumes and enhance 
waste disposal. 
In total, in 2012 EVRAZ recycled or reused 
104%
 2 
of waste and by-products from its 
non-mining assets compared to 109.6%  
in 2011.
EVRAZ’s strategy for dealing with non-
hazardous mining wastes, such as depleted 
rock, tailings and overburden is to use them 
where possible for land rehabilitation and  
the construction of dams or roads. In 2012, 
27.8% or 27 million tonnes of such waste 
material were reused compared to 46.7%  
or 45.6 million tonnes in 2011. 
All non-recyclable waste is stored in facilities 
which are designed to prevent any harmful 
substances contained in the waste escaping 
into the environment. 
In 2012 EVRAZ ZSMK and Yuzhkuzbassugol 
were recognised by the administration of 
Kemerovo region and Kuzbass Waste 
Processors Association for their contribution 
to environmental protection, secondary 
resources disposal, and cooperation in the 
establishment of the waste processing 
industry in the Kuzbass region.

Human capital
EVRAZ recognises the importance of working 
with people and for people. Therefore one of 
the key pillars of the Company’s long-term 
development plan is the development of its 
human capital. EVRAZ remains committed  
to providing equal rights to its employees 
regardless of their race, nationality, gender  
or sexual orientation, and the Company 
recognises the importance of diversity  
when recruiting talented employees.

Performance 
As of 31 December 2012 EVRAZ employed 
more than 110,000 people across Europe, 
Africa and North America, with the majority 
located in Russia and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States.
In 2012 EVRAZ focused on the following  
HR activities:
 Becoming an industry leader in terms of 
labour conditions. EVRAZ is focused on 
ensuring a high level of working conditions 
for all employees, regardless of their 
location. Favourable and safe working 
conditions are one of the most important 
factors that motivate staff. The Company 
provides health insurance, transport and 
food for its employees.
 Youth outreach. Youth outreach is one of 
the key pillars in developing EVRAZ’s human 
capital. EVRAZ strives to engage the young 
generation in the Company’s enterprises. 
The Company arranges visits to schools to 
present professional orientation 
programmes, invites pupils to the plants, 
and works with young employees to offer 
them various opportunities for professional 
growth. EVRAZ has developed a number of 
initiatives to attract highly talented students 
and graduates, such as paid internships, 
relocation compensation for interns and 
graduates, scholarships for students after 
successful training subject to subsequent 
employment; and corporate grants for the 
higher professional education of young 
employees.
EVRAZ offers young employees various 
opportunities for both professional and 
personal development by implementing 
individual plans for career development, 
education and training; organising professional 
contests such as: “Best young employee”, 
“Best in profession” and “Best young leader”; 
and youth scientific and technological 
conferences. The EVRAZ’s Youth organisation 
runs sporting and entertainment events.
In September 2012 Nizhny Tagil hosted the 
First Youth Forum of EVRAZ [Case 1]
 Identify and develop high potential 
employees (HiPo). In 2012 a lot of  
attention was paid to the development of 
high potential employees. EVRAZ has two 
closely related schemes in place, known  
as HiPo development and the New Leaders 
Programme. One focuses on the 
development of selected high potential 
employees in preparation for future 
leadership roles in Russia, while the other 
develops talented employees worldwide to 
become future operational and technical 
leaders. Talent management issues are 
supervised by a special Talent Committee 
comprising key EVRAZ executives, all of 
whom are actively involved in and personally 
responsible for, tutoring and overseeing a 
given pool of HiPos.
For HiPo, the Company’s goal is to select and 
prepare a set of suitable candidates for future 
roles as Russian business leaders. 
Additionally, in 2012, 59 EVRAZ employees 
from the USA, Canada, South Africa, Czech 
Republic, Switzerland, Ukraine and Russia,  
all of whom possess diplomas of higher 
engineering training and actual production 
experience, participated in the EVRAZ New 
Leaders Programme. The programme’s 
objectives are to shape a future international 
management team who could potentially hold 
leading positions at the Company’s 
enterprises, to encourage the development of 
general management skills and engineering 
competency, and to establish projects directed 
at the improvement of EVRAZ’s production 
system. 
 The preservation and development of 
engineering and technical expertise. 
EVRAZ capitalises on its technical 
employees’ expertise by involving them in 
the development of educational materials 
and training courses. Thus EVRAZ ensures 
experts and trainees are prepared for 
handling business issues. [The preservation 
and development of engineering and 
technical expertise [Case 2]
 Standard educational programmes. In 
2012 the Company introduced integrated 
corporate competence, adapted for all 
levels of management, from operational 
supervisors to executive management. 
Training programmes were developed in 
accordance with the corporate model and 
are now implemented across EVRAZ’s 
educational centres. The programme’s goal 
is to increase management efficiency. 
Graduates of the programme include: the 
leading specialists of the businesses, 
heads of technical areas, and subdivision 
heads. In 2012 100% of leaders and 40% 
of senior masters successfully completed 
the programme. In the second half of 2012, 
the training programmes were 
supplemented with a course on corporate 
standards of HSE, including modern tools of 
safety management.
Plans for 2013 include the continuing 
implementation of the majority of the 2012 
programmes, as well as further enhancements 
and implementation of new HR programmes. 
Key targets for 2013 include: 100%  
of employees engaged in development 
programmes, and new vacancies offered  
first to internal candidates. EVRAZ plc

Corporate Social Responsibility (Continued)
Cooperation with labour unions
EVRAZ respects its employees’ rights and 
aims to build a constructive and positive 
relationship with the labour unions which 
represent them. All EVRAZ sites operate 
through the collective bargaining agreement 
model. The Company has generally high levels 
of unionisation at operations, although this 
can vary significantly across operations and 
countries.
Regular discussions and formal and informal 
meetings of the management and the unions 
are conducted at all EVRAZ facilities in Russia 
and globally. 
Internal communications
EVRAZ is committed to keeping its employees 
informed of major corporate developments to 
the highest possible extent, and ensuring they 
understand and are aligned with the business 
strategy. EVRAZ has a well-developed internal 
communications system including an 
anonymous whistle-blowing system that allows 
employees to confidentially raise questions 
about any possible issue they face. The 
whistle-blowing system uses a number of 
tools, including internal surveys, suggestion 
boxes and a special anonymous hotline. In 
2012 the hotline received more than 2,200 
inquiries, which were addressed by the 
Company’s management in a timely manner.
Social and community programmes
EVRAZ contributes to local economies by 
providing jobs, paying taxes and looking after 
the communities where it operates. The 
Company takes its social responsibilities 
seriously, addressing and monitoring all 
aspects of corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) that are relevant to the business.
EVRAZ supports various community initiatives 
in the countries and regions where present. 
EVRAZ’s social expenses worldwide were  
US$51 million in 2012. 
Most assistance is channelled through 
charitable foundations set up by the Company 
and managed by local supervisory boards. 
EVRAZ’s charity funds operate in Russia 
(Siberia and the Urals) and the Czech Republic. 
The projects in Russia are divided into three 
categories: children, local communities and 
sports. Projects for children include providing 
assistance for children with special needs 
(especially those with cerebral palsy), such  
as no-cost treatment, purchasing special 
equipment for local hospitals, organising 
workshops for parents and doctors, providing 
essential equipment for day care centres, and 
career development. Besides in 2012 special 
projects aimed at bettering living conditions 
were further rolled out in the regions where the 
Company’s plants, facilities and offices are 
located. Thus EVRAZ funded the 
reconstruction of a railway crossing in the 
north of the city of Nizhniy Tagil (Ural) and 
funded construction of a paved road along the 
river Aba in Novokuznetsk (Siberia), as well as 
further expanded its programme of 
neighbourhood beautification by placing more 
courtyards in selected neighbourhoods, and 
installing children playgrounds, benches and 
sandboxes in some of them. 
Social investments in Ukraine included 
support for Vasilkovsky neurological hospital, 
Gorky Theater and instalment of a sun dial.
The EVRAZ Charity Fund in the Czech Republic 
supports the long-term development of the 
Moravian-Silesian region with funds directed 
towards medical, educational and 
psychological support for children suffering 
from various disabilities of the central nervous 
system, in particular those suffering from 
cerebral palsy. EVRAZ also supports Vitkovice 
hockey club. 
EVRAZ’s social investments in South Africa 
aim to empower communities through 
education, health, housing, community, 
infrastructure and supply chain initiatives.
EVRAZ North America launched a new 
community programme in 2012. The  
Reading Sparks™ children’s literacy 
programme included employee engagement 
activities, book distributions to school children 
in Claymont, funding for public school reading 
programmes such as the “Battle of the 
Books” in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,  
as well as donations to community centres  
in Regina and in Camrose, Alberta, Canada,  
for books and reading rooms. 
Additional non-profit organisations and 
charitable causes supported by EVRAZ North 
America in 2012 include the United Way, Boys 
& Girls Clubs, American Cancer Society, Boy 
Scouts of America, YMCA Centres, and 
numerous food drives, youth sports teams, 
and hospitals. 
Besides EVRAZ supports Dinamo sport club, 
Uralochka, a professional women volleyball 
team, hockey club Metallurg in Novokuznetsk 
and several children sports clubs, including 
the award-winning Federation of Sambo and 
Judo in the city of Kachnkanar in the Urals 
region. The Company also sponsored the 
Russian Geographical Society as well as  
the Volleyball Federation of Russia. 
 
Transformation in South Africa
EVRAZ Highveld’s transformation and social 
responsibility activities support B-BBEE 
(Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment) 
to create a better South Africa for all. The 
Company’s transformation policy (including  
the B-BBEE Act and the Broad-Based 
Socio-Economic Charter for the South African 
Mining Industry) is aligned with legislative and 
prescriptive measures aimed at achieving 
accurate demographic reflection within the 
organisation.
The policy formalises the Company’s respect 
for diversity and its contribution to advance 
transformation in areas such as preferential 
procurement and socio-economic 
development, employment equity, skills 
development and the development of local 
entrepreneurs. 
The Company retained its Level 5 B-BBEE 
scorecard with a score of 56.20, showing 
progress towards our target of 59.48 and an 
improvement on the score of 55.48 in 2011. 
The scorecard measures three core elements 
of BEE: direct empowerment through 
ownership and control of enterprises and 
assets, human resource development and 
employment equity, indirect empowerment 
through preferential procurement and 
enterprise development.
The main instrument in attracting skills to 
achieve the targeted demographic mix remains 
the Company’s benefits and remuneration 
packages, which are regularly benchmarked 
against others in the mining and industrial 
sectors. EVRAZ plc

CSR case studies
Case 1:  
The First Y outh Forum of EVRAZ 
EVRAZ pays great attention to the development of the potential 
of young employees. The Company believes that young people 
are the future and youth organisations take an active part in the 
life of the Company. To attract and retain young employees in 
each enterprise EVRAZ operates a programme, “The Youth”, 
which involves training young employees, testing their 
professional skills, and organising cultural and sporting events.
About 150 young miners and metal-makers from EVRAZ’s 
Russian operations took part in the Company’s First Youth 
Forum. The event took place in September 14th 2012 in Nizhny 
Tagil and lasted for three days. During this time the young 
employees of EVRAZ operations in Siberia, the Urals and the Far 
East took part in various training activities, had direct contact 
with the senior management of EVRAZ and socialized with their 
colleagues from other regions.
The goal of the event was to unite the young employees  
of EVRAZ and use their knowledge and energy in the 
implementation of EVRAZ’s policies. 
Case 2: Preserving and developing engineering  
and technical expertise at our operations 
The participants of the project are experts from the plants and 
engineering technicians of the same profession potentially 
capable of taking the expert’s place.
The programme consists of two courses: the School of Senior 
Experts, in which top-level technical employees pass their 
knowledge onto future experts, and the School of Progressive 
Experience, which allows the experts to share knowledge with  
a view to improving business processes.
The work of the School of Senior Experts is based on the following 
approaches:
1.  LEARN: Participants are trained and examined on the areas of 
focus at their enterprise. 
2.  ACT: The participants put their new knowledge into practice as 
they work on individual projects to solve business issues with 
the help of LEAN technologies. 
3.  TEACH: The programmes are individual for every enterprise 
implementing them, and are run by the chief technical 
professionals. Experts are educated to work as lecturers. 
Graduates of the school use their experience to prepare 
materials for educational books that EVRAZ is developing. 
In 2012 about 145 experts and 300 potential successors took 
part in the programme.
The second course, the School of Progressive Experience, aims to 
promote the exchange of experience and sharing of knowledge 
within the Company. This involves practical activities, involving 
experts in the process of operational improvements, allowing 
them to discuss and resolve engineering and technological 
issues, and planning progress for the year 2013. As a result The 
School of Progressive Experience helps the employees to form a 
fresh view on everyday business processes and offer ideas to 
improve them.
In 2012 almost 160 employees participated in the programme.
In 2013 EVRAZ aims to expand both courses, establishing 10 
Schools of Senior Experts and 4 Schools of Progressive 
Experience.
The scope of the course will grow as external experts from Research 
Institutes, client companies, and suppliers are invited to participate. EVRAZ plc

Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group on pages 102 to 167 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union and the presentation currency is US dollars.
Overview
As a result of a general weakness in the market for steel and steelmaking raw materials, the Company recorded a net loss of US$335 million for 
2012, compared to a net profit of US$453 million in 2011. Gross profit deteriorated as falling prices affected revenue and we were also impacted 
by an impairment of US$413 million. Our EBITDA decreased 31% to US$2,012 million in 2012.
Cash flow generation was utilised in the continuing investment to upgrade and maintain our operations, as well as to declare a final dividend for 
2011 and an interim dividend for the first half of 2012. Free cash flow for the year was positive, and we increased borrowings to prepare for the 
repayment of Rouble bonds and Eurobonds due in 2013. As of 31 December 2012, the Company held cash and short-term deposits for a total of 
US$2,064 million, compared to short-term debt of US$1,862 million
1
.
As part of a strategic alignment of our asset base at the end of 2012, the Group decided to dispose of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium  
and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel operations. Accordingly these assets are accounted for as assets held for sale as at the year-end. In March 2013  
we announced the execution of a non-binding term sheet on sale of EVRAZ Highveld.
In January 2013 we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Raspadskaya coal company, which was mostly financed by equity, and 
via a US$202 million cash component payable in equal quarterly instalments ending on 15 January 2014.
In addition, in April 2013 we announced the acquisition of a 51% stake in Timir, a joint-venture with Alrosa, created for the development of large 
iron ore deposits in Yakutia, Russia for RUB4,950 million (ca. US$160 million).

Eliminations (3,033) (3,732) 699 (18.7)%
Total 14,726 16,400 (1,674) (10.2)%
Group revenues for 2012 decreased by 10.2% to US$14,726 million of which steel products’ revenues (excluding intersegment sales) amounted 
to US$12,137 million or 82%. Steel sales volumes decreased only marginally from 15.5 million tonnes in 2011 to 15.3 million tonnes. The 
reduction in revenues was due largely to a decrease in sales prices, in line with the general trend in steel pricing. 
EVRAZ was also impacted by a poorer product mix during the year as steel from EVRAZ ZSMK was used for the production of lower margin billets 
because the rail mill modernisation programme halted rail production in April 2012. As the EVRAZ ZSMK rail mill has been operational from  
12 January 2013, and the ramp-up will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect an improved product mix during 2013. In addition 
adverse market conditions impacted sales volumes of the Group’s flat-rolled products in Europe.
“ The financial results for 2012 reflect the subdued  
steel pricing environment, however we have managed  
to retain balance sheet flexibility and preserve our solid 
liquidity position. While the business outlook for 2013 
remains challenging we continue to focus on efficiency 
improvements and the optimisation of our asset portfolio. ”

Cost of revenue decreased by 5.4% to US$11,797 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of a number of factors. Raw material costs 
decreased by 20% largely due to lower purchase prices for iron ore, coking coal and scrap. The costs for semi-finished products fell by 39%,  
as more slabs were procured internally, for further re-rolling, as opposed to being purchased from third parties. Expenditure on services 
decreased by US$9 million, as inflationary pressure was balanced by a 5% devaluation of the Rouble and through cost savings at many of  
our operations. Goods for resale increased by 55% as EVRAZ Metal Inprom increased the purchase of third party products to satisfy customer 
demand. Transportation costs increased by 7% following an increase in Russian railway tariffs and higher volumes of intragroup shipments of 
semi-products. The 2012 labour cost increase is partially attributed to carryover effects of 2011 salary increases that were negotiated based  
on more favourable 2011 market conditions, however these were somewhat offset, at least in Russia, by the Rouble devaluation.
Total depreciation, depletion and amortisation amounted to US$1,259 million for 2012, compared to US$1,153 million for 2011. The increase  
is due mainly to a larger depletion expense at Yuzhkuzbassugol following a revaluation of reserves in July 2011. While higher reserves were 
recognised, the future development costs per tonne of coal are higher than previously estimated. In 2012, management revised its mining  
plans to exclude some reserves that are not expected to be developed earlier than 2040-2070 and updated the reserves valuation accordingly. 
This led to a minor reduction of reserve base and a significant decline in estimated future development costs used in the calculation of the 
depletion charge. The amount of depreciation in cost of revenue was US$1,100 million for 2012. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

We achieved a reduction in electricity costs of US$49 million through increased proprietary generation at EVRAZ ZSMK and lower consumption at 
our European operations due to reduced activity. Natural gas expenditure was also slightly reduced as increases in prices were offset by 
devaluation of the local currencies, and reduced consumption volume as a result of lower level activity in Europe.
The large increase in other costs is mostly due to changes in finished goods inventory and work in progress, which increased by US$192 million  
in 2011, but decreased by US$53 million in 2012 due to destocking at the end of the year.

Selling and distribution expenses were 4.9% higher than in 2011 mainly due to the carryover effect of a change to CPT sales terms in Russia, which 
was introduced in the first half of 2011, and a minor increase in volumes shipped. This was slightly offset by a reduction in bad debt expense due 
to better cash collection from municipalities that are using heat and electricity produced by the Group’s subsidiaries at respective locations.
General and administrative expenses declined in 2012 by 6.6% mainly due to a lower staff bonuses accrual, the one off effect of expenses 
related to the premium listing that were incurred in 2011 and significant cost saving initiatives implemented at EVRAZ Highveld Steel and 
Vanadium during the year.
In 2012, we had a significantly higher impairment charge of US$413 million than in the previous year. US$356 million of this is attributed to the 
non-current assets of Evrazruda. For more details please refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements. 
Foreign exchange gains/(losses) moved from a US$269 million gain in 2011 to a US$41 million loss in 2012. This is in large part due to  
currency fluctuations on intragroup debt where the entities involved have different functional currencies. IFRS does not have a notion of a Group’s 
functional currency, therefore gains/(losses) of one subsidiary do not have corresponding counterparts in another subsidiary and thus cannot be 
eliminated on consolidation. For example this is the case between Russian subsidiaries with rouble functional currency and our non-Russian 
entities with other respective functional currencies. 
Interest expense incurred by the Group has fallen steadily over the last two years as we have refinanced debt at lower interest rates.  
Interest expense was US$645 million for 2012, compared to US$708 million for 2011. EVRAZ plc

Gains on financial assets and liabilities for 2012 were US$164 million, and dominated by a gain of US$177 million on the change in fair value  
of derivatives – currency and interest rate swaps for rouble bonds. This is a significant reversal of the position in 2011 where a loss of US$110 
million was incurred on the swaps alone. In 2011 the loss on financial assets and liabilities also included the effect of a loss on early settlement 
of debt (US$71 million) and incentivised conversion of convertible bonds (US$161 million), as described in more details in Notes 7 and 21 of the 
financial statements. 
The Group recognised a US$83 million loss on reclassification of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel to assets held 
for sale. This was more than offset by a gain realised by the sale of EvrazTrans, and together with the effect of other minor disposals, led to a  
US$ 114 million gain on assets classified as held for sale.
In 2012, the Company accrued an income tax expense of US$229 million, notwithstanding a loss before tax of US$106 million. This was mostly 
due to losses at certain subsidiaries that could not be offset against profits of other subsidiaries, as well as the fact that some expenses are not 
deductible for tax purposes.
In 2012, the Company reported a US$335 million net loss, compared to a net profit of US$453 million in 2011.

Cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital fell by 31% in 2012 to US$1,733 million reflecting the lower prices for our 
products in 2012 compared to 2011.
In 2012, US$410 million of working capital was released as a result of lower average prices, but also as part of the continued focus on managing 
the Group’s working capital. In order to pre-finance the 2013 maturities of the put options on our 2013 rouble bonds, and of other bonds and 
notes, we deposited US$674 million at large Russian banks.
Capital expenditure was sustained at virtually the same level as in the previous year (US$1,261 million in 2012 compared to US$1,281 million in 
2011). In 2012 made significant progress on many of the priority projects that we launched in 2010/2011, including the modernisation of the two 
rail mills in Russia, construction of Yerunakovskaya VIII coking coal mine, PCI for our Russian blast furnaces and construction of rolling mills at the 
south of Russia and in Kazakhstan. Whilst many projects neared completion during the year investment started on new projects such as Mezhegey

In December 2012 we completed the sale of EvrazTrans for a consideration of US$306 million. This, in addition to smaller disposals, resulted in a 
net positive contribution to our cash flow of US$311 million.
During the course of 2012 we also received US$88 million of dividends and US$38 million of capital returned by Corber, the Group’s joint venture, 
and in turn paid US$375 million to our shareholders in dividends.
We also continued to benefit from realised gains on the swaps for the rouble bonds that generated another US$81 million of cash. We do not 
have any other significant hedging instruments.
The free cash flow for the Group was US$780 million in 2012.
Financing and liquidity
Debt maturities schedule*, US$ million
We started 2012 with a total debt of US$7,245 million. Due to the favourable situation in capital markets in the first half of 2012, we decided  
to pre-finance our large bond maturities coming due in March and April 2013, in order to pro-actively manage the liquidity risk. To this end,  
in April 2012 we issued US$600 million of 5-year Eurobonds, and in December 2012 we issued US$250 million of ECP. As a result of these 
actions, our total debt increased to US$8,248 million as at 31 December 2012, while net debt decreased by US$258 million from US$6,442 
million at 31 December 2011 to US$6,184 million at 31 December 2012. Interest expense accrued in respect of loans, bonds and notes was 
US$588 million for 2012, compared to US$649 million for 2011.
Given the uncertainty in our key ratios in the near term, we decided to approach our bank lenders to adjust some of our covenants. In June  
2012 we agreed with the lenders to amend the levels on the two key maintenance covenants in most of our bank debt, namely the covenants  
to maintain (i) maximum net leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to 12-month consolidated EBITDA) and (ii) minimum EBITDA interest cover ratio  
(ratio of 12-month consolidated EBITDA to 12-month consolidated interest expense). Both ratios are based on Evraz Group S. A.’s, and not the 
whole Group’s, consolidated financial statements. The new levels were set at 3.5x and 3.0x respectively, at the same time the definition of 
interest expense was adjusted to take account of cash gains on hedging arrangements related to rouble bond issues. On 31 December 2012,  
the net leverage ratio was 3.1x, and the EBITDA interest cover ratio was 4.0x. In December 2012, we also successfully obtained the consent  
of the holders of our 2015 Eurobonds to remove the maintenance covenant from these bonds. As a result, we do not have any maintenance  
test on any of our public debt, giving us added flexibility in case of market downturns negatively affecting our leverage.

Our Eurobond covenants currently limit our ability to incur new debt at Evraz Group S.A. and its subsidiaries, but do not limit our ability to  
refinance the debt of Evraz Group S.A. or to raise new debt at EVRAZ plc. In order to increase our financial flexibility, we have set up project 
financing in relation to the Mezhegey project Phase I. The project entity is a subsidiary of EVRAZ plc, but not a subsidiary of Evraz Group S.A.,  
so any utilisation of this financing is not subject to the restriction of the incurrence covenants of the Evraz Group S.A. Eurobonds. As of  
31 December 2012, we had US$5 million drawn under this facility.
Part of our bank loans continue to include covenants to maintain certain financial metrics related to profitability and leverage. As of 31 December 
2012 the outstanding amount of such loans was US$1,424 million. Given the high volatility in the global steelmaking industry, we continue to closely 
monitor and proactively address any potential issues of future compliance with covenants associated with Company’s financial indebtedness.
Our cash and deposits on 31 December 2012 of US$2,064 million compared to a short-term debt of US$1,862 million gives us confidence  
in our financial position.
Dividends
Based on the results of the first half of 2012 we declared an interim dividend of 11 cents per share. Due to the deterioration in the market 
environment, and consequently our performance, in the second half of 2012, the Directors have recommended to pay no final dividend for 2012.

Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
Introduction
EVRAZ plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated in the United Kingdom. The Company is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and control. 
Further information on the Company’s Corporate Governance policies and principles are available on the Company’s website: www.evraz.com.  
The UK Corporate Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
Compliance with corporate governance standards
EVRAZ’s approach to corporate governance is primarily based on the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Company complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code or, if it does not 
comply, explains the reasons for non-compliance. 
As of 31 December 2012 EVRAZ complied with all the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (2010 version) with the 
following exceptions:  
 Contrary to provision C.3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Olga Pokrovskaya is a member of the Audit Committee, but does not meet 
the independence criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. Since more than 50% of EVRAZ activities and operations are based  
in the Russian Federation, Olga Pokrovskaya’s technical and regional experience and qualification, as a past senior audit manager at Arthur 
Anderson and as Head of Corporate Finance at Sibneft is of particular value to the Committee and her experience would be extremely difficult 
to replicate, particularly as EVRAZ is seeking to strengthen diversity on its Board. The Company considers that, in light of her involvement with 
the Group over a number of years and her experience in this area, her membership of the Audit Committee is to the benefit of the Group.
At the beginning of 2012 EVRAZ was non-compliant with the following principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (2010 
version), however these deficiencies had been rectified by the end of the year: 
 Contrary to provision C.3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, only two of the three members of the Audit Committee were Independent 
Non-Executive Directors prior to 28 February 2012. On 28 February 2012 Sir Michael Peat, senior Independent Non-Executive Director, was 
appointed to the Audit Committee. 
 Contrary to provision D.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Remuneration Committee did not solely comprise Independent 
Non-Executive Directors prior to 19 November 2012. On this date the Board decided that the membership of the Remuneration Committee 
should comprise only Independent Non-Executive Directors in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and, consequently, Mr Abramov and 
Mr Tenenbaum stood down from the Remuneration Committee. Since 19 November 2012 the Remuneration Committee has consisted of three 
independent members: Duncan Baxter, Karl Gruber and Alexander Izosimov. The Company has therefore been compliant with provision D.2.1 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code since that date.
Board of Directors
The members of the Board of EVRAZ plc as at 31 December 2012 were: Alexander Abramov (Chairman), Alexander Frolov (CEO), Olga 
Pokrovskaya, Eugene Shvidler, Eugene Tenenbaum, Duncan Baxter, Karl Gruber, Terry Robinson, Sir Michael Peat (senior Independent Non- 
Executive Director) and Alexander Izosimov.
Alexander Izosimov was appointed to the Board of EVRAZ plc on 28 February 2012 as an Independent Non-Executive Director. 
EVRAZ plc held 11 scheduled Board meetings and 8 extraordinary meetings held in the form of conference calls and exchange of emails  
during 2012.

4  Appointed to the Board on 28 February 2012
Board balance and independence
As at 31 December 2012, the Board of EVRAZ plc consisted of ten members, comprising nine Non-Executive Directors and one executive  
Director. Half of the members of the Board were Independent Non-Executive Directors in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Company regards this as an appropriate board structure. 
Following the appointment of Alexander Izosimov on 28 February 2012 five members of the Board (those other than Alexander Frolov, Alexander 
Abramov, Olga Pokrovskaya, Eugene Shvidler and Eugene Tenenbaum) were deemed to be independent in character and judgement pursuant to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. In reaching its determination of independence, the Board concluded that each one provided an objective challenge to 
management and was willing to stand up to defend their own beliefs and viewpoints in order to support the ultimate good of the Company and to 
help develop proposals on strategy. The Board concluded that there were no relationships or circumstances likely to affect, or which might appear 
to affect, the judgement of any of its independent Non-Executive Directors. 
For completeness, the Board considered an arm’s length business arrangement between one of the Non-independent Non-Executive Directors 
and the son of Sir Michael Peat, the senior Independent Director of the Company, and satisfied itself that this arrangement has no impact on  
Sir Michael Peat’s independence. 
In addition, the Board noted the nomination of Terry Robinson, an Independent Non-Executive Director, to the Board of OJSC Raspadskaya, which 
became a subsidiary of the Company in January 2013, and was satisfied that this nomination had no impact on Mr. Robinson’s independence.

Board committees
The four principal Committees of the Board are the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Health, 
Safety and Environment Committee. 
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee at 31 December 2012 were Terry Robinson (Chairman of the Committee), Olga Pokrovskaya, Sir Michael 
Peat and Duncan Baxter. Sir Michael Peat was appointed to the Audit Committee on 28 February 2012. Terry Robinson and Sir Michael Peat are 
both Fellows of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Olga Pokrovskaya is a past senior audit manager at Arthur Anderson 
and subsequently head of Corporate Finance at Millhouse LLC and Duncan Baxter is a member of the Institute of Bankers. All members of the 
Committee are considered to have recent and relevant financial experience.
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility for monitoring the integrity of EVRAZ plc’s Group financial statements. It oversees the Group’s relationship 
with the external auditors and reviews the effectiveness of the external audit process. The Audit Committee also monitors the activity of the 
Internal Audit Department and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Controls and Business Risk Management Systems. The terms  
of reference of the Audit Committee are available on the Company’s website www.evraz.com, and its duties are categorised under the following 
headings: 
 Financial Reporting;
 Internal Controls and Business Risk Management Systems;
 Whistleblowing Procedures;
 Internal Audit/External Audit.
The Audit Committee met 10 times in 2012 and four times since the beginning of 2013 until the publication date of this Annual Report. 
Committee members were present in person at the majority of the meetings, while 4 meetings were conducted by conference call and one 
meeting was by e-mail exchange. The external auditor was present at all except three meetings: those when the Group’s 3 and 9 months interim 
management statement and 12 months production reports were discussed, and the part of a meeting when the external auditors’ performance 
was discussed. Such presence provided the auditors with the opportunity to gain direct information relevant to the external audit process; as well 
as assisting the Audit Committee with guidance on technical issues and factors relevant to the auditors when exercising their professional 
judgment.
The following sections summarise how the Audit Committee has fulfilled its duties in 2012, including the Committee’s review of the 2012 Annual 
Report and Financial Statements.
Financial reporting
At its meeting in June 2012, the Audit Committee reviewed the 2011 Management Letter from the auditors together with management’s 
responses to the matters raised. Following this review the Audit Committee requested that management create an Internal Control Manual and 
instigate a regular reporting process to the Audit Committee of all actual and potential legal actions and the progress of such actions. Certain 
potential legal actions were identified as requiring immediate notification to the Audit Committee, as part of the Group’s risk management 
process, and Board oversight.
At the August 2012 meetings, the Audit Committee reviewed the Interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Interim 
Financial Results Announcement and the Draft Interim Analysts’ Presentation. Particular areas of focus for the Audit Committee were:
 Operations classified as Assets held for Sale; EvrazTrans and DKHZ, the latter asset, a coking plant in Ukraine, representing a sale to a related 
party;
 Valuation of Mineral Reserves held by Yuzhkuzbassugol, the coal mining subsidiary, and the consequent impact of the change in depletion 
charges;
 Impairment of assets, the impairment models, the relative WACC used as discount rates, raw material and product prices, and independently 
supported assumptions;
 The buy-back of shares by the equity accounted entity, Raspadskaya;
 The acquisition of an additional 10 per cent ownership interest by the subsidiary entity that holds and operates the Mezhegey coal field project;
 The management’s presentation of the Group’s Accounting Judgements and Management Estimates;
 The Group’s statement in the Interim Report as to the principal risks and uncertainties; EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Overview Strategy Operating Review
Corporate  
Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
 Environmental commitments, and 
 The Going Concern basis for preparing the accounts; considering both a base case and a pessimistic scenario. The Group signed covenant 
amendments in June 2012 and, as a consequence of these amendments, the Audit Committee reviewed the Going Concern note in the 
Group’s Financial Statements.
Following the above consideration, the Audit Committee recommended the Going Concern statement, the Interim Unaudited Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Interim Financial Results Announcement and the Draft Interim Analysts’ Presentation for approval by the 
Directors.
At its March and April 2013 meetings, the Audit Committee reviewed the EVRAZ’s Annual Report, including the Group’s Financial Statements, the 
Group’s audited Announcement for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the draft Analysts’ Presentation. Particular areas of focus for the 
Committee’s consideration were:
 The Group’s Going Concern statement: specifically the committee considered the forward estimates of EBITDA, Total debt, Consolidated Net 
Debt, Interest expense and Consolidated Net debt for the period to June 2014. These projections were prepared on a base case and 
pessimistic case scenarios. As the Group’s funding covenants are fixed on the operational performance and balance sheet of the previous 
holding company Evraz Group S.A., the key operational and balance sheet assumptions were considered at the Evraz Group S.A. consolidated 
level. In both the base case and the pessimistic case estimates, projections for certain of the Group’s covenants suggested that in forward 
periods the Group might not be in compliance. The committee considered management’s strategy and options to manage the Group’s funding 
and liquidity needs so as to remain compliant with all covenant requirements, including testing the forward EBITDA and funding estimates, the 
probabilities of and the sourcing and terms for refinancing. Based on management’s track record for resolving similar matters and the reviewed 
probabilities for the successful implementation of the management’s funding and refinancing strategy and options, the Audit Committee 
concluded that there was no material uncertainty on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly the Committee was able 
to recommend the going concern basis to the Directors.
 Impairment: resulting primarily from weakness of iron ore, coal and steel prices impairment tests were considered for the relevant Group Cash 
Generating Units (CGU) as well as all CGUs with goodwill allocated that are required to be tested annually regardless of impairment indications. 
The main impairment recognised was made for Evrazruda, a business unit involved with primarily mining iron ore. The parameters for testing 
the Group’s CGU’s are detailed in the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Also the Committee considered potential impairment arising on the reclassification to assets held for sale of EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel, located in 
the Czech Republic and EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium, located in South Africa. 
 The Committee considered the Accounting Policies detailed in note 2 following the company’s proposal to capitalise the development works at 
the Mezhegy coal field following the final approval of its feasibility study. Hitherto, any such capitalisations relating to new mines have been 
relatively insignificant, however, whilst this is not a new Group accounting policy, the Committee advised that the policy be described in note 2 
to the Financial Statements
 New and amended accounting standards: the Audit Committee considered the standards not effective for the Financial Statements as at 
December 2012. The one with material effect on Group financial statements is the amended IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” that removes 
“corridor approach” and introduces immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses of long-term employee benefits in other comprehensive 
income. The revised standard will be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2013. If the revised standard was implemented from 1 January 
2012, Group’s equity as of 31 December 2012 would be US$322 million lower. 
 The Audit Committee considered other significant accounting judgments and management estimates, including depreciation of assets and 
depletion of mining assets; site restoration provisions; allowance for doubtful debts; NRV allowance for inventories; gains or losses on 
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and commitments and contingencies, the disposal of the EvrazTrans operation and in 
respect of the annual accounts the statement of Principal Risks and Uncertainties
 Further the Audit Committee considered Ernst and Young’s report on their audit results for the year ended 31 December 2012, their statement 
and confirmation as to their continuing independence, the review of the audit and non-audit fees and the letter of representation required by 
the external auditor from EVRAZ management.
Internal controls and risk management
As part of the Group’s Primary Listing requirements in October 2011, a comprehensive financial procedures report was prepared detailing the 
Group’s Internal Controls and risk management systems and activity. As noted above, at the June 2012 Audit Committee it was requested that 
following this report, a Group Internal Control Manual be created. The final draft of this manual was reviewed by the Audit Committee at its 
meeting in November 2012. Following this it was subject only to final review and confirmation by certain Business Unit senior managers. The 
Group has in place internal controls and risk management systems in relation to the processes for both financial reporting and the preparation of 
consolidated statements. These systems include policies and procedures to ensure that adequate accounting records are maintained and 
transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of Internal Control, which includes Risk Management, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of these systems. The system of internal control is designed to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks associated with the 
achievement of the Group’s objectives. Because of the limitations inherent in any system of internal control, the Company’s system is designed 
to meet its particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed. It is designed to manage risk rather than to eliminate risk altogether. 
Consequently, it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group’s risk management is primarily the responsibility of the executive management and a twice yearly review of the Group’s risk profile is 
undertaken by the Group’s Risk Committee, the members of which are the Group’s senior management team, headed by the Group CEO. The 
Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the oversight of this committee’s deliberations and the chair of the Audit Committee is the chair of 
the Group’s Risk Committee.
The Group’s Risk Committee reviews the Group’s operations and determining the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties according to an impact 
and probability score, nominating the appropriate risk owner and reviewing the actions necessary to mitigate such risks. Given the breadth of the 
Group’s operations it was agreed that a system of regional and local risk committees should be established with specific accountability within the 
EVRAZ Business System, for the purpose of identifying, evaluating and establishing management actions for risk mitigation. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Corporate Governance Report (Continued)
An important part of the risk management process is the determination of appropriate risk appetite at operational, local, and Group management 
levels, thereby identifying particular risks and uncertainties which require specific Board oversight. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s major risks and uncertainties prior to the publication of the Annual Report and interim management 
statements and presents the major risk register and risk matrix for the Board’s consideration, together with a review and recommendations in 
respect of the Group’s risk appetite.
On the basis of this review, the Board considers whether the measures that have been implemented to create an appropriate risk management 
framework are appropriate to the Group’s business plans, strategies and operations.
The Audit Committee and the Board have kept under review the action taken by the Group to be compliant with the UK Bribery Act. Meetings of 
the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee have been held with the interim EVRAZ Compliance Officer, the EVRAZ Legal department and the 
EVRAZ communication team. A risk review has been compiled, training modules developed and key and relevant employees have been 
determined with key employees having taken either in-house or e-training. 
At its June meeting the Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s IT strategy including plans to replace the majority of the legacy IT platforms arising 
from the Group’s various acquisitions with a common platform through a phased programme across the Group’s operations. Subsequently, at its 
March 2013 meeting, following the Risk Committee review in November 2012, the Audit Committee reviewed the IT function’s disaster recovery 
effectiveness and an audit of critical operational systems, together with the presented plans for immediate mitigation and medium term 
investment to ensure greater security of such critical systems.
The Audit Committee and the Board have reviewed the effectiveness of the project management processes and various initiatives have been 
agreed to improve project delivery.
Whistleblowing arrangements
EVRAZ has established whistleblowing hotlines within its operations encompassing a multi-lingual hotline in respect of its European operations. 
The facilities utilise a mixture of in-house and independent external third party arrangements. 
The results are reported to the Audit Committee on a monthly basis, analysed by external and in-house facilities, and by HR, HSE, fraud and 
security. Internal Audit has specific responsibility for the overall oversight of whistleblowing activity and follow-up actions.
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the whistleblowing facilities as part of the Internal Audit’s quarterly report to the Audit 
Committee. As a result of this review at the Audit Committee meeting in November 2012, the Committee requested management to revisit and 
revise the whistleblowing procedures in the Russian Federation in the light of two instances whereby the identity of the recorder had been 
prejudiced by the historic follow-up procedures. New and robust procedures have now been introduced to protect recorders’ identities. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that whistleblowing facilities remain adequate in all other operations and locations. 
Internal audit
The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports and monthly updates from the Group’s Internal Audit Department throughout the year. The 
monthly report summarises current business risks and issues, progress as to the completion of internal audit plans, including any significant 
issues identified in completed audits and Hot Line/whistleblowing statistics. The quarterly reports encompass the results of audits and any 
consequential agreed management action with regard to significant audit findings, an overview of the major risks as detailed in the Group’s risk 
register, a security report, a progress report on the implementation of agreed management action and any modification to the agreed internal 
audit plan and a report in respect of the Internal Audit Department’s KPIs.
The Group Internal Audit function’s annual audit programme, across all operations, is structured to complete annual audits of the key financial 
and operational cycles with emphasis and audit time allocation where the Audit Committee or management perceives a higher level of risk. The 
key business cycles include processes and activities in production, operational and capital expenditure, inventory management, marketing and 
sales, finance and reporting, treasury, fixed assets, human resources, HSE, IT, corporate governance and secretarial, risk management, 
corporate and social responsibility expenditure, capital project management and support services.
The internal audit plans for 2012 were reviewed at the November 2011 Audit Committee meeting. The 2012 programme, in addition to audits of 
key business and financial processes and controls, provided specific audit time for the audit of capital projects and IT procedures and controls. At 
the same time the Audit Committee endorsed the Internal Audit Department’s proposal to develop a process of internal control self-assessment 
by accountable management, thereby emphasising that ownership of internal control lies with management and is not a purely administrative or 
internal audit function. The Internal Audit Department carries out spot checks on the integrity of the management’s self-assessment processes 
and reports to the Audit Committee on their findings. 
The audit plan by separate audit is analysed in terms of man-days. Upon reviewing the audit plan the Audit Committee considers the Group’s 
Internal Audit function’s resource both in terms of total available man-days and in terms of the Internal Audit function’s skill sets. 
The Internal Audit Department takes part in a quality improvement programme which includes quality reviews of internal ongoing audit projects, 
periodic peer reviews, co-ordination with the external auditors and an external quality assessment review. EVRAZ plc

External auditor
The Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditors. Ernst & Young has provided audit services to the Company prior and 
subsequent to its listing, first to EVRAZ Group S.A. on the secondary GDR market and subsequently to EVRAZ plc listed on the Main Market  
of the London Stock Exchange in 2011. A London audit partner was proposed and appointed subsequent to the Primary Listing. The current 
engagement of the external auditor was subject to a tender process in respect of the 2009 audit. In June 2012, prior to the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting of shareholders, the Audit Committee considered and recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Ernst & Young. This 
review took into account the results of the auditor assessment process, including the quality of the work and communication undertaken by the 
external auditor and the level of audit fees. The Audit Committee discusses the requirements for partner rotation with the external auditor to 
ensure appropriate independence and objectivity are maintained. In November 2012, upon presentation of the 2012 external audit plan, the 
Audit Committee reviewed the quality and independence of service and also reviewed the FRC’s Audit Inspection Unit’s 2011/12 report 
concerning Ernst & Young. Details of the fees paid to Ernst & Young  during the year are shown in note 32 to the Financial Statements.
The Group’s External Auditors Selection Policy requires tendering external audit work at least once in five years. 
In November 2012 the Audit Committee also reviewed the external auditor’s terms of engagement in respect of the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2012, including audit plans, the scope of the audit and timescales. The Audit Committee approved the audit plans and 
timescales and tabled the audit plans at the November Board meeting.
As part of its review of the financial statements prepared by the Company, the Audit Committee reviewed the findings of the external auditor in 
respect of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 at its 21 March and 8 April 2013 meetings and in respect of the 
financial statements for the six month period ending on 30 June 2012 at its August 2012 meeting. As part of each of these reviews, the Audit 
Committee met with representatives from Ernst & Young without management present, to ensure that there were no issues concerning the 
relationship between management and the external auditor which should be addressed. There were none. At each of these meetings, the Audit 
Committee also reviewed and approved the respective representation letters given to Ernst & Young by management.
In June 2012, the Audit Committee reviewed the letter to management detailing recommendations made by the external auditor in the course of 
the 2011 audit. In its review of the engagement of the external auditor, the Audit Committee had expressed some concern at the level of 
non-audit fees in 2011. As a result, in June 2012, the Audit Committee considered and approved a policy for the approval of services to be 
provided by EVRAZ’s external auditor (a copy can be found on the Company’s website). This policy is compliant with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting Council (the “FRC”), FRC Guidance on Audit Committees and Auditing Practice 
Board (the “APB”) Ethical Standard 5 “Non-audit services provided to audited entities”. In addition, this policy details a general limit for fees 
relating to non-audit services other than further assurance services at 40% of the Group’s audit services fees based on the latest approved 
annual audit service fees. 
The non-audit fees in 2012 were US$842,000, 11% of the Group’s audit service fees.
Evaluation
In November 2012, the Audit Committee conducted its annual self-assessment of performance. This assessment included a review of the 
Committee’s membership, procedures and resources, its roles and responsibilities and its relationship with the Board. Concern was raised as to 
the appropriateness of the induction material. The Company Secretary has therefore been requested to provide suitable and detailed material for 
future new members of the Audit Committee. Aside from this observation, the Audit Committee concluded that its mandate and oversight 
performance was appropriate.
The Audit Committee also undertook an evaluation of the Internal Audit Department in combination with reviews from management and the 
external auditors. In general the Internal Audit function was held in high regard and in addition to providing a satisfactory internal control and risk 
management assurance service, the Internal Audit Department was believed to add value to the Group’s systems and control functions. The Audit 
Committee discussed with the external auditors whether there were any additional complementary audit services which might be fulfilled by the 
Internal Audit Department and Ernst & Young said that, where appropriate, they continue to rely on the results of the Internal Audit Department’s 
audits when scoping their audit plan. This evaluation was in addition to the independent evaluation, referred to above.
Remuneration Committee
On 19 November 2012 the Board, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, decided to ensure that the membership of the 
Remuneration Committee solely comprised Independent Non-Executive Directors in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Consequently, two members, Mr Abramov and Mr Tenenbaum stood down from the Committee. Therefore, as of 31 December 2012 the 
Remuneration Committee consisted of three independent members: Duncan Baxter (Chairman), Karl Gruber, and Alexander Izosimov. Alexander 
Izosimov replaced Sir Michael Peat on the Committee on 1 March 2012.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board and can operate with a quorum of two Committee members.  EVRAZ plc

Corporate Governance Report (Continued)
Responsibilities
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
 Determining and agreeing with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, the Company’s 
Chief Executive Officer, the Board Secretary and key senior management, taking into account all factors which it deems necessary including 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements, the provisions and recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and associated 
guidance;
 Reviewing and having regard to the remuneration trends across the Group when setting remuneration policy for Directors;
 Regularly reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy;
 Determining the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman of the Board, the Board Secretary and key senior management, 
including pension rights, bonuses, benefits in kind, incentive payments and share options or other share awards within the terms of the agreed 
policy and in consultation with the Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer;
 Approving awards for participants where existing share incentive plans are in place;
 Reviewing and approving any compensation payable to executive Directors and senior executives;
 Overseeing any major changes in employees’ benefits structures throughout the Group. 
During 2012, the EVRAZ’s Remuneration Committee met four times. The purpose of the meetings was to consider and to make recommendations 
to the Board on management compensation and approval of the 2012 LTIP (Long-term incentive programme) awards and list of participants,  
as well as the remuneration packages of the Chairman, Non-Executive Directors, the Executive Director and key senior managers. For the 
Remuneration Report please refer to page 86.
Nominations Committee 
The members of the Nominations Committee at 31 December 2012 were Sir Michael Peat (Chairman), Alexander Abramov, Terry Robinson, 
Alexander Izosimov and Eugene Shvidler. Mr Izosimov and Mr Shvidler were appointed on 28th February 2012.
Role of the Nominations Committee
The role of the Nominations Committee is to advise the Board on its composition, making recommendations to the Board with respect to the 
addition and replacement of Directors. 
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Nominations Committee are as follows:
 Reviewing regularly the structure, size and composition of the Board and making recommendations to the Board on any appropriate changes; 
 Identifying and nominating, for the Board’s approval, suitable candidates to fill any vacancies for non-executive and, with the assistance of the 
Chief Executive Officer, executive Directors; 
 Planning for the orderly succession of Directors to the Board; 
 Recommending to the Board the membership and chairmanship of the Audit, Remuneration, and Health, Safety and Environment Committees; 
and
 Overseeing senior management development and succession plans to ensure that there is continuity of appropriate executive resource 
immediately below Board level.
The Committee met on two occasions during 2012, on 27 February and 19 November. All members were present for both meetings, with the 
Chief Executive Officer also in attendance: 
 At its first meeting the Committee considered the appointment of a fifth Independent Non-Executive Director, to enhance the range of the 
Board’s skills and experience and to ensure that half its members are independent non-executives. After an extensive search led by the 
Chairman of the Board, with the assistance of other Directors, and interviews by the Chairmen of the Board and the Nominations Committee, 
Alexander Izosimov was identified as the best candidate. This reflected the combination of senior international business experience, in markets 
in which the Group operates, and the independence which he would bring to the Board. The Committee therefore recommended the 
appointment of Mr Izosimov to the Board. No external adviser was engaged in the search for and appointment of Mr Izosimov, as the Board 
considered the Chairman to be the best positioned for such a task. The Nominations Committee also considered its own composition and work 
programme and recommended that Alexander Izosimov and Eugene Shvidler should become members of the Nominations Committee. In 
addition, the Committee considered the composition of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and recommended that Michael Peat should 
be appointed to the former and Alexander Izosimov to the latter.
 At its second meeting, the Committee considered compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and recommended that Alexander 
Abramov and Eugene Tenenbaum should step down as members of the Remuneration Committee to ensure that all its members are 
independent non-executives. The Committee also considered the mix of length of time in office, skill, experience and diversity of the Directors 
and the continuing independence of the independent non-executives, as a basis for Board development and succession planning. With respect 
to diversity, the Board has a mix of nationalities, reflecting the international nature of its business, but at present only one female Director. It is 
intended to appoint further female Directors when there is an opportunity and suitable candidates. In addition, the Committee considered the 
annual reviews of the performance of the Board, the Chairman and each Director, and made recommendations to the Board in these respects. 
The Committee also recommended the appointment of Olga Pokrovskaya to the Health, Safety and Environmental Committee.
An internal assessment of the Board’s performance was undertaken. It was led by the senior Independent Non-Executive Director and was based 
on discussions with Directors and responses to a questionnaire.
During 2013 the Committee will continue to fulfill its general responsibilities, with particular emphasis on compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, development and succession planning for senior management, providing updates and training for Directors and facilitating an 
external review of the Board’s performance. EVRAZ plc

Health, Safety and Environment Committee 
The members of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee at 31 December 2012 were Karl Gruber (Chairman), Alexander Frolov,  
Terry Robinson and Olga Pokrovskaya (from 19 November 2012).
Role of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee leads the Board’s thinking on health and safety issues, as well as maintaining responsibility for 
environmental, safety and local community matters. 
Responsibilities of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee are:
 Assessing the performance of the Group with regard to the impact of health, safety, environmental and community relations decisions and 
actions upon employees, communities and other third parties and on the reputation of the Group;
 On behalf of the Board, receiving reports from management concerning all fatalities and serious incidents within the Group and actions taken 
by management as a result of such fatalities or serious incidents;
 Reviewing the results of any independent audits of the Group’s performance in regard to environmental, health, safety and community relations 
matters, reviewing any strategies and action plans developed by management in response to issues raised and, where appropriate making 
recommendations to the Board concerning the same;
 Making whatever recommendations it deems appropriate to the Board on any area within its remit where action or improvement is needed.
The Committee met on two occasions during 2012, on 17 April 2012 and 9 October 2012. The following sections summarise how the Committee 
has fulfilled its duties in 2012.
HSE performance assessment of the Group
The HSE committee reviewed HSE performance and EVRAZ HSE Policy implementation progress including the following metrics: 
Health & Safety performance:
 Fatal incidents 
 Fatal-Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR)
 Lost Time Injuries (LTI)
 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) calculated as number or lost working hours due to injuries per 1 million hours worked
 Fundamental safety requirements implementation
Environmental performance: 
 Non-compliance related environmental levies (taxes) and penalties
 Air Emissions (Nitrogen Oxides NOx, Sulphur Oxides SOx, Dust and Volatile Organic Compounds)
 Non-mining waste and by-products generation, recycling and re-use
 Fresh water intake and water management aspects
The Committee reviewed the status of 2011 – 2012 initiatives and discussed the roadmap for 2013 HSE goals and actions, including: 
 Drive a cultural change that involves moving the Group’s safety programme from just a compliance perspective to instilling safety as a core part 
of the steelmaking and mining processes. A culture where safety is recognized as a core value from the top levels of management down to the 
front line employees and contractors. 
 Improve personal responsibility and management accountability. 
 Facilitate improved reporting and investigation skills. The evaluation of the 2012 serious incidents has led to a focused effort to 
– improve working conditions; 
– implement a 100% Tie off programme for working at heights;
– separate pedestrian and vehicle traffic;
– improve tools and personal protective equipment. 
 All of these areas of focus also involve new and improved training for managers, employees and contractors. 
 Facilitate a more proactive approach with the utilisation of risk or hazard assessment into the daily activity of all employees. 
The Committee also considered environmental activities to minimise the risks of environmental incidents and issues such as water usage  
and quality of return discharged water, air emissions, metallurgical waste recycling, tailing dam overflow or collapse and community complaints. 
The key environmental initiatives are to be focused on the following in 2013: decrease of air emissions and fresh water consumption and 
increase of share of non-mining waste recycled or used.  EVRAZ plc

Corporate Governance Report (Continued)
Fatalities and serious accidents reports review 
In 2012 the Company recorded 25 fatal incidents which was a significant increase from the 13 experienced in 2011. The HSE Committee had 
reviewed the causes of fatalities and serious incidents within the Group and follow-up actions taken by the management. Additional details could 
be found in the Corporate Social Responsibility section on pages 54 to 56.
HSE audit results review 
EVRAZ operations are the subject of HSE compliance inspections undertaken by supervising state bodies. The consequential risks of HSE 
regulation violation are regulatory fines, penalties or in the extreme withdrawal of mining or plant environmental licences thus curtailing operations. 
The Committee approved the initiative to establish the Internal Industrial Audit Departments (IIAD) for the coal and mining assets and reviewed 
the summary of results of state bodies inspections vs. performance of IIAD. The Committee concluded that establishment of similar audit 
departments for the other assets seemed unnecessary at present due to the fact that their industrial risks level is lower and safety performance 
is better. 
The Committee recommended improvements to existing control systems by including the personalised data for each identified case of violation 
into the statistics.
Other issues and recommendations 
The Committee reviewed the results of the survey of the availability of skilled HSE personnel and HSE competency. The total percentage of 
employees aged over 51 years old involved with HSE services is 30%. The Committee recommended steps should be taken to attract younger 
people into the HSE structures and improve the competence of existing staff by providing more training and role exchanges to develop 
experience. In order to improve HSE responsibility at all levels (down to shop floor management) the Committee requested that additional 
measures should be developed by management and brought to the Committee for review. 
The Committee members reviewed HSE internal communication measures and assessed them as positive.
The Committee members discussed the approach for the Sustainability report production. It was agreed that report should reflect the details of 
fundamental social risks for business and related strategies to meet these risks.
In the course of 2012 the Committee approved the following corporate policies for:
 alcohol, drug and smoking;
 fundamental environmental requirements.
Risk management and internal control
Risk management framework
The Group’s business and operations are exposed to various business risks. While a number of these risks are operational or procedural  
in nature, several of these risks are inherent in the character and arise from the jurisdiction of the Group’s international business activities,  
and others relate to changes in the global economy and are largely outside management’s control. 
The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for maintaining our risk management and internal controls systems. The Board defines the 
Group’s risk appetite, being a measure of residue risk by impact and probability and is responsible for monitoring our risk exposures to ensure 
that the nature and extent of significant risks taken by the Company are aligned with our overall goals and strategic objectives. 
The Audit Committee supports the Board of Directors in monitoring our risk exposures and has been delegated responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems. The Internal Audit provides assurance to the Audit Committee as to the 
effectiveness of internal controls and risk management systems through its audit of these systems and follow-up on implementation of mitigation 
actions by management. The Executive Risk Committee assesses risk exposure and evaluates the adequacy of processes in place to mitigate 
these risks and their implementation by management at the Group and Regional levels. Detailed risk assessment and evaluation of risk issues  
at the site, plant, mine and operational level were instigated in 2012. Substantially operational risks are managed by the Group’s operational 
controls which are attested by Internal Audit; however, the Group is now instigating a parallel risk management process and culture at the 
operational level.
Risk management processes and internal controls operate across our steel plants, mines, ancillary service operations, capital projects and 
administrative functions. Risk management and internal control procedures are embedded within our business practices across function areas 
including finance, HSE, human resources, procurement, IT, legal, security and insurance management. There is detailed assessment of safety 
risks at all hazardous work places, steel plants and mines, and of project risks for all major projects which from 2012 include environmental risk 
assessments. The finance and strategic risks of major projects are prepared by the executive and presented to the Board for its consideration 
and key associated risks are kept under regular review by the Board. 
Regional risk committees have been set up at all major regions of the Group’s assets and lead the process to deploy the risk management at  
our major steel and mining operations. The Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is designed to identify, quantify, respond to and  
to monitor the consequences of a Risk Committee agreed executive risk register that encompasses both internal and external critical risks.  
This process is consistent with the listing rules published by the UK Financial Services Authority and is based on the Turnbull Guidance on 
Internal Control. 
The ERM process is fully supported by the Board, the Audit Committee and executive management. Senior management is tasked with the 
development of the ERM process, identifying key risk elements and, to further risk management accountability, executive management is 
assigned ownership of the relevant risk areas, according to their designated functions.  EVRAZ plc

Overview Strategy Operating Review
Corporate  
Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
Executive oversight of the Group risk profile is mandated to the Group’s Executive Risk Committee, under the chairmanship of the Audit 
Committee Chairman and including the Group’s CEO and Group’s Vice Presidents. The role and responsibility of the Executive Risk Committee is 
to keep under review risk identification and the evaluation of risks and to supervise the entire risk management process including response and 
mitigation procedures. Particular scrutiny is given to risks having an ‘inherent’ risk greater than the Group’s risk appetite and the mitigating 
actions to manage, where feasible, to a ‘residual’ risk evaluation directed below the Group’s risk appetite. 
The Group’s executive management is responsible for embedding the agreed Risk Management related internal controls and mitigating actions 
throughout the entirety of the Group’s business and operations and through all levels of management and supervisory personnel. Such practices 
serve to encourage a risk conscious business culture.
EVRAZ applies the following core principles to the identification, monitoring and management of risk throughout the organisation:
 Risks are identified, documented, assessed, monitored, tested and the risk profile communicated to the relevant risk management team on a 
regular basis; 
 Business management and the risk management team are primarily responsible for ERM and accountable for all risks assumed in their 
operations; 
 The Board is responsible for assessing the optimum balance of risk through the alignment of business strategy and risk tolerance on an 
enterprise-wide basis; and
 All acquired businesses are brought within the Group’s system of internal control as soon as practicable.

Risk management activity in 2012
In 2012, the Group established regional risk committees responsible for identifying and evaluating regional risks, instigating mitigating actions to 
manage these risks and nominating regional risk owners. Also in 2012 the Group’s Executive Risk Committee established the methodology and 
set out procedures to instigate site, product line, shop, project and functional level risk management with the same aims and objectives as 
engaged at the Group’s and Regional levels. The operational level will be particularly focused on Health and Safety, environmental management, 
human resources and security. Additionally in 2012, the Group has addressed the issues and risk exposures following on from the UK Bribery Act 
legislation. The Group has been active in the implementation of an anti-bribery and corruption programme. The implementation has presented 
various challenges primary of which has been developing the training materials prepared by UK lawyers in an on-line multi-lingual e-training facility. 
This facility has had to be custom developed, particularly there is no available Russian language off-the-shelf training material. Key Group and 
functional management have undergone training facilitated by UK lawyers and intermediate management is taking the e-training programme. 
Management who have successfully taken the in-person training and e-training are formally certified as to their understanding and compliance 
with the procedures and policies. 
In 2013, Internal Audit will audit all the Group’s UK Bribery Act and anti-corruption procedures and records to provide assurance over successful 
implementation. 
EVRAZ risk proﬁle
EVRAZ’s original risk assessment across all plants, mines and operations in 2008 detailed all key risks. A number of these risks exhibited a 
common nature, e.g. global economy and industry conditions. Following the original risk assessment the Executive Risk Committee consolidated 
the risk profile to 40 specific risks. On a risk evaluation review, Impact/Probability and following agreed risk mitigation actions, these risks were 
detailed into the Group’s risk register as to Inherent and Residual risk. From the 40 specific risks 17 risks were identified as high priority risks 
which were required to be monitored by the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee and regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors. Further, 
Internal Audit through its audit process reviews risk issues and reports critical risks to the Audit Committee and to the Executive Risk Committee. 
Where such reports suggest risks evaluation exceed the Group’s risk appetite, these risks are presented by the Audit Committee to the Board for 
its attention and if necessary executive action and further remediation Board reports. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Corporate Governance Report (Continued)
From the 17 high priority risks, 9 risks are considered the Group’s principal risks.
The principal risks of EVRAZ can be found on page 28 of the report.
Controls
EVRAZ’s system of internal control has been designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Consistent with its governance policies, the Group 
continues to improve the process through which the effectiveness of its system of internal control can be regularly reviewed as required by 
provision C.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The process enables the Board and the Audit Committee to review the effectiveness of 
the system of internal control in place within the Group to manage significant business, operational and financial risks (including, environmental, 
safety and ethical risks) throughout the year.
The processes of preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements are designed to prevent any material misstatements and present such 
Financial Statements fairly in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. The use of our standard accounting manual and reporting pack by 
our finance teams throughout the Group ensures that transactions are recognised and measured in accordance with prescribed accounting 
policies and that information is gathered and presented in a consistent way that facilitates the production of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
The Audit Committee has the primary oversight role of the Group’s internal control regime and has direction as to the internal audit function 
resources and the annual audit programme thereby ensuring that the Group’s ongoing internal control process is adequate and effective.

Internal audit
Internal audit is an independent appraisal function established by the Board to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls, systems and 
procedures, within EVRAZ, in order to reduce business risks to an acceptable level in a cost effective manner. 
The latest version of Internal Audit Charter of EVRAZ plc was approved by the Board on 13 December 2012.
The role of the Internal Audit Department in the Group is to provide an independent, objective, innovative, responsive and effective value-added 
internal audit service through a systematic and disciplined approach by assisting management in controlling risks, monitoring compliance, 
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of internal control systems and governance processes. 
In 2012, EVRAZ’s Head of Internal Audit attended all the meetings of the Audit Committee and addressed any reported deficiencies in internal 
control as required by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee continued to engage with executive management during the year to monitor the 
effectiveness of internal control and accordingly considered certain deficiencies that had been identified in internal control together with 
management’s response to such deficiencies. 
The internal audit planning process starts with the Group’s strategy and includes the formal risk assessment process, and the process  
of identification of management concerns based on the previous audits results, and ends with an internal audit plan which is approved by  
the Audit Committee. Audit resource is predominantly allocated to risky areas and to the extent considered necessary is allocated to the 
company/processes universe with appropriate reservation for the ad hoc and follow-up assignments.  EVRAZ plc

In 2012; Internal audit projects have covered the following principal group risks:
1. Financing of capital projects; 
2. Health, safety and environmental;
3. Business interruption; and
4. Treasury and taxation. 
The Company’s internal audit is structured on a regional basis, reflecting the developing geographic diversity of the Group’s operations. In light of 
this the head office internal audit function has been in process of aligning common internal audit practices throughout the Group through its 
quality assurance and improvement programmes. 
During 2012 the internal audit function worked in cooperation with Ernst & Young, EVRAZ’s external auditor, on an appraisal of the general 
competence, independence and professional objectivity of the Group’s internal audit resource. 
Further information regarding the Company’s internal control processes can be found on the Company’s website.
Conﬂicts of interest
Alexander Abramov is the Chairman of the Company and Alexander Frolov is the CEO. Ms. Pokrovskaya, Mr. Shvidler, Mr. Tenenbaum,  
Mr. Abramov and Mr. Frolov have been appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company by the major shareholder pursuant to the terms  
of the relationship agreement. The indirect and direct shareholdings of these Directors in the share capital of the Company are set out in the 
Directors’ Report. No other conflicts of interests exist between the private interests of the Directors or members of senior management and  
their duties to the Company.
For completeness, the Board did consider an arm’s length business arrangement between one of the Non-independent Directors and the son of 
Sir Michael Peat, the Senior Independent Director of the Company, and satisfied itself that this arrangement has no impact on Sir Michael Peat’s 
independence. 
In addition, the Board noted the nomination of Terry Robinson to the Board of OJSC Raspadskaya, a subsidiary of the Company, and was satisfied 
that this nomination had no impact on Mr. Robinson’s independence. 
Relations with shareholders
An ongoing dialogue with stakeholders is an essential aspect of corporate activity. We use various communication channels including 
announcements made via the London Stock Exchange, the Annual Report and Accounts, the Annual General Meeting (the AGM) and the

Summary Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman 
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for 2012. Despite the challenging market environment 
over the past 12 months, we made good progress on our major modernisation programme and reached a 
milestone agreement on the acquisition of the controlling interest in Raspadskaya. Furthermore, we ran 
our core Russian steelmaking operations at full economic capacity and demonstrated strong utilisation 
rates at North American operations. Our continued focus will be on achieving strong financial returns for 
our shareholders, and we consider that our remuneration policy will play a vital role in helping us to 
achieve this.
We believe that our remuneration policy remains appropriate, and as such we made no major changes in 2012. However, in line with corporate 
governance best practice, we have changed the membership of the Remuneration Committee and as a result it is now comprised entirely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors, allowing for completely independent oversight and judgement. 
The Committee is fully aware of its responsibilities in developing a balanced and structured remuneration policy, and takes into account the views 
of investors and their representatives when making decisions on executive remuneration.
The Chief Executive Officer participates in a bonus scheme, the KPIs of which are aligned with the creation of shareholder value. We have made 
some further changes with effect from 2013, the purpose of which is to align the bonus further with the Company’s strategic objectives and 
priorities for the year. 
At present, given our Chief Executive Officer’s substantial shareholding in the Company, it is considered appropriate that he does not participate 
in any long-term incentive plan, nor in fact in any pension or superannuation scheme. Members of senior management are eligible to participate 
in a long-term incentive plan in order to ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
We recognise that we are moving into new territory in remuneration reporting. As such, we are taking appropriate actions to ensure that we add 
additional value to what was disclosed in our Remuneration Report last year, and we have provided a Remuneration Report which reflects some 
of the proposed reporting requirements put forward by the UK Government’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (“BIS”). Although 
these are not due to come into effect until later this year, we are reflecting come of the proposed requirements as an early response to what is 
being asked of us. We are committed to providing clear and insightful disclosure for our shareholders, and we await the final BIS regulations due 
to be published later this year. 
The Committee will continue to keep abreast of market trends and external expectations to ensure that the overall remuneration policy remains 
appropriate, in the context of business performance and strategy.
Members of the Remuneration Committee
The EVRAZ plc Remuneration Committee was constituted and appointed by the Board on 14 October 2011, and the Committee comprised the 
following Non-Executive Directors during the 2012 year:
 Duncan Baxter (Committee Chairman);
 Alexander Abramov

1 Stood down on 19 November 2012

On 19 November 2012 the Board, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, decided that it was important to ensure that the 
membership of the Remuneration Committee was comprised of only independent Non-Executive Directors in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Consequently, Mr Abramov and Mr Tenenbaum stood down from the Committee.
Therefore, as of 10 April 2013 the Remuneration Committee consists of three members:
 Duncan Baxter (Committee Chairman);
 Karl Gruber;
 Alexander Izosimov.
No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee may invite other individuals to attend Committee meetings, in 
particular the Chief Executive Officer, the Head of Human Resources and external advisers for all or part of any Committee meeting as and when 
appropriate and necessary.

Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board and can operate with a quorum of two Committee members. It is operated 
according to its Terms of Reference, a copy of which can be found on the Company’s website.
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
 to determine and agree with the Board the framework or policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer, the Company Secretary and key senior management and recommend Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration;
 to take into account all factors which it deems necessary to determine such a framework or policy, including all relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements, the provisions and recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and associated guidance;
 to review and take into account the remuneration trends across the Group when setting remuneration policy for Directors;
 to review regularly the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy;
 to determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman of the Board, the Company Secretary and key senior management, 
including pension rights, bonuses, benefits in kind, incentive payments and share options or other share awards within the terms of the agreed 
policy and in consultation with the Committee Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer;
 to approve awards for participants where existing share incentive plans are in place;
 to review and approve any compensation payable to executive Directors and senior executives; and
 to oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Group. 
During 2012, the EVRAZ’s Remuneration Committee met four times. The purpose of the meetings was to consider and to make 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the remuneration packages of the Chairman, Non-executive Directors, the Executive Director  
and key senior managers, as well as to approve the 2012 LTIP awards and list of participants. 
Advisors
The Committee received advice during the year from independent remuneration consultants Deloitte LLP. Deloitte LLP was selected by the 
Committee to provide the Company remuneration consultancy services. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultant’s Group and,  
as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Sir Michael Peat is an independent non-executive on the Board of Deloitte LLP. Both the Chairman and the Remuneration Committee Chairman 
recognise the need to ensure that there is no conflict of interest arising from the appointment of Deloitte LLP as independent remuneration 
consultants. We are satisfied that the nature of Sir Michael’s role at Deloitte LLP does not give rise to such conflict and that there are appropriate 
internal controls and segregation of duties in place. Sir Michael did not play a part in the tender and selection process. 
Policy report
Details of the executive Director and Non-Executive Director remuneration policies are given in the following sections. The full text of the 
Remuneration Policy can be found on the Company’s website www.evraz.com.
Currently none of the Directors receive any fees paid in shares of the Company and they are not entitled to participate in the Group’s pension plan 
or long-term incentive schemes.

Mr. Alexander Frolov, as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is entitled to a base salary, a performance related bonus and provision of benefits.  
As a member of the Board of Directors he is also entitled to the Director’s fee (US$150,000) and any applicable fees for participation in the work 
of the Board committees as laid out in the section on Non-Executive Director remuneration. Alexander Frolov’s current shareholding (10.76% of 
issued share capital as of 10 April 2013) provides alignment to the delivery of long-term growth in shareholder value. As such, we do not consider 
it necessary for the CEO to participate in any long-term incentive plans, or to impose formal shareholding guidelines. However, the Remuneration 
Committee will review this on an ongoing basis.
The current balance between fixed and variable pay for the executive Director means that, on achievement of the set targets, 50% of 
remuneration is performance-related, rising to 66.7% for the achievement of maximum performance above the set targets.  EVRAZ plc

Remuneration Report (Continued)
The composition of executive Director’s remuneration is as follows:
Target remuneration comprises current base salary and on-target annual cash bonus. Maximum remuneration comprises current base salary and 
maximum annual cash bonus.
The pay and conditions of employees across the Group and market data have been taken into account when setting the CEO’s remuneration.
The CEO did not hold any external appointments during the year. 
Senior management remuneration
Senior managers are entitled to a base salary, a performance related bonus (KPIs aligned with Company’s strategy), participation in the long-term 
incentive programme (with a 3 year vesting period) and the provision of benefits. 
Non-Executive Director remuneration
The Company’s policy on Non-Executive Director remuneration is based on the following key principles: 
 Remuneration should be: 
 sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent;
 consistent with recognised best practice standards for Non-Executive Director remuneration;
 in the form of cash fees, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees (after deduction of applicable income tax and social security 
contributions) to acquire shares in the Company should the Non-Executive Director so wish;
 set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the Board and its committees;
 Non-Executive Directors may not participate in the Company’s share incentive schemes or pension arrangements.
A Non-Executive Director’s remuneration consists of an annual fee of US$150,000 and a fee for committee membership (US$24,000) or 
chairmanship (US$100,000 in respect of the Audit Committee chairmanship and US$50,000 for the chairmanship of other committees).  
As disclosed last year, the fee for the Chairman of the Board was increased at the Board meeting on 28 February 2012 and amounts to 
US$750,000 from 1 March 2012 (this fee includes, for the avoidance of doubt, the Director’s fees and the fees that are paid for committee 
membership). The fees payable for the chairmanship of a committee include the membership fee, and any Director elected chairman of more 
than one committee is only entitled to receive fees in respect of one chairmanship.
In addition the Company contributes an annual amount of US$30,000 towards secretarial and administrative expenses of Non-Executive 
Directors.
Implementation report
Executive Director’s remuneration
Base salary
As disclosed in last year’s report, from 1 March 2012, the CEO’s salary reverted to the salary that was originally approved by the Remuneration 
Committee on 23 May 2008, of US$2,500,000 (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, the Director’s fee, the fees that are paid for 
committees’ membership and any salary from an EVRAZ plc subsidiary). Due to the challenging economic environment at that time, the CEO 
voluntarily accepted a decrease in salary and deferred the approved increase in base salary to a later date. The CEO has waived the right to 
receive any catch-up payments forgone between 2008 and 2012. The Committee has not recommended a base salary increase for 2013.
Annual bonus outcome for 2012
The CEO is eligible to participate in a performance-related bonus which is subject to the agreement of the Remuneration Committee and approval 
by the Board of Directors. The bonus is linked to the achievement of performance conditions based on predetermined targets set by the Board of 
Directors. The target bonus is 100% of base salary with a maximum potential of up to 200% of base salary. 
The bonus is linked to corporate performance. Three indicators were taken into account when determining the CEO’s annual bonus for 2012: 
EBITDA (30% weighting), return on assets (40% weighting) and relative share price performance (30% weighting).
All targets were set at a very challenging level and during 2012 there were very tough market conditions, and as a result targets were not 
achieved (for example, relative share price performance was not achieved due to the high financial and operational leverage of the Company). 
Therefore, the CEO received no bonus. EVRAZ plc

weighting 20%) to ensure focus is spread across the key aspects of Company performance and strategy.

Principal activities
EVRAZ plc is a global vertically-integrated steel, mining and vanadium business with operations in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the Czech 
Republic, Italy, the USA, Canada and South Africa. The Company has a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and is included in the FTSE 
100 Index. Additional information on the Group’s operations during the year and the information that fulfils the requirements of the Business 
Review is provided in the Overview, Strategy, Operating Review, Corporate Social Responsibility, Financial Review and Governance sections of this 
document, which are deemed to form part of this report by reference. 
Sustainable development
The Corporate Social Responsibility section of this report focuses on the health and safety, environmental and employment performance of the 
Company’s operations, and outlines the Company’s core values and commitment to the principles of sustainable development and development 
of community relations programmes.
Going concern
The financial position and performance of the Group and its cash flows are set out in the Financial Review section of the report on pages 62  
to 67. 
The Directors have considered the Group’s debt maturity and cash flow projections and an analysis of projected debt covenants compliance for 
the period to the end of June 2014. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the Group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and has neither the intention nor the 
need to liquidate or materially curtail the scale of its operations.
For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. More details are provided in Note 1  
to the consolidated financial statements on page 107 including further information regarding certain risks related to projected debt covenant 
compliance.
Results and dividends
Financial results of the Group are presented in the Financial Review of this Annual Report on pages 62 to 67.
Under the dividend policy, EVRAZ is targeting a long-term average dividend pay-out ratio of at least 25% of the consolidated net profit calculated in 
accordance with IFRS and adjusted for non-recurring items. In addition to the regular dividend payments, the Company may also employ special 
dividends from time to time at the discretion of the EVRAZ Board to return surplus capital to shareholders.
In August 2012, EVRAZ’s Board declared an interim dividend of 11 cents per share (US$147 million in total) based on the results for the first half 
of 2012. The Board, having reviewed the results in respect of the financial year to 31 December 2012 and after taking into account the 
substantial deterioration in the respective prices of steel and steel raw materials towards the year-end, has decided to forgo the recommendation 
of a final dividend in respect of 2012 in order to preserve the financial standing of the Company and provide greater flexibility to manage the 
current market environment.
Fixed assets
The Group’s property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The last valuation of land was determined as at 31 March 2010 by an independent professionally qualified valuer. At that time, the market value 
of land was 1.7 times higher than its carrying value. At 31 December 2012, the carrying value of land amounted to US$181 million. In the opinion 
of the Directors, the total market value of land has not decreased significantly since the last valuation.  
It is not practicable to estimate the market value of buildings and mineral reserves as at 31 December 2012.
Overseas branches
EVRAZ does not have any branches. The Company does, however, have a controlling interest in Evraz Group S.A., which owns steel production, 
mining and trading companies, as well as in EVRAZ Greenfield development. Information about the direct and indirect subsidiaries of EVRAZ is

Future developments
Information on the Group and its subsidiaries’ future developments is provided in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement,

Mr. Abramov, who held a beneficial interest in 329,622,798 ordinary shares in EVRAZ plc (24.64%), (iii) Mr. Frolov, who held a beneficial interest in 164,811,399 ordinary 
shares in EVRAZ plc (12.32%) and (iv) Mr. Shvidler, who held a beneficial interest in 46,825,407 ordinary shares in EVRAZ plc (3.50%). The percentages in this paragraph 
exclude any treasury shares and any shares held by or on behalf of EVRAZ pursuant to any employee incentive plan. 
  From 31 December 2012 to 10 April 2013 (being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this document), there was a decrease in the underlying number of 
beneficial interests held by each of Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Abramov, Mr. Frolov and Mr. Shvidler.
In October 2012 EVRAZ agreed the terms of an acquisition of a further 50% interest in Corber Enterprises Limited, a 82% shareholder of OJSC 
Raspadskaya and its subsidiaries, from Mr. Gennady Kozovoy and Mr. Alexander Vagin. The acquisition was completed in January 2013 when 
132,653,006 new EVRAZ ordinary shares were issued in equal shares in favour of the sellers. The new shares were admitted to the Official List 
of the Financial Services Authority and began to be traded on the London Stock Exchange Main Market. 
Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, EVRAZ also issued to Messrs. Kozovoy and Vagin 33,944,928 new warrants to subscribe for 
33,944,928 new ordinary shares in EVRAZ. Cash consideration was also agreed to be paid to the sellers in the amount of approximately  
US$202 million, payable in four equal instalments in Q1, Q2, Q3 2013 and Q1 2014. 
In February 2013, following an agreement between EVRAZ’s major shareholder, Lanebrook, and Messrs. Kozovoy and Vagin, the latter two 
shareholders exchanged all their warrants for Lanebrook’s 33,121,022 EVRAZ shares. The 33,944,928 warrants, now held by Lanebrook,  
may be exercised at any time between 16 January 2014 and 16 April 2014. 
As a result the following ultimate beneficial owners had interests in EVRAZ plc share capital (in each case, except for Mr. Kozovoy, held indirectly) 
as of 10 April 2013 (being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this document):
 
Shareholder Number of ordinary Shares % of issued share capital
Mr. Roman Abramovich 456,310,736 30.99%
Mr. Alexander Abramov 317,300,488 21.55%
Mr. Alexander Frolov 158,442,915 10.76%
Mr. Gennady Kozovoy 83,751,827 5.69%
Mr. Alexander Vagin 82,887,014 5.63%
Mr. Eugene Shvidler 45,257,031 3.07% EVRAZ plc

Signiﬁcant contractual arrangements
The Major Shareholder and the Company have entered into a relationship agreement which regulates the ongoing relationship between them, 
ensures that the Company is capable of carrying on its business independently of the Major Shareholder and ensures that any transactions and 
relationships between the Company and the Major Shareholder are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms.
This agreement terminates if the Major Shareholder ceases to own or control (directly or indirectly) at least 30% of the Ordinary Shares in the 
Company or if the Major Shareholder ceases to have a larger interest in the Company than the interest of any other shareholder of the Company.
Under the relationship agreement, the Major Shareholder and the Company agree that: (a) the Major Shareholder has the right to appoint the 
maximum number of Non-Executive Directors that may be appointed whilst ensuring that the composition of the Board remains compliant with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code for so long as it holds an interest in 30% or more of the Company with each appointee being a ‘‘Shareholder 
Director’’; (b) the Major Shareholder shall, and shall procure, insofar as it is legally able to do so that each of its affiliates (excluding the Company 
and its subsidiary undertakings) (the ‘‘Major Shareholder Group’’) shall, save to the extent required by law, exercise its powers so far as it is able 
so that the Company is managed in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules; (c) transactions, relationships and agreements between the Company and/or its subsidiaries (on the one hand) and the 
Major Shareholder or a member of the Major Shareholder Group (on the other) shall be entered into and conducted on an arm’s length and 
normal commercial basis, unless otherwise agreed by a committee comprising the Non-Executive Directors of the Company whom the Board 
considers to be independent in accordance with paragraph B.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘‘Independent Committee’’); (d)  
the Major Shareholder shall not, and shall procure, insofar as it is legally able to do so, that each member of the Major Shareholder Group shall 
not, take any action which precludes or inhibits the Company and/or its subsidiaries from carrying on its business independently of the Major 
shareholder or any member of the Major Shareholder Group; (e) the quorum for any Board meeting of the Company shall be two, of which at  
least one must be a Director other than a Shareholder Director and/or a Director who is (or has, in the 12 months prior to the relevant date) any 
business or other relationship with the Major Shareholder or any member of the Major Shareholder Group which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of his or her independent judgement in matters concerning the Company (‘‘Lanebrook Director’’); (f) the Major Shareholder shall not, and 
shall procure, insofar as it is legally able to do so, that each member of the Major Shareholder Group shall not, subject to specified exceptions, 
take any action (or omit to take any action) to prejudice the Company’s status as a listed company or its suitability for listing or its ongoing 
compliance with the Listing Rules and Disclosure and Transparency Rules; (g) the Major Shareholder shall not, and shall procure, insofar as it is 
legally able to do so, that each member of the Major Shareholder Group shall not, exercise any of its voting or other rights and powers to procure 
any amendment to the Articles which would be inconsistent with, undermine or breach any of the provisions of the Relationship Agreement, and 
will abstain from voting on, and will procure that the Lanebrook Directors abstain from voting on, any resolution to approve a transaction with a 
related party (as defined in the Listing Rules) involving the Major Shareholder or any member of the Major Shareholder Group; (h) if any matter 
which, in the opinion of an independent Director, gives rise to a potential conflict of interest between the Company and/or its subsidiaries (on the 
one hand) and the Lanebrook Directors, the Major Shareholder or any member of the Major Shareholder Group (on the other), such matter must 
be approved at a duly convened meeting of the Independent Committee or in writing by a majority of the Independent Committee; and (i) for so 
long as the Major Shareholder holds an interest in 50% or more in the Company, the Major Shareholder undertakes that it will not and will use its 
reasonable endeavours to procure that no other member of the Controlling Shareholder Group becomes involved in any competing business 
(subject to certain exceptions) in Russia, the Ukraine or the CIS without giving the Company the opportunity to participate in the relevant 
competing business.
The Board is satisfied that the Company is capable of carrying on its business independently of the major shareholder and makes its decisions in 
a manner consistent with its duties to the Company and stakeholders of EVRAZ plc. 
8.875% notes due 2013 and 9.50% notes due 2018, issued by Evraz Group S.A., as well as a structured credit facility agreement for a 
syndicated loan of US$759 million contain change of control provisions. If a change of control occurs under the terms of these notes, note 
holders will have the option to require Evraz Group S.A. to redeem notes together with interest accrued, if any. Under the structured credit facility 
terms, in the event of a change of control over Evraz Group S.A., any lender will have the right to cancel its commitments and declare that 
amounts relating to that lender’s participation in the loan become immediately payable. At 31 December 2012, the principal amount of these 
borrowings amounted to US$1,802 million, accrued interest was US$21 million.
Supplier payment policy and practice
The Group does not have any specific published code, however the Group has developed standard payment periods in respect of trade accounts 
payable and monitors the timeliness of payments to its suppliers and contractors.
Trade creditors of the Group at 31 December 2012 were US$1,100 million.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements 
for each financial year. Under the law, the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the Group and parent company financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group and parent company for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements the Directors are required to:
 Present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group and parent company;
 Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS8:Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently;
 Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable;
 Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the European Union is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s and parent company’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
 State that the Group and parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, subject to any material departures discloses and explained in the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, with respect to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Director’s Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance Report 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the requirements of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of

Independent auditor’s report to the members of EVRAZ plc
We have audited the group financial statements of EVRAZ plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Operations, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related 
notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 97, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its loss for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 92, in relation to going concern; and
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of EVRAZ plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 
and on the information in the Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
year ended 31 December 2012
1. Corporate information
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of EVRAZ plc on 10 April 2013.
EVRAZ plc (“EVRAZ plc” or “the Company”) was incorporated on 23 September 2011 as a public company under the laws of the United Kingdom 
with the registered number 7784342. The Company’s registered office is at 5th Floor, 6 St. Andrew Street, London, EC4A 3AE, United Kingdom.
As a result of the reorganisation implemented by way of the share exchange offer made by the Company for the shares of Evraz Group S.A. in 
November 2011 (Note 20), the Company became a new parent entity of Evraz Group S.A. (Luxembourg), a holding company which owns steel 
production, mining and trading companies.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries (the “Group”), is involved in the production and distribution of steel and related products and coal 
and iron ore mining. In addition, the Group produces vanadium products. The Group is one of the largest steel producers globally. Lanebrook 
Limited (Cyprus) is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.
The major subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group were as follows at 31 December:

Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Group’s activities in all of its operating segments continue to be affected by the uncertainty and instability of the current economic 
environment. According to management’s current forecasts, at 30 June 2013 the Group may not be in compliance with financial covenants under 
certain bank loans, which, if not resolved, may trigger a cross default under other debt instruments. Such an event would permit the Group’s 
lenders to demand immediate payment of the outstanding borrowings under the relevant debt instruments.
Directors and management have considered a number of alternatives to proactively address this situation, including, if and when necessary, 
a refinancing of certain borrowings, a financial covenant reset and a waiver from its lenders. The Group may incur additional costs related to 
these alternatives.
Based on the analysis of available alternatives, management’s track record of resolving similar matters and the probabilities of their successful 
implementation, Directors and management concluded that there is no material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. Consequently, Directors and management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IASB”). IFRSs that are mandatory 
for application as of 31 December 2012, but not adopted by the European Union, do not have any impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no material 
uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the entity can continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future. EVRAZ plc

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of Preparation (Continued)
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies 
below. Exceptions include, but are not limited to, property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS accounted for at deemed cost, 
available-for-sale investments measured at fair value, assets classified as held for sale measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair 
value less costs to sell and post-employment benefits measured at present value.
Group reorganisation in 2011
As the Group has been formed through a reorganisation in which EVRAZ plc became a new parent entity of the Group (Note 20), these 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a continuation of the existing group using the pooling of interests method.
Changes in accounting policies
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of computation  
as compared with those applied in the previous year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations and revision of the existing 
standards as of 1 January 2012.
New/Revised standards and interpretations adopted in 2012
 IFRS 7 – Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets (Amendment)
The amendment to IFRS 7 enhances disclosures for financial assets. These disclosures relate to assets transferred (as defined under 
IAS 39). If the assets transferred are not derecognised entirely in the financial statements, an entity has to disclose information that  
enables users of financial statements to understand the relationship between those assets which are not derecognised and their associated 
liabilities. If those assets are derecognised entirely, but the entity retains a continuing involvement, disclosures have to be provided that 
enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity’s continuing involvement in those 
derecognised assets. The amendment had no effect on the Group’s financial statements.
 IAS 12 Income Taxes (Amendment) – Deferred Taxes: Recovery of Underlying Assets
The amendment clarified the determination of deferred tax on investment property measured at fair value and introduces a rebuttable 
presumption that deferred tax on investment property measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 should be determined on the basis  
that its carrying amount will be recovered through sale. It includes the requirement that deferred tax on non-depreciable assets that are 
measured using the revaluation model in IAS 16 should always be measured on a sale basis. The amendment had no effect on the Group’s 
financial position, performance or its disclosures.

 Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014
 IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 1 January 2015
The Group expects that the adoption of the pronouncements listed above will not have a significant impact on the Group’s results of operations 
and financial position in the period of initial application.
Amended IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” introduced recognition of actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income in the period they 
occur. This amendment is required to be applied retrospectively. At 31 December 2012 and 2011, the Group had $332 million and $261 million 
actuarial losses, respectively (Note 23), they will increase the Group’s liabilities under defined benefit plans.
Signiﬁcant accounting judgements and estimates
Accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving 
estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
 The Group determined that it obtained control over Corber on 16 January 2013 (Note 11). As of 31 December 2012, certain conditions  
relating to acquisition of an additional 50% ownership interest in Corber were not met. As such, the Group did not consolidate Corber in 2012.
 The Group determined that the future sale of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel does not constitute a 
discontinued operation as the expected disposal will not lead to the Group abandoning any geographical area of operation or any product line 
(Note 12). EVRAZ plc

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Signiﬁcant accounting judgements and estimates (continued)
Estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group 
makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the assets. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $404 million, $105 million and $109 million, 
respectively (Note 9).
The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment involves the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, 
timing and amount of the impairment. Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, 
expectations of growth in the industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, 
discontinuance of service, current replacement costs and other changes in circumstances that indicate that impairment exists.
The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management. Methods used to 
determine the value in use include discounted cash flow-based methods, which require the Group to make an estimate of the expected 
future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. These estimates, including the methodologies used, may have a material impact on the value in use and, ultimately, the amount 
of any impairment.
Useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment
The Group assesses the remaining useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment at least at each financial year end and, if expectations 
differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 “Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”. These estimates may have a material impact on the amount of the carrying values of 
property, plant and equipment and on depreciation expense for the period.
In 2012 and 2010, the change in estimates of useful lives of property, plant and equipment resulted in an additional depreciation expense of 
approximately $5 million and $10 million, respectively. In 2011, the Group changed its estimation of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, 
which resulted in a $16 million decrease in depreciation expense as compared to the amounts that would have been charged had no change in 
estimate occurred.
Fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations
The Group is required to recognise separately, at the acquisition date, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or 
assumed in a business combination at their fair values, which involves estimates. Such estimates are based on valuation techniques which 
require considerable judgement in forecasting future cash flows and developing other assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $2,180 million, $2,180 million and $2,219 million, respectively.  
In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Group recognised an impairment loss in respect of goodwill in the amount of $Nil, $Nil and $16 million, respectively.  
More details of the assumptions used in estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are provided in Note 5.
Mineral reserves
Mineral reserves are a material factor in the Group’s computation of a depletion charge. The Group estimates its mineral reserves in accordance 
with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (“JORC Code”). Estimation of reserves in 
accordance with the JORC Code involves some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and 
engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data, which also requires use of subjective judgement and 
development of assumptions.
Site restoration provisions
The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each reporting date and adjusts them to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with 
IFRIC 1 “Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities”.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting 
period based on the requirements of the current legislation of the country where the respective operating assets are located. The carrying amount 
of a provision is the present value of the expected expenditures, i.e. cash outflows discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. EVRAZ plc

Signiﬁcant accounting judgements and estimates (continued)
Estimation uncertainty (continued)
Site restoration provisions (continued)
The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a 
provision. Considerable judgement is required in forecasting future site restoration costs.
Future events that may affect the amount required to settle an obligation are reflected in the amount of a provision when there is sufficient 
objective evidence that they will occur.
Post-Employment beneﬁts
The Group uses an actuarial valuation method for the measurement of the present value of post-employment benefit obligations and related 
current service cost. This involves the use of demographic assumptions about the future characteristics of the current and former employees who 
are eligible for benefits (mortality, both during and after employment, rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement, etc.) as well as 
financial assumptions (discount rate, future salary and benefit levels, expected rate of return on plan assets, etc.).
Allowances
The Group makes allowances for doubtful receivables to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required 
payments. When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the current overall 
economic conditions, the ageing of accounts receivable balances, historical write-off experience, customer creditworthiness and changes in 
payment terms. Changes in the economy, industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful 
accounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As of 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010, allowances for doubtful accounts in 
respect of trade and other receivables have been made in the amount of $101 million, $108 million and $117 million, respectively (Note 29).
The Group makes an allowance for obsolete and slow-moving raw materials and spare parts. In addition, certain finished goods of the Group are 
carried at net realisable value (Note 14). Estimates of net realisable value of finished goods are based on the most reliable evidence available at 
the time the estimates are made. These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring 
subsequent to the end of the reporting period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.
Litigations
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposure to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or 
other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities. 
Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the 
final settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated 
provision. These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists or with the 
support of outside consultants. Revisions to the estimates may significantly affect future operating results. More details are provided in Note 31.
Current taxes
Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes occur frequently. Further, the interpretation 
of tax legislation by tax authorities as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group’s entities may not coincide with that of management. As a 
result, tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group’s entities may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and interest, which can be 
significant. In Russia and Ukraine the periods remain open to review by the tax and customs authorities with respect to tax liabilities for three calendar 
years preceding the year of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. More details are provided in Note 31.
Deferred income tax assets
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that probability includes judgements based on 
the expected performance. Various factors are considered to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including 
past operating results, operational plans, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from 
these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be 
negatively affected. In the event that the assessment of future utilisation of deferred tax assets must be reduced, this reduction will be 
recognised in the statement of operations.
Foreign currency transactions
The presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar because presentation in US dollars is convenient for the major current and potential users 
of the consolidated financial statements.
The functional currencies of the Group’s subsidiaries are the Russian rouble, US dollar, euro, Czech koruna, South African rand, Canadian dollar 
and Ukrainian hryvnia. As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar 
are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period, and their statements of operations 
are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on 
the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. On disposal of a subsidiary with functional currency other than the US dollar, 
the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular subsidiary is recognised in the statement of operations.
Transactions in foreign currencies in each subsidiary of the Group are initially recorded in the functional currency at the rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the 
fair value was determined. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of 
exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. All resulting differences are taken to the statement of operations.

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currency transactions (continued)
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than 50% of the voting rights, or otherwise has power to 
exercise control over their operations, are consolidated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group 
and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, accounting policies for 
subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non-controlling interests are presented in 
the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the parent’s shareholders’ equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance.
Acquisition of subsidiaries
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or 
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is 
finally settled within equity.
The initial accounting for a business combination involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the cost of the combination. If the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined 
only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the Group accounts for 
the combination using those provisional values. The Group recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the 
initial accounting within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Comparative information presented for the periods before the completion of initial accounting for the acquisition is presented as if the initial 
accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.
Increases in ownership interests in subsidiaries
The differences between the carrying values of net assets attributable to interests in subsidiaries acquired and the consideration given for 
such increases is either added to additional paid-in capital, if positive, or charged to accumulated profits, if negative, in the consolidated 
financial statements.
Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control
Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests method.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary transferred under common control are recorded in these financial statements at the historical cost of 
the controlling entity (the “Predecessor”). Related goodwill inherent in the Predecessor’s original acquisition is also recorded in the financial 
statements. Any difference between the total book value of net assets, including the Predecessor’s goodwill, and the consideration paid is 
accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as an adjustment to the shareholders’ equity.
These financial statements, including corresponding figures, are presented as if a subsidiary had been acquired by the Group on the date it was 
originally acquired by the Predecessor.
Put options over non-controlling interests
The Group derecognises non-controlling interests if non-controlling shareholders have a put option over their holdings. The difference between the 
amount of the liability recognised in the statement of financial position over the carrying value of the derecognised non-controlling interests is 
charged to accumulated profits. EVRAZ plc

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Investments in Associates
Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant 
influence, but which it does not control or jointly control.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost including goodwill. 
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate and goodwill 
impairment charges, if any.
The Group’s share of its associates’ profits or losses is recognised in the statement of operations and its share of movements in reserves is 
recognised in equity. However, when the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does 
not recognise further losses, unless the Group has legal or constructive obligations to make payments to, or on behalf of, the associate. If the 
associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the 
share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates; 
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Interests in joint ventures
The Group’s interest in its joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in jointly controlled entities is 
initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint ventures. The statement 
of operations reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of joint ventures.
Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of plant and equipment when that cost is 
incurred and recognition criteria are met.
The Group’s property, plant and equipment include mining assets, which consist of mineral reserves, mine development and construction costs 
and capitalised site restoration costs. Mineral reserves represent tangible assets acquired in business combinations. Mine development and 
construction costs represent expenditures incurred in developing access to mineral reserves and preparations for commercial production, 
including sinking shafts and underground drifts, roads, infrastructure, buildings, machinery and equipment.
At each end of the reporting period management makes an assessment to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of property, 
plant and equipment. If any such indication exists, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less cost to sell and its value in use. The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount, and the difference is recognised as impairment 
loss in the statement of operations or other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for an asset in previous years is reversed if 
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, except for mining assets, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment and methods of their depreciation are reviewed, 
and adjusted as appropriate, at each fiscal year end. The table below presents the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.

Buildings and constructions 15–60 19
Machinery and equipment 4–45 11
Transport and motor vehicles 7–20 10
Other assets 3–15 6
The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depletion of mining assets including capitalised site restoration costs is calculated using the units-of-production method based upon proved and 
probable mineral reserves.
Maintenance costs relating to items of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are 
capitalised, and the replaced assets are derecognised.
The Group has the title to certain non-production and social assets, primarily buildings and facilities of social infrastructure, which are carried at 
their recoverable amount of zero. The costs to maintain such assets are expensed as incurred.

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Exploration and evaluation expenditures
Exploration and evaluation expenditures represent costs incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral 
resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. The expenditures include 
acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, activities 
in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting mineral resources. These costs are expensed as incurred.
When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, the Group commences recognition of 
expenditures related to the development of mineral resources as assets. These assets are assessed for impairment when facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date as 
to whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to 
use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised 
from the commencement of the lease term at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to interest expense.
The depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets is consistent with that for depreciable assets which are owned. If there is no reasonable 
certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its 
useful life.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating 
lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred for an acquisition of a subsidiary or an associte and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair 
value of the net assets of the acquiree, the difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.
Goodwill on acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included in the carrying amount 
of the investments in associates.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or 
more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, or the group of cash-generating units, to which the 
goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill 
disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-
generating unit retained.
Intangible assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Expenditures on internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development 
costs, are expensed as incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period 
and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite life are reviewed at least at each year end. Changes in the expected useful life or 
the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, they are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the 
cash-generating unit level. EVRAZ plc

Certain water rights and environmental permits are considered to have indefinite lives as management believes that these rights will 
continue indefinitely.
The most part of the Group’s intangible assets represents customer relationships arising on business combinations (Note 10).
Emission rights
One of the Group’s subsidiaries participates in the programme for emission reduction established by the Kyoto protocol. Emission rights 
(allowances) for each compliance period (one year) are issued at the beginning of the year, actual emissions are verified after the end of the year.
Allowances, whether issued by government or purchased, are accounted for as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”. 
Allowances that are issued for less than fair value are measured initially at their fair value.
When allowances are issued for less than fair value, the difference between the amount paid and fair value is recognised as a government grant. 
Initially the grant is recognised as deferred income in the statement of financial position and subsequently recognised as income on a systematic 
basis over the compliance period for which the allowances were issued, regardless of whether the allowances are held or sold.
As emissions are made, a liability is recognised for the obligation to deliver allowances equal to emissions that have been made. This liability is a 
provision that is within the scope of IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” and it is measured at the best estimate of 
the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period being the present market price of the number of 
allowances required to cover emissions made up to the end of the reporting period.
Financial assets
The Group classified its investments into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity, and available-for-sale. When investments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments 
not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its investments after 
initial recognition.
Investments that are acquired principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price are classified as held for 
trading and included in the category “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss”. Investments which are included in this category are 
subsequently carried at fair value; gains or losses on such investments are recognised in income.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such 
assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that management has the positive intent and ability to  
hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
Investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, 
are classified as available-for-sale; these are included in non-current assets unless management has the express intention of holding the 
investment for less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period or unless they will need to be sold to raise operating capital, in which 
case they are included in current assets. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase 
and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate 
component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the statement of operations. Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity 
instruments are not recognised in the statement of operations. Impairment losses in respect of debt instruments are reversed through  
profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised in the statement of operations.

Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets (continued)
For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid 
prices at the close of business on the end of the reporting period. For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using 
valuation techniques. Such techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another 
instrument, which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other generally accepted valuation techniques.
All purchases and sales of financial assets under contracts to purchase or sell financial assets that require delivery of the asset within the time 
frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are recognised on the settlement date i.e. the date the asset is 
delivered by/to the counterparty.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable, which generally are short-term, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any 
uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written  
off when identified.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable that represents its estimate of incurred losses. The main components 
of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for 
groups of similar receivables in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined 
based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory is determined on the weighted average basis and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring or producing inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. The cost of finished goods 
and work in progress includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
Value added tax
The tax authorities permit the settlement of sales and purchases value added tax (“VAT”) on a net basis.
The Group’s subsidiaries apply the accrual method for VAT recognition, under which VAT becomes payable upon invoicing and delivery of goods or 
rendering services as well upon receipt of prepayments from customers. VAT on purchases, even if not settled at the end of the reporting period, 
is deducted from the amount of VAT payable.
Where provision has been made for impairment of receivables, an impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debtor, including VAT.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method; any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is 
recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
Borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets are capitalised (Note 9).
Financial guarantee liabilities
Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it 
incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation  
at the end of the reporting period and the amount initially recognised.
Equity
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction in equity 
from the proceeds. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional 
paid-in capital.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are acquired by the Group (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in statement of 
operations on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Equity (continued)
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity only if they are declared before or the end of the reporting period. Dividends are 
disclosed when they are proposed before the end of the reporting period or proposed or declared after the end of the reporting period but before 
the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as 
a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Provisions for site restoration costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Employee beneﬁts
Social and pension contributions
Defined contributions are made by the Group to the Russian and Ukrainian state pension, social insurance, medical insurance and unemployment 
funds at the statutory rates in force (approximately 34%), based on gross salary payments. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to 
pay further contributions in respect of those benefits. Its only obligation is to pay contributions as they fall due. These contributions are expensed 
as incurred.
Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Group companies provide pensions and other benefits to their employees (Note 23). The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional 
on the completion of a minimum service period. Certain benefit plans require the employee to remain in service up to retirement age. Other 
employee benefits consist of various compensations and non-monetary benefits. The amounts of benefits are stipulated in the collective 
bargaining agreements and/or in the plan documents.
The Group involves independent qualified actuaries in the measurement of employee benefit obligations.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of post-employment benefits is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised 
actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit  
method. The present value of the benefits is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of  
high-quality government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related obligations.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense when the cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains or losses for each individual 
plan exceed 10% of the higher of defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The excess of cumulative actuarial gains or losses 
over the 10% of the higher of defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recognised over the expected average remaining 
working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
The past service cost is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the 
benefits are already vested immediately following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, past service cost is recognised immediately. 
The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less past service cost not yet recognised and 
less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
The Group includes expected return on plan assets in the interest expense caption of the consolidated statement of operations.
Other costs
The Group incurs employee costs related to the provision of benefits such as health services, kindergartens and other services. These amounts 
principally represent an implicit cost of employment and, accordingly, have been charged to cost of sales.
Share-based payments
The Group has management compensation schemes (Note 24), under which certain senior executives and employees of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-
settled transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with grantees is measured by reference to the fair value of the Company’s shares at the date on which 
they are granted. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken 
of any conditions, other than market conditions.

Share-based payments (continued)
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity (additional paid-in capital), over the period 
in which service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant persons become fully entitled to the award (“the vesting date”). 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the

statement of operations for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. Once a share-settled transaction is vested, no further accounting entries are 
made to reverse the cost already charged, even if the instruments that are the subject of the transaction are subsequently forfeited. In this case, 
the Group makes a transfer between different components of equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.  
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement,  
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised 
for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement 
award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as 
described in the previous paragraph.
Cash-settled share-based payments represent transactions in which the Group acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash 
or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price (or value) of the Group’s shares or other equity 
instruments.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. This fair value is 
expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of operations.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share (Note 20).
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
When goods are sold or services are rendered in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred. When the fair value of the goods or services 
received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any 
cash or cash equivalents transferred.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably. The moment of transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership is determined by the contract terms.
Rendering of services
The Group’s revenues from rendering of services include electricity, transportation, port and other services. Revenue is recognised when services 
are rendered.
Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.
Dividends
Revenue is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
Rental income
Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the 
statement of operations. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
120 
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred income tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred income taxes are 
provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting 
purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that  
is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
3. Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services, and has four reportable 
operating segments:
 Steel production segment includes production of steel and related products at eleven steel mills.
 Mining segment includes iron ore and coal mining and enrichment.
 Vanadium products segment includes extraction of vanadium ore and production of vanadium products. Vanadium slag arising in the 
steel-making process is also allocated to the vanadium segment.
 Other operations include energy-generating companies, seaports, shipping and railway transportation companies.
Management and investment companies are not allocated to any of the segments.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Management monitors the results of the operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and 
performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA. This performance indicator is calculated based on management 
accounts that differ from the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the following reasons:
1)  for the last month of the reporting period, the statement of operations for each operating segment is prepared using a forecast for that month;
2)  the statement of operations is based on local GAAP figures with the exception of depreciation expense which approximates the amount 
under IFRS.
Segment revenue is revenue reported in the Group’s statement of operations that is directly attributable to a segment and the relevant portion of 
the Group’s revenue that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to a segment, whether from sales to external customers or from transactions 
with other segments.
Segment expense is expense resulting from the operating activities of a segment that is directly attributable to the segment and the relevant 
portion of an expense that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the segment, including expenses relating to external counterparties and 
expenses relating to transactions with other segments.
Segment result is segment revenue less segment expense that is equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”).
Segment EBITDA is determined as a segment’s profit/(loss) from operations adjusted for impairment of assets, profit/(loss) on disposal of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, foreign exchange gains/(losses) and depreciation, depletion and amortisation expense.
The following tables present measures of segment profit or loss based on management accounts.

Acquisitions of controlling interests
Inprom group
On 22 December 2010, the Group acquired 100% in a holding entity owning steel dealers throughout Russia (known as Inprom Group).  
The purchase consideration consisted of cash amounting to $19 million plus the fair value of a deferred consideration of $21 million.
The financial position and the results of operations of Inprom were included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements beginning 
22 December 2010.
The table below sets forth the fair values of consolidated identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree at the date of 
business combination:

Net cash outﬂow $(10)
In 2011, the Group made a final payment of $1 million for the acquisition of Inprom Group.
For the period from 22 December to 31 December 2010, Inprom Group reported net loss amounting to $1 million.
Acquisition of other controlling interests
On 1 January 2012, the Group obtained control over the operating activities of Kachkanar Heat and Power Plant (Russia), for which the Group paid 
$20 million in 2011. This payment was included in other non-current assets as of 31 December 2011 (Note 13). Goodwill arising on this 
business combination amounted to $3 million.
In 2012, the Group paid $12 million for the scrap yards located in the USA. Goodwill arising on this acquisition amounted to $1 million. EVRAZ plc

4. Acquisition of subsidiaries (continued)
Acquisitions of Controlling Interests (continued)
Disclosure of other information in respect of business combinations
As the acquired subsidiaries either did not prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS before the business combinations or applied 
accounting policies that are significantly different from the Group’s accounting policies, it is impracticable to determine revenues and net profit  
of the combined entity for each year presented on the assumption that all business combinations effected during each year had occurred at the 
beginning of the respective year.
Other payments for acquisition of subsidiaries
In 2011, the Group purchased a 100% ownership interest in an entity whose assets comprise only land to be used for construction of a rolling 
mill in Russia. The cash consideration amounted to $11 million. This purchase did not qualify for a business combination, as the acquired 
company does not constitute a business.
In 2010, the Group fully settled a $16 million liability under earn-out payments for the acquisition of Stratcor in 2006. In 2011, the Group paid 
$3 million of synergy payments related to the same acquisition (Note 26).
EVRAZ Group S.A.
On 17 February 2012, the Group purchased the remaining global depository receipts, representing 96,607.67 shares of Evraz Group S.A., for 
$4 million and exchanged them for the newly issued shares of EVRAZ plc. Since that date Evraz Group S.A. became a wholly-owned subsidiary  
of EVRAZ plc and a non-controlling interest amounting to $10 million was derecognised.
Mezhegey project
In June 2012, the Group acquired an additional 9.996% ownership interest in Actionfield Limited, which holds and operates the Mezhegey coal 
field project (Note 20). As a result, the Group increased its share in the project to approximately 60.016%.
The fair value of the consideration amounted to $36 million. It was agreed to settle the liabilities for the purchase by an offset with a loan 
receivable by the Group. The excess of the consideration over the carrying value of the acquired non-controlling interest amounting to $30 million 
was charged to accumulated profits.
Evraztrans
In 2011, the Group acquired an additional non-controlling interest of 24% in Evraztrans (Note 12), a subsidiary, which renders railway 
transportation services. The cash consideration amounted to $51 million. The excess of the amounts of consideration over the carrying  
values of non-controlling interests acquired amounting to $18 million was charged to accumulated profits.
Stratcor
In 2010, the Group acquired an additional non-controlling interest of 5.92% in Strategic Minerals Corporation (“Stratcor”) for a cash consideration 
of $8 million paid in 2009. The excess of the amount of consideration paid over the carrying value of acquired non-controlling interest amounting 
to $3 million was charged to accumulated profits.
LDPP
In 2010, the Group acquired an additional non-controlling interest of 25% in OAO Large Diameter Pipe Plant (“LDPP”) for a cash consideration of 
$8 million. The excess of the carrying value of acquired non-controlling interest over the amount of consideration paid amounting to $1 million 
was recorded in additional paid-in capital.

For the purpose of the impairment testing as of 31 December 2012 the Group assessed the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit 
(“CGU”) to which the goodwill was allocated or where indicators of impairment were identified.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on the actual operating 
results and business plans approved by management and appropriate discount rates reflecting time value of money and risks associated with 
respective cash-generating units. For the periods not covered by management business plans, cash flow projections have been estimated by 
extrapolating the respective business plans results using a zero real growth rate.
The key assumptions used by management in the value-in-use calculations with respect to the cash-generating units to which the goodwill was 
allocated are presented in the table below.

The major drivers that led to impairment were the changes in expectations of long-term prices for iron ore and steel products and the increase in 
the forecasted costs.
The calculations of value in use are most sensitive to the following assumptions:
Discount rates
Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit. The discount rates have been determined 
using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and analysis of industry peers. Reasonably possible changes in discount rates could lead to an additional 
impairment at EVRAZ United West-Siberian Iron & Steel Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, EVRAZ Sukha Balka, EVRAZ Palini e 
Bertoli and EVRAZ Inc. NA cash-generating units. If discount rates were 10% higher, this would lead to an additional impairment of $284 million.
Sales prices
The prices of the products sold by the Group were estimated using industry research. The Group expects that the nominal prices will grow with a 
compound annual growth rate of 0%-6.5% in 2013 – 2017, 3.0% in 2018 and thereafter. Reasonably possible changes in sales prices could lead 
to an additional impairment at EVRAZ United West-Siberian Iron & Steel Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, EVRAZ Sukha Balka 
and EVRAZ Inc. NA cash-generating units. If the prices assumed for 2013 and 2014 in the impairment test were 10% lower, this would lead to an 
additional impairment of $411 million.
Sales volumes
Management assumed that the sales volumes of steel products would increase by 7% in 2013 and would grow evenly during the following four 
years to reach normal asset capacity utilisation thereafter. Reasonably possible changes in sales volumes could lead to an additional impairment 
at EVRAZ United West-Siberian Iron & Steel Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, and EVRAZ Sukha Balka cash-generating units. If 
the sales volumes were 10% lower than those assumed for 2013 and 2014 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of 
$119 million.
Cost control measures
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the business plans approved by management. A reasonably possible deviation of 
cost from these plans could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ United West-Siberian Iron & Steel Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and 
Steel Works, EVRAZ Bagleykoks, EVRAZ Sukha Balka, EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli and EVRAZ Inc. NA cash-generating units. If the actual costs were 
10% higher than those assumed for 2013 and 2014 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $1,048 million. EVRAZ plc

In addition to the impairment losses recognised as a result of the impairment testing at the level of cash-generating units, the Group made a 
write-off of certain functionally obsolete items of property, plant and equipment and recorded an impairment relating to the VAT with a 
long-term recovery.

In 2010, a new Tax Code was adopted in Ukraine, which introduced a gradual reduction in income tax rates from 25% in 2010 to 16% in 2014. In 
addition, in accordance with the new Tax Code the carrying values of property, plant and equipment per statutory books as of 1 April 2011 
became a new tax base of these assets for income tax calculations. The Group’s subsidiaries in Ukraine measured the respective deferred tax 
assets and liabilities at 31 December 2010 based on the new tax bases using the announced tax rates and a forecast of temporary differences 
reversal and realisation.

As of 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010, deferred income taxes in respect of undistributed earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries have not been 
provided for, as management does not intend to distribute accumulated earnings in the foreseeable future. The current tax rate on intra-group 
dividend income varies from 0% to 10%. At 31 December 2012, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset in 
respect of temporary differences of $4,985 million and $8,975 million, respectively (2011: $5,686 million and $3,478 million, 2010: $5,764 
million and $2,831 million, respectively). These differences are associated with investments in subsidiaries and were not recognised as the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of those temporary differences and does not intend to reverse them in the foreseeable future.
In the context of the Group’s current structure, tax losses and current tax assets of the different companies may not be set off against current tax 
liabilities and taxable profits of other companies, except for the companies registered in Cyprus and the United Kingdom where group relief can be 
applied. As of 31 December 2012, the unused tax losses carry forward approximated $3,398 million (2011: $3,481 million, 2010: $3,365 million). 
The Group recognised deferred tax asset of $101 million (2011: $151 million, 2010: $150 million) in respect of unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
asset in the amount of $728 million (2011: $694 million, 2010: $655 million) has not been recorded as it is not probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available in the foreseeable future to offset these losses. Tax losses of $2,603 million (2011: $2,568 million, 2010: $2,555 million) 
for which deferred tax asset was not recognised arose in companies registered in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Russia and Ukraine. Losses in the amount 
of $2,414 million (2011: $2,479 million, 2010: $2,535 million) are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in 
which the losses arose and $189 million will expire during 2013–2022 (2011: $89 million, 2010: $20 million).

On 1 April 2012, the Group updated its mining plans relating mostly to the extraction of coking coal reserves. Consequently, the depreciation 
and depletion charge in 2012 is lower by $276 million compared to the amount that would have been charged in accordance with the 
previous mining plans.

a result of the testing at the level of cash-generating units (Note 6).
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2012 was $16 million (2011: $13 million, 2010: $5 million).  
In 2012, the rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 4.8% (2011: 4.6%, 2010: 6.3%), which is the 
effective interest rate of borrowings that were outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining 
qualifying assets.

Return of capital
In September 2012, the Board of Directors of Corber decided to reduce its additional paid-in capital by $76 million by the return of funds to its 
shareholders. The Group received $38 million in cash.
Acquisition of a controlling interest in Corber
In October 2012, EVRAZ plc concluded a preliminary agreement with Adrolive Investments Limited for an acquisition of a 50% ownership interest 
in Corber subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfillment of certain other conditions. On 16 January 2013, all the conditions were 
met and the Group obtained control over the entity. As a result, Corber became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group in 2013.
Management believes that this acquisition will increase the Group’s coking coal self-coverage and generate substantial operational synergies to 
the Group, including the optimal use of various coal grades.
The purchase consideration includes 132,653,006 shares of EVRAZ plc issued on 16 January 2013, warrants to subscribe for additional 
33,944,928 EVRAZ plc shares exercisable at zero price in the period from 17 January to 17 April 2014 and a cash consideration of $202 million 
to be paid in equal quarterly installments through 15 January 2014. Fair value of the consideration transferred totalled to $964 million and was 
determined by reference to the market value of EVRAZ plc shares at the date of acquisition.
The fair value of the equity interest in the acquiree held by the Group immediately before the acquisition approximated $650 million. If this 
business combination had occurred as of the beginning of 2012, the revenue of the combined entity would have been $15,133 million.
In addition to the information disclosed in respect of this acquisition, IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” requires the Group to disclose the 
amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date for each class of the acquiree’s assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and profit or loss  
of the combined entity as if this acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the annual reporting period. It is impracticable to disclose this 
information because the Group has not completed purchase price allocation in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”.
Kazankovskaya

20. Equity (continued)
Earnings per share
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity 
holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
that would be issued on the conversion of all the potential dilutive ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:
2012 2011 2010
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share 1,339,027,567 1,293,795,125 1,247,614,092
Effect of dilution: share-based awards – 2,689,622 134,937
Weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution 1,339,027,567 1,296,484,747 1,247,749,029
Profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
US$ million $(308) $461 $486
Basic earnings/(losses) per share $(0.23) $0.36 $0.39
Diluted earnings/(losses) per share $(0.23) $0.36 $0.39
In 2010, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share does not include 7,333,333 shares of Evraz Group S.A. 
issued in 2009 to Lanebrook in exchange for the right to receive 7,333,333 shares lent under the shares lending transactions. These 
transactions had no impact on equity, as the Group’s net assets did not change as a result of these transactions.
In 2011 and 2010, share-based awards (Note 24) had a dilutive effect. In 2012, the Group reported net loss. Consequently, they were 
antidilutive. In 2010, the convertible bonds were antidilutive as the interest (net of tax) per ordinary share obtainable on conversion exceeded 
basic earnings per share.
In 2011, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding from 1 January 2011 to the date of the first share exchange (“the 
reorganisation date”) was computed on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of Evraz Group S.A. outstanding during the 
period multiplied by the share exchange ratio. The number of ordinary shares outstanding from the reorganisation date to the end of 2011 was 
the actual number of ordinary shares of EVRAZ plc outstanding during that period. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
and earnings per share for 2010 were recalculated using the share exchange ratio.
In 2013, in connection with the purchase of a controlling interest in Corber (Note 11), EVRAZ plc issued 132,653,006 shares and warrants to 
subscribe for an additional 33,944,928 shares exercisable at zero price. The number of the additionally issued shares is adjusted for dividends 
that could be declared during the period from the date of issue of the warrants till the date of their exercise.
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of 
completion of these consolidated financial statements.

$2.70 per share. In the consolidated financial statements of the Group for 2011 these dividends were charged against accumulated profits.  
At a meeting held on 15 May 2012, the shareholders of Evraz Group S.A. approved the distribution of those dividends from share premium of 
Evraz Group S.A. Consequently, in 2012, the Group decreased its additional paid-in capital and increased accumulated profits by $491 million.
The shareholders’ meeting held on 16 May 2011 resolved not to declare dividends for 2010.
In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Group declared dividends. The share of non-controlling shareholders in those dividends was $1 million in 
2012, 2011 and 2010.
Legal reserve
According to the Luxembourg Law, Evraz Group S.A. is required to create a legal reserve of 10% of share capital per the Luxembourg statutory 
accounts by annual appropriations which should be at least 5% of the annual net profit per statutory financial statements. The legal reserve can 
be used only in case of a bankruptcy.

the principal amount of $100,000 each. The bondholders owning 6,478 bonds accepted the incentivised conversion. In July and August 2011, 
Evraz Group S.A. additionally converted 21 bonds and settled 1 bond by cash. The conversion premium paid by Evraz Group S.A. in the amount 
of $158 million together with $3 million of transaction costs were recognised as a loss (Note 7). Evraz Group S.A. issued 30,771,756 GDRs 
representing 10,257,252 ordinary shares. As such, the carrying amount of liability amounting to $553 million was reclassified into equity.
Covenants reset
In 2012, the lenders under certain bank facilities and the holders of the 8.25% guaranteed notes due 2015 approved the requested amendments 
to the loan agreements and notes removing certain financial restrictions. The Group incurred $7 million with respect to this covenants reset.
In 2010, the Group paid the remaining $29 million of consent fees and legal fees in connection with the covenants reset, which was performed 
in 2009.
Unamortised debt issue costs
Unamortised debt issue costs represent agent commission and transaction costs paid by the Group in relation to the arrangement and reset of 
loans and notes.

The Group has several lease agreements under which it has an option to acquire the leased assets at the end of lease terms ranging from 1 to 
21 years. The estimated remaining useful life of leased assets varies from 1 to 29 years. The leases were accounted for as finance leases in the 
consolidated financial statements. The carrying value of the leased assets was as follows as at 31 December:
US$ million 2012 2011 2010
Buildings and constructions $2 $2 $1
Machinery and equipment 15 22 22

23. Employee beneﬁts
Russian plans
Certain Russian subsidiaries of the Group provide regular lifetime pension payments and lump-sum amounts payable at retirement date.  
These benefits generally depend on years of service, level of remuneration and amount of pension payment under the collective bargaining 
agreements. Other post-employment benefits consist of various compensations and certain non-cash benefits. The Group funds the benefits 
when the amounts of benefits fall due for payment.
In addition, some subsidiaries have defined benefit plans under which contributions are made to a separately administered non-state pension 
fund. The Group matches 100% of the employees’ contributions to the fund up to 4% of their monthly salary. The Group’s contributions become 
payable at the participants’ retirement dates.
Defined contribution plans represent payments made by the Group to the Russian state pension, social insurance, medical insurance and 
unemployment funds at the statutory rates in force, based on gross salary payments. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay 
further contributions in respect of those benefits.
Ukrainian plans
The Ukrainian subsidiaries make regular contributions to the State Pension Fund thereby compensating preferential pensions paid by the fund to 
employees who worked under harmful and hard conditions. The amount of such pension depends on years of service and salary.
In 2010 and 2011, these preferential pensions were partially funded by the State Pension Fund. The Ukrainian subsidiaries gradually increased 
these contributions and starting from 2012 they pay 100% of preferential pensions. In addition, employees receive lump-sum payments on 
retirement and other benefits under collective labour agreements. These benefits are based on years of service and level of compensation.  
All these payments are considered as defined benefit plans. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

23. Employee beneﬁts (continued)
US and Canadian plans
The Group’s subsidiaries in the USA and Canada have defined benefit pension plans that cover specified eligible employees. Benefits are based 
on pensionable years of service, pensionable compensation, or a combination of both depending on the individual plan. Certain employees that 
were hired after specified dates are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans. Those employees are instead enrolled in defined 
contribution plans and receive a contribution funded by the Group’s subsidiaries equal to 2–7% of annual wages, including applicable bonuses. 
The defined contribution plans are funded annually, and participants’ benefits vest after three years of service. The subsidiaries also offer 
qualified Thrift (401(k)) plans to all of their eligible employees.
Other plans
Defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans are maintained by the subsidiaries located in South Africa, Italy and the Czech Republic.
Deﬁned contribution plans
The Group’s expenses under defined contribution plans were as follows:
US$ million 2012 2011 2010
Expense under defined contribution plans $412 $404 $257
Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Russian, Ukrainian and other defined benefit plans are mostly unfunded and the US and Canadian plans are partially funded.
The components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended 31 December 2012, 2011 
and 2010 and amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010 for the defined

The expected long-term rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets represents the weighted-average asset return for each forecasted 
asset class return over several market cycles.
A one percentage point change in the assumed rate of increase in healthcare costs would have insignificant effects on the Group’s current 
service cost and the defined benefit obligation.
24. Share-based payments
On 14 December 2010, 13 October 2011 and 6 September 2012, the Group adopted Incentive Plans under which certain senior executives and 
employees (“participants”) could be gifted shares of the parent company upon vesting.
The vesting date for each tranche occurs within the 90-day period after announcement of the annual results. The expected vesting dates of the 
awards outstanding at 31 December 2012 are presented below:

29 March 2015 3,810,363 – –
9,525,479 1,887,395 656,697
The plans are administrated by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors has the right to accelerate vesting of the grant.  
In the event of a participant’s employment termination, unless otherwise determined by the Board or by a decision of the authorised person, a 
participant loses the entitlement for the shares that were not gifted up to the date of termination.
There have been no modifications or cancellations to the plans during 2010–2012. In 2011, after the Group’s reorganisation (Notes 1 and 20), 
the shares of Evraz Group S.A., which were granted to the participants, have been substituted by the shares of EVRAZ plc. EVRAZ plc

24. Share-based payments (continued)
The Group accounted for share-based compensation at fair value pursuant to the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”. The weighted 
average fair value of share-based awards granted in 2012 was $3.41 per share of EVRAZ plc (in 2011 and 2010 $48.26 and $102.07 per share 
of Evraz Group S.A., respectively). The fair value of these awards was estimated at the date of grant and measured at the market price of the 
shares of a parent company reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period. The following inputs, 
including assumptions, were used in the valuation:

The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise was $4.31 and $97.46 in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the share-based awards outstanding as of 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 1.2, 1.2 
and 1.4 years, respectively.
In the years ended 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010, expense arising from the equity-settled share-based compensations was as follows:
US$ million 2012 2011 2010
Expense arising from equity-settled share-based payment transactions $22 $23 $2
In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Group paid $Nil, $1 million and $3 million, respectively, relating to the cash-settled share-based awards under the 
incentive plans which were in place before 2010.

Under the legislation, mining companies and steel mills have obligations to restore mining sites and contaminated land. The respective liabilities 
were measured based on estimates of restoration costs which are expected to be incurred in the future discounted at the annual rate ranging 
from 3.7% to 14% in 2012 and 2011 (2010: 6.1% to 13%).

Contingent consideration payable
Contingent consideration represents additional payments for the acquisition of Stratcor in 2006. This consideration could be paid each year up to 
2019. The payments depend on the deviation of the average prices for vanadium pentoxide from certain levels and the amounts payable for each 
year are limited to maximum amounts. In 2012, the Group was not required to pay this consideration due to the movements in the vanadium 
pentoxide market relative to the levels set in the agreement. In 2011 and 2010, the Group paid $3 million and $16 million, respectively. EVRAZ plc

26. Other long-term liabilities (continued)
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
In 2009–2011, the Group issued rouble-denominated bonds in the total amount of 70,000 million Russian roubles (Note 21). To manage the 
currency exposure, the Group concluded currency and interest rate swap contracts under which it agreed to deliver US dollar-denominated 
interest payments at the rates ranging from 4.45% to 8.90% per annum plus the notional amount totalling $2,177 million, in exchange for 
rouble-denominated interest payments plus the notional amount totalling 63,790 million roubles ($2,100 million at the exchange rate as of 
31 December 2012). The exchange is exercised on approximately the same dates as the payments under the bonds.

These swap contracts were not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. The Group accounted for these derivatives at fair value which was 
determined using valuation techniques. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the change in fair value of the derivatives of $96 million, $(176) million and 
$(27) million, respectively, together with a realised gain on the swap transactions, amounting to $81 million, $66 million and $31 million, 
respectively, was recognised within gain/(loss) on financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations (Note 7).

29. Financial risk management objectives and policies
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Financial 
instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts receivable.
To manage credit risk related to cash, the Group maintains its available cash, mainly in US dollars, in reputable international banks and major 
Russian banks. Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of the banks in which it deposits cash.
The Group’s trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. There are no 
significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related 
entities. In 2012, the major customers were Russian Railways and Enbridge Energy Partners (3.1% and 2.4% of total sales, respectively).
Part of the Group’s sales is made on terms of letter of credit. In addition, the Group requires prepayments from certain customers. The Group 
does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except when a customer applies for credit terms which are longer than 
normal. In this case, the Group requires bank guarantees or other collateral. The Group has developed standard credit terms and constantly 
monitors the status of accounts receivable collection and the creditworthiness of the customers.

Credit risk (continued)
Certain of the Group’s long-standing Russian customers for auxiliary products, such as heat and electricity, represent municipal enterprises and 
governmental organisations that experience financial difficulties. The significant part of doubtful debts allowance consists of receivables from 
such customers. The Group has no practical ability to terminate the supply to these customers and negotiates with regional and municipal 
authorities the terms of recovery of these receivables.
At 31 December the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets, which is disclosed below.

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group prepares a rolling 12-month financial plan which ensures that the Group has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational 
expenses, financial obligations and investing activities as they arise. The Group exercises a daily monitoring of cash proceeds and payments. 
The Group maintains credit lines and overdraft facilities that can be drawn down to meet short-term financing needs. If necessary, the Group 
refinances its short-term debt by long-term borrowings. The Group also uses forecasts to monitor potential and actual financial covenants 
compliance issues. Where compliance is at risk, the Group considers options including debt repayment, refinancing or covenant reset. 
The Group has developed standard payment periods in respect of trade accounts payable and monitors the timeliness of payments to its 
suppliers and contractors.
The following tables summarise the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, including 
interest payments. EVRAZ plc

Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows on both a fixed and variable rate basis and has other interest-bearing liabilities, such as finance lease liabilities and 
other obligations.
The Group incurs interest rate risk on liabilities with variable interest rates. The Group’s treasury function performs analysis of current interest 
rates. In case of changes in market fixed or variable interest rates management may consider the refinancing of a particular debt on more 
favourable terms. The Group does not have any financial assets with variable interest rates.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for ﬁxed rate instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore, a change in interest rates 
at the reporting date would not affect the Group’s profits.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets as assets available for sale. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting 
date would not affect the Group’s equity.
Cash ﬂow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
Based on the analysis of exposure during the years presented, reasonably possible changes in floating interest rates at the reporting date would 
affect profit before tax (“PBT”) by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, 
remain constant.

Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currencies of the respective Group’s subsidiaries. The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily US dollars,  
Canadian dollars and euro.
The Group does not have formal arrangements to mitigate currency risks of the Group’s operations. However, management believes that the 
Group is partly secured from currency risks as foreign currency denominated sales are used to cover repayment of foreign currency 
denominated borrowings.
The Group’s exposure to currency risk determined as the net monetary position in the respective currencies was as follows at 31 December:

Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
 Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and
 Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, short-term accounts receivable and payable, 
short-term loans receivable and payable and promissory notes, approximate their fair value.

The fair value of the non-convertible bonds and notes was determined based on market quotations. The fair value of convertible bonds and 
long-term bank loans was calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the Group’s market 
rates of interest at the reporting dates. The discount rates used for valuation of financial instruments were as follows:
Currency in which ﬁnancial instruments are denominated 2012 2011 2010
USD 7.5 – 8.6% 8.2 – 9.1% 7.7 – 8.3%

RUB 9.2% 9.7% 12.0%
Capital management
Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity. Revaluation surplus which is included in capital is not subject to 
capital management because of its nature.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order  
to support its business and maximise the return to shareholders. The Board of Directors reviews the Group’s performance and establishes key 
performance indicators. In addition, the Group and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements (loans and 
bonds covenants) which are used for capital monitoring. There were no changes in the objectives, policies and processes during 2012. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

29. Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
Capital management (continued)
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it by the issue of new shares, dividend payments to shareholders, and the 
purchase of treasury shares. In addition, the Group monitors distributable profits on a regular basis and determines the amounts and timing of 
dividend payments.
The capital requirements imposed by certain loan agreements include a $2,000 million minimum representing consolidated equity of Evraz Group 
S.A. less goodwill. In 2010–2012, the Group was in compliance with this requirement.

31. Commitments and contingencies
Operating environment of the Group
The Group is one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers globally and the largest steel producer in Russia. The Group’s major 
subsidiaries are located in Russia, Ukraine, the European Union, the USA, Canada and the Republic of South Africa. Russia, Ukraine and the 
Republic of South Africa are considered to be emerging markets with higher economic and political risks.
Steel consumption is affected by the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general 
economic conditions. The global economic recession resulted in a significantly lower demand for steel products and decreased profitability.
In 2012, the sovereign debt problems in Europe added extra volatility to commodity and financial markets and led to an additional uncertainty  
in the process of recovery of the global economy.
The global economic climate continues to be unstable and this may negatively affect the Group’s results and financial position in a manner not 
currently determinable.
Taxation
Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant 
regional and federal authorities.
Recent events suggest that the tax authorities are taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments and, 
as a result, it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged. As such, significant 
additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed.
Management believes that it has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable. Where uncertainty exists, the Group has accrued tax liabilities 
based on management’s best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, which will be required to settle these 
liabilities. Possible liabilities which were identified by management at the end of the reporting period as those that can be subject to different 
interpretations of the tax laws and other regulations and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $19 million.
Contractual commitments
At 31 December 2012, the Group had contractual commitments for the purchase of production equipment and construction works for an 
approximate amount of $579 million.
In 2010, the Group concluded an agreement for the supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon by a third party for a period of 20 years. The 
contractual price comprises a fixed component and a variable component. The total amount of the fixed component approximates 252 million 
euro. The agreement is within the scope of IFRIC 4 “Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease”. At 31 December 2012, the lease 
had not commenced.
Social commitments
The Group is involved in a number of social programmes aimed to support education, healthcare and social infrastructure development in towns 
where the Group’s assets are located. In 2013, the Group plans to spend approximately $159 million under these programmes.

31. Commitments and contingencies (continued)
Environmental protection
In the course of the Group’s operations, the Group may be subject to environmental claims and legal proceedings. The quantification of 
environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, improvements in environmental 
technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of each site investigation, preliminary findings 
and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement. Management believes that any pending environmental claims or proceedings will 
not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations.
In addition, the Group has committed to various environmental protection programmes covering periods from 2013 to 2022, under which the 
Group will perform works aimed at reductions in environmental pollution and contamination. The costs of implementing these programmes are 
estimated at $267 million.
Legal proceedings
The Group has been and continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, none of which has had, individually or in aggregate, a significant effect 
on the Group’s operations or financial position. Possible liabilities which were identified by the Group at the end of the reporting period as those 
that can be subject to different interpretations of legislation and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately 
$27 million.
In 2008, the Competition Commission initiated a complaint against various steel manufacturers, including EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium 
Corporation Limited (“EHSVL ”), alleging that EHSVL (then Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation) was involved, whether directly or indirectly,  
in the fixing of the selling prices and trading conditions for flat steel products. It was further alleged that EHSVL contravened the Competition Act 
by engaging in the exchange of information with a competitor through information exchanges and meetings of the South African Iron and Steel 
Institute or its committees.
In March 2012, the Commission referred the complaints to the South African Competition Tribunal for prosecution.
No decision has yet been announced by the Competition Tribunal as to whether it will decide to impose any penalty against EHSVL or, if imposed, 
the amount of any such fine. Should the Competition Commission be successful, which is not expected by management, it could raise a 
maximum penalty of R554 million ($65 million).
Management believes that EHSVL acted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Thus, no provision for this matter has been accrued 
as of 31 December 2012. The Group has cooperated with the Competition Commission throughout the investigation and intends to continue to 
do so.
32. Auditor’s remuneration
The remuneration of the Group’s auditor in respect of the services provided to the Group was as follows.
US$ million 2012 2011 2010
Audit of the parent company of the Group $2 $4 $2

33. Subsequent events
Acquisition of a controlling interest in Corber
In January 2013, the Group obtained control over Corber, which owns 81.95% interest in JSC Raspadskaya (Note 11).
Extension of the notes due 2013
In March 2013, the holders of 9.25% rouble-denominated notes received an option to accept a new coupon of 8.75% per annum till 20 March 
2015 or put the notes back to the Group at a nominal value. By 26 March 2013, the date of the expiration of the option, the Group re-purchased 
back the notes totalling 12,265 million roubles ($399 million at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction). The remaining notes with the 
aggregate principal amount of 2,735 million roubles (approximately $89 million) continue to be traded on the Moscow Exchange. The Group has a 
right to resell the repurchased notes on the market at any time and at its own discretion.
Timir Iron Ore project
On 3 April 2013, the Group acquired a 51% ownership interest in the joint venture with Alrosa for the development of 4 iron ore deposits in  
the southern part of the Yakutia region in Russia. The Group’s consideration for this stake amounts to 4,950 million roubles (approximately 
$160 million) payable in installments through 15 July 2014. Total investments in the first phase of the Timir project are estimated at $1.8 billion 
during the period from 2013 to 2018. The Group and Alrosa are expected to finance the Timir project on a pro rata basis. EVRAZ plc

has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act

responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 97, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of EVRAZ plc for the year ended 31 December 2012.

Notes to the Separate Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012
1. Corporate information
These separate financial statements of EVRAZ plc were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 April 2013.
EVRAZ plc (“EVRAZ plc” or “the Company”) was incorporated on 23 September 2011 as a public company under the laws of the United Kingdom. 
The company was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 with the registered number 7784342 (originally called Project Savannah plc which 
name was changed to EVRAZ plc by a resolution on 13 October 2011). The Company’s registered office is at 5th Floor, 6 St. Andrew Street, 
London, EC4A 3AE, United Kingdom.
As a result of the reorganisation implemented by way of the share exchange offer made by the Company for the shares of Evraz Group S.A., on 
7 November 2011, the Company became a new parent entity of Evraz Group S.A., a joint stock company registered in Luxembourg in 2004.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries (the “Group”), is involved in the production and distribution of steel and related products and coal 
and iron ore mining. In addition, the Group produces vanadium products. The Group is one of the largest steel producers globally.
Lanebrook Limited (Cyprus) is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable requirements of the UK law.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IASB”). IFRSs that are mandatory for 
application as of 31 December 2012, but not adopted by the European Union, do not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no material uncertainties that lead to 
significant doubt the entity can continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future.
Foreign currency transactions
The presentation and measurement currency of the Company is US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in US dollar at 
the rate ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange 
at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Investments in subsidiaries
Participations in subsidiaries are initially stated at acquisition cost. Write-downs are recorded if, in the opinion of the management, there is any 
permanent impairment in value.
The cost of investment in Evraz Group S.A. was measured at the carrying amount of the equity items of Evraz Group S.A. as a separate legal 
entity at the date of the reorganisation (Note 3).
Dividend income is recognised as revenue when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date when the investment is delivered to or by the 
Company.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for 
doubtful receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method; any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is 
recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and when it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement 
is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. EVRAZ plc

As described in Note 4, the Company acquired Evraz Group S.A. in 2011 by means of the share exchange offer made by the Company to 
the shareholders of Evraz Group S.A., which were entitlied to receive 9 shares of EVRAZ plc for each share of Evraz Group S.A.
The cost of investments in Evraz Group S.A. was measured at the carrying amount of the equity items shown in the separate accounts of 
Evraz Group S.A. at the dates of share exchange. In addition, at 31 December 2012, the cost of investments in Evraz Group S.A. includes $26 
million of share-based compensations to participants of Incentive Plans which are employed by the Company’s indirect subsidiaries (Note 5).
In 2012, the Company acquired 100% of Susurrus Finance S.A. (Luxembourg) for a consideration of 36,000 euro. In May 2012, the name of the 
subsidiary was changed to EVRAZ Greenfield Development S.A. (“EGD”). Subsequently, the Company made a cash contribution to the share 
capital of EGD for a total amount of $248 million. This contribution was used by EGD for the purchase of a 60.016% share in the Mezhegey coal 
field project from Mastercroft Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, for $245 million.

At 31 December 2012 and 2011, Mastercroft Finance Limited had 0.01% and 0.06% interest, respectively, in the Company’s issued capital.
On 17 October 2011, following the decision of the Board of Directors, Evraz Group S.A. commenced the Group’s reorganisation and re-
domiciliation to the United Kingdom. This was implemented by means of the share exchange offer made by the Company to the shareholders of 
Evraz Group S.A. which were entitlied to receive 9 shares of EVRAZ plc for each share of Evraz Group S.A.
The first share exchange was performed on 7 November 2011: EVRAZ plc issued 1,313,258,883 ordinary shares with par value of $2 each and 
exchanged them for approximately 98.01% interest in Evraz Group S.A. The new shares were admitted to the premium listing segment of the 
Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities.
On 24 November 2011, the par value of the shares was reduced to $1, and $1,313 million representing distributable reserves were transferred 
to accumulated profits. All subsequent shares were issued with par value of $1 each. The exchange offer was finally closed on 7 February 2012.

4. Equity (continued)
Share capital (continued)
The Company recognised a reorganisation reserve of $(582) million being the difference between the net assets of Evraz Group S.A. at 
7 November 2011 and the par value of the issued shares of EVRAZ plc. This charge to equity reduced the amount of distributable reserves.
At 31 December 2011, there were shareholders which did not accept the share exchange offer. On 17 February 2012, Mastercroft Finance 
Limited, an indirect subsidiary of EVRAZ plc, purchased the remaining GDRs of Evraz Group S.A. and exchanged them for 869,469 newly issued 
shares of EVRAZ plc. Since that date Evraz Group S.A. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVRAZ plc. This transaction increased the 
Company’s share capital by $2 million with a corresponding charge to the reorganisation reserve.
Dividends
In 2012 and 2011, the Company declared dividends as follows:

5. Share-based payments
As diclosed in Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements, in 2012 the Group has incentive plans under which certain employees 
(“participants”) can be gifted shares of the Company.
After the Group’s reorganisation the shares of Evraz Group S.A. granted under incentive plans have been substituted by the shares of EVRAZ plc. 
As such, EVRAZ plc recognised an expense arising from the share-based compensations from 7 November 2011 till 31 December 2011 in the 
amount of $4 million as a cost of investments in Evraz Group S.A. with a corresponding increase in equity. In 2012, the Company recognised a 
$22 million expense under the share-based compensations as a cost of investments in Evraz Group S.A. with a corresponding increase in equity.
The share-based awards which were not exercised at 31 December 2012 and 2011 amounted to 12,069,571 and 4,460,547 shares of EVRAZ 
plc, respectively. More details are provided in Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.
6. Related party transations
Related parties of the Company include its direct and indirect subsidiaries, associates and joint venture partners, key management personnel 
and other entities that are under the control or significant influence of the key management personnel, the Company’s parent or its shareholders 
represent related parties.
In 2011, there were no transactions with related parties, except for the share exchange with Mastercoft Finance Limited (“MFL ”) in the course  
of the reorganisation described in Note 4. MFL exchanged the global depository receipts (“GDRs”) of Evraz Group S.A. into 775,410 shares of 
EVRAZ plc.
In 2012, Evraz Group S.A. paid general and administrative expenses on behalf of the Company in the amount of $4 million under the Paying 
Agency agreement.
In 2012, OOO Evrazholding, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, renderred consulting services in the amount of $2 million. At 31 December 
2012, the balances with related parties comprised accounts payable to OOO Evrazholding in the amount of $1 million.

In December 2012, the Group issued European commercial papers with a nomial amount of $80 million and $170 million bearing an interest rate 
of 3.50% and 3.75%, respectively, and maturing on 6 September 2013 and 4 December 2013, respectively. The proceeds from this issue 
amounted to $242 million.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of the European commercial papers approximates their carrying amount.
8. Dividend income
In 2012, the Company received dividends from Evraz Group S.A. in the amount of $390 million.
9. Subsequent events
Acquisition of a controlling interest in Corber
In October 2012, EVRAZ plc concluded a preliminary agreement with Adrolive Investments Limited for an acquisition of a 50% ownership interest 
in Corber subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfillment of certain other conditions. On 16 January 2013, all the conditions were 
met and the Group obtained control over the entity (the other 50% share in Corber is held by an indirect subsidiary of Evraz Group S.A.).
Management believes that this acquisition will increase the Group’s coking coal self-coverage and generate substantial operational synergies to 
the Group, including the optimal use of various coal grades. EVRAZ plc

Timir Iron Ore project
On 3 April 2013, the Company acquired a 51% ownership interest in the joint venture with Alrosa for the development of 4 iron ore deposits in the 
southern part of the Yakutia region in Russia. The Company’s consideration for this stake amounts to 4,950 million roubles (approximately $160 
million) payable in installments through 15 July 2014. Total investments in the first phase of the Timir project are estimated at $1.8 billion during

Operations and Products
API-certiﬁed American Petroleum Institute certified (API grade) products
Beam A structural element. Beams are characterised by their profile (the shape of their cross-section). 
One of the most common types of steel beam is the I-beam, also known as H-beam, or W-beam 
(wide-flange beam), or a ‘universal beam/column’. Beams are widely used in the construction 
industry and are available in various standard sizes, e.g. 40-k beam, 60Sh beam, 70Sh beam as 
mentioned in this report
Billet A usually square, semi-finished steel product obtained by continuous casting or rolling of blooms. 
Sections, rails, wire rod and other rolled products are made from billets
Blast furnace The blast furnace is the classic production unit to reduce iron ore to molten iron, known as hot 
metal. It operates as a counter-current shaft system, where iron ore and coke is charged at the 
top. While this charge descends towards the bottom, ascending carbon containing gases and coke 
reduces the iron ore to liquid iron. To increase efficiency and productivity, hot air (often enriched 
with oxygen) is blown into the bottom of the blast furnace. In order to save coke, coal or other 
carbon containing materials are sometimes injected with this hot air
Brownﬁeld An exploration or development project which is either on industrial lands that are now vacant or 
underused or located within an existing operation, with the ability to share infrastructure and 
management 
By-product A secondary product which results from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction
Capex Capital expenditure
CFR Cost and freight, the seller must pay the costs and freight to bring the goods to the port of 
destination. However, risk is transferred to the buyer once the goods are loaded on the vessel. 
Insurance for the goods is not included
Channel U-shaped section for construction
CIF Cost, Insurance and Freight, the same as CFR except that the seller must in addition procure and 
pay for the insurance
Coke A product made by baking coal without oxygen at high temperatures. Unwanted gases are driven 
out of the coal. The unwanted gases can be used as fuels or processed further to recover valuable 
chemicals. The resulting material (coke) has a strong porous structure which makes it ideal for use 
in a blast furnace
Coke battery A group of coke ovens operating as a unit and connected by common walls
Coking coal Highly volatile coal used to manufacture coke
Concentrate A product resulting from iron  ore / coal enrichment, with a high grade of extracted mineral
Construction products Include beams, channels, angles, rebars, wire rods, wire and other goods
Converter A type of furnace that uses pure oxygen in the process of producing steel from cast iron or dry mix
Crude steel Steel in its solidified state directly after casting. This is then further processed by rolling or other 
treatments, which can change its properties
Debottlenecking Increasing capacity of a supply or production chain through the modification of existing equipment 
or infrastructure to improve efficiency
ECP Eurocommercial Paper
Electric arc furnace A furnace used in the steelmaking process which heats charged material via an electric arc.  
Flat products or Flat-rolled steel products Include commodity plate, specialty plate and other products in flat shape such as sheet, strip and 
tin plate
Greenﬁeld The development or exploration of a new project not previously examined
Grinding balls Balls used to grind material by impact and pressure
Head-hardened rails High strength rails with head hardened by heat treatment  EVRAZ plc

Term Deﬁnition
Iron ore Chemical compounds of iron with other elements, mainly oxygen, silicon, sulphur or carbon.  
Only extremely pure (rich) iron-oxygen compounds are used for steelmaking. 
JORC Code The Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee, which is widely accepted as a standard for 
professional reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves
Ladle furnace The secondary metallurgy vessel used between steelmaking and casting operations  to allow the 
composition of molten steel to be brought to the required customer specification
Lean Lean is philosophy of managing the business that is based on a set of principles that define the 
way of work 
Long products Include bars, rods and structural products that are ‘long’ rather than ‘flat’ and are produced from 
blooms or billets
Longwall An underground mining process in which the coal face is dug out by a shearer and transported 
above ground by conveyors.
Lumpy ore Iron ore between 6mm and 30mm in size. Lump is preferred in the blast furnace as its particle 
size allows oxygen to circulate around the raw materials and melt them efficiently
MENA Middle East and North Africa
OCTG pipe Oilfield Casing and Tubing Goods or Oil Country Tubular Goods – pipes used in the oil industry
Old order/New order mining rights Reference terms for South African mining agreements. 
Old order mining rights are those licenses which were issued during the apartheid era,  
for New order mining rights to be awarded operators must collaborate with the Black Economic 
Empowerment partners
OSB technology Open Slag Bath Furnace. An electric steelmaking furnace, where the electrodes are not submersed, 
but are operated in a “brush” arc mode, where the electrode is just above the liquid slag
Pellet An enriched form of iron ore shaped into small balls or pellets. Pellets are used as raw material in 
the steel making process
Pig iron The solidified iron produced from a blast furnace used for steel production. In liquid form, pig iron 
is known as hot metal
Pipe blank A flat sheet of metal, a semi-finished product, sold to pipemakers to manufacture pipes 
Plate A long thin square shaped construction element made from slabs
Pulverised coal injection (PCI) A cost-reducing technique in iron-making, where cheaper coal is prepared to replace normal  
coking coal in the blast furnace. The coal is pulverised into very small particles before injection 
into the furnace
Railway products Include rails, rail fasteners, wheels, tyres and other goods for the railway sector
Raw steam coal Also known as thermal coal. Mainly used in energy generation 
Rebar Reinforcing bar, a commodity grade steel used to strengthen concrete in highway and building 
construction. Rebar A500SP is a type of reinforcing bar that allows for a reduction in the metallic 
component of reinforced concrete, thereby significantly lowering construction costs
Rolled steel products Products finished in a rolling mill; these include bars, rods, plate, beams etc
Rolling mill A machine which converts semi-finished steel into finished steel products by passing them through 
sets of rotating cylinders which form the steel into finished products
SG&A Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Saleable products Products produced by EVRAZ mines or steel mills which are suitable for sale to third parties
Self-coverage The raw material requirement of EVRAZ’s steelmaking facilities fulfilled by EVRAZ owned mines
Scrap Iron containing recyclable materials (mainly industrial or household waste) that is generally 
remelted and processed into new steel

04 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Chairman’s Statement
2010 was a landmark year for the Group, with the successful 
completion of the Esperanza mine. Commissioning of the plant 
commenced in November 2010, with the ﬁrst shipment of copper 
concentrate taking place in January 2011. As a result of Esperanza 
coming on-stream, along with the completion of the Los Pelambres 
plant expansion during the ﬁrst quarter of 2010, Group copper 
production is currently expected to increase to approximately  
715,000 tonnes in 2011, a 60% increase on the pre-expansion 
2009 levels.
Jean-Paul Luksic, Chairman 05 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
Net earnings increased by 57 .5% to US$1,051.8 million compared with 
US$667 .7 million in 2009, reﬂecting improved commodity prices and 
increased production volumes. Cash ﬂows from operations were 
US$2,433.9 million, compared with US$1,167 .8 million in 2009, mainly 
reﬂecting the increase in proﬁts. At the end of 2010 the Group had a net 
cash position of US$1,345.1 million and total cash, cash equivalents and 
liquid investments of US$3,541.6 million.
Group copper production was 521,100 tonnes, compared with 442,500 tonnes 
in 2009. This 17 .8% increase was mainly due to increased production at 
Los Pelambres, reﬂecting higher throughput as a result of the plant expansion. 
Molybdenum production at Los Pelambres was 8,800 tonnes, a 12.8% increase 
on 2009, again due to the plant expansion. The transport and water divisions 
both achieved increased volumes.
Our careful ﬁnancial stewardship during the recent years of development will 
allow a substantial return of capital through the proposed special dividend, 
while the signiﬁcant increase in the ordinary dividend underlines our increased 
production base and conﬁdence in our future prospects. Our ﬁnancial position 
remains strong and we remain well placed to progress with our substantial 
growth opportunities which we have continued to enhance over the past year.
During 2010 the Chilean government enacted a number of changes to the 
Chilean tax system in order to contribute to the reconstruction costs following 
the severe earthquake which affected the country on 27 February 2010, 
including changes to both the corporate tax rates and the mining royalty. 
The Group’s four mining operations, Los Pelambres, Esperanza, El Tesoro and 
Michilla, which have invariability agreements in place with regard to the mining 
tax, have voluntarily elected to accept amendments enacted in respect of this 
tax. In exchange for waiving protection for a three-year period from 2010-2012, 
the companies will be granted an additional stability period of six years at the 
end of their existing agreements, during which any connected projects will also 
beneﬁt from tax invariability. Further details of the tax charge for the year and 
the tax structure applicable to the Group are set out in the Financial Review 
on page 63.
Strategy
The strategy for the Group’s mining business continues to be based on three 
key pillars. Firstly, securing and strengthening the core business of the Group – 
the Los Pelambres, Esperanza, El Tesoro and Michilla mines; secondly, 
continuing to grow this core business by further developing the areas around its 
existing asset base – the Sierra Gorda District around Esperanza and El Tesoro, 
the area around Los Pelambres, and areas close to Michilla, including the 
Antucoya deposit; and ﬁnally, continuing to develop and search for additional 
opportunities including early-stage growth in copper both in Chile and abroad. 
The successful execution of the Esperanza mine and the Los Pelambres plant 
expansion were major achievements in the Group’s growth plans. The Group has 
also made signiﬁcant progress with its longer-term growth prospects. In the 
Sierra Gorda District, mineral resource estimates were completed during 2010 
in respect of the Telégrafo and Caracoles deposits, totalling 3.9 billion tonnes 
with an average copper grade of 0.38% and containing additional gold and 
molybdenum credits. This gives a total of 6.1 billion tonnes with an average 
copper grade of 0.39% in the Sierra Gorda District. At Los Pelambres a scoping 
study is examining the key enablers which could allow the mine to utilise its 
signiﬁcant resource base in the longer term, which could potentially lead to a 
signiﬁcant increase in the scale of the operation later this decade. A feasibility 
study is in progress at the Antucoya deposit, evaluating the potential for a project 
producing approximately 80,000 tonnes of copper per year. At the Reko Diq 
joint venture, work on the feasibility study and the environmental and social 
impact assessment study are both complete and have been submitted to the 
Government of Balochistan. Further progress on this project will be dependent 
on the grant of the mining lease for which an application has been made, and 
successful conclusion of litigation which is currently in progress before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. In July 2010 the Group signed a deﬁnitive 
agreement with Duluth Metals Limited to acquire an initial 40% stake in the 
Nokomis copper-nickel-platinum group metal deposit, a potentially world-class 
base and precious metal deposit located in the highly prospective Duluth 
Complex in Minnesota, and work is progressing in respect of the feasibility study. 
The Group has also expanded its portfolio of early-stage international earn-in 
agreements. The Group is also continuing with its exploration and development 
activities relating to geothermal and coal energy prospects in Chile.

Sustainable development
Sustainable development forms an integral part of the Group’s decision-
making process and supports achievement of our business strategy. The Board 
continues to place key importance on a range of considerations including health 
and safety, management of human resources, environment and community 
relations. Effective management of social and environmental issues reduces 
costs and risks to our business, supports our reputation, underpins our 
relationships with key stakeholders including investors, regulators, 
employees and communities, and helps us to maintain our social licence 
to operate and grow. 
As a Group, we have been very proud to be able to play a part in the 
reconstruction efforts in Chile following the earthquake and resulting tsunami 
of February 2010 which had a devastating impact on the Maule and Bio-Bio 
Regions. Five days after the earthquake we had a team and equipment working 
in the severely affected town of Curepto in the Maule Region providing assistance 
and clearing debris. We also engaged with the authorities and established a 
US$10 million recovery fund, which has been mainly used for Antofagasta 
Minerals S.A.’s “Coastal Route” project to support the recovery of artisanal 
ﬁshing, which had been severely affected, as well as strengthening tourist and 
community infrastructure. In addition to this ﬁnancial contribution, Antofagasta 
Minerals is contributing management expertise used in large mining projects 
to help implement the project. Both for the Group as a whole as well as for 
the individuals directly involved, the project has been a very positive and 
rewarding experience.
Health and safety
The Board deeply regrets the death of two contractors at Los Pelambres during 
2010. The Board has a clear target of zero fatalities and considers any fatality 
to be unacceptable. Following these incidents, further safety training and 
awareness raising has been provided for workers. Los Pelambres has also 
introduced changes to increase the linkage between safety performance and 
remuneration, with 25% of bonuses now based on whether the site’s lost time 
injury frequency target has been met.
Dividends
In light of the successful completion of the key growth projects and the strong 
ﬁnancial position of the Group, the Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 
112 cents per share, comprising an ordinary dividend of 12 cents per share and 
a special dividend of 100 cents per share, which, if approved, will amount to a 
payment in June 2011 of US$1,104.2 million. Taking this payment into account, 
the Group’s ﬁnancial position remains strong and it remains well placed to take 
advantage of its considerable growth prospects as these continue to progress. 
This gives total dividends for the year of 116 cents, amounting to US$1,143.6 
million and representing a distribution of 109% of 2010 net earnings. 
The Board’s policy is to establish an ordinary dividend which can be maintained 
or progressively increased at conservative long-term copper prices and through 
the economic cycle. In addition, the Board recommends special dividends when 
it considers these appropriate after taking into account the level of proﬁts earned 
in the period under review, the existing cash position of the Group and signiﬁcant 
known or expected funding commitments. The Board’s overall policy remains 
unchanged and the level of distribution in future years, including any special or 
additional dividends, will depend on the factors set out above.

Board composition
I am very pleased to be able to welcome two new Non-Executive Directors to 
the Antofagasta plc Board, who both bring great experience of the international 
mining industry. Hugo Dryland is Global Head of Rothschild’s investment banking 
activities in the mining and metals sector, and has 25 years of investment 
banking experience in natural resources. Tim Baker was latterly Executive 
Vice-President and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer at Kinross Gold Corporation, and 
previously Executive General Manager of Placer Dome Chile. He has previously 
managed mining operations in Chile, the United States, Tanzania and Venezuela 
and held geological and production roles in Kenya and Liberia. Daniel Yarur 
retired from the Board on 1 March 2011. Daniel had been a Non-Executive 
Director of Antofagasta plc since 2004, and we are very grateful for his 
signiﬁcant contribution to the Group over this period and would like to wish 
him every success for the future.
Outlook
Market fundamentals remain positive and, while the high level of volatility that 
has characterised commodity prices in recent years is expected to continue, 
consensus estimates are for copper prices to remain favourable in 2011. 
Supply constraints and underlying demand could keep the copper market 
in deﬁcit for a number of years.
As previously announced, the initial forecast for 2011 Group copper production 
is for approximately 715,000 tonnes, a 37% increase on 2010 levels, mainly 
due to the production from Esperanza, although this will depend on a number 
of factors including the precise timing of the completion of the ramp-up of 
that operation. Molybdenum production at Los Pelambres is expected to be 
approximately 9,300 tonnes compared with 8,800 tonnes in 2010, due to the 
full-year impact of increased plant throughput as a result of the plant expansion 
completed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2010. The payable gold content in copper 
concentrate is expected to be approximately 324,000 ounces compared with 
35,100 ounces in 2010, also as a result of Esperanza, although again this will 
depend on the precise timing of the completion of the ramp-up of that operation.
The Group’s very sizeable resource base within Chile provides excellent 
opportunities for longer-term organic expansion, and its expanding portfolio 
of exploration and development agreements provides further potential for 
international growth. The Group’s continued strong ﬁnancial position means 
it is well placed to progress with all of these opportunities.

1
 Securing and strengthening 
the Core Business 
  The ﬁrst pillar of our strategy for the mining 
business is to optimise and enhance our 
existing core business – the Los Pelambres, 
Esperanza, El Tesoro and Michilla mines.
>  Los Pelambres completed its plant expansion during Q1 2010, 
increasing throughput by approximately 30%. 
>  Esperanza made its ﬁrst shipment of copper concentrate in 
January 2011, following the start of commissioning of the plant 
in November 2010. Esperanza will signiﬁcantly increase total 
Group copper production by approximately 25%. 
>  At El Tesoro, pre-stripping of the Mirador deposit commenced 
in December 2010, with production from this satellite deposit 
expected to commence in the ﬁnal quarter of 2011. 
>  Michilla is continuing with work on the evaluation and 
recategorisation of its resources, to allow the extension of its 
current mine plan, as well as additional exploration which could 
further extend the mine life.
 
2
 Organic and sustainable 
growth of the Core Business 
   The second pillar of the strategy is to achieve 
sustainable, organic growth from further 
developing the areas around our existing 
asset base in Chile.
>  In the Sierra Gorda District, mineral resource estimates were 
completed in respect of the Telégrafo and Caracoles deposits, 
increasing the Group’s total mineral resources by 3.9 billion 
tonnes with an average copper grade of 0.38%. This gives 
a total of 6.1 billion tonnes with an average copper grade 
of 0.39% in the Sierra Gorda District.
>  At the Antucoya deposit a feasibility study is in progress, 
evaluating the potential for a project producing approximately 
80,000 tonnes of copper per year.
>  At Los Pelambres a scoping study is examining the key factors 
which could allow it to utilise its signiﬁcant resource base in 
the longer term.
 
3
 Growth beyond the 
Core Business 
  The third pillar of the strategy is to look 
for growth beyond the areas of our existing 
operations – both in Chile and internationally. 
The primary focus is on potential early-stage 
developments.
>  At the Reko Diq joint venture, work on the feasibility study and 
the environmental and social impact assessment study are 
both complete and have been submitted to the Government 
of Balochistan. 
>  In July 2010 the Group signed a deﬁnitive agreement with 
Duluth Metals Limited to acquire an initial 40% stake in the 
Nokomis copper-nickel-platinum group metal deposit, a 
potentially world-class base and precious metal deposit 
located in the highly prospective Duluth Complex in Minnesota,

The Group uses the following enablers to support our strategy:
Quality of existing assets
The Group has a high-quality, low-cost portfolio of operating assets and 
development projects, with a weighted average net cash cost of 104.0 cents/
lb in 2010. This means it is well positioned to perform strongly throughout the 
commodity price cycle. The Esperanza project will provide additional new 
production also with a low net cash cost. > Pages 26 to 37
Strong ﬁnancial position
The Group’s net cash position of US$1.3 billion at the end of 2010 has allowed 
the proposed signiﬁcant capital return to shareholders, while still leaving the 
Group well placed to progress with its medium and longer-term growth plans 
as well as preserving the ﬂexibility to take advantage of opportunities which 
may arise. > Page 66
Experienced management team
The Group’s stable, well-established management team has an excellent 
track record of delivering on planned production growth and operational 
performance. > Page 76
Extensive mineral resource base
The Group has substantial mineral resources, well in excess of the ore 
reserves incorporated in existing mine plans, which could provide the potential 
for expansions in production volumes or extensions of existing mine lives. 
During 2010 the total resource tonnage of the Group’s subsidiaries increased 
by 46%, from 9.2 billion tonnes in 2009 to 13.4 billion tonnes, following the 
proving-up of the resources relating to the Telégrafo and Caracoles deposits. 
> Pages 38 to 43 and Pages 134 to 140
Commitment to health and safety
Management of health and safety is a key priority for the Group. The Group 
aims to work to the highest standards to safeguard its employees, contractors 
and communities. > Pages 49 and 50
Strong labour relations
The Group values the importance of its workforce. The Group provides its 
employees with training and opportunities to fulﬁl their potential, and with fair 
remuneration which reﬂects their contribution. This has been reﬂected in the 
good history of labour relations across the Group. During 2010 the Group 
successfully completed new long-term labour agreements with unions at 
Los Pelambres and Michilla. > Page 51 
Community relations
The Group seeks to manage the social impact of its activities, and aims to 
make use of its operations as a platform for the social and economic 
development of its local communities. > Pages 52 to 54
Efﬁcient environmental management
The Group recognises the importance of the effective management of the 
environmental impacts of its activities, from exploration through to closure. 
It promotes efﬁcient management of natural resources, in particular energy 
efﬁciency and responsible water use. > Pages 54 to 57 Strategic Review

Our products
The principal product of the Group’s mining business is copper. The Los Pelambres 
and Esperanza mines produce copper concentrate, through a milling and 
ﬂotation process. The El Tesoro and Michilla mines produce reﬁned copper 
cathodes, using heap-leaching processes (and in the case of El Tesoro also 
a Run-of-Mine leaching process) and then solvent-extraction electro-winning 
(“SX-EW”). Los Pelambres and Esperanza’s copper concentrate is normally 
sold to smelters for further processing and reﬁning into copper cathodes. 
El Tesoro and Michilla’s copper cathodes are typically sold to copper fabricators, 
for processing into applications including copper wiring and tubing for use 
by industrial end-users. The principal end markets for reﬁned copper are 
construction and electrical and electronic products, which account for more 
than 60% of global copper demand, followed by industrial machinery, 
transport and consumer products. 
Sales of copper are typically priced in line with London Metal Exchange (“LME”) 
market prices. A deduction is made from LME prices in the case of concentrate, 
to reﬂect treatment and reﬁning charges (“TC/RCs”) – the smelting and reﬁning 
costs necessary to process the concentrate into copper cathodes. Cathodes of 
a certain quality or from certain locations may attract a premium above the LME 
price. In addition, prices realised by the Group during a speciﬁc period will differ 
from the average market price for that period because, in line with industry 
practice, concentrate and cathode sales agreements generally provide for 
provisional pricing at the time of shipment with ﬁnal pricing based on the 
average market price for future periods (normally about one month from the 
month of shipment in the case of cathode sales and on average three months 
from the month of shipment in the case of concentrate sales). 
The Group’s businesses, and in particular the mining 
division, are heavily dependent on the copper and 
molybdenum markets which in turn are signiﬁcantly 
inﬂuenced by the international economy.

under long-term framework agreements. These framework contracts will 
typically set out the annual volumes to be supplied, with the pricing of the 
contained copper in accordance with market prices as explained above, and 
the TC/RCs to be determined annually, normally in line with industry benchmark 
terms. A signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’s copper cathode sales are made 
under annual contracts, which again specify volumes to be supplied, and with 
pricing in line with market prices as explained above. 
Esperanza and Los Pelambres also produce gold, contained within the main 
concentrate. The sales of this gold content is priced in accordance with normal 
market prices. In addition, Los Pelambres produces molybdenum, a metal which 
is primarily used in the production of high-quality steel alloys. This is sold in 
separate concentrate form to molybdenum roasters for further processing and 
reﬁning. These sales are priced in accordance with market prices, and as with 
copper concentrate are subject to ﬁnal pricing adjustments (on average one 
month from the month of shipment). 
The transport division provides rail and road services, with its main business 
being the transportation of copper cathodes from and sulphuric acid to mines 
in Chile’s Antofagasta Region. These services are typically provided to customers 
under long-term contracts, often with agreed pricing levels which are subject to 
adjustments for inﬂation and movements in fuel prices. 
The water division operates a 30-year concession for the distribution of water 
in Chile’s Antofagasta Region, which it acquired in 2003. It consists of two 
businesses – a regulated business supplying domestic customers and an 
unregulated business serving mines and other industrial users. Sales to domestic 
customers are priced in accordance with regulated tariff structures, while sales 
to industrial customers are generally priced in accordance with contractually 
agreed levels. 
Reﬁned copper market
The commodity price environment remained very favourable through 2010, 
and has continued to perform strongly so far in 2011.
The LME copper price averaged 342.0 cents per pound over the course of 2010, 
a 46.0% increase on the 2009 average of 234.2 cents. The price at the start of 
2010 was 333.2 cents per pound, remaining volatile during the ﬁrst half of the 
year, falling to around 280 cents in both February and June 2010. The price then 
rose consistently during most of the second half of 2010, reaching 441.8 cents 
per pound at 31 December 2010, which was an all-time high. This strong 
performance was principally driven by continued strong demand from China 
and other emerging countries, as well as improving demand from western world 
economies. The Group’s average realised copper price was higher than the 
average market price in 2010 at 359.3 cents per pound (2009 – 270.6 cents), 
with the rising copper prices during the year resulting in positive adjustments 
to provisionally priced sales.
The strength of the copper market seen in the second half of 2010 has 
continued in the ﬁrst two months of 2011, during which period the LME copper 
price has averaged 441 cents per pound. During February 2011 a record price 
of 460 cents was reached, although prices have eased back from this high point. 
Supply side pressures over the forthcoming years have been increased by the 
project delays and cancellations during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008-2009 and 
declining ore grades as existing mines mature. A number of physically-backed 
copper Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) have recently been established, and 
while the level of investment in these funds is currently limited, they could 
represent a further source of demand for copper. This could provide further 
support for the copper price, but may also result in increased volatility as 
investment ﬂows play an increasingly important role alongside more traditional 
fundamental drivers of demand. Current consensus estimates are for the copper 
price to average approximately 435 cents per pound in 2011, with the market 
expected to be in deﬁcit by approximately 440,000 tonnes, and the market 
balance could remain tight in the medium term.

Marketplace continued
Copper concentrate market
The concentrate market continues to be in signiﬁcant deﬁcit, with available 
smelting capacity signiﬁcantly in excess of mine supply, resulting in low 
treatment and reﬁning charges (“TC/RCs”) which favour mine producers. 
The market deﬁcit was approximately 1.5 million tonnes in 2010, and current 
consensus estimates are that this level of deﬁcit is likely to be maintained or to 
increase slightly in 2011. Without fundamental changes to the smelting market, 
a deﬁcit is expected to continue for a number of years, with resulting favourable 
treatment and reﬁning charges. The negotiations for the 2011 annual benchmark 
treatment and reﬁning terms have been predominantly concluded, with most 
deals between miners and smelters agreed at US$56 per dry metric tonne of 
concentrate for smelting and 5.6 cents per pound of copper for reﬁning, although 
some of Los Pelambres’ agreements have been settled with a slightly lower 
treatment charge reﬂecting the relatively high copper content of its concentrate. 
While this represents an increase from the 2010 annual benchmark terms of 
US$46.5 and 4.65 cents, the impact during 2011 will be reduced by the “brick 
system” in many contracts whereby the terms are often averaged over two years. 
Molybdenum market
The market molybdenum price averaged US$15.7 per pound in 2010, a 
41.4% improvement from the average during 2009 of US$11.1. This reﬂected 
signiﬁcantly improved demand from the stainless steel sector, the principal use 
of molybdenum, particularly from China, which since 2009 has been a net 
importer, but also increasingly from Europe and North America. The realised 
molybdenum price in 2010 was marginally above the average market price at 
US$16.2 per pound (2009 – US$11.3). The LME started trading molybdenum 
futures contracts from February 2010. While there is still limited liquidity in this 
market, it could provide greater depth and transparency to molybdenum prices 
as it continues to develop.
The ﬁrst two months of 2011 have seen an improvement in the molybdenum 
price, increasing from US$16.4 per pound at the start of the year to US$17 .7 
at the end of February 2011. Market consensus is for prices to remain at around 
this level during 2011, given the improved demand from the stainless steel 
market, and the lack of signiﬁcant supply-side growth in the short term. 
Key inputs
The Group’s mining operations are dependent on a range of key inputs, such 
as mining equipment (including the supply and maintenance of vehicles and 
replacement parts such as tyres), electricity, labour and fuel. In the case of a 
copper concentrate producer such as Los Pelambres, steel balls used in the 
milling process are also a signiﬁcant input cost. With cathode producers using 
the SX-EW process, such as El Tesoro and Michilla, sulphuric acid is a key input. 
The availability and cost of these inputs can be key operational issues, 
particularly during times of strong demand for commodities. 
During 2010 the Group has seen sustained market cost pressures, and this is 
likely to continue throughout 2011, particularly if the commodity markets remain 
strong. Weighted average cash costs per pound of copper produced were 
104.0 cents per pound in 2010, compared with 96.3 cents per pound in 2009. 
This increase was due to higher on-site and shipping costs at the three mining 
operations, partially offset by improved by-product credits. Excluding by-product 
credits, cash costs were 137 .3 cents per pound, compared with 120.3 cents in 
2009. This was mainly due to higher input costs, in particular energy, and the 
effect of the stronger Chilean peso across the three mining operations, as well 
as the effect of the temporary suspension of the Tesoro North-East pit and the 
increased maintenance at Los Pelambres.

Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
Weighted average cash costs excluding by-product credits are forecast to 
be approximately 140 cents per pound in 2011, broadly in line with 2010 
average costs of 137 .3 cents, although costs remain susceptible to further 
macroeconomic pressures, particularly in a strong commodity pricing 
environment. Weighted average cash costs net of by-product credits, which 
are subject to ﬂuctuations in the price of gold and molybdenum, are currently 
forecast to be approximately 90 cents per pound in 2011, a reduction 
compared with the 104.0 cents in 2010, reﬂecting the impact of the additional 
low-cost production from Esperanza. The estimate for 2011 is based on a 
molybdenum price of approximately US$18 per pound and a gold price of 
US$1,150 per pound.
The Group enters into medium and long-term contracts for a range of key inputs 
to help ensure continuity of supply and in some cases to guarantee cost levels. 
Labour agreements are in place at all of the Group’s mining operations, 
generally covering periods of between three to four years. Los Pelambres 
entered into a new 46-month labour agreement with the main union in 
November 2010. In December 2010 Michilla concluded negotiations with their 
main labour union for a new 48-month labour agreement. Esperanza currently 
has in place a two-year labour agreement which runs until May 2011, and 
during the early part of 2011 will be working to put in place a new agreement. 
El Tesoro’s labour agreement runs until early 2012.
The Group has long-term electricity supply contracts in place at each of its 
mines. In most cases the cost of electricity under these contracts will be linked 
to some degree to the current cost of electricity on the Chilean grids or the costs 
of generation of the particular supplier. In 2011 Los Pelambres will enter into a 
two-year period under its existing energy supply agreement with a lower pricing 
level, resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction in its energy cost.
The Group also normally contracts for the majority of its sulphuric acid 
requirements for future periods of a year or longer, at speciﬁed rates. 
In most cases contractual prices will be agreed in the latter part of the year, to 
be applied to the purchases of acid for the following year. In 2010 the average 
cost of acid across El Tesoro and Michilla (including transportation costs) was 
approximately US$100 per tonne of acid, approximately 30% lower than in 
2009. However, following a tightening in the acid market during 2010 it is 
expected that the average cost of acid for El Tesoro and Michilla could rise 
by approximately 30% in 2011.
The Group was impacted by the increase in oil prices in 2010. The average 
market price for oil during 2010 was US$79 per barrel (WTI), compared with 
US$62 per barrel in 2009, an increase of 27%. Clearly, oil prices remain 
susceptible to political uncertainty in the larger oil producing countries, with 
the WTI price trading at over US$95 per barrel at the end of February 2011.
The Group’s costs are also impacted by the Chilean peso exchange rate, as 
on average across the Group’s mining operations approximately 35% of costs 
are denominated in Chilean pesos. However, the economic exposure to 
ﬂuctuations in the Chilean peso exchange rate is partly mitigated by a natural 
hedge, as the copper industry is a major component of the Chilean economy, 
and movements in the copper price and Chilean peso tend to be correlated. 
The average exchange rate during 2010 was Ch$510/US$, a 9% strengthening 
compared with the average of Ch$559/US$ during 2009. The peso has 
continued to strengthen during early 2011, reaching Ch$474/US$ by the end 
of February 2011.

Risk Management
  Effective risk management is an essential element of the Group’s operations and strategy. The accurate and timely 
identiﬁcation, assessment and management of risk is key to the operational and ﬁnancial success of the Group.
The Group’s risk management framework can be divided into three tiers: 
>  Governance – ensuring that the Group’s vision, strategy and objectives 
are communicated throughout the organisation, and that appropriate 
governance structures and policies and procedures are in place to embed 
those key aims and objectives. 
>  Risk Management – ensuring that there are appropriate structures and 
processes in place to identify and evaluate risks, and that appropriate controls 
and mitigating actions are developed to address those risks. Ensuring that 
details of the key risks, and the performance in managing those risks, are 
reported on a timely basis to the relevant individuals. 
>  Compliance – ensuring that the Group’s internal policies and procedures 
and control activities, as well as all relevant external laws and regulations, 
are adhered to.

Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of risk management. 
This includes both reviewing the effectiveness of the overall risk management 
system, and also monitoring major strategic and operational risks. Monthly 
highlights are presented to the Board which include a variance analysis of 
operational and ﬁnancial performance, allowing potential key issues to be 
identiﬁed and corrective measures adopted on a timely basis. Progress on 
key development projects are closely monitored, including a trafﬁc light risk 
assessment of progress against key project milestones. The Audit Committee 
assists the Board with its review of the Group’s risk management process, 
including some detailed aspects of the effectiveness of the internal control 
system. Further details about the role of the Audit Committee are given in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 79.
The Group’s Ethics Code sets out our commitment to undertaking business 
in a responsible and transparent manner. The Code demands honesty, integrity 
and responsibility from all employees and contractors, and includes guidelines 
to identify and manage potential conﬂicts of interest. An Ethics Committee, 
comprising members of senior executive management, is responsible for 
implementing, developing and updating the Ethics Code and monitoring 
compliance with the Code. Further details are provided in the Sustainability 
Report on page 46.
There is a central risk management function which has overall responsibility 
for risk management activities across the Group. The risk management function 
reports to the Audit Committee at least twice a year, with updates on the key 
risks and mitigations, and summaries of internal audit reviews which have been 
undertaken. Speciﬁc matters will be reported by the risk management function to 
the Audit Committee on an immediate basis if necessary. The risk management 
function also reports regularly to the Antofagasta Minerals CEO.
The risk management function maintains the Group’s risk register, which 
includes the strategic risks that cover the most signiﬁcant threats to the Group’s 
performance and strategy. The risk register is updated on a continuous basis, 
but strategic risk workshops are also held at least once a year, in which senior 
management from across the business review the Group’s key strategic risks 
and related controls and mitigation activities. The General Managers of each 
of the operations have overall responsibility for risk management within their 
business. There are also risk co-ordinators within each business, who have direct 
responsibility for the risk management processes within that business, and for 
the ongoing maintenance of the individual business risk registers. There are risk 
workshops for each business held at least annually, involving the business’s 
management team and the central risk management function, in which the 
business unit’s risks and corresponding mitigation activities are reviewed in 
detail to allow a thorough updating of the business risk register.
The mitigation activities in relation to the most signiﬁcant strategic and business 
unit risks are reviewed by the risk management function at least annually, 
through direct on-site review for the most signiﬁcant risks. 
Areas of focus during 2010 and development of key risks
Particular areas of focus in risk management during 2010 included:
> a detailed review and update of the Group’s Ethics Code; 
>  reviewing the emergency planning in place for low probability, high impact 
natural disasters; and
>  reviewing the risks relating to early-stage exploration and development 
projects, including developing an annual process for assessing the countries 
in which the Group wishes to engage in exploration work.
Particular key risks which are considered to be increasing in signiﬁcance include: 
>  competition for talent and other key resources, particularly given the current 
strength of the mining sector and wider economic recovery; and 
>  ensuring that the Group’s organisational structure and talent pool reﬂects 
the Group’s developing requirements as the business increasingly expands 
beyond its original Chilean base.
Speciﬁc areas of compliance focus included an assessment of the impact of 
and compliance with the new Chilean anti-bribery law which was enacted in 
December 2009, and an initial assessment of the implications of the UK Bribery 
Act 2010 pending the issue of ﬁnal statutory guidance and implementation 
which is expected to occur in 2011.

20 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk Mit i gat i on
Health, safety and the environment
The Group operates in an industry that is subject to numerous health, 
safety and environmental laws and regulations as well as community 
expectations. Non-compliance could result in harm to the Group’s 
workers, the environment and the communities in which the Group 
operates, disruption to the Group’s operations, as well as ﬁnes and 
penalties and damage to its reputation. 
The Group attaches a very high priority to health, safety and 
environmental matters. The Group monitors relevant legislation 
and regulations relating to health, safety and the environment 
to ensure the safety of its workforce, and continued compliance. 
Potential environmental impacts are key considerations when 
assessing projects, including the integration of innovative technology 
in the project design where it can help to mitigate those effects.
The Group provides for future site closure and remediation costs, 
based on analysis produced by external expert advisors.
> Further information in respect of 
the Group’s activities in respect of health, 
safety and the environment is set out in 
the Corporate Sustainability section on 
pages 49 and 50 and 54 to 57.
Community relations
Failure to adequately manage relations with local communities 
could have a direct impact on the Group’s reputation and ability 
to operate at existing operations and the progress and viability 
of development projects.
The Group aims to contribute to the local development of the 
communities in which it operates, in particular through education, 
training and employment of the local population. The Group 
endeavours to ensure clear and transparent communication with 
local communities, including through the use of local perception 
surveys, local media and community meetings.
> Details of the Group’s community relations 
activities are included in the Corporate 
Sustainability section on pages 52 to 54.
Political, legal and regulatory risks
The Group may be affected by political instability and regulatory 
developments in the countries in which it is operating, pursuing 
development projects or conducting exploration activities. Issues 
with the granting of permits, or the withdrawal or variation of permits 
already granted, and changes to regulations or taxation could 
adversely affect the Group’s operations and development projects.
The Group assesses political risk as part of its evaluation of potential 
projects, including the nature of foreign investment agreements in 
place. Political, legal and regulatory developments affecting the 
Group’s operations and projects are monitored closely. 
> Details of any signiﬁcant political, legal 
or regulatory developments impacting the 
Group’s operations are included within the 
Operational Review on pages 24 to 45.
Employees and contractors
The Group’s highly skilled workforce is essential to maintain its 
current operations, to implement its development projects, and to 
achieve longer-term growth. The loss of skilled workers and failure 
to recruit new staff may lead to increased costs or delays. 
Labour disputes may lead to operational interruptions and higher 
costs and could have a negative impact on the Group’s earnings.
The Group’s performance management system is designed 
to provide reward and remuneration structures and personal 
development opportunities appropriate to attract and retain 
a highly skilled workforce. The Group has in place a talent 
management system to identify and develop internal candidates 
for critical management positions. 
There are long-term labour contracts in place at each of the 
Group’s mining operations which help to ensure labour stability.
Contractors’ employees are an important part of the Group’s 
workforce, and under Chilean law are subject to the same duties 
and responsibilities as the Group’s own employees. The Group’s 
approach is to treat contractors as strategic associates. 
> Details of the Group’s relations with 
its employees and contractors are set out 
within the Corporate Sustainability section 
on pages 51 and 52 and within the 
Operational Review on pages 24 to 45.
Strategic resources 
Disruption to the supply of any of the Group’s key strategic inputs 
such as electricity, water, sulphuric acid and mining equipment 
could have a negative impact on production volumes. Longer-term 
restrictions could impact opportunities for the growth of the Group.
A portion of the Group’s input costs are inﬂuenced by external 
market factors and are not entirely within the control of the Group.
Contingency plans are in place to address potential short-term 
disruptions to strategic resources such as electricity. The Group 
enters into medium and long-term supply contracts for a range 
of key inputs to help ensure continuity of supply. 
Technological solutions, such as increased use of sea water in the 
Group’s mining processes, can help address long-term limitations 
on scarce resources such as fresh water.
> Information on the Group’s arrangements 
for the supply of key inputs are included 
within the Marketplace section on pages 
14 and 15, and details of signiﬁcant 
operational or cost factors related to key 
inputs are included within the Operational 
Review on pages 24 to 57. 21 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

Risk Mit i gat i on
Operational risks 
Mining operations are subject to a number of circumstances not 
wholly within the Group’s control, including damage to or breakdown 
of equipment or infrastructure, unexpected geological variations or 
technical issues, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, 
which could adversely affect production volumes and costs. 
The key operational risks relating to each operation are identiﬁed as 
part of the regular risk review process undertaken by the individual 
operations. This process also identiﬁes appropriate mitigations for 
each of these speciﬁc operational risks. 
Monthly Board reports present an analysis of operational and 
ﬁnancial performance, with an analysis of signiﬁcant variances, 
allowing potential key issues to be identiﬁed on a timely basis, and 
any necessary monitoring or control activities to be established.
The Group has appropriate insurance to provide protection from 
some, but not all, of the costs that may arise from such events.
> Details of the operational performance 
of each of the Group’s operations 
are included within the Operational Review 
on pages 24 to 45.
Development projects
A failure to effectively manage the Group’s development projects 
could result in delays in the commencement of production and cost 
overruns. Demand for supplies, equipment and skilled personnel 
could affect capital and operating costs. Increasing regulatory and 
environmental approvals and litigation could result in delays in 
construction or increases in project costs.
Prior to project approval a detailed feasibility process is followed 
to assess the technical and commercial viability of the project. 
Detailed progress reports on the ongoing development projects 
are regularly reviewed, including assessments of the progress of 
the key project milestones and actual performance against budget.
> Details of the progress of the Group’s 
development projects are included within 
the Operational Review on pages 38 to 43.
Growth opportunities
The Group needs to identify new mineral resources and development 
opportunities in order to ensure continued future growth. The Group 
seeks to identify new mineral resources through exploration and 
acquisition. There is a risk that exploration activities may not identify 
viable mineral resources. The Group may fail to identify attractive 
acquisition opportunities, or may select inappropriate targets. 
The long-term commodity price forecasts used when assessing 
potential projects and other investment opportunities are likely to 
have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the forecast return on investment.
The Group has teams conducting active exploration programmes 
both within Chile and elsewhere. The Group has entered into 
early-stage exploration agreements with third parties in a number 
of countries throughout the world, and has also acquired interests 
in companies with known geological potential. 
The Group assesses a wide range of potential growth opportunities, 
both from its internal portfolio and external opportunities, to 
maximise its growth proﬁle. A rigorous assessment process is 
followed to evaluate all potential business acquisitions. 
> A review of the Group’s exploration 
activities, its exploration agreements and 
other growth opportunities are set out in 
the Operational Review on pages 38 to 43. 
Commodity prices 
The Group’s results are heavily dependent on commodity prices – 
principally copper and to a lesser extent molybdenum. The prices 
of these commodities are strongly inﬂuenced by world economic 
growth, and may ﬂuctuate widely and have a corresponding impact 
on the Group’s revenues. 
The Group considers exposure to commodity price ﬂuctuations within 
reasonable boundaries to be an integral part of the Group’s business, 
and its usual policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices. 
The Group monitors the commodity markets closely to determine the 
effect of price ﬂuctuations on earnings and cash ﬂows, and uses 
derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price 
ﬂuctuations where appropriate. 
> The sensitivity of Group earnings to 
movements in commodity prices is set out 
in the Financial Review on page 65.
Details of hedging arrangements put in 
place by the Group are included within the 
Financial Review on page 65 and in Note 25 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
Ore reserves and mineral  
resources estimates
The Group’s ore reserves and mineral resources estimates are 
subject to a number of assumptions and estimations, including 
geological, metallurgical and technical factors, future commodity 
prices and production costs. Fluctuations in these variables may 
result in lower grade reserves or resources being deemed 
uneconomic, and could lead to a reduction in reserves or resources.
The Group’s reserves and resources estimates are updated annually 
to reﬂect material extracted during the year, the results of drilling 
programmes and updated assumptions. The Group follows the 
JORC code in reporting its ore reserves and mineral resources 
which requires that the reports are based on work undertaken 
by a Competent Person. 
> The ore reserves and mineral 
resources estimates, along with 
supporting explanations, are set out

CHILE Operational Review
26 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Los Pelambres is a sulphide deposit located in Chile’s Coquimbo Region, 
240 km north-east of Santiago. It produces copper concentrate (containing 
gold and silver) and molybdenum concentrate, through a milling and 
ﬂotation process. 
The plant expansion initiated in mid-2008 was successfully completed, on 
schedule and on budget, during the ﬁrst quarter of 2010. The additional plant 
infrastructure, including a third SAG mill and a sixth ball mill, has increased 
throughput capacity to a 175,000 tonnes per day level, being the maximum 
annual average allowed under current environmental permits. This results 
in an approximate 30% increase in plant capacity, which on average will 
increase annual production in a full year by around 90,000 tonnes of 
copper compared with 2009 levels. 
In 2010 Los Pelambres produced 384,600 tonnes of payable copper, 
23.4% above 2009 production of 311,600 tonnes, with the increase due to the 
higher throughput as a result of the plant expansion. Ore throughput averaged 
159,400 tonnes per day during the year (2009 – 129,200 tonnes per day). 
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2010, while the plant expansion was being commissioned, 
throughput averaged 137 ,900 tonnes per day. Following the completion of the 
commissioning throughput increased to an average of 172,100 tonnes per day 
during Q2 and Q3. In the ﬁnal quarter of the year throughput temporarily reduced 
to an average of 155,400 tonnes per day, mainly due to major maintenance work 
performed in December 2010.

This maintenance work, which had originally been scheduled for 2011, included 
the partial replacement of the conveyor belt that transports the ore from the mine 
site to the plant. The average ore grade during 2010 was marginally higher than 
the prior year at 0.76% copper (2009 – 0.74%), although this was partly offset 
by slightly lower metallurgical recovery of 90.0% (2009 – 92.1%). 
Molybdenum production was 8,800 tonnes, a 12.8% increase on 2009. 
The increase reﬂected the increased plant throughput following the expansion, 
partly offset by a slight decrease in the molybdenum grade to 0.019% (2009 
– 0.020%). Gold production was 35,100 ounces (2009 – 23,500 ounces).
Labour negotiations were satisfactorily concluded at Los Pelambres during 
November 2010 with the main union, which covers more than 70% of the mine’s 
employees, for a new 46-month labour agreement. This was concluded in 
advance of the expiry of the existing agreement, which ran until February 2011.
Revenue at Los Pelambres in 2010 was US$3,348.3 million, 60.9% ahead of 
the US$2,081.5 million in 2009. The increase reﬂected the increase in copper 
and molybdenum volumes as a result of the plant expansion, and increases in 
both copper and molybdenum market prices.
Realised copper prices at Los Pelambres were 371.7 cents per pound, 29.6% 
higher than the 2009 realised price of 286.8 cents. This largely reﬂected the 
increase in the average LME price, which was 342.0 cents per pound in 2010, 
compared with 234.2 cents on average during 2009. The realised copper 
prices during both 2010 and 2009 exceeded the average LME price, due 
to signiﬁcant provisional pricing adjustments in both years, with positive 
adjustments of US$280.1 million in 2010, and US$380.3 million in 2009. 
Realised molybdenum prices were US$16.2 per pound (2009 – US$11.3 per 
pound) which was broadly in line with the average market price of US$15.7 per 
pound (2009 – US$11.1 per pound). Further details of pricing adjustments for 
both copper and molybdenum are given in the Financial Review on pages 60 
and 61 and in Note 25(d) to the ﬁnancial statements. 
Cash costs for 2010, which are stated net of by-product credits and include 
tolling charges, were 79.3 cents per pound, marginally below the 80.4 cents 
for 2009. This reﬂected an increase in on-site and shipping costs, offset by 
improved by-product credits due to the higher molybdenum market prices and 
production volumes. On-site and shipping costs increased from 95.3 cents per 
pound in 2009 to 106.8 cents, reﬂecting higher energy prices, increased labour 
and maintenance and fuel costs as well as the impact of the stronger Chilean 
peso. Labour costs increased largely as a result of a one-off signing bonus 
following the early conclusion of the labour agreement in November 2010. 
The increased maintenance included the major work performed in December 
2010 described above. Tolling charges decreased slightly to 17 .6 cents per 
pound (2009 – 19.2 cents), resulting in total cash costs before by-product 
credits of 124.4 cents per pound (2009 – 114.5 cents). 
The increased molybdenum price and improved production volumes resulted 
in an increased by-product credit of 45.1 cents per pound (2009 – 34.1 cents). 
The individual components of Los Pelambres’ cash costs are set out on page 141. 
Los Pelambres achieved an operating proﬁt of US$2,215.9 million, a 73.0% 
increase compared with the 2009 proﬁt of US$1,280.7 million. This reﬂected 
the increased production volumes and realised commodity prices, partly offset 
by the higher on-site and shipping cash costs, as well as a US$31.0 million 
increase in depreciation as the plant expansion is now operational and a one-off 
US$65.2 million charge relating to an increase in the provision for future mine 
closure costs. The closure provision was increased following an updated 
assessment during 2010 by external consultants, with the provision increasing 
due to factors including increases in the scale of the operation, updated cost 
assumptions, and an acceleration of the timing of certain closure activities 
relating to the Quillayes tailings dam.
Total capital expenditure during 2010 was US$215.9 million, of which 
US$134.3 million related to the ﬁnal expenditure on the completion of the plant 
expansion during the ﬁrst quarter of the year. Total expenditure on the plant 
expansion was in line with budget at just below US$1 billion. 
Labour negotiations were concluded during 
November 2010 with the main union for a 
new 46-month labour agreement. Operational Review
28 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Mining continued
As previously announced, the initial forecast for 2011 production is for 
approximately 419,000 tonnes of payable copper, a 9% increase compared 
with 2010. This is based on an average plant throughput of 175,000 tonnes per 
day, given a full year of operation of the plant at the expanded capacity, and an 
expected average ore grade of 0.76%. The initial forecast for 2011 molybdenum 
production is for approximately 9,300 tonnes, again based on the impact of the 
increased plant throughout, and a relatively stable molybdenum grade of 
approximately 0.019%. The initial gold production forecast is approximately 
38,000 ounces. Copper production during the ﬁrst two months of 2011 is 
slightly behind budgeted levels and the ability to fully achieve the forecast will 
depend on ore grades and plant performance for the remainder of the year. 
As normal, Los Pelambres will continue to review actual production levels and 
the full-year forecast as the year progresses.
On-site and shipping costs for 2011 are forecast to be approximately 107 cents 
per pound, similar to the 106.8 cents achieved in 2010. Inﬂationary pressures 
and other general cost increases of approximately 10 cents are expected to be 
fully offset by a number of speciﬁc factors, including unit cost decreases resulting 
from the higher production levels, lower labour costs in 2011 following the 
recognition of the one-off labour agreement signing bonus in November 2010, 
and reduced energy prices as Los Pelambres enters into a two-year period under 
its existing energy supply agreement with a lower pricing level. Tolling charges 
are also expected to remain largely stable at approximately 17 cents compared 
with 17 .6 cents in 2010. While the benchmark terms for 2011 have increased 
slightly from the 2010 level, the impact of this is mitigated by the effect of the 
“brick system” in many contracts whereby the benchmark is often averaged over 
two years. Some of Los Pelambres’ agreements have also been settled with a 
slightly lower treatment charge compared with the 2011 benchmark, reﬂecting 
the relatively high copper content of its concentrate. Cash costs before 
by-product credits are expected, therefore, to remain largely steady at 
approximately 124 cents per pound compared with 124.4 cents per pound 
in 2010. Based on a molybdenum price of approximately US$18 per pound, 
by-product credits are expected to be around 45 cents per pound, compared 
with 45.1 cents in 2010, which would give net cash costs of approximately 
79 cents in 2011, compared with 79.3 cents in 2010. 
Los Pelambres is continuing to review opportunities for further expansion. 
The processing capacity of the plant is currently limited by the existing 
environmental permits to an annual average of 175,000 tonnes per day. 
It is possible that the engineering capacity of the plant could support operation 
at a higher level than this current limit, and Los Pelambres is evaluating whether 
it is feasible to seek to raise this limit. As explained below in the Los Pelambres 
District section, Los Pelambres is also continuing to review options for the 
longer-term development of the mine. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

El Tesoro is a deposit located in Chile’s Antofagasta Region, 1,350 km north of 
Santiago, which produces copper cathodes using a solvent-extraction electro-
winning process. It currently comprises two open pits – Central and North-East 
– which, along with oxide ore from Esperanza, feed a heap-leach operation and 
a Run-of-Mine  (“ROM”) leaching operation. The new Mirador open pit is currently 
undergoing pre-stripping.
Revenue at El Tesoro was US$739.7 million in 2010, a 51.7% increase on the 
2009 revenues of US$487 .6 million, reﬂecting an increased realised copper price 
and improved volumes.
Copper cathode production was 95,300 tonnes in 2010, a 5.7% increase 
compared with the 90,200 tonnes produced in 2009, partly reﬂecting the impact of 
the inclusion of a whole year of production from the ROM which contributed 19,200 
tonnes of cathode production in 2010. Operations at the Tesoro North-East open pit 
were temporarily suspended in August 2010, to allow geotechnical studies to be 
undertaken to ensure the safety of certain walls of that pit. During this suspension 
of operations the Tesoro plant processed ore from lower grade stockpiles in place 
of material from the North-East pit. After the completion of geotechnical studies 
mining resumed in some areas of the Tesoro North-East pit in November 2010. 
The plant throughput relating to the heap-leach operation averaged 26,400 
tonnes per day during 2010, largely in line with the 2009 throughput of 26,200 
tonnes per day. The average ore grade decreased to 1.10% in 2010, compared 
with 1.25% in 2009, reﬂecting the processing of material from the lower grade 
stockpiles in place of the ore from the North-East pit during the temporary 
suspension of that operation.

The average metallurgical recovery was also slightly lower at 71.7% (2009 – 
73.0%), due to the impact of lower grade feed to the plant. Production from the 
ROM processing of the Esperanza oxide cap was 19,200 tonnes during 2010. 
The ROM project entered into production during the second half of 2009, with 
production of 2,800 tonnes in that year, and reached full design capacity during 
the ﬁrst half of 2010. 
Realised copper prices at El Tesoro increased by 42.9% to 351.9 cents 
per pound compared with 246.3 cents per pound in 2009. This increase 
reﬂected the rise in the average LME copper price, which increased from 
an average of 234.2 cents per pound in 2009 to 342.0 cents in 2010. 
The increasing market prices during the course of 2010 resulted in positive 
provisional pricing adjustments of US$17 .4 million during the year. El Tesoro 
had minimal commodity hedging instruments in place during 2010, resulting in 
realised gains of just US$0.1 million during the year, compared with realised 
losses of US$20.0 million in 2009. Further details of the effects of commodity 
hedging instruments in place are given in the Financial Review under “Derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments” and in Note 25(e) to the ﬁnancial statements. 
Cash costs were 169.2 cents per pound in 2010, compared with 123.4 cents in 
2009. Cash costs during the ﬁrst half of 2010 averaged 146.6 cents per pound, 
but increased to 191.5 cents in the second half of the year, with the increase 
mainly due to the impact of the processing of lower grade stockpiles following 
the temporary suspension of operations in the Tesoro North-East pit. In addition, 
higher maintenance costs, the effect of the stronger Chilean peso and higher 
fuel and energy prices also contributed to the increase in costs, partly offset 
by lower sulphuric acid prices. 2009 also beneﬁted from temporary cost 
deferral measures.
Operating proﬁt at El Tesoro was US$386.6 million, compared with 
US$177 .9 million in 2009. The current year results include a credit of 
US$109.4 million from the reversal of the impairment originally recognised 
at El Tesoro in 2008, following a review undertaken in light of the current 
commodity environment. This amount has been recorded as an exceptional 
credit within operating expenses. Excluding this one-off credit, operating proﬁt 
was US$277 .2 million, 55.8% ahead of 2009. This increase in underlying 
operating proﬁt was due to the higher revenue as a result of the increased 
realised copper price, and improved volumes, partly offset by the increase in 
cash costs and higher depreciation. Depreciation in 2010 was US$75.1 million, 
compared with US$52.3 million in 2009, with the increase mainly reﬂecting 
increased depreciation relating to the Tesoro North-East pit. 
Capital expenditure in the year was US$27 .7 million, including US$2.9 million 
relating to the ﬁrst pre-stripping costs at the Mirador deposit. Capital expenditure 
is expected to increase during 2011, mainly due to remaining capital expenditure 
on the Mirador deposit (see page 31) of approximately US$42 million, and 
US$14 million relating to the construction of a solar thermal plant, to provide 
heat for the SX-EW plant, in addition to normal sustaining capital expenditure. 
For 2011, the initial forecast for cathode production is approximately 
96,000 tonnes. Production from the heap-leach operation is expected 
to be approximately 75,000 tonnes, with the ROM operation producing 
approximately 21,000 tonnes. For the heap-leach operation it is expected that 
Tesoro North-East pit will contribute approximately 21,000 tonnes in 2011, 
following the resumption of operations there in November 2010, and that the 
Mirador deposit will produce approximately 14,000 tonnes in the ﬁnal months of 
the year. The balance of production is expected to come predominantly from the 
Tesoro Central pit, with a small amount of higher-grade oxide ore from Esperanza 
also being processed through the heap-leach. Ore grades for the heap-leach 
operation are expected to decrease slightly to 1.06 % on average over the 
course of 2011 (2010 – 1.10%), although grades in the ﬁnal quarter of 2011 
are expected to increase as the higher grade production from the Mirador 
pit commences. 
The initial forecast for cash costs at El Tesoro for 2011 is approximately 161 
cents per pound, compared with the annual average of 169.2 cents during 2010. 
The costs during the second half of 2010 were unusually high given the need 
to process the lower grade ore stockpiles in place of the planned ore from the 
Tesoro North-East pit, and the resumption of normal operations will result in 
a decrease in costs in 2011, along with an expected reduction in the level of 
planned maintenance activity compared with 2010, although these factors 
will be partly offset by higher sulphuric acid prices. While costs are expected 
to average 161 cents over the course of 2011 as a whole, costs are likely to 
be higher than this average level during the ﬁrst months of the year as normal 
operations ramp-up again at Tesoro North-East, and conversely costs are likely 
to be lower than this average in the ﬁnal months of 2011 as the higher-grade 
Mirador ore begins to be processed. 
El Tesoro is continuing to work to identify further oxide deposits in the district 
surrounding the mine. As explained above, the Mirador deposit will allow the 
El Tesoro plant to run at close to capacity for the three-year period from 
2012 to 2014, with production of around 98,000 tonnes per year in that period. 
Thereafter, production is currently forecast to reduce as lower grade material is 
processed once again from the Tesoro Central and North-East pits. As detailed 
in the Sierra Gorda District section below, El Tesoro is conducting exploration 
and evaluation work to identify additional resource which could help to maintain 
production at closer to capacity levels.

Case study
Mirador at
El Tesoro
During 2010, El Tesoro approved the inclusion 
of additional material into its mine plan from the 
Mirador oxide deposit. The deposit, which is located 
approximately six kilometres east of Tesoro North-
East, contains reserves of 25.1 million tonnes of 
oxide ore at an average grade of 1.22%, compared 
with the average reserve grade of the Tesoro Central 
and North-East pits of 0.74%. 
Mirador, which also has sulphide potential, was identiﬁed by the Group in 
2008 through its ongoing exploration programme. During 2010 El Tesoro, 
which is 70% owned by the Group, paid US$350 million to the wholly-owned 
Antofagasta Minerals S.A., for the right to extract the oxide ores from the 
Mirador deposit. This intragroup transaction, which is eliminated in the 
consolidated Group results, was based on an independent valuation based 
on the estimated incremental net present value to El Tesoro of incorporating 
the oxide ores from Mirador into its mine plan. During the year El Tesoro 
put in place borrowing facilities of US$300 million to provide ﬁnancing for 
this payment.
Pre-stripping of the Mirador deposit commenced in December 2010. There is 
a limited amount of overburden above the deposit, and so only a comparatively 
low level of pre-stripping is required, which is expected to be completed during 
the ﬁrst nine months of 2011, with a total capital expenditure of approximately 
US$42 million. Production from Mirador is expected to commence in the ﬁnal 
quarter of 2011, with approximately 14,000 tonnes expected to be contributed 
to El Tesoro’s production in 2011. During the following three years from 2012 
to 2014, El Tesoro’s production is expected to come primarily from the Mirador 
pit. The relatively higher grade ore which will therefore be mined during this 
period should allow the El Tesoro plant to operate close to full capacity with 
production of around 98,000 tonnes per year during this period. The higher 
grade material is also expected to result in decreased costs during this 
three-year period. The incorporation of the Mirador reserves into the El Tesoro 
mine plan has resulted in an increase of the mine life from 2019 to 2022.  
 The Mirador deposit will allow the El Tesoro 
plant to run at close to capacity for the 
three-year period from 2012 to 2014, and is 
also expected to result in decreased costs. Operational Review

Michilla is a leachable sulphide and oxide deposit located in Chile’s Antofagasta 
Region, 1,500 km north of Santiago. It produces copper cathodes using a 
heap-leach and solvent-extraction electro-winning process. The ore which 
is processed by the Michilla plant comes from a variety of sources – from 
underground and open pit mines which are operated by Michilla itself, from other 
underground operations which are owned by Michilla and leased to third-party 
operators, and also material which is purchased from ENAMI, the Chilean state 
organisation which represents small and medium-sized mining companies. 
The price paid for material purchased from the third-party operators or from 
ENAMI is in some cases linked to the market copper price. 
Revenue at Michilla in 2010 was US$242.0 million, a 41.9% increase compared 
with 2009 revenue of US$170.5 million, as a result of a higher realised copper 
price, and a slight increase in volumes.
Total annual production in 2010 was 41,200 tonnes of copper cathodes, an 
increase on the prior year production of 40,600 tonnes. The increase reﬂected 
higher average ore grades, which offset a reduction in the plant throughput. 
Average ore grades were 1.03%, compared with average grades of 0.96% 
in 2009. Average plant throughput decreased slightly to 14,100 tonnes per 
day, compared with 15,100 tonnes per day in the prior year.
In December 2010 negotiations with the main labour union, representing 90% 
of Michilla’s workforce, were satisfactorily concluded early for a new 48-month 
labour agreement, commencing in January 2011.

33 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
The initial forecast for cash costs in 2011 is approximately 198 cents per pound. 
The increase compared with the 2010 costs of 183.8 cents is mainly due to 
the higher expected cost of purchasing ore from the third parties who lease 
and operate certain of Michilla’s underground mines, costs relating to the 
commencement of operations at the new Aurora open pit and higher sulphuric 
acid costs. The forecast does not include potential purchases of ore from 
ENAMI, the cost of which is often linked to the market price of copper. 
If such material continues to be purchased this could, particularly in a strong 
copper price environment, further increase 2011 cash costs through processing 
higher cost, but proﬁtable, materials.
Michilla’s mine plan currently runs until the end of 2012. Michilla is continuing 
with work to extend the mine plan beyond this point, including further drilling 
to allow the recategorisation of existing ore resources into reserves, and 
engineering studies to incorporate these reserves into an extended mine plan. 
It is likely that the mine plan will initially be extended to approximately 2014 
or 2015. In addition, exploration work continues to be undertaken at Michilla, 
which could identify further resources which could further extend the mine life, 
potentially to 2018.
The average realised copper price in 2010 was 263.8 cents per pound, 
34.8% higher than the 2009 realised price of 195.7 cents. This reﬂected the 
increase in average LME market prices over this period, with the average LME 
price in 2010 of 342.0 cents per pound being 46.0% higher than the 2009 
market average of 234.2 cents. The realised copper price was lower than the 
average LME price in both 2010 and 2009, mainly due to realised losses on 
copper hedging instruments. During 2010 realised losses of US$81.5 million 
were recognised in respect of instruments maturing during the year (2009 – loss 
of US$45.8 million). As a high cost operation Michilla has over recent years often 
hedged a signiﬁcant proportion of its production, in order to ensure a reasonable 
level of return even if market prices were to weaken considerably. In the year 
ended 31 December 2010, 32,000 tonnes of total production were hedged, 
which represented slightly under 80% of the total production of 41,200 tonnes. 
Michilla has in place hedging instruments in respect of 2011 and 2012 
production, again covering approximately 80% of expected production. 
Further details of the effects of commodity hedging instruments in place are 
given in the Financial Review under “Derivative ﬁnancial instruments” and in 
Note 25(e) to the ﬁnancial statements. 
Cash costs averaged 183.8 cents per pound during 2010, compared with 
157 .6 cents in 2009. The increase reﬂected the impact of the stronger 
Chilean peso, as well as the higher cost of ore purchased from ENAMI, the 
cost of which is often linked to the market price of copper, partly offset by 
lower sulphuric acid prices.
Operating proﬁt at Michilla was US$50.4 million, compared with US$21.7 million 
in 2009. The improved result reﬂected the increase in the realised copper price, 
partly offset by the higher cash costs and increased depreciation. 
The initial forecast for cathode production in 2011 is approximately 40,000 
tonnes. The majority of this production is expected to continue to come from 
the Lince open pit and the Estefania underground mine, but additional sources 
of material will become increasingly signiﬁcant to Michilla. Pre-stripping of the 
Aurora deposit commenced during the ﬁrst quarter of 2011, with production 
from the Aurora pit continuing to ramp-up during the year. Approximately 
2,500 tonnes of copper are expected to be produced from Aurora in 2011, 
but this is expected to increase to between 6,000 to 8,000 tonnes from 2012. 
There is also a substantial amount of low-grade spent ore deposited in spent 
ore pads at Michilla. This is material removed from the dynamic heap-leach 
pads after the primary leach cycle is complete. Preliminary testing has indicated 
that this material is capable of being re-leached on the dynamic leach pads. 
While this material is only likely to contribute approximately 1,000 tonnes of 
copper production in 2011, this could become an increasingly important 
source of material for processing through the Michilla plant. 
 It is likely that the mine plan will initially be 
extended to approximately 2014 or 2015, 
and continuing exploration work could 
identify further resources which could further 
extend the mine life, potentially to 2018. Operational Review
34 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Over its ﬁrst 10 years of operations Esperanza is expected to produce on average 
approximately 190,000 tonnes of payable copper in concentrate and 230,000 
ounces of payable gold annually, signiﬁcantly increasing total Group production 
by approximately 25%. The operation utilises innovative technology to minimise 
its environmental impact and to optimise efﬁciency. 
Esperanza is a copper-gold sulphide deposit located in Chile’s Antofagasta 
Region approximately ﬁve kilometres south of the Group’s El Tesoro mine. 
It produces copper concentrate containing gold and silver by-product credits 
through a conventional milling and ﬂotation process, with plant capacity 
of approximately 97 ,000 tonnes per day of ore throughput. The Esperanza 
deposit includes an oxide resource that is part of the overburden removed 
through pre-stripping and which, as explained in the El Tesoro section below, 
is processed by El Tesoro through both their main heap-leach operation and 
also a speciﬁc Run-of-Mine  (“ROM”) leaching operation. 
Construction was substantially completed by the ﬁnal quarter of 2010. 
Commissioning of the plant commenced in late November 2010, and the 
ﬁrst shipment of copper concentrate took place on 27 January 2011 from the 
port of Antofagasta. The major earthquake which occurred in Chile in February 
2010 had a number of indirect impacts on the Esperanza construction during the 
following months, impacting both the construction workforce and also a number 
of key supplies. Partly as a consequence of this, commissioning of the plant was 
marginally delayed compared with earlier forecasts which had envisaged the 
process commencing earlier in Q4 2010. Ramp-up of the plant will continue 
through the ﬁrst half of 2011, initially with one of the two ball mills in operation.

The dedicated Esperanza port facility is expected to be completed during the 
second quarter of 2011. 
As previously announced, the initial forecast for 2011 production is for 
approximately 159,000 tonnes of payable copper, reﬂecting an average ore 
grade of 0.59%, and 286,000 ounces of gold, based on an average grade 
of 0.37 grammes per tonne. The forecast is based on the assumption that full 
design capacity is reached at the start of the second quarter and ﬁnal production 
levels for the full year will depend on the precise timing of the completion of the 
ramp-up. The current expectation is that processing at the full design capacity 
of 97 ,000 tonnes per day should be achieved during the second quarter of 2011.
Also as previously announced, the current forecast is for cash costs before 
by-product credits to average approximately 146 cents per pound over the 
course of 2011. This average cost level reﬂects the high costs expected during 
the ramp-up process, when higher than normal costs are expected to be 
incurred. Unit cost ﬁgures, stated on the basis of cents per pound of payable 
copper production, will also depend on the actual copper and gold production 
volumes. The current forecast is for cash costs after by-product credits to 
average approximately 41 cents per pound during 2011 based on a gold price of 
approximately US$1,150 per ounce, with this estimated level of by-product credit 
reﬂecting the current forecast gold production volumes for 2011 detailed above.
Costs are expected to fall to a more typical level following the completion of the 
ramp-up process. The average cash costs before by-product credits over the 
ﬁrst 10 years of production are currently estimated at approximately 136 cents 
per pound. Cash costs after by-product credits are expected to average 41 cents 
per pound during 2011 based on a gold price of approximately US$1,150 per 
ounce, with this level of by-product credit partly reﬂecting the particularly high 
gold production expected in 2011. The gold by-product is expected to reduce 
cash costs on average during the ﬁrst 10 years of production by just over ﬁve 
cents per pound for every US$100 in the gold price.
Capital expenditure during 2010 was US$1,058.6 million, taking cumulative 
expenditure at 31 December 2010 to US$2,276 million. Including some 
ﬁnal costs expected in the early part of 2011, the total capital cost of the 
development is expected to be US$2.6 billion (including ﬁnancing costs). 
In addition to the ﬁnal construction expenditure to be incurred in 2011, sustaining 
capital expenditure in 2011 is expected to be in the region of US$40 million.
Esperanza currently has in place a two-year labour agreement which runs until 
May 2011, and during the early part of 2011 will be working to put in place a 
new agreement, which is likely to be of between three to four years’ duration.
Copper production is expected to increase from 2012 with a full year of operation 
at the maximum plant capacity, and on average over the ﬁrst 10 years of the 
mine’s life, Esperanza is expected to produce approximately 190,000 tonnes 
of payable copper annually. The gold grade expected for 2011 is relatively high 
compared to the longer-term average, and while grades are expected to remain 
at higher levels for the ﬁrst two to three years of operation, the average payable 
gold production over the ﬁrst 10 years is expected to be approximately 230,000 
ounces annually.
The mine is currently evaluating the potential to commence production of 
molybdenum from 2013, which would necessitate the construction of a 
separate molybdenum plant. This represents an acceleration on earlier plans 
which envisaged potential production of molybdenum from 2015, as further 
drilling and analysis along with the stronger molybdenum price have indicated 
that the mine should reach economic levels of molybdenum two years earlier 
than previously expected. 
The Group is continuing to review its signiﬁcant opportunities for longer-term 
growth, both from Esperanza’s own resource base, and also other Group 
deposits situated within the surrounding district. The Esperanza resources have 
increased signiﬁcantly during 2010, to 1,922.6 million tonnes with an average 
copper grade of 0.39% (2009 – 1,204.4 million tonnes with an average 
copper grade of 0.45%) following the updating of the resource block model to 
incorporate additional in-ﬁll drilling results. There is also signiﬁcant potential from 
the Telégrafo deposit, which is part of Esperanza’s existing property. The Sierra 
Gorda District section below provides more detail on the size and quality of this 
and other resources in the district, as well as the range of growth options which 
they bring to the Group’s operations in the district.

Commitment to training and employment for local communities
Esperanza has been committed from the outset of its development to providing 
training and employment opportunities for local communities. 
Almost 1,400 local people received training supported by Esperanza as part 
of this commitment. This included nearly 500 people who participated in 
foundation courses for mine operators and mine and plant maintenance. 
More than 270 apprenticeships were created by Esperanza, of which 
approximately 90% were ﬁlled by local people.
In total, approximately 60% of the mine’s total workforce is drawn from local 
communities. The mine has also focused on developing the employment of 
female workers, with women comprising 14% of the mine’s workforce, which 
is high by local industry standards. Esperanza’s achievement in this area was 
recognised by a special Presidential award for the development of good labour 
practices in respect of gender equality.  
Esperanza has been committed to developing the

Automation of the mining process
Water
The operation’s complete process, from the mine site, through the plant, to the 
dedicated port facility, can be monitored and controlled from one control room. 
The primary crusher is fully automated, controlled entirely from the central 
control room. Similarly, it is possible to operate the loading at the dedicated 
port facility remotely from the control room at the mine site. During the testing 
phase a parallel control room in Santiago was available to control and monitor 
the operations remotely. This automated process allows both more efﬁcient 
management and control of the operation, as well as allowing detailed analysis 
of the efﬁciency of all key processes, facilitating continual improvement in the 
efﬁciency of the operation.  
Esperanza is situated in the Atacama desert, one of the driest areas in the 
world, and water availability is one of the key constraints for the mining industry 
in the region. Esperanza was designed to use two innovative technologies to 
address this issue – the use of sea water, and the use of thickened tailings.
Esperanza will not consume any fresh water. All of its water requirements will 
be met through sea water, piped 145 kilometres from the coast, to an altitude 
of 2,250 metres. A small element of the mine’s water will be desalinated at two 
desalination units, located by the mine’s dedicated port facility and at the mine 
site, to provide the desalinated water required to wash the ﬁnal concentrate, 
and also to provide potable water for the mine’s workforce. However, 90% of 
the mine’s water usage will comprise non-desalinated sea water. The relevant 
mine infrastructure, such as the pipelines and plant equipment, has been 
specially engineered from the outset to be optimised for use with sea water. 
This is the largest copper project in the world to be designed for exclusive use 
of sea water. 
Esperanza will achieve efﬁcient waste management through a high-density 
thickened tailings deposit. This will be a global ﬁrst for a large-scale copper 
project. The main beneﬁt is that it will recover more water than a comparable 
conventional tailings system. Once deposited, the thickened tailings are more 
stable because they contain less water, and the desert conditions also allow 
them to solidify more quickly. The saline quality of the water in the tailings 
facilitates the formation of a stable crust that substantially reduces dust, 
further reducing the environmental impact. 
In recognition of this, Esperanza was awarded both the Avonni prize as one of 
the most innovative mining companies in Chile, and also received the Benjamín 
Teplizky prize in Chile, again for its innovative technology.   Operational Review

The Group has a portfolio of growth projects, which could provide signiﬁcant 
potential for future growth over the forthcoming years. Given the early-stage 
nature of these projects, their potential and timing is inherently uncertain, and 
so the following information is only intended to provide a high-level indication of 
potential opportunities. The Antucoya project is currently at feasibility stage, and 
given successful completion of that study and project approval, could potentially 
commence construction in late 2011 or 2012, which could result in ﬁrst 
production by early 2014. In the Sierra Gorda District a pre-feasibility study is

of the Caracoles deposit there is a signiﬁcant level of pre-stripping which 
would be required, which could potentially take three to four years to complete, 
but incremental production from these deposits could be possible from 
approximately 2016. At Los Pelambres a scoping study is under way to look 
at the longer-term possibilities for utilising its large resource base, which could 
potentially lead to a signiﬁcant increase in the scale of the operation later this 
decade. The Nokomis deposit is very promising, although this deposit, located 
in the United States, will require several years to undergo feasibility work and 
then environmental permitting before construction for a project could begin.

The Group continues to invest strongly in its early-stage exploration activities. 
The total exploration and evaluation expenditure in 2010 was US$99.0 million, 
which reﬂects a more than four-fold increase over the past ﬁve years.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group’s commitment to organic exploration has been rewarded over recent 
years through the major increase in the resource base. The total resource 
tonnage of the Group’s subsidiaries has increased more than four-fold over the 
past ﬁve years, from 3.2 billion tonnes in 2006 to 13.4 billion tonnes in 2010. 
During 2010 the total resource tonnage of the Group’s subsidiaries increased 
by 46%, from 9.2 billion tonnes in 2009 to 13.4 billion tonnes, following the 
proving-up of the resources relating to the Telégrafo and Caracoles deposits. 
Mineral resources (including ore reserves)
Of the 2010 expenditure, more than 40% related to the Sierra Gorda District, 
which is the Group’s primary area of focus for exploration in Chile.

A Operational Review
40 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
In May 2010 Antofagasta Minerals approved further expenditure of approximately 
US$70 million on growth options in the Sierra Gorda District for the period to the 
end of 2011, covering further exploration, the preparation of a pre-feasibility 
study for the district and for inﬁll drilling, geotechnical and metallurgical studies 
to support eventual feasibility studies at Telégrafo and Caracoles. During the 
second half of 2010 work has commenced on the pre-feasibility studies for these 
two deposits, which is expected to continue throughout 2011, potentially then to 
be followed by feasibility study work. 
The Telégrafo deposit is part of Esperanza’s existing property, and could be 
used to extend that mine’s life or increase the size of the operation. The Telégrafo 
deposit is owned through Minera Esperanza and hence the Group’s interest in 
the deposit is 70%. During 2010, US$14.6 million of exploration work was 
carried out at the deposit. The mineral resource at the Telégrafo deposit is 2,728 
million tonnes at an average copper grade of 0.35%, of which the sulphide 
deposit represents 2,677 million tonnes at 0.36% copper (plus 0.010% 
molybdenum and 0.10 g/tonne gold) and the oxide deposit represents 51 million 
tonnes at 0.21% copper. 
Sierra Gorda District 
The Group’s primary focus for exploration in Chile remains the Sierra Gorda 
District. The Group owns or controls a number of properties in the district, 
containing both sulphide and oxide resource. The existing Esperanza 
concentrator plant and the El Tesoro SX-EW operation mean that the Group 
is well placed to develop this area as a wider mining district.
During 2010 a total of US$41.3 million of exploration and evaluation 
expenditure was incurred in respect of this district (2009 – US$20.4 million), 
predominantly in respect of the Telégrafo and Caracoles deposits. Mineral 
resource estimates were completed during the year in respect of these two 
deposits, increasing the Group’s total mineral resources by 3.9 billion tonnes 
with an average copper grade of 0.38% (along with additional gold and 
molybdenum credits). These deposits represent nearly 30% of the total mineral 
resources of the Group’s subsidiaries. The resources in the district could 
potentially extend the life or scale of the existing Esperanza and El Tesoro 
plants, or allow additional stand-alone operations.

growth from further developing  
the areas around our existing  
asset base in Chile. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
41 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
The Caracoles deposit is situated approximately 10 kilometres south-east of 
Esperanza, and is 100% owned by the Group. During 2010, US$16.5 million 
of further exploration work was undertaken at the deposit. The mineral resource 
at Caracoles is 1,129 million tonnes at an average copper grade of 0.45%, of 
which the sulphide deposit represents 997 million tonnes at 0.45% copper (plus 
0.015% molybdenum and 0.18 g/tonne gold) and the oxide deposit represents 
132 million tonnes at 0.50% copper. Depending on the results of the ongoing 
pre-feasibility study it will be possible to evaluate whether the deposit could 
provide additional feed for the Esperanza plant, or support a stand-alone project. 
Given the depth of the deposit there is a signiﬁcant level of pre-stripping which 
would be required, which could potentially take three to four years to complete. 
This pre-stripping could provide oxide ore for processing by the El Tesoro plant.
During the second half of 2010 drilling work has continued around these 
deposits, in particular to ensure that areas which potentially could be used to site 
waste dumps or plant contain no economic mineralisation.
As discussed above in the El Tesoro section, in December 2010 El Tesoro 
commenced pre-stripping of the Mirador oxide deposit. Exploration work is also 
continuing on the Mirador sulphide deposit, with US$2.1 million of exploration 
expenditure incurred during 2010.
In addition to the above properties, a further US$8.1 million of exploration work 
was performed in the Sierra Gorda District during 2010 in respect of a number 
of other properties which the Group owns in the area, in particular the Llano-
Palaeocanal, Centinela and Polo Sur deposits. These deposits contain both 
sulphide and oxide mineralisation, and exploration work suggests that these 
deposits have the potential to contain between 450 to 690 million tonnes, 
with a corresponding average grade of between 0.54% and 0.44%.
Los Pelambres
Los Pelambres is continuing to review options for the longer-term development 
of the mine, especially given the size of the resource base, which at 5.8 billion 
tonnes is more than four times the ore reserve of 1.4 billion tonnes. 
A scoping study is in progress, looking at the opportunities to utilise this large 
resource base, focusing particularly on the key enablers of water supply, 
community engagement and environmental impact. The analysis is considering 
ﬁrstly opportunities to extend the mine life, as well as the potential for expanding 
the scale of the operation. Over recent years Los Pelambres has undertaken a 
number of incremental expansions to plant capacity. However, given both the size 
of the resource base now in place, and also the number of potential bottlenecks 
with existing mine, plant and related infrastructure which would need to be 
addressed in the case of further expansion, it is possible that the studies 
currently in process may indicate the rationale for a substantial increase in the 
scale of the operation. It is expected that work on the scoping study will continue 
through much of 2011, potentially to be followed by the commencement of a 
pre-feasibility study.
Michilla/Antucoya
Michilla
As detailed in the Michilla operations section above, Michilla is continuing with 
work in respect of its core resource base, to extend its current mine plan beyond 
2012. During 2010 a major drilling campaign progressed, with 493 drill holes 
completed, with a total of more than 86,000 metres of drilling.
In addition to the various deposits which are included within Michilla’s resource 
estimate, the Rencoret deposit has potential to eventually further supplement that 
resource base in the longer term. Exploration work suggests that this deposit has 
the potential to contain between 15 to 25 million tonnes, with a corresponding 
average grade of between 1.22% and 1.00%.
Antucoya
Antucoya is an oxide deposit located approximately 45 kilometres east of 
Michilla. The deposit is a large but low grade resource, with 1.5 billion tonnes 
of mineral resource at an average copper grade of 0.27% at a cut-off grade 
of 0.10%. 
A feasibility study is under way, evaluating the potential for a project producing 
approximately 80,000 tonnes of copper per year, with a 19-year mine life. The 
study envisages the operation would combine heap-leaching of ore on dynamic 
pads as well as Run-of-Mine  (“ROM”) leaching on permanent pads. While the 
deposit is low grade by historical standards for a greenﬁeld project, there are 
a number of compensatory factors. There is a relatively low level of pre-stripping 
required at the deposit, reducing the potential construction time and cost. 
The waste to ore ratio is also very favourable, at approximately 0.4 tonnes of 
waste to every tonne of ore, reducing the mine site costs of material extraction 
and movement. The nature of the mineralogy also results in a relatively short 
leaching cycle. Partly as a result of these factors, preliminary estimations are 
that the capital cost of the project could be approximately US$950 million, and 
that operating cash costs could be in the region of between 135 to 150 cents 
per pound.
Detailed work on the feasibility study was undertaken in the second half of 2010, 
with US$17 .8 million capitalised during the year in respect of the feasibility study. 
A test pit has been constructed allowing detailed metallurgical analysis to be 
performed, including test leaching of extracted ore on specially constructed leach 
pads at Michilla. The environmental impact assessment was submitted to the 
authorities in November 2010. It is expected that the feasibility study should 
be complete by mid-2011. Depending on the results of the study, and project 
approval, it is possible that construction could commence by the end of 2011. 
Given the low level of pre-stripping required at the deposit it is possible that 
construction could be completed within a two-year period, which could result 
in ﬁrst production by early 2014. Operational Review

per day plant, which would be capable of future expansions. The study indicates 
average annual production for the ﬁrst ﬁve full years of operation of approximately 
190,000 tonnes of copper and 270,000 ounces of gold, again on a 100% basis. 
Cash costs before by-product credits are estimated at approximately 140 cents 
per pound, with the gold credit reducing net cash costs by approximately 
6.5 cents for every US$100 in the gold price. 
Further progress on this project will be dependent on the grant of the mining 
lease, for which an application has been ﬁled on 15 February 2011, and 
successful conclusion of litigation which is currently in progress before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. The Supreme Court is currently hearing several 
constitutional petitions which, among other things, challenge the validity of the 
Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement from 1993 with the 
Government of Balochistan and Tethyan’s mining rights. On 3 February 2011, 
the Supreme Court issued an interim order providing, among other things, that 
the Government of Balochistan may not take any decision in respect of the grant 
or otherwise of a mining lease to the project company until the matters before 
the Supreme Court are decided. 
United States – Twin Metals – Nokomis deposit
On 21 July 2010 the Group signed a deﬁnitive Participation and Limited Liability 
Company Agreement pursuant to the legally binding Heads of Agreement (“HoA”) 
signed on 14 January 2010 with Duluth Metals Limited (“Duluth”), to acquire a 
40% interest in the project company Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”) 
which holds the Nokomis copper-nickel-platinum group metal (“PGM”) deposit 
Reko Diq 
The Group holds a 50% interest in Tethyan Copper Company Limited 
(“Tethyan”), its joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”). 
Tethyan’s principal assets are a 75% interest in the exploration licence 
encompassing the Reko Diq prospects in the Chagai Hills region of south-west 
Pakistan including the western Porphyries, and a 100% interest in certain 
other licences in the region. 
The mineral resource at Reko Diq is estimated at 5.9 billion tonnes with an 
average copper grade of 0.41% and an average gold grade of 0.22 g/tonne. 
The Group’s attributable share of this joint venture interest amounts to 
2.2 billion tonnes.
The Group’s 50% share of exploration and evaluation expenditure which has 
been expensed during 2010 was US$16.1 million (2009 – US$32.5 million). 
A total of US$120.7 million has been capitalised within intangible assets in 
respect of the value of the licences acquired in respect of the project, and 
US$20.2 million has been capitalised within property, plant and equipment, 
predominantly in respect of the costs of the feasibility study.
Work on the feasibility study and the environmental and social impact 
assessment study are both complete. A copy of the feasibility study has 
been delivered to the Government of Balochistan in accordance with the 
terms of the joint venture agreement between Tethyan and the Government. 
The feasibility study indicates potential capital costs for the project of 
approximately US$3.3 billion on a 100% basis, based on a 110,000 tonne

The third aspect of the Group’s 
strategy is to look for growth beyond 
the areas of its existing operations 
– both in Chile and internationally. 
The primary focus is on early-stage 
opportunities with the potential for 
large-scale development.

(“Nokomis”), located in the highly prospective Duluth Complex in north-east 
Minnesota, USA. The Group will fund a total of US$130.0 million of further 
exploration and feasibility study expenditure over a three-year period and has 
the option to acquire an additional 25% interest in Nokomis under certain 
conditions including the completion of the feasibility study. 
The deposit is situated in an established mining district, with signiﬁcant existing 
infrastructure in place. Duluth has published an NI 43-101 compliant resource 
estimate for the deposit, consisting of 550 and 274 million tonnes of indicated 
and inferred resource, respectively, with a combined copper grade of 
approximately 0.6% and a combined copper equivalent grade of approximately 
1.5% taking into account the nickel, platinum, palladium and gold content. 
US$10.9 million of exploration and evaluation expenditure was incurred by the 
Group during 2010 in respect of the project, including acquisition-related costs. 
Exploration drilling work is concentrated during the winter months, to minimise 
potential environmental impact, and so it is anticipated that further drilling will 
take place from the latter part of 2011 and early 2012. Work to date has also 
focused on initial stakeholder engagement, with local authorities and 
communities. The forecast expenditure for the project in 2011 is currently 
estimated at approximately US$50 million.
On 20 December 2010 the Group entered into arrangements with Duluth in 
connection with Duluth’s proposed acquisition of 100% of Franconia Minerals 
Corporation (“Franconia”). Following approval of the acquisition by Franconia’s 
shareholders and by the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, Duluth completed 
the acquisition on 7 March 2011. Franconia’s principal assets are a 70% interest 
in the Birch Lake Joint Venture (“BLJV”) which holds the Birch Lake, Maturi and 
Spruce Road copper-nickel-platinum and palladium deposits that are contiguous 
to the Nokomis deposit held through Twin Metals. Franconia announced in 
November 2010 its intention to increase its ownership at the Birch Lake Project 
to 82% under the terms of the BLJV Agreement. The offer valued Franconia at 
approximately C$77 million (approximately US$77 million). Duluth and 
Antofagasta agreed that following the proposed acquisition, Franconia’s assets 
will be transferred to Twin Metals. Subsequent to the year end, Antofagasta has 
contributed approximately C$30 million (approximately US$30 million) in cash to 
Duluth’s acquisition of Franconia in order to, in part, maintain the 40% and 60% 
interests of Antofagasta and Duluth, respectively, in Twin Metals. Following the 
completion of Duluth’s acquisition it is expected that Franconia’s assets will be 
transferred to Twin Metals during the ﬁrst half of 2011.
Other exploration and evaluation activities
The Group has continued with its extensive early-stage exploration activities 
beyond its existing core districts, both in Chile and internationally. In general, 
this is undertaken by the Group’s internal exploration team in those areas where 
the Group has historically had its deepest experience, namely Chile and Peru. 
Typically when the Group wishes to engage in early-stage exploration work 
outside of those areas it does so through partnerships with other companies 
already established in those locations. During 2010 the Group established an 
ofﬁce in Toronto, Canada, to support its continuing search for such opportunities.
During 2010 the Group’s internal exploration team continued to perform 
exploration work in Chile, in areas beyond the existing core locations of the Sierra 
Gorda, Los Pelambres and Michilla/Antucoya districts. As well as this internal 
exploration work in Chile, the Group also continued to fund work at Rio Figueroa, 
the exploration project located in the Atacama Region in which the Group holds 
a 30% stake. The combined expenditure on these exploration and evaluation 
activities in Chile during 2010 was US$9.8 million. In August 2010 the Group 
also entered into an earn-in agreement with a subsidiary of Codelco in respect 
of a prospect close to the Group’s own properties in the Sierra Gorda District.
The Group has continued to expand its portfolio of early-stage international 
exploration interests through a number of earn-in agreements. During 2010 
the Group incurred US$11.9 million of exploration and evaluation expenditure in 
respect of its international early-stage exploration activities. During the year the 
Group entered into agreements in Alaska in the United States and in Australia. 
Subsequent to the year end the Group entered into a further agreement in 
Sweden. Further details of these agreements are set out in Notes 32 and 39 
to the ﬁnancial statements. The Group’s portfolio of international earn-in 
agreements also includes projects in Spain and Eritrea. After evaluation of the 
results of the exploration activities to date, the Group decided during 2010 not 
to proceed further with its earn-in agreements in Zambia, Namibia and Peru.
Opportunities in geothermal and coal 
exploration and generation
The Group is also continuing with its exploration and development activities 
relating to geothermal and coal energy prospects. 
Energía Andina S.A, the joint venture between the Group and the Chilean 
state-owned Empresa Nacional del Petróleo (“ENAP”), is continuing with its 
activities for the exploration and development of geothermal energy prospects 
in Chile. Energía Andina has been granted 13 concessions to date, grouped into 
six projects, and is engaged in the bidding process to acquire a number of 
further concessions. 
Exploration activity to date has focused on surface exploration, with the Group’s 
share of Energía Andina’s exploration and evaluation expenditure during 2010 
being US$3.9 million. Exploration drilling is expected to commence in 2011. 
Depending on the results of this work, it is anticipated that drilling of the ﬁrst 
geothermal well could commence in late 2011, allowing feasibility work to be 
undertaken during 2012. 
Work is continuing on the potential underground coal gasiﬁcation (“UCG”) 
project at the Mulpun coalﬁeld, situated near Valdivia in southern Chile, along 
with the Group’s partner in the project Carbon Energy Limited (“Carbon Energy”) 
of Australia. In August 2010 the Group received environmental approvals for 
the ﬁrst stage of the project, which allows construction and operation of a pilot 
scheme including the ﬁrst UCG panel and on-site facilities, and engineering 
studies in relation to the trial project were undertaken in the second half of 
the year.  Operational Review

During 2010 a capital restructuring of Inversiones Hornitos took place, with 
the FCAB’s previous capital contributions being reduced by US$57 .2 million 
and replaced with loan ﬁnancing from the FCAB, with the FCAB contributing 
US$78.6 million of further loan ﬁnancing to Inversiones Hornitos during the year. 
The FCAB’s cumulative total investment in Inversiones Hornitos, in both equity 
and loans, was US$154.2 million at 31 December 2010.
The Antofagasta port, which is managed by the Group’s 30% associate 
investment Antofagasta Terminal Internacional S.A. (“ATI”) contributed 
US$1.9 million to Group results (2009 – US$1.5 million). ATI is a strategic 
investment for FCAB and complements its principal business as the main 
transporter of cargo within Chile’s Antofagasta Region. 
FCAB also owns Forestal S.A., which manages the Group’s forestry assets. 
Forestal’s two properties, Releco-Puñir and Huilo-Huilo, comprise 26,295 
hectares of native forest near the Panguipulli and Neltume lakes, in Chile’s 
Region de Los Lagos. During 2010, Forestal continued with its ongoing 
forestation, fertilisation and thinning programme to maintain these assets.

Combined turnover at the transport division was US$154.7 million, an 11.0% 
increase compared to the US$139.4 million achieved in 2009. This increase 
reﬂected tariff adjustments, partly due to rates indexed to inﬂation and fuel 
costs, as well as the higher volumes. As a result, operating proﬁt also 
increased, by 6.1% from US$41.3 million to US$43.8 million.
The FCAB holds a 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos S.A. (“Inversiones

In early 2011, an environmental application was submitted for the construction 
of a second desalination plant in the city of Antofagasta under the terms of the 
existing concession, to provide additional capacity for future growth in domestic 
and industrial demand. A decision to proceed with this project, if environmental 
permits are approved, could be taken later in 2011. The plant, which would have 
an estimated capacity of 1,000 litres per second, has an estimated cost of 
US$120 million and could come into operation by 2014.
ADASA is forecasting a slight increase in volumes in 2011. The Company’s 
revenues and proﬁts are predominantly in Chilean pesos, and will be impacted 
by the relative strength or weakness of that currency against the US dollar, the 
currency in which the Group reports its results. The regulated water business is

Combined domestic and industrial water sales in 2010 amounted to 
46.3 million cubic metres, an increase of 5.9% compared with the 2009 
volumes of 43.7 million cubic metres. This was principally due to a 6.3% 
increase in demand from domestic clients and a 4.8% increase in demand 
from industrial customers. Water volumes are mainly sourced by surface rights 
as well as the desalination plant in the city of Antofagasta which was acquired 
during 2009 and which is now operating at capacity.
Turnover in 2010 was US$92.4 million, a 10.5% increase compared with 
2009. This improvement largely reﬂected the increase in volumes outlined

1. Social Responsibility. To build relationships of trust and mutual beneﬁt 
with stakeholders by taking action in three areas:
 > Responsible behaviour – The Group will prioritise the health and safety of 
employees and contractors, maintain a beneﬁcial work environment, minimise 
negative impacts on society, engage with key stakeholders and monitor 
progress against commitments.
 > Risk management – The Group will seek to identify, minimise and manage 
socio-political risks and be prepared to professionally manage any crises 
or incidents that occur.
 > Developing local human capital – The Group will seek to contribute to local 
development in the communities near its sites through job creation and local 
sourcing, and by supporting local education. The Group will seek to implement 
initiatives to improve local quality of life and support the development and 
growth of other economic activities. 
2. Environmental Responsibility. To protect the environment and natural 
resources by taking action in three areas:
 > O p erational ef ﬁ c iency – including managing tailings and other waste, 
water, electricity, fuel consumption and land use.
 > Controlling environmental impacts – including air and water quality, 
water availability, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions and 
environmental incidents.
 > Environmental beneﬁts – including providing environmental education, 
using renewable energy, enhancing biodiversity, protecting cultural heritage 
and developing beneﬁcial new technologies.
The Group is working to embed sustainability issues into management systems 
and decision making to ensure delivery of its strategy. See Management Systems 
and Stakeholder Engagement on page 48.
Material issues, 
risks and opportunities
The Group’s strategy focuses on the risks and opportunities that are most 
material to its business and its stakeholders. These are identiﬁed through its risk 
management and engagement processes, see below. The sustainability issues 
currently considered to be most material to the Group are:

Risk Mitigation
An operational incident which damages 
the environment could affect the Group’s 
relationships with local stakeholders and 
our reputation, and ultimately undermine 
its social licence to operate and to grow.
A comprehensive approach to incident 
prevention has been put in place. 
Relevant risks have been mapped and 
are monitored. The Group approach includes 
raising awareness among employees and 
providing training to promote operational 
excellence.
Water is a strategic resource for the Group’s 
mining operations and water scarcity is a 
particular risk to projects located in dry 
areas such as the Atacama desert.
The Group has pioneered the use of sea water 
in Chile and strives to ensure maximum 
efﬁciency in the use of it, achieving high rates 
of reuse and recovery. Esperanza is the ﬁrst 
major operation in Chile to use untreated sea 
water on a large scale.
Lack of compliance with newly introduced 
environmental regulations.
New and proposed legislation is monitored 
to enable the Group to anticipate, mitigate 
or reduce negative impacts to our operations.
Failure to identify social and environmental 
risks that can impact the viability of 
new ventures. 
New investments are now subject to a social 
due diligence process as well as economic 
and environmental analysis.
Effective management of social and 
environmental issues reduces costs and 
risks to our business, supports our 
reputation, underpins our reputation with 
key stakeholders and helps us to maintain 
our social licence to operate and grow. Operational Review

Corporate sustainability governance 
The Board has put in place procedures and management structures (including 
risk management procedures) at Group and business unit level to ensure the 
implementation of its sustainable development principles and AMSA’s social 
and environmental strategy. These arrangements are part of the overall Group 
governance arrangements described in the Corporate Governance Report.
The Directors’ responsibilities, including those relating to risk management 
and control, are described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
The Corporate Sustainability Committee was established in 2008 and has 
three members: Mr. J-P Luksic, the Group Chairman, and Non-Executive 
Directors Mr. G S Menéndez and Mr. R F Jara (see Directors’ biographies 
on page 70). The committee met once in 2010. 
Reporting
The Group reports its sustainability performance through a number of channels 
including this Annual Report and the Group’s Sustainability Report. The Group’s 
two largest mines, Los Pelambres and El Tesoro, also publish annual site reports. 
Antofagasta Minerals provides information for the Mining Social and 
Environmental Report published by the Chilean Mining Council, a national 
industry organisation.
A new task force was established in 2010 to oversee reporting of the Group’s 
sustainability performance. Its members include deputy managers from the 
business units as well as key functions such as human resources, environment, 
external affairs, operations, ﬁnance and audit. The task-force will help to improve 
the quality and consistency of reporting among different business units and 
functions and raise sustainability awareness across the Group. 
Stakeholder engagement
The Group recognises the importance of stakeholder engagement at the local, 
national and international levels. Regular dialogue helps to identify and address 
sustainability risks and opportunities and to build strong relationships with key 
stakeholders based on trust and mutual beneﬁt. It helps us to avoid conﬂict 
and contributes to the long-term success of the business. 
The Group has identiﬁed its key stakeholders as: investors, employees and 
contractors, communities, local and national governments and regulators, 
and the media. 
In 2010, regular meetings with key investors were held as well as a series 
of interviews with responsible investors to get feedback on the Group’s 
approach to sustainability issues. The Group also participated in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project. 
The Group interacts with communities near its sites at all stages of project 
development and operation. The mining division also conducts an annual 
employee perception survey. The results are reviewed by senior management 
who develop action plans to respond to key ﬁndings. An annual reputation 
survey was conducted where the views of social and political leaders, local 
communities, employees and contractors were noted. The 2010 results will 
be summarised in its Sustainability Report 2010.
ADASA, the water business was included in the annual customer surveys 
conducted by SISS, the regulator of the sanitary services industry. This assessed 
issues such as water quality, customer service, billings and service continuity. 
Management systems
AMSA uses an Assessment of Environmental Performance (“AEP”) tool to 
monitor progress against its performance indicators. These cover operational 
efﬁciency, impact control and environmental beneﬁts. The Group will further 
strengthen the AEP this year and add more information on how environmental 
beneﬁts can be generated. The Group is also developing an Assessment of 
Social Performance tool that includes performance indicators on issues such 
as health and safety, employee development and diversity, stakeholder 
relationships, grievance procedures and community investment.
Each operation uses these frameworks to set its own goals reﬂecting local 
priorities. Key environmental indicators are now included in the monthly 
performance reports submitted by the mining businesses, and are reviewed 
by AMSA’s environmental manager. The Group plans to integrate key social 
indicators into these reports during 2011.

The Group produced a Corporate Environmental Best Practices Handbook that 
contains the key frameworks and standards, including those of the International 
Finance Corporation and International Council on Mining and Minerals, 
relevant to the exploration, construction, operation and closure stages of 
mining operations. It aims to ensure a consistent approach to environmental 
management and decision making across the business. The Handbook will be 
rolled out in 2011. 
The Group has achieved accreditation to the international management 
standards ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and OHSAS 18001 at a number of our sites. 
See table below. During 2011, it plans to achieve accreditation to ISO 14001 
at Esperanza’s port facility (located in Michilla), with a view to extending it to 
the rest of Esperanza in future.

Audit and performance assessment
Regular internal and external audits are used to assess performance and 
implementation of our management systems and our compliance with the law 
in regard to labour, social security and occupational health issues as well as 
employment standards. 
External auditors are commissioned to assess contractor compliance with our 
safety, human rights and labour standards. This includes Group policies on fair 
wages, collective bargaining, paid overtime and vacations, and those prohibiting 
child labour and forced labour.
During 2010, independent external auditors assessed environmental 
performance at each of the operations. They identiﬁed and classiﬁed a number 
of risks and made recommendations for improvement. The operations have 
developed action plans to implement these recommendations. Improvements 
have included the introduction of additional safety measures to prevent water 
pollution at the port in Punta Chungo and new measures to reduce dust 
emissions and protect worker safety at Tesoro and Michilla.
Activity in 2010
Safety
Protecting the safety of employees, contractors and local communities is a 
priority for the Group. The Group focuses on identifying, mitigating and managing 
the safety risks inherent in its different operations and development projects. 
The Group requires all contractors to comply with its Occupational Health 
and Safety Plan. 
The Group’s goal is to create a safety culture through regular training and 
awareness campaigns for employees and contractors. It also aims to reach 
workers’ families and local communities particularly on issues of road safety. 
Antofagasta Minerals has a team of safety experts that train and supervise 
workers and contractors. All new workers, contractors and visitors must 
complete a health and safety induction course before entering one of the 
Group’s mining operations. Employees and contractors must also attend 
refresher workshops on our safety policies and procedures at least every other 
year. The Group operates personal identiﬁcation systems for machinery, so 
that it can only be operated by authorised and appropriately trained personnel. 
All facilities have been constructed to withstand the impact of earthquakes 
and evacuation plans have been put in place.
Contractor safety practices are monitored through monthly audit processes. 
Contractors are required by law to establish worker-employer accident 
prevention committees.
As well as operational safety, Antofagasta Minerals focuses on road safety 
training and awareness to prevent transport accidents. Road transportation 
contracts include strict requirements on safety. Compliance with standards 
is monitored through speed controls and random breathalyser tests. 
All incidents are investigated and action plans put in place to prevent recurrence. 
This may include: redesigning procedures and/or maintenance programmes, 
revising equipment control, protection and blockage systems and providing 
increased training for workers. 
Safety and health management systems are established across the Group, 
and the majority of its mining operations and the Railway are certiﬁed to OHSAS 
18001. Los Pelambres is also making certiﬁcation to OHSAS 18001 a 
requirement for contractors and is helping them to achieve this. 
The Board has a clear target of zero fatalities and considers any fatality to 
be unacceptable. In response to the four fatalities at Los Pelambres in 2009, 
Los Pelambres introduced changes that link workers’ remuneration to safety 
performance. 25% of the workers’ bonus is now awarded based on whether 
the site’s lost time injury frequency target has been met. Operational Review

The management systems put in place by the operations have allowed the 
Group’s indicators to remain stable and with a tendency to decrease, despite 
the operations’ sustained growth and growing complexity of processes that have 
augmented the demand on structures, systems and people. This effort has been 
recognised by the Mining Ministry who in 2010 granted Minera Esperanza the 
“Benjamín Teplizky” annual prize on excellency in environmental, health and 
safety management. It must be noted that through 2009 and most of 2010, 
this site was under construction, a stage normally associated with an increase 
in safety risks.
Nevertheless, the two fatal accidents in 2010 emphasise the need to continually 
improve the system despite improvements in standards to date. In order to 
achieve this, the mining operations plan to introduce global operational excellency 
programmes combined with risk management models that help make 
preventive actions more effective.
The Board deeply regrets the death of two contractors at Los Pelambres during 
2010. Following these incidents further safety training and awareness raising 
has  been provided for workers. The Group audited relevant systems at 
Los Pelambres and inspected all other facilities using similar systems. 
Protecting workers’ and contractors’ health is also a priority. As well as 
implementing high standards on issues such as dust control and the use of 
protective equipment, the Group provides a yearly preventative health check 
for workers and runs programmes on issues such as healthy eating, combating 
stress and smoking cessation. Many of its operations provide gyms and other 
sporting facilities for workers and offers healthy eating options in cafeterias. 
The Group’s lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) was an average of 
1.9 injuries per million hours worked in 2010 compared with 2.8 the 
previous year (see above).

Employment
Training and development
There is a growing talent shortage in Chile, making it more difﬁcult and 
expensive to recruit and retain skilled employees. This particularly affects 
the mining industry, which may soon experience a shortfall in the number 
of qualiﬁed mining professionals available for new projects. The Group is 
participating in a survey commissioned by the Mining Council to obtain more 
detailed data on this issue. 
The Group increased its focus on training and development during 2010 to 
ensure it continues to develop the skills and expertise the business needs. 
This included:
 > The launch of the Antofagasta Minerals management diploma in partnership 
with the Adolfo Ibanez University School of Business. This is designed to help 
trainees, ﬁrst-time managers, middle managers and senior managers develop 
their leadership capabilities and was completed by 120 employees.
 > A graduate trainee programme was completed by 15 graduates, most of 
whom have been offered full-time positions with the business. We will expand 
the programme to 30 graduates in 2011.
 > The new Leaders for Change two-day workshop, completed by 30 leaders 
and potential leaders in 2010. 
Labour relations
The Group aims to build constructive relationships with employees and the 
13 labour unions that represent them, and to resolve any issues that arise 
through regular dialogue. This contributes to the productivity and efﬁciency of 
our business and helps us to avoid the disputes and strikes that have affected 
much of the Chilean mining industry in recent years. 
Collective agreements are in place at all mining operations covering 
remuneration as well as terms and conditions of employment. There were 
two collective bargaining processes in 2010 with unions at Los Pelambres 
and Michilla. The negotiations were successful and new contracts were agreed 
for the maximum period allowed under Chilean law, well ahead of the expiration 
of the previous agreements. 
Contractors made up a signiﬁcant proportion of the workforce of the Group’s 
mining division in 2010. The Group requires its contractors to meet high 
employment standards in line with our own. This includes offering a minimum 
wage that exceeds legal requirements and passing on a portion of any bonuses 
they receive from Antofagasta to their employees. Their approach is monitored 
through the Group’s annual performance agreement system and regular audits. 
There were no labour disputes and no strikes among our employees or 
contractors during 2010. The operations received a positive rating in the 
compliance audits conducted by the government agency responsible for 
monitoring compliance with Chile’s labour laws. Audits cover issues such as 
health and safety and remuneration. 
The Group complies with legal requirements relating to employment in Chile, 
including those concerning child labour, discrimination and equal opportunity. 
As in previous years, no cases of human rights breaches were identiﬁed in 2010.
Diversity
The Group is committed to equal opportunities in all areas of employment 
including recruitment, employee development and remuneration. Data on gender 
diversity will be available in the Group’s Sustainability Report. The Group has 
introduced a number of initiatives to increase representation of women including 
a training plan for local women near to the El Tesoro and Esperanza mines. 
Women account for 14% of the workforce at Esperanza, compared with the 
national average for the mining industry of 6%. 
Internal communication
The Group aims to keep employees informed about the business through a range 
of channels including the intranet, newsletters, bulletin boards and social events. 
The Group seeks feedback from employees in our mining division through regular 
employee surveys. In response to the ﬁndings of our 2010 survey we will be 
focusing on training team leaders to give feedback to employees and introducing 
new systems for recognising employee achievements. 
The Group has introduced a number 
of initiatives to increase representation 
of women, including a training plan for 
local women near to the El Tesoro and 
Esperanza mines. Operational Review

Engaging with indigenous communities
Our Mulpun coal gasiﬁcation project is located adjacent to a Mapuche community. 
This is the ﬁrst time a Group project has been located next to an indigenous 
community. We have taken a proactive approach to engagement and, to date, 
this has proved successful. The Mapuche community has not opposed 
development of the site and have become willing to engage with us. 
Our approach at Mulpun has included demonstrating our goodwill by providing 
information on the project from its earliest stages, before applying for 
environmental approval.
We have also launched a number of projects to bring sustained beneﬁts to local 
people. This has included bringing electricity to the community for the ﬁrst time. 
We have ﬁnanced and overseen the installation and also educated local families 
on how to use energy efﬁciently and how to budget for their electricity bills. 
We are using our experiences at Mulpun to inform our approach to engagement 
with native communities in other locations.
Community relations 
and engagement
The Group’s businesses make a signiﬁcant contribution to economic 
development but it recognises that mining operations can also negatively 
impact local communities. It seeks to maximise our positive contribution 
and to minimise negative impacts, as well as fostering good relations with 
the communities near its sites through regular dialogue. This helps to avoid 
conﬂict, contributes to the efﬁcient running of operations and helps protect 
the Group social licence to operate and to grow. 
The Group engages with local stakeholders at our sites and development 
projects, in a variety of ways including through face-to-face meetings, 
newsletters and radio broadcasts. It often establishes joint community-
company committees to address speciﬁc issues such as air quality, 
water availability or site closures. 
The Group respects the culture, customs and values of indigenous groups. 
For details of our approach to engagement with indigenous communities, 
see case study. 
The Group conducts regular surveys to get feedback from local people and 
to help us better understand their views. More details are available in the 
sustainability reports of Los Pelambres and Tesoro operations. 
Ethical conduct 
The Group is committed to meeting high ethical standards in its work. The 
Ethics Committee oversees approach, monitors compliance with the Group’s 
policies and investigates any reports of suspected unethical conduct. The 
Committee is made up of the Vice-Presidents of Risk, Human Resources and 
Corporate Affairs and its work is overseen by the Audit Committee. On issues 
relating to the mining division, it reports to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of 
Antofagasta Minerals. 
The Group has an Ethics Code which applies to all its operations and projects 
in Chile and abroad. It emphasises the Board’s commitment to carry out 
business in a responsible and transparent manner. It sets standards on a 
range of issues including respect for human rights, local customs and values 
and the rights of neighbouring communities, as well as the Group’s procedure 
for identifying and managing potential conﬂicts of interest. It demands honesty, 
integrity and responsibility from all employees and contractors. 
Employees may report any unethical behaviour, anonymously if necessary, 
via the Group’s intranet site. There were no reported cases of suspected 
misconduct that required investigation by the Ethics Committee during 2010. 
During 2010 further revisions were made to the Code and other internal 
control procedures to ensure compliance with Chile’s new relevant legislation. 
An updated code is expected to be rolled out in 2011.

Supporting communities affected by the Chilean earthquake
The earthquake and tsunami which shook the central-south zone of Chile in 
February 2010 devastated the coast of the regions of Maule and Bio-Bio. 
Five days after the earthquake, Antofagasta Minerals had a debris clearing team 
and equipment working in the severely affected town of Curepto, in Maule region. 
Simultaneously, it engaged with the authorities to offer support for the 
reconstruction and established a US$10 million recovery fund and the 
management expertise and standards used in its large mining projects 
to implement and run the scheme.
The joint decision was to invest the fund in the recovery of the infrastructure used 
by local artisanal ﬁshing in Maule, an important source of revenue for the area. 
Antofagasta Minerals’ Coastal Route project is supporting the recovery of artisanal 
ﬁshing and using the redevelopment as an opportunity to further develop local 
tourist infrastructure. As well as a US$10 million donation, we are applying our 
project-management expertise, and the standards and practices used in our large 
mining projects to implement and run the scheme. This has included working in 
partnership with key stakeholders and promoting the involvement of local people, 
as well as integrating sustainable solutions for energy use and waste management 
into the project design.
Both the public (national, local and regional authorities) and the private sectors 
were involved in the design and implementation of this initiative. The Chilean 
Architects’ Association and World Wildlife Fund WWF advised on the 
reconstruction of coastline ﬁshing coves to ensure their sustainability and to 
incorporate improvements that will add environmental value. Local communities 
and organisations were given opportunities to review the project plans.
After nearly one year of work, 190 ﬁshermen have received new boats and/or 
engines through a support programme implemented jointly with government 
agencies. Along the 160 km coastline, six small ports have been rebuilt, including 
community centres, warehouses and restrooms. New restaurant infrastructure has 
been developed to support the tourist industry, capable of servicing 1,000 tourists 
per day, and 141 people trained to work in them. 
During 2010, 11 members of the Caimanes community initiated a hunger strike 
in the context of this litigation demanding a number of measures including 
ﬁnancial demands. The strike ended without incident in December 2010 
without ﬁnancial settlements or impact to the health of the strikers. 
Los Pelambres maintained open dialogue with the community and authorities 
throughout the incident. The Group strongly believes it has taken all appropriate 
steps at the Mauro tailings dam both in terms of environmental and community 
measures both during construction and operation. The construction of the dam 
was developed in accordance with all legal and administrative requirements 
and complies with international standards of design and operation.
El Mauro tailings dam
The Mauro tailings dam, for which environmental permission was received 
in 2004, is located 12 kilometres from the town of Caimanes which has a 
population of 700 people. In 2008, when the construction of the dam was 
in its ﬁnal stages, Los Pelambres entered into binding settlements in respect 
of litigation relating to the tailings dam which had been initiated after the 
environmental impact study had been approved and which enabled 
construction to be completed. In December 2008, after operation of the dam 
had commenced, Los Pelambres became aware of further legal proceedings 
that had been initiated by further members of the Caimanes community, which 
seek to prevent the operation of the dam. A number of these proceedings have 
since been rejected by the relevant courts. 
 Five days after the earthquake Antofagasta 
Minerals had a team working in the severely 
affected town of Curepto. Simultaneously it 
established a recovery fund, and provided 
management expertise to implement and 
run the scheme. Operational Review
54 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Environment
The Group recognises the environmental impacts of its mining operations and 
aims to reduce these as far as possible during the development, operation and 
closure of its sites. When impacts are unavoidable, it strives to mitigate and 
compensate them. This supports relationships with local communities and 
contributes to operational efﬁciency, reduces costs and ensures compliance 
with legislation. 
The Group’s key environmental impacts include water use, water quality, 
air quality, waste, biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions. Antofagasta 
Minerals uses an Assessment of Environmental Performance (“AEP”) tool to 
monitor progress against its performance measures. See page 48.
The Group aims to raise the environmental awareness of employees through 
training and communication. During 2010 it held a series of events around 
World Water Day and Chile’s Environment Month and distributed a bi-monthly 
newsletter with updates on its progress and tips to help employees protect 
the environment. 
Energy and climate change
Climate impact
The Group recognises the need to conserve energy and develop a strategic 
response to climate change. This will protect the business from future cost 
increases associated with energy supply and carbon emissions reduction. 
The Group intends to play its part in helping Chile achieve its target to reduce 
national greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020. 
Operations are already implementing energy efﬁciency projects and 
investigating opportunities to use renewable energy where possible. 
During 2011 Antofagasta Minerals will undertake a study of the potential 
effects of climate change on its operations and develop a climate change 
policy that will be presented to the Board. 
In line with the agreements reached at the UN Climate Change Conferences, 
Chilean law demands that the proportion of energy generation from renewable 
sources should rise from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2024. Antofagasta Minerals is 
exploring a number of new renewable energy alternatives to increase the 
proportion of renewable energy in its total energy supply. Currently, renewable 
energy accounts for around 10% at the Los Pelambres site. Data is not 
currently available for other sites. At the end of 2010 El Tesoro issued a tender 
for a major solar thermal plant to provide heat to the electro-winning plant and 
reduce dependence on diesel. A decision on whether to progress with the 
project is expected early in 2011. 
The Group measures and manages its CO2 emissions according to the GHG 
protocol of the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”). In the latest year for which 
CDP data is available, 2009, Group total CO2 emissions were 1.12 million 
tonnes. Further data will be published in the Group’s Sustainability Report.
Contribution to socio-economic development
The Group makes a positive contribution to socio-economic development 
through the taxes paid, the employment created, the products and services 
purchased and through the social investments made to enhance the 
development of local human capital. 
The Group’s Social Strategy aims to provide training and other support to help 
local people access employment opportunities at our sites. For example, 
Esperanza has committed to hire at least 30% of construction and operation 
workers from the Antofagasta Region. Its approach includes training to give 
800 residents the skills they need in areas such as safety, quality, environment 
and community relations to work at the mine. 
Antofagasta Mineral’s mining companies voluntarily elected to accept 
amendments to the Chilean mining tax introduced in 2010. These were 
established to contribute to the ﬁnancing of reconstruction costs following the 
severe earthquake which affected the country in 2010. In exchange for waiving 
protection under existing invariability agreements for a three-year period from 
2010–2012, the companies will be granted an additional stability period of six 
years at the end of their existing stability agreements, during which any 
connected projects will also beneﬁt from tax invariability. Further details are 
given in the Financial Review on page 63. 
Community investment
The Los Pelambres Mining Foundation continued to support initiatives in the 
areas of education, water resources and productive development during 2010.

The Group monitors water consumption and efﬁciency at each operation. 
Water use levels remained steady this year, except at Los Pelambres where 
levels went up due to an increase in production. Data on water consumption 
by source and water use efﬁciency will be published in the Sustainability 
Report 2010. 
ADASA is seeking to increase the supply of desalinated water for domestic 
consumption in the Antofagasta Region to 50%. 
Environmental incidents and ﬁnes
The Group aims to prevent environmental incidents at our sites. Chilean 
environmental law provides a wide deﬁnition of environmental impacts, so 
in 2010, the Group developed a corporate protocol for identifying, classifying 
and reporting incidents at its mining sites, to help address these and 
prevent recurrences. 
The following environmental incidents were reported in 2010. 
There was an oil leak from a tank at El Tesoro. The contaminated soil was 
removed and disposed of according to regulations. An improvement plan was 
developed which included building a containment platform, improving loading 
and unloading procedures and reviewing the leak control system.
At Los Pelambres, there was a tailings spill in the Polcura ravine due to a 
drainage gutter becoming blocked. The ravine has been thoroughly cleaned 
and the gutter has been strengthened to prevent a recurrence. 
Also at Los Pelambres, there was a water discharge from the mine tunnel 
evacuation system into the Borrega ravine. The operation informed the local 
authorities, the neighbouring Cuncumen community and the local channel 
irrigation association (a community organisation which ensures the fair 
distribution of water resources) who investigated the incident. The local 
water courses were monitored and water quality was found not to have been 
affected. The affected area has been thoroughly cleaned and the water 
evacuation system was reviewed.
The Group was ﬁned US$35,240 in 2010 in relation to a tailings spill at 
Los Pelambres in February 2009 which affected the Polcura ravine. 
Energy security
Antofagasta Minerals continues to work towards securing alternative 
energy supplies and establishing longer-term agreements and contracts 
with energy suppliers.

stations from 2012 might result in a shortage of supply in the Antofagasta 
Region if older plants are closed which could impact market prices for energy.
Energía Andina S.A, the joint venture between the Group and the Chilean 
state-owned Empresa Nacional del Petróleo (“ENAP”), is continuing with its 
activities for the exploration and development of geothermal energy prospects 
in Chile. Energía Andina has been granted 13 concessions to date, grouped 
into six projects, and is engaged in the bidding process to acquire a number 
of further concessions. Exploration activity to date has focused on surface 
exploration, and drilling is expected to commence in 2011. Depending on the 
results of this work, it is anticipated that drilling of the ﬁrst geothermal well 
could commence in late 2011, allowing feasibility work to be undertaken 
during 2012. 
Work is continuing on the potential underground coal gasiﬁcation project 
(“UCG”) at the Mulpun coalﬁeld, situated near Valdivia in southern Chile, 
along with the Group’s partner in the project Carbon Energy Limited 
(“Carbon Energy”) of Australia. In August 2010 the Group received 
environmental approvals for the ﬁrst stage of the project, which allows 
construction and operation of a pilot scheme including the ﬁrst UCG panel 
and on-site facilities, and engineering studies in relation to the trial project 
were undertaken in the second half of the year. 
Water resources
The Group’s mining operations use signiﬁcant volumes of water. Water use is 
a particularly important issue for the Group due to its location in areas of water 
scarcity. The Group needs to use water efﬁciently and recycle it where possible 
to ensure its continued availability for our operations and local communities. 
The Group must also protect the quality of fresh water sources near its sites. 
All mines have water management plans in place to reduce and monitor water 
use and ensure that emissions of wastewater meet relevant quality standards. 
To reduce demand on fresh water sources, Michilla has pioneered the use 
of non-desalinated sea water in its operations and a similar system will be 
implemented at Esperanza where use of thickened tailings also increases 
water recovery, see page 37 . Los Pelambres uses a system of industrial water 
recirculation which recycles a high proportion of water used in its processes. 
El Tesoro operates a similar system. 
The Group is reviewing whether implementation of the water accounting 
framework developed by the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University 
of Queensland would help to better audit Group water consumption.  Operational Review
56 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
A sustainable approach to the site closure
When closing Group facilities we aim to work closely with local people to ﬁnd 
safe and sustainable solutions. For example, in 2010 Los Pelambres began the 
process of closing a tailings dam at Los Quillayes. 
The Group has worked closely with local people since 2008 to jointly develop 
a closure plan for the site. This includes an innovative remediation programme, 
known as phytostabilisation. The 400 hectare site is being covered with a thick 
layer of topsoil and planted with native species. This will reduce the risk of 
pollution and leaching due to wind or water erosion. Over the life of the project, 
estimated to be 10–15 years, it will also create employment opportunities for 
local people in planting, irrigation and cultivation.
Waste
Mining operations produce signiﬁcant amounts of hazardous and non-
hazardous waste including waste rock, spent ore and tailings (waste from 
processing ore and concentrates). Hazardous waste consists mainly of 
used oils, rags and containers with the remains of oil, lead-contaminated 
sediment and used batteries. Waste is also an issue for the transport and 
water businesses. 
The Group aims to reduce the amount of waste it produces, to reuse resources 
where possible and to dispose of waste according to legal requirements. 
Tailings
It is particularly important that tailings are managed safely to prevent leakages 
which could impact water quality. The failure of a tailings dam could have a 
major impact on local communities, the environment and the Group’s workers. 
All dams are designed to resist extreme weather and high-magnitude 
earthquakes. They are carefully maintained and monitored during use. 
Taking advantage of its geographical location, at our Esperanza mine we have 
introduced “thickened tailings” technology. This will reduce water consumption 
and the risk of soil contamination, and mean that the tailings are more stable 
during operations and after the mine has closed. It will also reduce dust levels. 
At the Los Pelambres mine, the Mauro tailings dam is now operational, 
which will provide enough waste disposal capacity for the remaining 
26 years’ mine life. 
Biodiversity 
The Group recognises the importance of protecting local ecosystems and 
biodiversity. Biodiversity protection plans are developed for every mine in 
compliance with regulations and take into account the interests of different 
stakeholders including farmers and landowners, local communities and 
non-governmental organisations. 
The Group’s efforts to promote biodiversity focus in particular on the Choapa 
valley where our Los Pelambres mine is located. Los Pelambres restored and 
manages a nature sanctuary at the Laguna Conchalí wetlands which has 
signiﬁcant biological diversity. It has also put in place programmes to protect 
peat lands and one of the few remaining Chilean Palm forests. All these sites 
provide habitats for endangered species.
In the Antofagasta Region, operations are located in the Atacama desert, the 
driest desert in the world, where there are very few animal and plant species. 
In 2010, El Tesoro ﬁnanced a survey of biodiversity around its fresh water 
source at Ojos de Opache. This found that the area is home to one vulnerable 
species, the Atacama Runner (a type of lizard). 
There were also two incidents (one at Esperanza and one at El Tesoro) involving 
foxes found drowned in evaporation pools. The operations have improved 
fencing round the sites to prevent other animals getting in and reminded 
workers of the importance of taking steps to avoid attracting foxes to the area. 
The Group monitors marine and bird biodiversity at Michilla Bay and contributes 
to the protection of marine biodiversity and the development of sustainable 
ﬁshing through the Fundación Minera Los Pelambres charitable foundation.

Assessing social and environmental impacts at Reko Diq
Reko Diq is a copper and gold deposit located in the state of Balochistan in 
Pakistan. The Group has been a joint venture partner in the project since 2006. 
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) has been undertaken 
for the site and will be presented to the Balochi and Pakistani environmental 
authorities in 2011. Stakeholder engagement was a key part of this process 
and feedback covered issues such as water use, employment and economic 
growth, transportation, air quality, biodiversity and the impact of the pipeline 
on local agriculture.
A social investment plan has been developed for the site which will form part 
of the social management process for the project, and reﬂects the commitment 
of the joint venture partners to provide lasting beneﬁts to local communities. 
See www.tethyan.com for more information.
The Group meets all GHS requirements. Its concentrates were evaluated 
under GHS and found not to be classiﬁable as they do not contain impurities. 
Clients and traders are provided with safety data sheets.
Other
The Group reviewed its processes and updated them where necessary 
to ensure compliance with updates to Chile’s environmental law 19.300. 
Group companies are also preparing to meet proposed new standards 
on air quality. 
Making mining projects sustainable
Since 2009, the Group has been deﬁning the social and environmental 
criteria it uses when deciding whether to proceed with a new project, and 
when developing the terms of reference and design criteria for new ventures. 
This process was completed in 2010 and the criteria will be incorporated 
into AMSA’s due diligence and project design processes in Chile and abroad. 
The criteria reﬂect current best practice and relevant international standards 
such as those of the International Finance Corporation and International 
Council on Mining and Minerals.
It also has a Social and Environmental Best Practices Handbook for 
Exploration and Projects that includes guidance on stakeholder engagement. 
The Group focuses on stakeholder engagement from the start of new projects. 
This enables understanding in local concerns and expectations and this is 
considered in the project design even before undertaking the ofﬁcial social 
and environmental assessment process.
Closure provisions
The Group aims to close and decommission our facilities safely and in ways 
that protect the environment and the interests of local people. It has closure 
plans and provisions in place for all its operations in accordance with 
regulations. These are regularly updated, often in consultation with local 
people. The Group includes closure plans within the environmental impact 
assessment reports submitted to authorities for all new projects. It is 
contributing to development of the new law on mining closure being 
discussed by the Chilean Congress and will comply with its requirements.
Developments in environmental law
REACH
The European Union’s REACH Directive requires companies to collect or 
generate toxicity data on chemicals manufactured in or imported into the EU.
Antofagasta’s molybdenum and copper products are covered by REACH. 
The Group met the November 2010 registration deadline for its Michilla and 
Tesoro sites. Copper concentrates do not need to be registered under REACH 
but must undergo a toxicity and danger evaluation. The ﬁndings of this 
evaluation showed that no special measures are needed to ensure the 
compliance of copper concentrates from Los Pelambres. 
Global Harmonising System
The Global Harmonising System (“GHS”) is intended to create an internationally 
consistent system of chemical hazard management and reporting through 
standard product labelling and Safety Data Sheets. Financial Review

Basis of preparation
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements on pages 88 to 128 have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). 
The accounting policies followed are set out in Note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements. 
The presentation currency of the Group and the functional currency of the 
Company is the US dollar, the principal currency in which the Group operates 
and in which assets and liabilities are denominated.
Review of performance
A detailed segmental analysis of the components of the income statement is 
contained in Note 6 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Turnover
Year ended 
31.12.10 
US$m
Year ended 
31.12.09 
US$m
Turnover 4,577.1 2,962.6 
Group turnover in 2010 was US$4,577 .1 million, 54.5% above the 
US$2,962.6 million achieved in 2009. This mainly reﬂected increased sales 
at the mining division in respect of both copper and molybdenum, and to a 
lesser extent also at the transport and water divisions.
Turnover from the mining division
Turnover from copper concentrate and copper cathodes
Turnover from copper concentrate and copper cathode sales from the 
Group’s three mines which were operational in 2010 increased by 57 .1% 
to US$3,953.8 million, compared with US$2,516.1 million in 2009. 
The increase mainly reﬂected the impact of higher realised prices as 
well as higher copper volumes. 
(i) Realised copper prices
The Group’s average realised copper price increased by 32.8% to 359.3 cents 
per pound (2009 – 270.6 cents), reﬂecting the higher average LME copper 
price, which increased by 46.0% to 342.0 cents per pound (2009 – 
234.2 cents) as well as positive adjustments to provisionally priced sales 
which were partially offset by the impact of realised hedging losses. 
Realised copper prices are determined by comparing turnover (gross of tolling 
charges for concentrate sales) with sales volumes in the year. Realised copper 
prices differ from market prices mainly because, in line with industry practice, 
concentrate and cathode sales agreements generally provide for provisional 
pricing at the time of shipment with ﬁnal pricing based on the average market 
price for future periods (normally about 30 days after delivery to the customer 
in the case of cathode sales and up to 120 days after delivery to the customer 
in the case of concentrate sales). Realised copper prices also reﬂect the impact 
of realised losses or gains of commodity derivative instruments hedge 
accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurements”.
In 2010 there were signiﬁcant positive mark-to-market adjustments to 
provisionally invoiced sales as a result of the signiﬁcant increase in the LME 
copper price during the year. In the case of Los Pelambres, pricing adjustments 
increased initially invoiced sales (before adjusting for tolling charges) by 
US$280.1 million in 2010, compared with a US$380.3 million increase of sales 
in 2009. The adjustments in 2010 comprised a deduction of US$6.4 million 
in respect of sales invoiced in 2009 (net of the reversal of mark-to-market 
adjustments made at the end of 2009) which were ﬁnally priced in 2010, and 
an uplift of US$286.5 million in respect of sales invoiced in 2010 (including 
a positive mark-to-market provision for open sales at the end of the year of 
US$124.3 million). Pricing adjustments in 2010 at El Tesoro and Michilla 
increased revenues by US$17 .4 million (2009 – increased revenues by 
US$31.1 million) and US$6.0 million (2009 – increased revenues by 
US$11.8 million) respectively. Further details of provisional pricing 
adjustments are given in Note 25(d) to the ﬁnancial statements.
In 2010, turnover also included a net loss of US$81.4 million (2009 – loss 
of US$65.8 million) on commodity derivatives at El Tesoro and Michilla which 
matured during the year. Further details of hedging activity in the year are 
given in Note 25(e) to the ﬁnancial statements.
Realised prices are analysed by mine in the Operational Review on pages 
26 to 33. The movement in the LME copper price during the year is described 
in the Marketplace section on page 13. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
61 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
(ii) Copper volumes
Copper sales volumes increased by 16.5% from 442,900 tonnes in 2009 to 
516,000 tonnes this year. Sales volumes differed slightly from production each 
year mainly due to differences in shipping and loading schedules.
Production volumes are analysed by mine in the Operational Review on pages 
26 to 33. The increased production volumes in the year were mainly due to 
increased production at Los Pelambres, reﬂecting higher throughput as a 
result of the plant expansion.
(iii) Tolling charges
Tolling charges for copper concentrate at Los Pelambres increased marginally 
from US$125.1 million in 2009 to US$134.0 million in 2010, reﬂecting the 
increased production. The decreased level of annual treatment and reﬁning 
charges in 2010 compared with 2009 have been largely offset by the “brick 
system” under which terms are often averaged over two years. Tolling charges 
are deducted from concentrate sales in reporting turnover and hence the 
increase in these charges has had a negative impact on turnover.
Turnover from molybdenum and other by-products
Turnover from by-products at Los Pelambres, which relate mainly to 
molybdenum, increased by 68.3% to US$376.2 million in 2010 compared with 
US$223.5 million in 2009, mainly due to increased molybdenum realised and 
prices. Molybdenum revenues (net of roasting charges) were US$303.5 million 
(2009 – US$180.1 million).
(i) Realised molybdenum prices
The realised molybdenum price increased by 43.4% to US$16.2 per pound 
in 2010 (2009 – US$11.3 per pound), compared to a 41.4% increase in the 
average market price to US$15.7 per pound (2009 – US$11.1 per pound). 
Molybdenum concentrate sales are also subject to provisional pricing with 
an average open period of up to approximately 90 days. 
(ii) Molybdenum volumes
Molybdenum sales volumes increased by 15.6% to 8,900 tonnes, compared 
with 7 ,700 tonnes in 2009. Small differences with production in each year 
reﬂected shipping and loading schedules.
Production volumes for Los Pelambres are analysed in the Operational Review 
on page 27 .
(iii) Gold and silver credits in copper concentrate sales
Credits received from gold and silver contained in copper concentrate sold 
increased to US$72.7 million (2009 – US$43.4 million). This was mainly due 
to the increase in gold content from 23,500 ounces in 2009 to 35,100 ounces 
in 2010. 
Turnover from the transport and water divisions
Turnover from the transport division (“FCAB”) increased by US$15.3 million or 
11.0% to US$154.7 million, mainly due to a 27 .5% increase in road tonnages 
partly offset by a slight decrease in rail tonnages and normal tariff adjustments 
in line with contractual terms.
Turnover at Aguas de Antofagasta, which operates the Group’s water business 
increased by US$8.8 million or 10.5% to US$92.4 million in 2010. This was 
mainly due to increased demand from domestic clients and to a lesser extent 
to increased demand from industrial customers. Financial Review

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) from 
subsidiaries and joint ventures increased by 64.9% to US$2,771.9 million 
(2009 – US$1,680.7 million).
EBITDA at the mining division increased by 69.1% from US$1,563.9 million to 
US$2,645.1 million, due to the increase in turnover as explained above, partly 
offset by higher operating costs. At Los Pelambres, EBITDA increased from 
US$1,408.9 million in 2009 to US$2,375.0 million this year. EBITDA at 
El Tesoro increased by US$123.2 million to US$354.9 million. At Michilla, 
EBITDA increased by US$32.7 million to US$60.6 million. 
Excluding by-product credits (which are reported as part of turnover) and tolling 
charges for concentrates (which are deducted from turnover), weighted average 
cash costs for the Group (comprising on-site and shipping costs in the case of 
Los Pelambres and cash costs in the case of the other two operations) increased 
from 106.8 cents per pound in 2009 to 124.3 cents per pound. This increase 
was mainly due to increased on-site and shipping costs as a result of higher 
input costs, in particular energy, and the effect of the stronger Chilean peso 
across the three mining operations, as well as the effect of the temporary 
suspension of the Tesoro North-East pit and increased maintenance at 
Los Pelambres. Cash costs are analysed by mine in the Operational Review 
on pages 24 to 57 .
Operating costs at Los Pelambres include a one-off US$65.2 million charge 
relating to the increase in the closure provision following an updated assessment 
during 2010 by external consultants, with the provision increasing due to factors 
including increases in the scale of the operation, updated cost assumptions, 
and an acceleration of the timing of certain closure activities relating to the 
Quillayes tailings dam.
Exploration costs increased from US$67 .1 million in 2009 to US$99.0 million, 
reﬂecting the increased level of exploration activity across the Group. Net costs 
in respect of corporate and other items were higher at US$46.4 million (2009 
– US$37 .5 million) mainly as a result of the increased level of costs associated 
with supporting the Group’s longer-term growth plans at the corporate centre. 
EBITDA at the transport division increased by US$3.2 million to US$59.8 million, 
with the increased revenue as explained above partly offset by increased 
operating costs. Aguas de Antofagasta contributed US$67 .0 million compared to 
US$60.2 million last year, mainly reﬂecting the increased volumes and revenue 
as explained above which were partly offset by increased operating costs. 
Depreciation, amortisation and impairments
Depreciation and amortisation increased by US$59.5 million to US$277 .0 million 
in 2010, mainly due to higher charges at Los Pelambres (as a result of 
depreciation relating to the expansion) and El Tesoro (as a result of depreciation 
relating to Tesoro North-East and amortisation of the related mining licences). 
The loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment in 2010 was 
US$9.8 million, compared with US$4.2 million in the prior year. 
During 2010 the reversal of the remaining US$109.4 million impairment 
originally recognised at El Tesoro in the year ended 31 December 2008 
has been recorded as an exceptional credit within total operating costs, 
following a review undertaken in light of the current commodity environment. 
The recoverable amounts in the review were determined by a value in use 
calculation prepared using management’s forecasts as to future commodity 
prices, operating costs and production volumes. The present value of the 
forecast future cash ﬂows was calculated using a discount rate of 7 .6%.
Operating proﬁt from subsidiaries and joint ventures
As a result of the above factors, operating proﬁt from subsidiaries and 
joint ventures (excluding the 2010 exceptional item) increased by 70.3% to 
US$2,485.1 million. Including the 2010 exceptional item, operating proﬁt from 
subsidiaries and joint ventures increased by 77 .8% to US$2,594.5 million.

Interest receivable increased from US$13.2 million in 2009 to US$16.5 million 
in 2010, reﬂecting the higher cash and liquid investment balances held during 
the year.
Interest expense decreased from US$24.0 million in 2009 to US$18.3 million 
in 2010, mainly due to a reduction in borrowings at Los Pelambres in 2010 
compared to 2009. 
Other ﬁnance items comprised a loss of US$16.9 million (2009 – loss of 
US$15.1 million). A loss of US$16.1 million (2009 – loss of US$1.1 million) has 
been recognised in respect of the time value element of changes in the fair value 
of commodity derivative options, which is excluded from the designated hedging 
relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in the income statement. 
Foreign exchange gains included in ﬁnance items were US$9.6 million in 2010, 
compared with a gain of US$1.2 million in the previous year. A loss on foreign

Total tax charge (Income tax expense) (752.5) (317.7)
The rate of ﬁrst category (i.e. corporation) tax in Chile was 17% for both 2010 
and 2009. 
Los Pelambres, El Tesoro, Michilla and Esperanza are also subject to a mining 
tax (royalty) which is tax deductible (i.e. an allowable expense in determining 
liability to ﬁrst category tax). On 12 January 2011 these four companies, which 
have tax invariability agreements to the mining tax, voluntarily elected to accept 
amendments as permitted pursuant to a law enacted in Chile on 21 October 
2010. Between 2010 and 2012, production from Los Pelambres, El Tesoro, 
Michilla and Esperanza mines is subject to a mining tax at a rate of between 
4–9% of tax-adjusted operating proﬁt, based on a sliding scale with the 
minimum rate of 4% applying to operations with a tax-adjusted operating proﬁt 
margin of below 40% and a maximum rate of 9% applying to operations with a 
tax-adjusted operating proﬁt margin of above 75%. Production from the Tesoro 
North-East deposit and the Run-of-Mine  processing at El Tesoro is subject to a 
mining tax at a rate of between 5–14% of tax-adjusted operating proﬁt, based 
on a sliding scale with the minimum rate of 5% applying to operations with a 
tax-adjusted operating proﬁt margin of below 35% and a maximum rate of 14% 
applying to operations with a tax-adjusted operating proﬁt margin of above 85%. 
In addition to ﬁrst category tax and the mining tax, the Group incurs withholding 
taxes on the remittance of proﬁts from Chilean operations and deferred tax is 
provided on undistributed earnings to the extent that remittance is probable in 
the foreseeable future. Withholding tax is levied on remittances of proﬁts from 
Chile at 35% less ﬁrst category tax already paid. Accordingly, during the year 
ended 31 December 2010 the effective tax rate of withholding tax is 
approximately 18% of the amount remitted or expected to be remitted.
The tax charge for the year was US$752.5 million and the effective tax rate was 
29.2%. This rate varies from the standard rate principally due to the provision 
of withholding tax of US$160.9 million and the effect of the mining tax which 
resulted in a charge of US$157 .7 million. In 2009 the total tax charge was 
US$317 .7 million and the effective tax rate was 22.1%. This rate varied from 
the standard rate principally due to the provision of withholding tax of 
US$28.1 million, the effect of the mining tax which resulted in a charge 
of US$55.1 million, exchange gains of US$18.3 million on Chilean peso 
denominated tax prepayments due to the strengthening of the Chilean 
peso during the year.

As a result of the factors set out above, proﬁt for the 2010 ﬁnancial year 
attributable to equity shareholders of the Company was US$1,051.8 million 
compared with US$667 .7 million in 2009. Accordingly, basic earnings per share 
were 106.7 cents in 2010 compared with 67 .7 cents for 2009. Basic earnings 
per share excluding exceptional items (detailed in Note 5 of the ﬁnancial 
statements) were 100.6 cents for 2010. During 2009 there were no 
exceptional items. 
Dividends
The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend for 2010 of 112 cents per ordinary 
share, which amounts to US$1,104.2 million and if approved at the Annual 
General Meeting, will be paid on 9 June 2011 to shareholders on the Register 
at the close of business on 6 May 2011. This ﬁnal dividend comprises an 
ordinary dividend of 12 cents and a special dividend of 100 cents. 
This gives total dividends for the year of 116 cents, including the interim dividend 
of 4 cents which was paid in October, amounting to US$1,143.6 million and 
representing a distribution of 109% of 2010 net earnings. 
The Board’s policy is to establish an ordinary dividend which can be maintained 
or progressively increased at conservative long-term copper prices and through 
the economic cycle. In addition, the Board recommends special dividends when 
it considers these appropriate after taking into account the level of proﬁts earned 
in the period under review, the existing cash position of the Group and signiﬁcant 
known or expected funding commitments.
As explained above, in determining the appropriate level of the special 
dividend of 100 cents per share for 2010, the Board has taken into account 
the successful completion of the key growth projects, the strong ﬁnancial 
position of the Group, and its continued ability to fund future growth. 
Accordingly, the 2010 distribution level is signiﬁcantly in excess of the 
typical distribution level in recent years. 
The Board’s overall policy remains unchanged and the level of distribution in 
future years, including any special or additional dividends, will depend on the 
factors set out above.

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group periodically uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce exposure 
to commodity price movements. The Group does not use such derivative 
instruments for speculative trading purposes. The impact of derivative 
instruments on the Group’s results for the period is set out on pages 60 and 61 
in the sections on turnover, operating proﬁt from subsidiaries and net ﬁnance 
income, and in Note 25(e) to these ﬁnancial statements. 
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 “Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” to its commodity derivatives. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are designated 
and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows have been recognised directly in 
equity, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in 
the period when the hedged item affects proﬁt or loss. Any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Realised gains and losses on 
commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement have been recorded 
within turnover. The time value element of changes in the fair value of derivative 
options is excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore 
recognised directly in the income statement within other ﬁnance items.
At 31 December 2010 the Group had min-max instruments for 58,575 tonnes 
of copper production at Michilla covering a total period up to 31 December 2012. 
The weighted average remaining period covered by the min-max hedges 
calculated with effect from 1 January 2010 was 12.7 months. The instruments 
had a weighted average ﬂoor of 311.1 cents per pound and a weighted average 
cap of 392.2 cents per pound. This represents approximately 80% of Michilla’s 
forecast production for 2011 and 2012 respectively, and the Group’s exposure 
to the copper price will be limited by the extent of these instruments. 
Details of the mark-to-market position of these instruments at 31 December 
2010, together with details of any interest and exchange derivatives held by 
the Group, are given in Note 25(e) to the ﬁnancial statements. 
The Group periodically uses foreign exchange derivatives to reduce its exposure 
to ﬂuctuations in the fair value of non-US dollar denominated assets or liabilities. 
At 31 December 2010 the Group had cross-currency swaps with a principal 
value of US$10.0 million relating to Esperanza to swap Chilean pesos for US 
dollars, at an average rate of Ch$550.3/US$1, covering a total period up to 
6 January 2011. The weighted average remaining period covered by these 
hedges calculated with effect from 1 January 2011 is 1.0 months. Between 
31 December 2010 and 31 January 2011 US$10.0 million of cross-currency 
swaps matured. 
The Group also periodically uses interest rate swaps to swap the ﬂoating rate 
interest for ﬁxed rate interest. At 31 December 2010 the Group had entered into 
contracts in relation to the Esperanza ﬁnancing for a maximum notional amount 
of US$787 .8 million at a weighted average ﬁxed rate of 1.353% maturing in 
February 2011 and a maximum notional amount of US$840.0 million at a 
weighted average ﬁxed rate of 3.372% maturing in February 2018. 
Commodity price sensitivities
Based on 2010 production volumes and without taking into account the effects 
of provisional pricing and any hedging activity, a 10 cent change in the average 
copper price would affect turnover and proﬁt before tax by US$114.9 million and 
earnings per share by 5.6 cents. Similarly, a one-dollar change in the average 
molybdenum price would affect turnover and proﬁt before tax by US$19.4 million 
and earnings per share by 0.9 cents.

Cash ﬂows from operations were US$2,433.9 million in 2010 compared with 
US$1,167 .8 million last year, reﬂecting the operating results adjusted for 
depreciation, amortisation, impairments and gains and losses on disposals of 
US$286.8 million (2009 – US$221.7 million) and a net working capital increase 
of US$338.0 million (2009 – increase of US$512.9 million). The signiﬁcant 
working capital movements relate mainly to an increase in trade debtors as a 
result of copper prices and provisional pricing mark-to-market adjustments at 
the end of each year, and to a lesser extent increased inventory levels with the 
start-up of Esperanza partly offset by an increase in closure provisions as well 
as creditors, mainly as a result of increased tax liabilities. Financial Review
66 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Financial Review continued
Cash tax payments in the year were US$427 .9 million (2009 – US$135.2 
million), comprising corporation tax of US$306.0 million (2009 – US$95.0 
million), mining tax of US$74.7 million (2009 – US$40.1 million) and withholding 
tax of US$47 .2 million (2009 – US$0.1 million). These amounts differ from the 
current tax charge in the consolidated income statement of US$631.5 million 
(2009 – US$185.1 million) because cash tax payments partly comprise lower 
monthly payments on account in respect of current year proﬁts and partly 
comprise the settlement of the outstanding balance for the previous year.
The purchase of available-for-sale investments of US$12.9 million relates to 
the purchase of shares in Duluth Metals Limited. 
Cash disbursements relating to capital expenditure in 2010 were US$1,301.8 
million compared with US$1,323.6 million in 2009. This included expenditure of 
US$1,058.6 million relating to the Esperanza project (2009 – US$716.4 million) 
and US$134.3 million (2009 – US$399.4 million) relating to the plant expansion 
at Los Pelambres. 
Dividends (including special dividends) paid to ordinary shareholders of the 
Company this year were US$236.6 million (2009 – US$561.9 million), which 
related to the ﬁnal dividend declared in respect of the previous year and the 
interim dividend in respect of the current year, and reﬂected the decreased 
dividend per share paid out during 2010 compared with 2009. Dividends paid 
by subsidiaries to non-controlling shareholders were US$702.7 million (2009 – 
US$310.0 million), principally due to increased distributions by Los Pelambres.
Details of other cash inﬂows and outﬂows in the year are contained in the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.

At 31 December 2010 the Group had combined cash, cash equivalents and 
liquid investments of US$3,541.6 million (2009 – US$3,222.3 million). 
Excluding the non-controlling interest share in each partly-owned operation, 
the Group’s attributable share of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments 
was US$3,393.8 million (2009 – US$2,934.3 million). 
New borrowings in the year amounted to US$1,022.0 million (2009 – 
US$2,051.6 million), mainly due to drawdowns from the Esperanza Project 
ﬁnance facility and new corporate loans at Los Pelambres and El Tesoro and an 
increase of subordinated debt provided to Esperanza by Marubeni. Repayments 
of borrowings and ﬁnance leasing obligations in the year were US$459.8 million, 
relating mainly to repayment of the Los Pelambres short-term borrowings and to 
a lesser extent regular repayments on existing loans (2009 – US$874.5 million 
mainly relating to repayment of short-term borrowings).
Total Group borrowings at 31 December 2010 were US$2,196.5 million (2009 
– US$1,626.6 million). Of this, US$1,486.8 million (2009 – US$1,067 .6 million) 
is proportionally attributable to the Group after excluding the non-controlling 
interest shareholdings in partly-owned operations. 
Balance sheet
Net equity (i.e. equity attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company) 
increased from US$5,338.6 million at 1 January 2010 to US$6,170.6 million 
at 31 December 2010, relating mainly to proﬁt after tax and non-controlling 
interests for the period less ordinary dividends declared and paid in the year. 
Other changes relate mainly to movements in the fair value of hedges and 
available-for-sale investments and the currency translation adjustment; 
these are set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
Non-controlling interests increased from US$1,278.8 million at 1 January 2010 
to US$1,355.2 million at 31 December 2010. This principally reﬂected the 
non-controlling interest’s share of proﬁt after tax less the non-controlling 
interest’s share of the dividends paid by subsidiaries in the year. Other 
movements affecting non-controlling interest are also set out in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Long-term provisions increased from US$127 .9 million at 31 December 2009 to 
US$244.4 million at 31 December 2010. During the year ended 31 December 
2010 there has been a one-off charge of US$65.2 million to operating proﬁt 
in relation to increases to the rehabilitation provision, and US$44.4 million 
capitalised in relation to the decommissioning provision at Los Pelambres 
following an updated independent review and which reﬂects changes to 
the assumptions relating to the provision. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

Foreign currency exchange differences
The principal subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the US dollar 
are Chilean peso denominated, of which the most signiﬁcant is Aguas de 
Antofagasta S.A. Exchange rates used to translate the results of such 
subsidiaries are given in Note 36 to the ﬁnancial statements. 
In 2010 the currency translation gain recognised in net equity of US$27 .1 million 
resulted mainly from the strengthening in the Chilean peso during the year from 
Ch$507 = US$1 at the start of 2010 to Ch$468 = US$1 at the end of 2010. 
In 2009 the currency translation gain recognised in net equity of US$46.1 million 
resulted mainly from the strengthening in the Chilean peso during the year from 
Ch$636 = US$1 at the start of 2009 to Ch$507 = US$1 at the end of 2009.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with those factors likely to affect its 
future performance, are set out in the Operational Review on pages 24 to 45. 
Details of the cash ﬂows of the Group during the year, along with its ﬁnancial 
position at the year end are set out in this Financial Review. The ﬁnancial 
statements include details of the Group’s cash, cash equivalent and liquid 
investment balances in Note 22, and details of borrowings are set out in 
Note 23. Details of the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management including details 
of the management of liquidity and counterparty risk, are set out in Note 25(c) 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
In assessing the Group’s going concern status the Directors have taken into 
account the above factors, including the ﬁnancial position of the Group and in 
particular its signiﬁcant balance of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments, 
the borrowing facilities in place and their terms, the current copper price and 
market expectations in the medium term, the Group’s expected operating cost 
proﬁle and its capital expenditure and ﬁnancing plans. 
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. 
Cautionary statement about forward-looking statements
The Financial Statements contain certain forward-looking statements with 
respect to the ﬁnancial position, results of operations and business of the Group. 
Examples of forward-looking statements include those regarding ore reserve 
and mineral resource estimates, anticipated production or construction 
commencement dates, costs, outputs, demand, trends in commodity prices, 
growth opportunities and productive lives of assets or similar factors. The words 
“intend”, “aim”, “project”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “believe”, “expect”, 
“may”, “should”, “will”, “continue”, or similar expressions, commonly identify 
such forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, 
assumptions and other factors that are beyond the Group’s control. For example, 
future ore reserves will be based in part on long-term price assumptions that 
may vary signiﬁcantly from current levels. These may materially affect the timing 
and feasibility of particular developments. Other factors include the ability to 
produce and transport products proﬁtably, demand for products, the effect of 
foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, activities 
by governmental authorities, such as changes in taxation or regulation, and 
political uncertainty. 
Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, actual results could be 
materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these 
forward-looking statements which speak only as at the date of this report. 
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Group does not 
undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. The Group 
cannot guarantee that its forward-looking statements will not differ materially 
from actual results.  Governance

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their Annual Report, together with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Principal group activities
The principal activities of the Group are copper mining (including exploration and 
development), the transportation of freight by rail and road and the distribution 
of water. These activities are mainly based in Chile. The Company’s principal 
activity is to act as a holding company. Group operations are carried out through 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. The principal subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures that make up the Group are set out in Notes 16 to 18 to the 
ﬁnancial statements. One subsidiary, the Antofagasta Railway Company plc, 
has a branch in Chile (known as the FCAB) which provides rail freight services.
Business review
The Company is required by section 417 of the Companies Act 2006 to provide 
a business review in this report. The requirements of the business review are 
fulﬁlled in the disclosures contained within the Chairman’s Statement on pages 
4 to 7 , the Marketplace section on pages 12 to 15, the Operational Review 
(including information on expected future developments) on pages 24 to 57 , the 
Financial Review on pages 60 to 67 and the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 76 to 80. A summary of the key performance indicators considered most 
relevant to the Group is on pages 16 and 17 . Information on environmental, 
employee and social and community matters is included within the Corporate 
Sustainability section on pages 46 to 57 . Information on signiﬁcant contractual 
and other arrangements which are essential to the business of the Group is 
included within this Directors’ Report on pages 72 and 73. A description of the 
ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies of the Group, together with 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, is contained in the Risk 
Management section on pages 18 to 21, and in Note 25(c) to the ﬁnancial 
statements. Signiﬁcant events since the balance sheet date requiring disclosure 
are set out in Note 39 to the ﬁnancial statements. All the above matters are 
incorporated into this report by reference.
Value of land
Land included within property, plant and equipment in the ﬁnancial statements 
is mainly held at cost. It is not practicable to estimate the value of such land and 
mineral rights, since these principally depend on product prices over the long 
term and will vary with market conditions. Land included in investment properties 
relates to forestry properties which the Group maintains but does not use in any 
of its existing operations. This land is held for long-term real estate development 
and recreational potential and is held in the ﬁnancial statements at cost. The fair 
value of such land is disclosed in Note 15 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Results and dividends
The consolidated proﬁt before tax has increased from US$1,437 .6 million in 
2009 to US$2,573.2 million in 2010. 
The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of US 112.0 cents (2009 – US 
20.0 cents) per ordinary share, comprising an ordinary dividend of US 12.0 cents 
(2009 – US 6.0 cents) and a special dividend of US 100.0 cents (2009 – US 
14.0 cents). An ordinary interim dividend of US 4.0 cents was paid on 7 October 
2010 (2009 ordinary dividend – US 3.4 cents). This gives total dividends per 
share proposed in relation to 2010 of US 116.0 cents (2009 – US 23.4 cents), 
including the special dividend. The total amount of dividends paid to ordinary 
shareholders (including special dividends) proposed in relation to 2010 will be 
US$1,143.6 million, compared with US$230.7 million in 2009. 
Preference shares carry the right to a ﬁxed cumulative dividend of 5% per 
annum. The preference shares are classiﬁed within borrowings, and preference 
dividends are included within ﬁnance costs. The total cost of dividends paid 
on preference shares and recognised as an expense in the income statement 
was US$0.2 million (2009 – US$0.2 million). Further information relating to 
dividends is set out in the Financial Review on page 64, and in Note 12 to the 
ﬁnancial statements.
Directors
The Directors who served during the year are set out on page 149. No Director 
has a service contract with the Company which cannot be terminated within 
12 months. Mr. H Dryland and Mr. T C Baker were appointed Non-Executive 
Directors subsequent to the year end on 20 January 2011 and 1 March 2011 
respectively. Mr. D E Yarur served as a Non-Executive Director throughout 2010, 
and resigned from the Board subsequent to the year end on 1 March 2011.
As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors are 
seeking re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Biographical 
details of the Directors are set out on page 70. The reasons why the Board 
considers that these Directors should be re-elected are set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 76 to 80 and in particular in the sections headed 
“Performance evaluation” and “Re-election”.

Directors’ indemnities and insurance
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the extent 
permitted by the laws of England and Wales, Directors are granted an indemnity 
from the Company in respect of liabilities personally incurred as a result of their 
ofﬁce. In respect of those matters for which the Directors may or may not be 
indemniﬁed, the Company maintained a Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ liability 
insurance policy throughout the ﬁnancial year. This policy has been renewed 
for the current ﬁnancial year. 
Conﬂicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 requires that a Director must avoid a situation where 
he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conﬂicts, or possibly may 
conﬂict, with the Company’s interests. The Company has undertaken a process 
to identify, and, where appropriate, authorise and manage potential and actual 
conﬂicts. Each Director of the Company has identiﬁed his interests which may 
constitute conﬂicts, including for example, directorships in other companies. 
The Board has considered the potential and actual conﬂict situations of each of 
the Directors and decided in relation to each situation whether to authorise it and 
the steps, if any, that need to be taken to manage it. The authorisation process 
is not regarded as a substitute for managing an actual conﬂict of interest if one 
arises. The monitoring and, if appropriate, authorisation of actual and potential 
conﬂicts of interest is an ongoing process. Directors are required to notify the 
Company of any material changes in those positions or situations that have 
already been considered, as well as to notify the Company of any other new 
positions or situations that may arise. In addition to considering any new 
situations as they arise, the Board considers the conﬂict position of all 
Directors formally each year. 
Signiﬁcant relationships
The Group has a number of signiﬁcant contractual or other arrangements which 
are essential to its operations and projects:
–  the Group holds a number of mining and exploration rights in Chile and other 
countries in which it has exploration or development activities, normally granted 
by the relevant national government;
–  a signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’s sales of copper concentrate (and other 
payable elements) and molybdenum concentrate are made under long-term 
framework agreements with a number of customers. These framework 
contracts will typically set out the minimum annual volumes to be supplied, 
with the processing charges determined annually and the pricing of contained 
material to be in accordance with market prices. A signiﬁcant proportion 
of the Group’s copper cathode sales are made under annual contracts with 
a number of customers. These contracts will typically specify the volumes 
to be supplied, with the pricing to be in accordance with market prices. 
Further details of such arrangements are given in Note 25(d) to the 
ﬁnancial statements;
–  there are collective labour agreements with each of the labour unions at the 
Group’s mining operations. These agreements are typically of between three 
and four years’ duration. Several of these labour unions are afﬁliated with the 
Federación Minera de Chile;
–  the Group has contracts with a number of suppliers to sub-contract 
certain services at each of its mine sites, including vehicle and equipment 
maintenance and other logistical services. In addition, the Group has a number 
of medium and long-term contracts for the supply of key inputs such as 
electricity, sulphuric acid, oil and explosives with a number of suppliers;
–  tax invariability agreements are in place in respect of the Group’s four 
mining operations – Los Pelambres, Esperanza, El Tesoro and Michilla – 
which provide that set rates will apply in respect of the mining royalty for 
speciﬁed periods;
–  in 2003 the Group was awarded a 30-year concession to operate the water 
rights and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, supplying domestic 
and industrial users. The domestic tariffs are controlled by the Chilean Water 
Regulator. Further details are given in Note 35 to the ﬁnancial statements;
–  the transport division has long-term contracts with a number of customers, 
which typically govern volumes and pricing structures; and
–  the Group has shareholder agreements in place governing its relationship 
with its partners at its operations and development and exploration projects. 
The Group also has a number of “earn-in” agreements in respect of exploration 
and development projects. Governance

nominal value of all issued share capital.
There are no speciﬁc restrictions on the transfer of shares or on their voting 
rights beyond those standard provisions set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association and other provisions of applicable law and regulation (including, 
in particular, following a failure to provide the Company with information about 
interests in shares as required by the Companies Act 2006). The Company is 
not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
Details of signiﬁcant holdings in the Company’s shares are set out in the 
“Substantial shareholdings” section on page 75.
The Company has the authority to purchase up to 98,585,669 of its own 
ordinary shares, representing 10% of the issued ordinary share capital. 
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company 
is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2010, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The Articles of 
Association may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
There are no signiﬁcant agreements in place which take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company. There are no agreements 
in place between the Company and its Directors or employees which provide 
for compensation for loss of ofﬁce resulting from a change of control of 
the Company.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations of US$13.7 million during the year ended 
31 December 2010 (2009 – US$2.2 million). The donations include amounts 
paid during 2010 from the US$10 million recovery fund established by 
Antofagasta Minerals S.A. to support the earthquake reconstruction efforts 
in Chile, as described in more detail in the Corporate Sustainability section. 
This also includes US$53,000 (2009 – US$32,000) of charitable donations 
in the United Kingdom, principally related to educational studies with a focus on 
Chile. The Group made political donations of US$49,000 during the year ended 
31 December 2010, in relation to presidential elections (2009 – US$2.2 million 
in relation to Chilean presidential and parliamentary elections). These donations 
were made in accordance with the Chilean legislation which governs the 
ﬁnancing of political parties and candidates in order to facilitate the democratic 
process of the country. The donations were made via the Chilean Electoral 
Management Body, which transfers funds to political parties and candidates.
Supplier payment policy and creditor days
The Company acts as a holding company and does not trade in the United 
Kingdom or elsewhere. Creditor days for the Group have been calculated at 
32 days (2009 – 40 days). Each operating company is responsible for agreeing 
terms of payment with each of their suppliers. It is Group policy that payments 
to suppliers are made in accordance with agreed terms.
Environment
The Group seeks to ensure that its operations and products cause minimal harm 
to the environment. Care is taken to limit discharges of environmentally harmful 
substances and to dispose of waste material in a safe manner. Contingency 
arrangements and plans exist to reduce the risk and limit the effect of any 
accidental spillage. The Group’s policy is that all its operations should comply 
fully with or exceed applicable Chilean regulations. Further information regarding 
the Group’s environmental performance and activities is given in the Corporate 
Sustainability section on pages 46 to 57 . Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

Corporate Governance Report
Introduction
The Company is incorporated in England and listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, with the Group’s businesses, which comprise mining, transport 
and water distribution, principally located in Chile, the largest copper producing 
country in the world. The E. Abaroa Foundation, an entity in which members of 
the Luksic family are interested, controls 60.66% of the ordinary share capital 
and 94.12% of the preference share capital of the Company through two 
investment vehicles, Metalinvest Establishment and Kupferberg Establishment. 
Aureberg Establishment, which is controlled by Antofagasta’s Chairman, 
Mr. J-P Luksic, holds 4.26% of the ordinary share capital of the Company as 
at the date of this report. Antofagasta’s Board is committed to managing the 
operations of the Group with a view to maximising value for all shareholders. 
During 2010 the Board had eight members, comprising an Executive Chairman 
and seven Non-Executive Directors. Two of these eight Directors (including the 
Chairman) are members of the Luksic family. Six of these Directors, including 
the Chairman, are based in Chile, where the Group’s operations are principally 
located; one of these Directors is based in England, where the Company is 
incorporated and listed on the London Stock Exchange; and one of these 
Directors is based in the United States. 
Subsequent to the year end, two further Directors were appointed to the Board, 
one of whom is based in the United States and one of whom is based in Canada. 
The day-to-day operations of the Group are carried on through the boards of 
each division of the Group, Antofagasta Minerals S.A. (mining), Antofagasta 
Railway Company plc (FCAB – railway and other transport services) and Aguas 
de Antofagasta S.A. (water distribution). The Antofagasta Board oversees these 
divisional boards and provides strategic direction. Each division is headed by a 
chief executive ofﬁcer who reports to his divisional board and the Chairman of 
the Group – Marcelo Awad for the mining division, Miguel Sepúlveda at the 
transport business and Marco Kútulas in the water division. Antofagasta Minerals 
S.A. has a team of senior executives who report to Marcelo Awad, focusing on 
areas including operations, strategy, risk management, human resources, 
ﬁnance and business development, exploration and mineral resources, 
corporate affairs and project development.
During the 2010 ﬁnancial year, the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 (“the Combined Code”) 
applied to the Company. The Board describes below how it applied the corporate 
governance principles contained in the Combined Code during that year. 
Two areas where the Company did not comply with the detailed Combined Code 
provisions are set out at the end of this report under the heading “Statement 
of compliance with the detailed provisions of the Combined Code”. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 
2010 will apply to the Company from the 2011 ﬁnancial year and will be 
reported upon in the 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Directors
The Board
The Directors collectively have responsibility for the conduct of the Group’s 
business. The Board, which met eight times during 2010, was comprised of 
an Executive Chairman and seven Non-Executive Directors, ﬁve of whom are 
considered by the Board to be independent. Subsequent to the year end, two 
further Directors, were appointed to the Board. One is not considered by the 
Board to be independent for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
while the other is considered by the Board to be independent. One Director 
based in Chile who was considered independent resigned after the end of 
the year.
There is a schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved for the Board. The Board 
is responsible for:
– providing leadership;
– setting the Group’s strategic objectives and key policies;
–  ensuring that appropriate resources are in place to enable the Group to 
meet its objectives;
– reviewing the Group’s performance; and
– overseeing the Group’s internal control systems.
The Chairman will always attempt to persuade the Board to act as a single team 
by obtaining consensus at Board meetings but, in exceptional circumstances, 
decisions may be taken by majority. The agenda for Board meetings are set 
by the Chairman in consultation with the other Directors.
Responsibility for developing and implementing the Group’s strategic and 
ﬁnancial objectives is delegated to the senior management of the Group. 
Accordingly, the boards of Antofagasta Minerals S.A. (mining), the Antofagasta 
Railway Company plc (railway and other transport services) and Aguas de 
Antofagasta S.A. (water distribution) meet regularly to consider strategic, 
operational and risk management issues in more detail. There is substantial 
overlap between membership of the Board of Antofagasta plc and these three 
divisional boards. The chief executive ofﬁcer of each division reports to his 
divisional board and to the Chairman of the Group; the Board oversees these 
divisional boards and provides strategic direction. The Board is also responsible 
for reviewing the performance of management. The Non-Executive Directors 
scrutinise the performance of management in meeting goals and objectives 
and also monitor the reporting of performance, through the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
The Directors of the Company as at 7 March 2011 are set out on page 70. 
Mr. D E Yarur served as a Non-Executive Director throughout 2010, and resigned 
from the Board subsequent to the year end on 1 March 2011.
The recognised senior independent Non-Executive Director is Mr. C H Bailey, 
who is also Chairman of the Audit Committee. Mr. G S Menéndez is Chairman 
of the Remuneration and Nomination Committees. The Board does not have 
a Director formally designated as Chief Executive. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
77 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
The role of the Chairman
Mr. J-P Luksic is Chairman of the Board. His role is that of a full-time Executive 
Chairman, and he has no other signiﬁcant commitments that prevent him from 
devoting sufﬁcient time to this role. 
As explained above, the Group does not have a Board member who is 
designated as Chief Executive. Mr. Marcelo Awad is chief executive ofﬁcer of 
Antofagasta Minerals S.A.; Mr. Miguel Sepúlveda is chief executive ofﬁcer of the 
Antofagasta Railway Company plc; and Mr. Marco Kútulas is the chief executive 
ofﬁcer of Aguas de Antofagasta S.A. The Board believes that the Company is 
not at risk from a concentration of power by Mr. J-P Luksic having executive 
responsibilities as Chairman. In reaching this conclusion, it has taken into 
consideration the strong presence of Non-Executive Directors on the Board, the 
structure of the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and Sustainability Committees 
designed to devolve away from the Chairman responsibility and control of certain 
key areas of Board responsibility, and the delegation of management 
responsibility to the chief executive ofﬁcer of each division.
Board balance and independence
The Board considers ﬁve of its seven Non-Executive Directors who served during 
2010 to be independent – Mr. C H Bailey, Mr. G S Menéndez, Mr. D E Yarur, 
Mr. J G Claro and Mr. W M Hayes. Mr. T C Baker who was also appointed 
subsequent to the year end is considered independent. The Board is satisﬁed 
that this balance limits the scope for an individual or small group of individuals 
to dominate the Board’s decision-making. All Directors will be standing for 
re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and biographical details 
of each Director can be found on page 70. 
Mr. Claro, Mr. Hayes and Mr. Baker meet the independence criteria set out 
in Combined Code provision A.3.1 and the Board is satisﬁed as to their 
independence. The Board is satisﬁed that Mr. Bailey remains independent in 
character and judgement, notwithstanding that he has served on the Board for 
more than nine years, since he does not receive any remuneration from the 
Company other than Non-Executive Directors’ fees, nor does he have any other 
relationships with the Company or its majority shareholder. 
The Board is also satisﬁed that Mr. Menéndez remains independent in character 
and judgement, notwithstanding that he has also served on the Board for more 
than nine years and notwithstanding that he is a non-executive director of 
Quiñenco S.A. (a Chilean-listed company also controlled by the Luksic family) 
and some of its subsidiaries, including Banco de Chile. This is because he does 
not receive any remuneration from the Group other than in a non-executive 
capacity. His position in the Quiñenco group is also solely as a non-executive 
director. The Board considers that Mr. Bailey’s and Mr. Menéndez’s length of 
service is of considerable beneﬁt to the Board given their wealth of knowledge 
and experience of the Group and of Latin America and of the mining industry, 
and therefore proposes both for re-election. 
The Board does not consider Mr. R F Jara or Mr. G A Luksic who served during 
the year nor Mr. Dryland who was appointed subsequent to the year end to be 
independent. Mr. R F Jara provides advisory services to the Group, as explained 
in the Remuneration Report on page 82. Mr. G A Luksic is the brother of 
Mr. J-P Luksic, the Chairman of Antofagasta plc. Mr. G A Luksic is chairman of 
Quiñenco S.A. and chairman or a director of Quiñenco’s other listed subsidiaries. 
Mr. J-P Luksic and Mr. G S Menéndez are also non-executive directors of 
Quiñenco and some of its listed subsidiaries. Like Antofagasta plc, Quiñenco 
is also controlled by the Luksic family. Mr. H Dryland was appointed a Non-
Executive Director subsequent to the year end on 20 January 2011. The Board 
does not consider Mr. H Dryland to be independent, as Mr. Dryland has provided 
advisory services to the Group in his capacity as a senior managing director at 
Rothschild, which remains a ﬁnancial advisor to the Group. 
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee currently comprises Mr. G S Menéndez (Chairman), 
Mr. C H Bailey and Mr. R F Jara. As explained above, Mr. C H Bailey and 
Mr. G S Menéndez are considered by the Board to be independent  
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Nomination Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board 
including the balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and 
considers succession planning for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
and the Group’s senior management. It is also responsible for the process for 
new Board appointments and makes recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment of new Directors and is responsible for ensuring that appointments 
are made on merit and against objective criteria. In fulﬁlling these responsibilities, 
the Nomination Committee consults the Chairman, Mr. J-P Luksic. 
The Nomination Committee meets as necessary and, in any case, at least once a 
year. Its terms of reference are available from the Company’s registered ofﬁce 
and may be viewed on the Company’s website – www.antofagasta.co.uk. 
In making appointments to the Board, the Nomination Committee considers the 
skills, experience and knowledge of the existing Directors and assesses which of 
the potential candidates would most beneﬁt the Board. It considers the potential 
candidate’s knowledge and experience of Chile, the mining industry, Latin 
America, capital markets and the regulatory environment, and that they have 
sufﬁcient time to devote to the role. The Chairman ensures that any new 
Directors are provided with a full induction on joining the Board. 
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for 
an initial period of three years from the date of their appointment, subject to 
re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting. These letters require the 
Non-Executive Directors to undertake that they will have sufﬁcient time to 
discharge their responsibilities. The letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal business hours and 
at the Annual General Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting). 
The Company intends to comply with provision B.7 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code from the 2011 ﬁnancial year and submit each Director for 
annual re-election.
Information and professional development
The Directors receive information for review ahead of each Board or Committee 
Meeting. In addition, they receive regular reports and forecasts for the Group and  Governance

Re-election
All Directors at the date of this report will stand for re-election at this year’s

Directors continues to be effective and continues to demonstrate commitment 
to his role.
Remuneration
The membership of the Remuneration Committee, a statement of the Company’s 
policy on remuneration, and the remuneration details and shareholding interests

Accountability and audit
Internal control
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the Combined Code by establishing a 
continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks 
the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which is an ongoing 
activity from the start of each ﬁnancial year to the date of approval of this report 
and which is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control published 
in October 2005 (“the Turnbull Guidance”). The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Combined Code, the Board regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. The Board’s 
monitoring covers all controls, including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management. It is based principally on reviewing reports from 
management to consider whether signiﬁcant risks are identiﬁed, evaluated, 
each signiﬁcant operation to ensure that they remain properly briefed about the 
performance and ﬁnancial position of the Group throughout the year. All Directors 
have access to management and to such further information as is needed to 
carry out their duties and responsibilities fully and effectively. Furthermore, all 
Directors are entitled to seek independent professional advice concerning the 
affairs of the Group at the Company’s expense. 
The Company also provides Directors with the necessary resources to develop 
and update their knowledge and capabilities. In particular, the Directors are 
regularly updated on the Group’s business, the competitive and regulatory 
environment in which it operates and other changes affecting the Group as a 
whole. The Directors based outside Chile visit the country regularly and at least 
once a year, and the Directors based outside the United Kingdom also regularly 
visit this country, again normally at least once a year, and normally attend the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting held in London.
Group management in the United Kingdom and Chile is responsible for ensuring 
that Board procedures and applicable rules and regulations are complied 
with and for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance 
matters. Company secretarial services and advice are provided by Petershill 
Secretaries Limited.
Performance evaluation
The Board periodically considers its performance and effectiveness. 
A performance evaluation of the Board, its committees and its individual 
members was conducted during 2010 by Mr. G S Menéndez, with the assistance 
of senior management. Mr. C H Bailey, as the senior independent Non-Executive 
Director was responsible for the evaluation of the Chairman. The results were 
discussed with the Chairman and considered by the Board and were taken into 
account in the decision to recommend for re-election all of the Directors at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Board is satisﬁed that each Director 
continues to contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment to his role. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

managed and controlled and whether any signiﬁcant weaknesses are promptly 
remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has 
also performed a speciﬁc assessment for the purpose of this Annual Report. 
This assessment considers all signiﬁcant aspects of internal control arising 
during the period covered by the report including the work of internal audit. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities. 
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has 
not identiﬁed nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has 
determined to be signiﬁcant. Therefore a conﬁrmation in respect of necessary 
actions is not required. Further information relating to the Group’s risk and 
management systems is given on pages 18 to 21.
Going concern
The Board’s statement on going concern is included in the Financial Review 
on page 67 .
Corporate sustainability
The Board takes into account the community, social, environmental and ethical 
impact of its decisions and is responsible for the relevant policies of the Group. 
A Corporate Sustainability Committee, comprising Mr. J-P Luksic, Mr. G S 
Menéndez and Mr. R F Jara, assists the Board in its responsibilities with respect 
to the Group’s social responsibility. The Committee met once in 2010 with all 
three members in attendance. Key issues of social responsibility are identiﬁed 
and assessed through the Group’s risk management processes described 
under “Internal control” above. The Group also published a separate annual 
Sustainability Report to provide further information on its social and 
environmental performance. More information on corporate sustainability 
is given on pages 46 to 57 .
“Whistleblowing” procedures
The Audit Committee, whose other functions are described below, is 
responsible for reviewing arrangements by which employees of the Group 
may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of 
ﬁnancial reporting or other matters. An Ethics Code is in place across the Group, 
which includes a procedure to enable employees to raise concerns, anonymously 
if necessary. An Ethics Committee, comprising members of senior management, 
is responsible for implementing, developing and updating the Ethics Code and 
investigating any allegations of impropriety. The Ethics Committee reports 
directly to the Chief Executive of Antofagasta Minerals S.A. The Audit Committee 
considers the results of this work and the operation of the Ethics Code as part 
of its annual review of the effectiveness of internal control.
Audit Committee and auditors
During the year the Audit Committee comprised Mr. C H Bailey (Chairman), 
Mr. G S Menéndez and Mr. D E Yarur. 0n 1 March 2011, Mr. D E Yarur retired 
from the Board and was replaced on the Audit Committee by Mr. W M Hayes. 
The Audit Committee members during the year and to the date of this report are 
considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive Directors. All three 
members are considered to have recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. 
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year with the external auditors in 
attendance. The Audit Committee’s purpose is to assist the Board in meeting 
its responsibilities relating to ﬁnancial reporting and control matters. In particular, 
it reviews the scope and nature of the audit and issues arising from it and is 
responsible for ensuring the independence of the external auditors (including 
their objectivity and effectiveness), monitoring the provision of any non-audit 
services and for making recommendations to the Board for the appointment, 
re-appointment or removal of the external auditors. The Audit Committee 
periodically reviews if it is necessary to re-tender the audit engagement. 
It reviews the internal control and risk assessment procedures adopted by the 
Group described in the section under the heading “Internal control” above, 
including a review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function. The internal 
audit function is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of the internal control 
environment across the Group and for reporting the ﬁndings of the internal audit 
work to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. The Audit Committee also 
monitors the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements and Directors’ statements on 
internal controls and reviews the going concern basis prior to its endorsement 
by the Board. The Committee also reviews the preliminary announcement and 
the half yearly ﬁnancial report. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
are available from the Company’s registered ofﬁce and may be viewed on the 
Company’s website – www.antofagasta.co.uk. 
The Audit Committee is authorised by the Board to investigate any activity within 
its terms of reference. It is authorised to seek any information it requires from any 
employees and all employees are directed to co-operate with any request made 
by the Audit Committee. 
The Company’s external auditors, Deloitte LLP , have provided non-audit services 
to the Company, which amounted to US$609,000. This comprised the provision 
of services relating to corporate ﬁnance advisory services, tax compliance and 
other consultancy services. The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of these 
services in the course of the year and is conﬁdent that the objectivity and 
independence of the auditors are not impaired by reason of such non-audit work. 
The Audit Committee has also considered the effectiveness of the external audit 
function through the year through meetings with Deloitte LLP , a review of their 
audit plan and a consideration of the results of work performed by the external 
auditors prior to release of the half year and full year results. Governance

Relations with shareholders
Directors and senior management regularly meet with institutional shareholders 
and analysts in the United Kingdom, Europe, Chile, North America, Asia and 
Australia. The senior independent Non-Executive Director, Mr. C H Bailey, also 
attends meetings with major shareholders when required. Other Non-Executive 
Directors are given the opportunity to meet with major shareholders and attend 
meetings if requested to do so by shareholders. These meetings ensure that the 
Board is able to develop and maintain an understanding of the views of several of 
the Company’s major investors. The Company carries out a formal programme of 
presentations to update institutional shareholders and analysts on developments 
in the Group after the announcement of the half year and full year results. 
In addition, quarterly production ﬁgures and ﬁnancial results are published for 
the mining, transport and water divisions. Copies of these results and production 
announcements, presentations and other press releases issued by the Company 
are available on its website. As noted above, the Group also publishes a separate 
Sustainability Report to provide further information on its social and 
environmental performance. The Company’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
is also used as an opportunity to communicate with both institutional and private 
shareholders; the Board of Directors encourages all shareholders to attend. 
The notice of the AGM is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days in 
advance of the meeting. At the meeting, the Company complies with the 
Combined Code as it relates to voting, including votes withheld, the separation 
of the resolutions and the attendance of committee chairmen.
Statement of compliance with the detailed provisions 
of the Combined Code
As explained above, the Company complied with the detailed code provisions 
contained in the Combined Code throughout 2010 except as follows:
–  the Board did not have a separately identiﬁed Chief Executive and hence at 
Board level there is no formal separation of the functions of Chairman and 
Chief Executive (provision A.2.1). As explained above, the Group has separate 
chief executives for its mining, transport and water distribution divisions who 
report to their respective divisional boards and to the Chairman of the Group. 
The Board considers that its predominantly non-executive composition 
combined with the delegation of management responsibility to the chief 
executive ofﬁcer of each division achieves an appropriate balance and 
prevents a concentration of power in its Executive Chairman; and
–  performance-related pay measures did not apply to Board members 
(provision B.1.1). The Board considers this appropriate given its predominantly  
Non-Executive composition and the role of the only Executive Director, 
who is a member of the controlling family, as Chairman of the Board. 
Performance-related bonuses are paid to senior management in the Group 
based on a combination of personal, divisional and Group performance 
assessed against targets set at the start of each year. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008. It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 (“the 
Combined Code”) relating to Directors’ remuneration which applied to the 
Company during the 2010 ﬁnancial year. The UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010 will apply to the 
Company from the 2011 ﬁnancial year and will be reported upon in the 2011 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code 
provisions set out in Section B of the Combined Code except, as explained on 
page 80, performance-related pay measures did not apply to the Chairman, 
who was the only Executive Director (provision B.1.1). 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the Company’s 
members on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion 
those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for 
unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises Mr. G S Menéndez 
(Chairman), Mr. C H Bailey and Mr. W M Hayes, all of whom are considered 
by the Board to be independent Non-Executive Directors. Mr. W M Hayes 
replaced Mr. D E Yarur, who retired from the Remuneration Committee 
on 29 November 2010.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are fully set out in its 
Terms of Reference which are available from the Company’s registered ofﬁce 
and may be viewed on the Company’s website – www.antofagasta.co.uk. 
The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration policy and for reviewing 
the remuneration of any Executive Directors and, where appropriate, it consults 
the Chairman, Mr. J-P Luksic. The Committee used benchmarking data from 
various sources, but did not appoint external consultants to advise on Directors’ 
remuneration during the year. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible 
for monitoring the level and structure of remuneration of Group senior 
management and evaluating management performance. The remuneration 
of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole. No Director 
participates in the determination of his own remuneration.
Company policy on Directors’ pay and bonuses
The Company’s policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with 
regard to responsibilities undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels in 
the United Kingdom, in Chile, and in the international mining industry. Corporate 
and individual performance is taken into account in setting the pay level for the 
Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is reviewed on an annual basis to 
ensure it remains in line with companies of a similar nature, size and complexity. 
Remuneration levels for Non-Executive Directors are based on comparable levels 
for companies of a similar nature, size and complexity, and take into account 
speciﬁc responsibilities undertaken. Remuneration includes fees paid for 
non-executive directorships of subsidiary companies and joint ventures 
within the Group. The Board does not consider it appropriate to make regular 
performance-related pay awards such as bonuses to the only Executive Director, 
Mr. J-P Luksic, given his role as Chairman of the Board and his interest in 
the Company’s shares both directly and as a member of the Luksic family. 
The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services to the Group. During the 
year, exceptional bonuses were paid in respect of Mr. Jara and to a number of 
long-serving senior executives recognising their contribution to long-term value 
creation of the Group over the years from the development of the Los Pelambres 
mine in the late 1990s to the commissioning of the Esperanza mine towards 
the end of 2010. The aggregate amount of the bonuses was US$8.8 million. 
No Director currently receives pension contributions.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors in respect of Antofagasta plc 
were as follows:
2010 
US$000
2009 
US$000
Base fee 100 100
Audit Committee chairman 20 20
Audit Committee member 10 10
Remuneration Committee chairman 16 16
Remuneration Committee member 10 10
Nomination Committee chairman 10 10
Nomination Committee member 4 4
In addition to the above amounts, Non-Executive Directors also receive fees in 
their capacity as Non-Executive Directors of the principal operating subsidiary 
companies and joint ventures within the Group. As some of these fees are set 
in Chilean pesos, the US dollar payments made in respect of such fees may vary 
depending on the applicable exchange rate from time to time. These additional 
fees are included within the amounts attributable to the Directors within the table 
of Directors’ remuneration on page 83.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
Mr. J-P Luksic has a contract for services with both the Antofagasta Railway 
Company plc and Antofagasta Minerals S.A. Both contracts for services can 
be terminated by either party on one month’s notice. There is also a contract 
between Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and Asesorías Ramón F Jara Ltda for the 
provision of advisory services by Mr. R F Jara which can also be terminated on 
one month’s notice. The amounts payable under these contracts for services 
are denominated in Chilean pesos and as is typical for employment contracts or 
contracts for services in Chile, are adjusted in line with Chilean inﬂation, and are 
also reviewed periodically in line with the Company’s policy on Directors’ pay 
although no changes were made in 2010. Amounts paid during 2009 and 
2010 have been included in the table of Directors’ remuneration on page 83. 
All Non-Executive Directors (other than Mr. Menéndez, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Baker and 
Mr. Dryland) have letters of appointment with the Company, for an initial period 
of three years from the date of their appointment, subject to re-appointment 
at each Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) during their period of appointment. 
Mr. Menéndez, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Baker and Mr. Dryland are each appointed for a 
one-year period from the date of their appointment, subject to re-appointment 
at the AGM following their appointment. The Company intends to comply with 
provision B.7 of the UK Corporate Governance Code from the 2011 ﬁnancial 
year and submit each Director for annual re-election. These letters require 
the Non-Executive Directors to undertake that they will have sufﬁcient time 
to discharge their responsibilities. The appointments may be terminated by 
either party on one month’s notice. The letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal business hours 
and at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting). The service 
contracts and letters of appointment do not provide for any compensation for loss 
of ofﬁce beyond payments in lieu of notice, and therefore the maximum amount 
payable upon termination of these contracts is limited to one month’s payment.
Share options and long-term incentive schemes
No arrangements exist to enable Directors to acquire beneﬁts through the 
acquisition of shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, 
to beneﬁt through proﬁt-related pay or share option schemes or to participate 
in any long-term incentive schemes.
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company at the beginning and end 
of the year were as follows:

There have been no changes to the Directors’ interests in the shares of the 
Company between 31 December 2010 and the date of this report. 
The Directors had no interests in the shares of the Company during the year 
other than the interests in the table set out above. No Director had any material 
interest in any other contract with the Company or its subsidiary undertakings 
during the year other than in the ordinary course of business. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s performance compared to the 
performance of the FTSE All-Share Index over a ﬁve-year period, measured by 
total shareholder return (as deﬁned below). The FTSE All-Share Index has been 
selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based index to 
which the Company belongs and which relates to the London Stock Exchange, 
the market where the Company’s ordinary shares are traded. Total shareholder 
return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding 
over a speciﬁed period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional shares at the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date. 
Total shareholder return for the FTSE All-Share Index is calculated by 
aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of the FTSE at the end 
of the ﬁve-year period.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial 
statements. Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements 
for each ﬁnancial year. The Directors are required to prepare ﬁnancial statements 
for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and have chosen to prepare Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”). 
In the case of the Group’s IFRS ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year 
the Group’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires 
the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial 
Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
–  properly select and apply accounting policies;
–  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
–  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements 
in IFRS are insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and 
ﬁnancial performance; and
–  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In the case of the Company’s UK GAAP ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are 
required to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt and loss 
of the Company for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
–  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
–  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
–  state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; 
and
–  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
We conﬁrm to the best of our knowledge:
(a)  the Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, 
and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and 
proﬁt of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
(b)  the Company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK 
GAAP , and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position 
and proﬁt of the Company; and
(c)  the Directors’ Report, including those sections incorporated therein by 
reference, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and the related Notes 1 to 41. 
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Group ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
–  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of the 
Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
–  the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
–  the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
–  the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the Group 
ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
–  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
–  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the 
ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
–  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
–  the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
–  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
–  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
–  the Directors’ statement contained within the Financial Review in relation 
to going concern; 
–  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code 
speciﬁed for our review; and
–  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ 
remuneration.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Basis of Preparation
a) Accounting standards applied
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. For these purposes, IFRS comprise the Standards issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Interpretations issued by the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) that have been endorsed by the European 
Union (“EU”).
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the factors 
which have been taken into account in assessing the Group’s going concern status are set out 
on page 67 of the Financial Review.
The prior year balance sheet reﬂects a reclassiﬁcation of certain balances between cash and 
cash equivalents and liquid investments to better reﬂect the maturity terms of the underlying 
instruments. At 31 December 2009 this results in a cash and cash equivalents balance of 
US$2,590.5 million and a new liquid investments balance of US$631.8 million (31 December 
2008 – US$2,813.1 million and US$544.9 million). This has resulted in certain reclassiﬁcations 
within the cash ﬂow statement.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following Standards and 
Interpretations which have not been applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not 
yet effective:
– IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
– IAS 24 (amended) Related Party Disclosures
– IAS 32 (amended) Classiﬁcation of Rights Issue
– IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments
– IFRIC 14 (amended) Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement 
– Improvements to IFRSs (May 2010)
The adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classiﬁcation and measurement of the Group’s 
ﬁnancial assets. The Group does not expect that the adoption of the other standards listed above 
will have a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group in future periods.
b) Adoption of new accounting standards
In the current ﬁnancial year the Group has adopted the following standards that have affected 
the presentation and disclosure in these ﬁnancial statements:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008). In the current year the Group has adopted IFRS 3 
Business Combinations (2008) for accounting for business combinations. The change in 
accounting policy has been applied prospectively. For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, 
the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred and the 
recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognised 
amount of the identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the 
acquisition date. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity 
securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as 
incurred. The revised standard was applied to the acquisition of the 40% controlling interest in 
Twin Metals Minnesota LLC. See Note 31 for further details of this business combination which 
occurred in 2010.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2008). In the current year the Group 
has adopted IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2008) for accounting 
for acquisitions of non-controlling interests. The change in accounting policy has been applied 
prospectively and there was no impact on the Group’s results in the current year. From 1 January 
2010 a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary (without loss of control) is accounted for 
as an equity transaction.
The following standards and interpretations are effective but have not had any signiﬁcant impact 
on the ﬁnancial statements:
– IFRS 2 (amended) Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions
– IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
2 Principal Accounting Policies
a) Accounting convention
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed 
by the use of fair values to measure certain ﬁnancial instruments, principally provisionally priced 
sales as explained in Note 2(d) and ﬁnancial derivative contracts as explained in Note 2(t).
b) Basis of consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements comprise the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Antofagasta plc 
(“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”).
(i)  Subsidiaries – A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has power to govern the 
operating and ﬁnancial policies in order to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. The consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash ﬂows of 
the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating inter-company balances and transactions. 
For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets and net earnings attributable to non-controlling 
shareholders are presented as “Non-controlling interests” in the consolidated balance sheet 
and consolidated income statement.
(ii)  Associates – An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or joint control, through the power to participate in the 
ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of that entity. The Group’s share of the net assets, 
the results post-tax and post-acquisition reserves of associates are included in the ﬁnancial 
statements. This requires recording the investment initially at cost to the Group and then, in 
subsequent periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reﬂect the Group’s 
share of the associate’s results less any impairment of goodwill and any other changes to 
the associate’s net assets such as dividends.
(iii)  Jointly controlled entities – A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds 
a long-term interest and shares joint control over the operating and ﬁnancial decisions with 
one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement. Jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using proportionate consolidation, which combines the Group’s share of the 
results of the jointly controlled entity on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Group’s 
ﬁnancial statements.
(iv)  Other investments – The accounting treatment of investments which are not 
subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities is set out in Note 2(t) relating to 
other ﬁnancial instruments.
(v)  Acquisitions and disposals – Acquisitions and disposals are treated as explained in 
Note 2(e) relating to business combinations and goodwill.
c) Currency translation
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which it operates. Transactions other than those in the functional 
currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are 
retranslated at year end exchange rates. Gains and losses on retranslation are included in net 
proﬁt or loss for the period within other ﬁnance items.
The presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Company is the 
US dollar. On consolidation, income statement items for entities with a functional currency other 
than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange. Balance sheet 
items are translated at period-end exchange rates. Exchange differences on translation of the 
net assets of such entities are taken to equity and recorded in a separate currency translation 
reserve. Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition date to IFRS are 
recognised as income or as expenses in the income statement in the period in which an 
operation is disposed.
On consolidation, exchange gains and losses which arise on balances between Group entities 
are taken to reserves where that balance is, in substance, part of the net investment in a foreign 
operation, i.e. where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. 
All other exchange gains and losses on Group balances are dealt with in the income statement.
Fair value adjustments and any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated 
as assets of the foreign entity and translated at the period-end rate.
d) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties during the year. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, and excludes 
any applicable sales tax. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
93 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
A sale is recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have passed. This is 
generally when title and any insurance risk has passed to the customer, and the goods have 
been delivered to a contractually agreed location or when any services have been provided.
Revenue from mining activities is recorded at the invoiced amounts with an adjustment for 
provisional pricing at each reporting date, as explained below. For copper and molybdenum 
concentrates, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing, the invoiced 
amount is the market value of the metal payable by the customer, net of deductions for tolling 
charges. Revenue includes amounts from the sale of by-products.
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements 
generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment, with ﬁnal pricing based 
on the monthly average London Metal Exchange (“LME”) copper price or the monthly average 
market molybdenum price for speciﬁed future periods. This normally ranges from 30 to 120 days 
after delivery to the customer. Such a provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is 
required to be separated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of metals contained 
in the concentrate or cathode at the provisional invoice price less tolling charges deducted, and 
the embedded derivative is the forward contract for which the provisional sale is subsequently 
adjusted. At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal sales together with any related 
tolling charges are marked-to-market, with adjustments (both gains and losses) being recorded 
in revenue in the consolidated income statement and in trade debtors in the balance sheet. 
Forward prices at the period end are used for copper concentrate and cathode sales, while 
period-end average prices are used for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence 
of a futures market.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive 
payment has been established.
e) Business combinations and goodwill
(i)  Acquisitions – The results of businesses acquired during the year are brought into the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the effective date of acquisition. The identiﬁable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, joint venture entity or an associate 
which can be measured reliably are recorded at their provisional fair values at the date 
of acquisition. Provisional fair values are ﬁnalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, 
the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value 
or at non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquirer’s net assets.
(ii)  Goodwill – Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as the excess of the 
sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree 
(if any) over the next identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any goodwill on the 
acquisition of subsidiaries is separately disclosed, while any goodwill on the acquisition of 
associates is included within investments in equity accounted entities. Internally generated 
goodwill is not recognised. Where the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired 
exceed the sum of the consideration transferred, the surplus (which represents the discount 
on the acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
(iii)  Transactions with non-controlling interests – The Group treats transactions with 
non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases 
from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the 
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in 
equity. When the Group ceases to have control or signiﬁcant inﬂuence, any retained interest 
in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised 
in proﬁt or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or ﬁnancial asset. 
Any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that 
entity are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt and loss.
(iv)  Disposals – The results of businesses sold during the year are included in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements for the period up to the effective date of disposal. Gains or losses on 
disposal are calculated as the difference between the sales proceeds (net of expenses) 
and the net assets attributable to the interest which has been sold. Where a disposal 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, the net 
results attributable to the disposed entity are shown separately in the income statement.
f) Intangible assets
(i)  Concession rights – In 2003, the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary, Aguas de Antofagasta 
S.A., was awarded a 30-year concession to operate the water rights and facilities in the 
Antofagasta Region of Chile previously controlled by Empresa Concesionaria de Servicios 
Sanitarios S.A. (“ECONSSA”). All infrastructure assets relating to the Water concession 
are recorded within intangible assets, as part of the “concession rights”. The concession 
rights also includes an amount recognised in respect of the right to use those assets 
not recognised as their lives extend substantially beyond the period of the concession. 
The concession rights is measured as the difference between the cost of the concession 
and the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition plus the fair value of 
any further assets transferred to the Group by way of concession subsequent to acquisition.
(ii)  Exploration licences – In 2006, the Group acquired Tethyan Copper Company Limited 
(“Tethyan”), a company with copper-gold interests in Pakistan, and entered into a joint 
venture over Tethyan’s mineral interests with Barrick Gold Corporation through the disposal 
of a 50% interest in Tethyan. An intangible asset has been recognised for the Group’s 
proportionate share of the full unencumbered value attributed to the interest in the 
exploration licences held by Tethyan in Pakistan, along with related rights acquired 
subsequently. In addition, the intangible asset balance also includes amounts relating 
to interests in other prospecting licences.
g) Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation are expensed in the year in which it is incurred. When a decision 
is taken that a mining project is commercially viable (normally when the project has reached 
the feasibility stage) all further directly attributable pre-production expenditure is capitalised. 
Capitalisation of pre-production expenditure ceases when commercial levels of production 
are achieved.
h) Property, plant and equipment
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing 
mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment in the year 
in which they are incurred, when a decision has been taken that a mining project is commercially 
viable (normally when the project has reached the feasibility stage).
The cost of plant, property and equipment comprises the purchase price and any costs directly 
attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended. Once a project has been established as commercially viable, 
related development expenditure is capitalised. This includes costs incurred in preparing the site 
for mining operations, including pre-stripping costs. Capitalisation ceases when the mine is 
capable of commercial production, with the exception of development costs which give rise 
to a future beneﬁt.
Interest on borrowings directly related to construction or development of projects is capitalised, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale which, in the 
case of mining properties, is when they are capable of commercial production.
i) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the 
operation if shorter, to residual value. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are 
depreciated as follows:
(i)  Land – freehold land is not depreciated. Any leasehold land is depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease.
(ii)  Mining properties – mining properties, including capitalised ﬁnancing costs, are 
depreciated on a unit of production basis, in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in 
the year compared with total proven and probable reserves at the beginning of the year.
(iii) Buildings and infrastructure – straight-line basis over 10 to 25 years.
(iv) Railway track (including trackside equipment) – straight-line basis over 20 to 25 years.
(v) Wagons and rolling stock – straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years.
(vi) Machinery, equipment and other assets – straight-line basis over 5 to 10 years.
(vii) Assets under construction – no depreciation until asset is available for use.
(viii)  Assets held under ﬁnance lease – are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and their useful life. Financial Statements
94 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2 Principal Accounting Policies continued
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at least annually, 
and changes to residual values and useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
The concession right is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the concession, 
or the useful life of any component part if less.
j) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
(excluding goodwill)
Property, plant and equipment and ﬁnite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if 
there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. Any intangible asset with an indeﬁnite useful life is tested for impairment 
annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value, using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
For mining properties, estimates of future cash ﬂows are based on assumptions as to expected 
production levels, commodity prices, cash costs of production and capital expenditure. 
IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” includes a number of restrictions on the future cash ﬂows that 
can be recognised in respect of future restructurings and improvement-related expenditure. 
When calculating value in use, it also requires that calculations should be based on exchange 
rates current at the time of assessment. For operations with a functional currency other than 
the US dollar, the impairment review is conducted in the relevant functional currency.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment 
charge is recognised in the income statement immediately. Where an impairment subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of recoverable amount, but so 
that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying value that would have been 
determined if no impairment had previously been recognised. A reversal is recognised in the 
income statement immediately.
k) Investment property
Investment property is property held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation and includes 
land held for a currently undetermined future use. The Group has elected to adopt the cost model 
in IAS 40 “Investment Property”. Accordingly, investment property is measured initially at cost, 
which includes transaction costs for the acquisition of the property and, as detailed in Note 2(i) 
relating to property, plant and equipment, is not depreciated.
l) Inventory
Inventory and work-in-progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion 
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The production cost of inventory 
includes an appropriate proportion of depreciation and production overheads. Raw materials 
and consumables are valued at cost on a weighted average basis. Finished products are 
valued at raw material cost, plus labour cost and a proportion of production overhead 
expenses including depreciation.
m) Taxation
Tax expense comprises the charges or credits for the period relating to both current and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt may differ from net proﬁt as 
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable and deductible in different years and also excludes items that are not taxable or 
deductible. The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates for each entity in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences 
(i.e. differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements 
and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable proﬁt). Deferred tax is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary 
differences with certain limited exceptions as follows:
(i)  tax payable on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is 
provided except where the Group is able to control the remittance of proﬁts and it is probable 
that there will be no remittance of past proﬁts earned in the foreseeable future;
(ii)  deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that does not affect accounting proﬁt or taxable proﬁt and is not a business combination; nor 
is deferred tax provided on subsequent changes in the carrying value of such assets and 
liabilities, for example where they are depreciated; and
(iii) the initial recognition of any goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be 
recovered through sufﬁcient future taxable proﬁt. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also taken directly to equity.
n) Provisions for decommissioning and restoration costs
An obligation to incur decommissioning and restoration costs occurs when environmental 
disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining property. Costs are 
estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular formal review.
Such costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to 
their net present value, are provided and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the 
obligation to incur such costs arises. These decommissioning costs are charged against proﬁts 
over the life of the mine, through depreciation of the asset and unwinding or amortisation of the 
discount on the provision. Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding of the 
discount is included as ﬁnancing costs. Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the 
decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost 
of the related asset in the current period.
The costs for restoration of site damage, which is created on an ongoing basis during production, 
are provided for at their net present values and charged against operating proﬁts as extraction 
progresses. Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to site damage created during 
production is charged against operating proﬁt.
o) Provision for termination of Water concession
Under the terms of the Water concession from ECONSSA, certain items of working capital 
recognised by Aguas de Antofagasta (as described in Note 2(f) above) are to be transferred to 
the state-owned operator ECONSSA at the end of the concession period for nil consideration. 
Provision is made for the estimated net present value of these assets and liabilities which are 
expected to be in existence when the concession comes to an end. The unwinding of the 
discount is charged within ﬁnancing costs. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

p) Post-employment beneﬁts
The Group operates deﬁned contribution schemes for a limited number of employees. For such 
schemes, the amount charged to the income statement is the contributions paid or payable 
in the year.
Employment terms may also provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment 
contract comes to an end. This is typically at the rate of one month for each year of service 
(subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of service) and based on 
ﬁnal salary level. The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt 
plan, and the calculation is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the 
projected unit credit method which are regularly updated. The obligation recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the severance indemnity obligation. Actuarial gains 
and losses are immediately recognised in the income statement within operating cost.
q) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to 
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value, net of bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand. 
Cash and cash equivalents normally have a maturity period of 90 days or less.
r) Liquid investments
Liquid investments represent highly liquid current asset investments that do not meet the IAS 7 
deﬁnition of cash and cash equivalents, normally because even if readily accessible, the 
underlying investments have an average maturity proﬁle greater than 90 days. These assets 
are designated as fair value through proﬁt or loss.
s) Leases
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement account in equal 
annual amounts over the term of the lease.
Assets under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at inception of the lease 
at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments derived by 
discounting at the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest element is charged within 
ﬁnancing costs so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability.
t) Other ﬁnancial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
(i)  Investments – Investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are 
initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
  Investments are classiﬁed as either held for trading or available-for-sale, and are normally 
measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner 
described in Note 25(b). Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market 
price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at 
cost. Securities are classiﬁed as “held-for-trading” when they are acquired principally for the 
purpose of sale in the short-term, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value 
are included in the income statement for the period. Other investments are classiﬁed as 
“available-for-sale”, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity, within the “Fair value reserve”, until the security is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in equity is included in the income statement for the period. Dividends on available-for-sale 
equity investments are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive 
payment is established.
(ii)  Trade and other receivables – Trade and other receivables do not generally carry any 
interest and are normally stated at their nominal value less any impairment. Impairment 
losses on trade receivables are recognised within an allowance account unless the Group 
considers that no recovery of the amount is possible, in which case the carrying value of the 
asset is reduced directly.
(iii)  Trade and other payables – Trade and other payables are generally not interest-bearing 
and are normally stated at their nominal value.
(iv)  Borrowings (loans and preference shares) – Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts 
are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life of the ﬁnancial liability, or, where appropriate, 
a shorter period. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest 
rate method. Amounts are either recorded as ﬁnancing costs in the income statement or 
capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2(h). Finance charges 
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in 
the period in which they arise. The sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the 
Company carry a ﬁxed rate of return without the right to participate in any surplus. They are 
accordingly classiﬁed within borrowings and translated into US dollars at period-end rates 
of exchange. Preference share dividends are included within ﬁnance costs.
(v)  Equity instruments – Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net 
of direct issue costs. Equity instruments of the Company comprise its sterling denominated 
issued ordinary share capital and related share premium. As explained in Note 2(c), 
the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Company 
is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share premium are translated into US dollars 
at historical rates of exchange based on dates of issue.
(vi)  Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – As explained in Note 25(e), the Group uses derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity 
price movements. The Group does not use such derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
The Group applies the hedge accounting provisions and changes in the fair value of 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash 
ﬂows are recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the 
income statement in the period when the hedged item affects proﬁt or loss. Any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Realised gains and losses on 
commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement are recorded within revenue. 
The time value element of changes in the fair value of derivative options is excluded from 
the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in the income 
statement within other ﬁnance items. Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments 
or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are 
not carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported in the income statement for the 
period. The treatment of embedded derivatives arising from provisionally-priced commodity 
sales contracts is set out in further detail in Note 2(d) relating to revenue.
(vii)  Impairment of ﬁnancial assets – Financial assets, other than those at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events 
that occurred after the initial recognition of the ﬁnancial asset the estimated future cash 
ﬂows of the investment have been impacted. For loans and receivables the amount of the 
impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and the present value of 
estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Any impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
  The carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all 
ﬁnancial assets with the exception of trade receivables.
  With the exception of available-for-sale equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the 
amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed through the income statement immediately to the extent that the carrying 
amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the 
amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. In respect of 
available-for-sale equity instruments, any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment 
loss is recognised directly in equity. Financial Statements

3 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation 
Uncertainty
Determining many of the amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements involves the use of 
judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but 
actual results may differ from the amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements. Information 
about such judgements and estimates is included in the principal accounting policies in Note 2 
or the other notes to the ﬁnancial statements, and the key areas are set out below.
a) Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment and ore reserves estimates
As explained in Note 2(i), mining properties, including capitalised ﬁnancing costs, are depreciated 
in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven and probable 
reserves at the beginning of the year.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that 
were valid at the time of estimation may change when new information becomes available. 
These include assumptions as to grade estimates and cut-off grades, recovery rates, commodity 
prices, exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and reclamation costs and 
discount rates. The actual volume of ore extracted and any changes in these assumptions could 
affect prospective depreciation rates and carrying values.
The majority of other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over their useful economic lives. Management reviews the appropriateness of useful 
economic lives at least annually and, again, any changes could affect prospective depreciation 
rates and asset carrying values.
b) Impairment of assets
As explained in Note 2(j), the Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are 
impaired. In making assessments for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash 
ﬂows are allocated to an appropriate cash-generating unit (“CGU”). The recoverable amount 
of those assets, or CGU, is measured at the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use.
Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets to CGUs, in estimating the 
probability, timing and value of underlying cash ﬂows and in selecting appropriate discount rates 
to be applied within the value in use calculation. The key assumptions are set out in Note 2(j) and 
Note 5. Subsequent changes to CGU allocation or estimates and assumptions in the value in use 
calculation could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
c) Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs
As explained in Note 2(n), provision is made, based on net present values, for decommissioning 
and site rehabilitation costs as soon as the obligation arises following the development or 
ongoing production of a mining property. The provision is based on a closure plan prepared with 
the assistance of external consultants.
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for and (in the case of capitalised 
decommissioning costs) amortise these estimated costs over the life of the mine. The ultimate 
cost of decommissioning and site rehabilitation cost is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in 
response to many factors including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence of 
new restoration techniques or experience at other mine sites.
The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change, for example in response to 
changes in ore reserves or processing levels. As a result, there could be signiﬁcant adjustments 
to the provisions established which would affect future ﬁnancial results.
d) Post-employment beneﬁts
As explained in Note 2(p), the expected costs of severance indemnities relating to employee 
service during the period are charged to the income statement. Any actuarial gains or losses, 
which can arise from differences between expected and actual outcomes or changes in actuarial 
assumptions, are recognised immediately within operating costs in the income statement.
Assumptions in respect of the expected costs are set in consultation with an independent 
actuary. These include the selection of the discount rate used, service lives and expected rates 
of salary increases. While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, a change 
in the assumptions used would impact the earnings of the Group.
e) Deferred taxation
As explained in Note 2(m), deferred tax is not provided for future tax payable on undistributed 
earnings where the Group is able to control the remittance of proﬁts and it is probable that there 
will be no remittance of past proﬁts earned in the foreseeable future.
Management uses its judgement in estimating the probability of such remittances. These are 
based on Group forecasts and include assumptions as to future proﬁts and cash ﬂows 
(which depend on several factors including commodity prices, operating costs, production levels, 
capital expenditures, interest costs, debt repayment and tax rates) and cash requirements 
(which may also depend on several factors including future dividend levels). A change in the 
assumptions used or in the estimate as to the probability that past proﬁts will be remitted would 
impact the deferred tax charge and balance sheet provision. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

prepared using management’s forecasts as to future commodity prices, operating costs and production volumes. The present value of the forecast future cash ﬂows was calculated using a discount 
rate of 7.6% (initial impairment review – 9.9%). Financial Statements

6 Segment Information
The Group’s reportable segments are as follows:
– Los Pelambres
– El Tesoro
– Michilla
– Esperanza
– Exploration and evaluation
– Railway and other transport services
– Water concession
– Corporate and other items
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three business divisions based on their products – Mining, Railway and other transport services and the Water concession. The mining 
division is split further for management reporting purposes to show results by mine and exploration and evaluation activity. Los Pelambres, El Tesoro and Michilla are all operating mines and 
Esperanza is a mine which was under construction during 2010. Los Pelambres produces primarily copper concentrate and molybdenum as a by-product. El Tesoro and Michilla both produce 
copper cathodes. The transport division provides rail cargo (based in Chile and Bolivia) and road cargo (based in Chile) together with a number of ancillary services (based in Chile). The Water division 
produces and distributes potable water to domestic customers and untreated water to industrial customers in Chile’s Antofagasta Region. The Exploration and evaluation segment incurs exploration 
and evaluation expenses. Exploration costs relating to Tethyan Copper Company Limited (“Tethyan”) are included within the Exploration and evaluation segment, and all other Tethyan-related costs 
are included within “Corporate and other items”. Corporate and other items also comprise costs incurred by the Company and Antofagasta Minerals S.A., the Group’s mining corporate centre, that 
are not allocated to any individual business segment. Consistent with its internal management reporting, the Group’s corporate and other items are included within the Mining division.
Management monitors the operating results of business segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated and of assessing performance. 
Segment performance is evaluated based on the operating proﬁt of each of the segments.

(i)  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. Operating proﬁt excludes the share of net loss from associates of US$2.6 million 
(year ended 31 December 2009 – income of US$4.5 million). Operating proﬁt is shown after exceptional items (see Note 5).
(ii)  Inter-segment revenues are eliminated on consolidation. Revenue from the Railway and other transport services is stated after eliminating inter-segmental sales to the Mining division 
of US$13.5 million (year ended 31 December 2009 – US$11.6 million). Revenue from the Water concession is stated after eliminating inter-segmental sales to the Mining division of 
US$10.5 million (year ended 31 December 2009 – US$8.6 million) and after eliminating sales to the Railway and other transport services of US$0.2 million (year ended 31 December 
2009 – US$0.2 million). The payment of US$350 million by El Tesoro to Antofagasta Minerals S.A. for the right to extract the oxide ores from the Mirador deposit has been eliminated on 
consolidation and so does not form part of the above ﬁgures.
(iii)  Revenue includes the effect of both ﬁnal pricing and mark-to-market adjustments to provisionally priced sales of copper and molybdenum concentrates and copper cathodes. Further details 
of such adjustments are given in Note 25(d).
(iv)  Revenue includes a realised gain on commodity derivatives at El Tesoro of US$0.1 million (year ended 31 December 2009 – loss of US$20.0 million) and a realised loss at Michilla of 
US$81.5 million (year ended 31 December 2009 – loss of US$45.8 million). Further details of such gains or losses are given in Note 25(e).
(v) The copper and molybdenum concentrate sales are stated net of deductions for tolling charges. Tolling charges for copper and molybdenum concentrates are detailed in Note 25(d).
(vi) Exceptional items affecting operating proﬁt in 2010 relate to a reversal of the impairment at El Tesoro (see Note 5).
(vii)  Capital expenditure represents purchases of property, plant and equipment stated on an accruals basis (see Note 14) and may therefore differ from the amount included in the cash 
ﬂow statement.
(viii)  The assets of the Railway and transport services segment includes US$53.1 million relating to the Group’s 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos S.A. (“Inversiones Hornitos”), which owns the 
150MW Hornitos thermoelectric power plant in Mejillones, under construction in Chile’s Antofagasta Region and US$4.9 million relating to the Group’s 30% interest in Antofagasta Terminal 
Internacional S.A.(“ATI”), which operates a concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta. Financial Statements

10 Taxation
The tax charge for the year comprised the following:
2010 
US$m
2009 
US$m
Current tax charge
– Corporate tax (principally ﬁrst category tax in Chile)  (437.4) (161.6)
– Mining tax (Royalty) (147.3) (41.4)
– Withholding tax provision (47.4) (0.4)
– Exchange gains on corporate tax balances 0.6  18.3 
 (631.5) (185.1)
Deferred tax charge
– Corporate tax (principally ﬁrst category tax in Chile)  2.9  (91.2)
– Mining tax (Royalty) (10.4) (13.7)
– Withholding tax provision (113.5) (27.7)
 (121.0) (132.6)
Total tax charge (Income tax expense) (752.5) (317.7)
The rate of ﬁrst category (i.e. corporation) tax in Chile was 17% for both 2010 and 2009. A temporary increase in the corporate income tax rate for the 2011 and 2012 calendar years to 20.0% 
and 18.5% respectively was enacted into law in Chile on 31 July 2010. 
Los Pelambres, El Tesoro, Michilla and Esperanza are also subject to a mining tax (royalty) which is tax deductible (i.e. an allowable expense in determining liability to ﬁrst category tax). 
On 12 January 2011 the Group voluntarily elected to accept amendments to the mining tax as permitted pursuant to a law enacted in Chile on 21 October 2010. Between 2010–2012, production 
from Los Pelambres, El Tesoro, Michilla and Esperanza mines is subject to a mining tax at a rate of between 4%–9% of tax-adjusted operating proﬁt, based on a sliding scale with the minimum rate 
of 4% applying to operations with a tax-adjusted operating proﬁt margin of below 40% and a maximum rate of 9% applying to operations with a tax-adjusted operating proﬁt margin of above 75%. 
Production from the Tesoro North-East deposit and the Run-of-Mine processing at El Tesoro is subject to a mining tax at a rate of between 5%–14% of tax-adjusted operating proﬁt, based on a 
sliding scale with the minimum rate of 5% applying to operations with a tax-adjusted operating proﬁt margin of below 35% and a maximum rate of 14% applying to operations with a tax-adjusted 
operating proﬁt margin of above 85%. 
In addition to ﬁrst category tax and the mining tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on the remittance of proﬁts from Chile and deferred tax is provided on undistributed earnings to the extent that 
remittance is probable in the foreseeable future. Withholding tax is levied on remittances of proﬁts from Chile at 35% less ﬁrst category tax already paid. Accordingly, during the year ended 
31 December 2010 the effective tax rate of withholding tax is approximately 18% of the amount remitted or expected to be remitted.

Exchange differences 0.6 –  18.3  (1.3)
Tax expense and effective tax rate for the year (752.5) 29.2  (317.7) 22.1 
The tax charge for the year was US$752.5 million and the effective tax rate was 29.2%. This rate varies from the standard rate principally due to the provision of withholding tax of US$160.9 million 
and the effect of the mining tax which resulted in a charge of US$157.7 million. In 2009 the total tax charge was US$317.7 million and the effective tax rate was 22.1%. This rate varies from the 
standard rate principally due to the provision of withholding tax of US$28.1 million, the effect of the mining tax which resulted in a charge of US$55.1 million and exchange gains of US$18.3 million 
on Chilean peso denominated tax prepayments due to the strengthening of the Chilean peso during the year.  Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

In accordance with IAS 32, preference dividends have been included within interest expense (see Note 9) and amounted to US$0.2 million (2009 – US$0.2 million).

The concession rights relates to the 30-year concession to operate the water rights and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile which the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Aguas de Antofagasta S.A., 
acquired in December 2003 and any other subsequent additions or acquisitions subject to the terms of the concession. This intangible asset is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
concession, or the useful life of any component part if less.
The exploration licences relate to the US$120.7 million value attributed to the exploration licences in the Reko Diq area of south-west Pakistan. This asset is subject to the grant of a mining lease for which 
an application has been made and the successful conclusion of litigation as set out in Note 38. This intangible asset will be amortised in accordance with the Group’s policy for mining properties when the 
related mining properties enter into production. 
After evaluation of the results of the exploration activities to date the Group has decided not to proceed further with the partnership with TEAL Exploration & Mining Incorporated (“TEAL ”), and accordingly 
has withdrawn from the agreement. The US$5.0 million disposal relates to the Group’s interests in the mining licences relating to the project with TEAL. Further details are disclosed in Note 32.  Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

Investment property represents the Group’s forestry properties, which are held for long-term potential and accordingly classiﬁed as investment property and held at cost as permitted by IAS 40. 
The fair value of the Group’s investment property at 31 December 2010 was US$11.0 million (2009 – US$11.0 million), based on an independent valuation carried out during 2008 by Gabriel 
Durán, who is not connected with the Group. Mr. Durán is a Forestry Engineer, Valuer and Assessor of forestry properties for Banco Itau in Chile, with extensive experience of valuation in the region 
where the assets are located. The valuation was based on market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
Direct operating expenses (principally ongoing maintenance costs) arising on these properties amounted to US$0.3 million (2009 – US$0.2 million).

The investments which are included in the US$58.0 million balance at 31 December 2010 are set out below: 
(i) The Group’s 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos S.A., which owns the 150MW Hornitos thermoelectric power plant in Mejillones, in Chile’s Antofagasta Region. 
(ii) The Group’s 30% interest in ATI, which operates a concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta.
During December 2010 the Group sold its 17.8% interest in Sunridge Gold Corp (“Sunridge”) for US$17.5 million resulting in a gain of US$15.1 million. Although the Group held less than a 20% 
interest in Sunridge, the Group’s representation on the board of directors of Sunridge gave it signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the entity and it was therefore accounted for as an associate. 
During 2010 a capital restructuring of Inversiones Hornitos took place, with the FCAB’s previous capital contributions being reduced by US$57.2 million and replaced with loan ﬁnancing from the 
FCAB, with the FCAB contributing US$78.6 million of further loan ﬁnancing to Inversiones Hornitos during the year. The balance due from Inversiones Hornitos to the Group at 31 December 2010 
was US$101.1 million (year ended 31 December 2009 – US$22.5 million).

18 Joint Venture Agreements
a) Tethyan Copper Company Limited
In 2006 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tethyan Copper Company Limited (“Tethyan”) for cash consideration (including transaction costs) of US$170.4 million. 
In the same year, the Group subsequently entered into a joint venture agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick Gold”), to establish a 50:50 joint venture in relation to Tethyan’s mineral 
interests in Pakistan.
From the date of incorporation to 2010, Tethyan was wholly engaged in mineral exploration and evaluation activities and did not generate any revenue. Tethyan’s operating loss resulting during 
the year was US$25.5 million (2009 – US$59.6 million), which relates mainly to exploration and evaluation costs expensed in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy and of which 50% 
is attributable to the Group. Further progress in this project is subject to the grant of a mining lease for which an application has been made and the successful conclusion of litigation as set out 
in Note 38.
The following amounts represent the Group’s 50% share of the assets and liabilities, and results of the jointly controlled entity, and are included in the consolidated balance sheet and in the 
consolidated income statement of the Group under the proportionate consolidation method:

In addition to these amounts, the Group incurred US$4.0 million (2009 – US$3.5 million) relating to Tethyan which is included in Corporate and other items.
b) Energía Andina S.A.
In October 2008, Energía Andina S.A. was formed as a vehicle for the exploration and exploitation of potential sources of geothermal energy. The company is 60% owned by the Group and 40% 
owned by Empresa Nacional del Petróleo (“ENAP”) of Chile. Control over the key operational and ﬁnancial decisions in respect of the company are jointly exercised by the Group and ENAP , 
and accordingly the company is accounted for as a jointly controlled entity, with results included in the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated income statement of the Group under 
the proportionate consolidation method.
In 2010 and 2009, Energía Andina S.A. was wholly engaged in geothermal exploration and evaluation activities and did not generate any revenue in the period after its incorporation. The operating 
loss resulting from Energía Andina S.A. for the year was US$6.7 million (2009 – US$2.4 million), which relates mainly to exploration and evaluation costs expensed in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy, and of which 60% is attributable to the Group.

There is no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large number of customers. The average credit period given on sale of goods 
and rendering of service is 55 days (2009 – 49 days). There is no material element which is interest-bearing. Trade debtors include mark-to-market adjustments in respect of provisionally priced 
sales of copper and molybdenum concentrates which remain open as to ﬁnal pricing; where these have resulted in credit balances, these have been reclassiﬁed to trade creditors.

With respect to the trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, there are no indications that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations. The carrying value of the trade receivables 
recorded in the ﬁnancial statements represents their maximum exposure to credit risk. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Other debtors include US$18.5 million (2009 – US$52.9 million) relating to prepayments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.

25 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management
a) Categories of ﬁnancial instruments
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments, grouped according to the categories deﬁned in IAS 39 
“Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement”, were as follows:

Financial assets
Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships 1.8  1.7 
Available-for-sale investments 21.8  1.2 
Loans and receivables (including cash and cash equivalents) 3,751.3  3,235.7 
Fair value through proﬁt and loss (restated) 806.9  631.8

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (2,706.0) (2,076.5)
 1,762.1  1,708.2 
b) Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
The fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are determined as follows:
–  the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities with standard terms and conditions 
and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices;
–  the fair values of other ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) 
are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted 
cash ﬂow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions; and
–  the fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices 
are not available, use is made of discounted cash ﬂow analysis based on the applicable yield 
curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing 
models for optional derivatives.
The fair value of each category of ﬁnancial asset and liability is not materially different from 
the carrying values presented for either 2010 or 2009.
The following table provides an analysis of the ﬁnancial instruments that are measured 
subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree 
to which the fair value is observable:
–  level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities;
–  level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices 
included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
–  level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that 
include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).

c) Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including commodity 
price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce exposure to commodity price, foreign 
exchange and interest rate movements. The Group does not use such derivative instruments 
for speculative trading purposes. 
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Board has established the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing 
and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and 
ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported 
to the Risk Management Committee.
(i) Commodity price risk
The Group generally sells its copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes output 
at prevailing market prices, subject to ﬁnal pricing adjustments which may be 30 to 120 days 
after delivery to the customer, and it is therefore exposed to changes in market prices for copper 
and molybdenum both in respect of future sales and previous sales which remain open as to 
ﬁnal pricing. In 2010, sales of copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes 
represented 93.0% of Group turnover and therefore revenues and earnings depend 
signiﬁcantly on LME and realised copper prices.
The Group uses futures, min-max instruments and options to manage its exposure to copper 
prices. These instruments may give rise to accounting volatility due to ﬂuctuations in their 
fair value prior to the maturity of the instruments. Details of those copper and molybdenum 
concentrate sales and copper cathode sales which remain open as to ﬁnal pricing are given 
in Note 25(d). Details of commodity rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given 
in Note 25(e). 
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the copper price on the 
ﬁnancial instruments held as at the reporting date. A movement in the copper forward price as at 
the reporting date will affect the ﬁnal pricing adjustment to sales which remain open at that date, 
impacting the trade receivables balance and consequently the income statement. A movement 
in the copper forward price will also affect the valuation of commodity derivatives, impacting the 
hedging reserve in equity if the fair value movement relates to an effective designated cash ﬂow 
hedge, and impacting the income statement if it does not. The calculation assumes that all other 
variables, such as currency rates, remain constant.
–  If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had increased by 10 cents, net earnings 
would have increased by US$6.1 million (2009 – US$0.2 million) and hedging reserves in 
equity would have decreased by US$34.9 million (2009 – US$13.8 million).
–  If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had decreased by 10 cents, net earnings 
would have decreased by US$5.4 million (2009 – US$0.4 million) and hedging reserves in 
equity would have increased by US$29.2 million (2009 – US$13.0 million).
In addition, a movement in the average copper price during the year would impact revenue 
and earnings. A 10 cents change in the average copper price during the year would affect net 
earnings by US$55.7 million (2009 – US$48.8 million) and earnings per share by 5.6 cents 
(2009 – 5.0 cents), based on production volumes in 2010, without taking into account the 
effects of provisional pricing and hedging activity. A US$1 change in the average molybdenum 
price for the year would affect net earnings by US$8.9 million (2009 – US$8.2 million), and 
earnings per share by 0.9 cents (2009 – 0.8 cents), based on production volumes in 2010, 
and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
117 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
(ii) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to a variety of currencies. The US dollar, however, is the currency in 
which the majority of the Group’s sales are denominated. Operating costs are inﬂuenced by 
the countries in which the Group’s operations are based (principally in Chile) as well as those 
currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined. After the 
US dollar, the Chilean peso is the most important currency inﬂuencing costs and to a lesser 
extent sales. 
Given the signiﬁcance of the US dollar to the Group’s operations, this is the presentational 
currency of the Group for internal and external reporting. The US dollar is also the currency for 
borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of this may be held in other currencies, 
notably Chilean pesos and sterling, to meet short-term operational and capital commitments 
and dividend payments. 
When considered appropriate, the Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency 
swaps to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates in foreign currency denominated 
assets and liabilities. The Group may also use these instruments to reduce currency exposure 
on future transactions and cash ﬂows. Details of any exchange rate derivatives entered by the 
Group in the year are given in Note 25(e).
The currency exposure of the Group’s cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments is 
given in Note 22, and the currency exposure of the Group’s borrowings is given in Note 23. 
The effect of exchange gains and losses included in the income statement are given in Note 7. 
Exchange differences on translation of the net assets of entities with a functional currency other 
than the US dollar (the most material of which is Aguas de Antofagasta S.A.) are taken to the 
currency translation reserve and are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity on page 89. 
Currency sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the US dollar/Chilean peso 
exchange rate on the ﬁnancial instruments held as at the reporting date. 
The impact on proﬁt or loss is as a result of the retranslation of monetary ﬁnancial instruments 
(including cash, trade receivables, trade payables, current tax balances and borrowings). 
The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which 
are effective designated cash ﬂow hedges, and changes in the fair value of available-for-sale 
equity investments. The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as interest rates, 
remain constant.
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, 
net earnings would have decreased by US$2.1 million (2009 – US$4.0 million); there would 
have been no additional impact on equity. If the US dollar had weakened by 10% against the 
Chilean peso as at the reporting date, net earnings would have increased by US$2.6 million 
(2009 – US$4.9 million increase); there would have been no additional impact on equity.
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at ﬂoating rates. Fluctuations in interest 
rates may impact the Group’s net ﬁnance income or cost, and to a lesser extent on the value 
of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. The Group occasionally uses interest rate swaps and collars to 
manage interest rate exposures on a portion of its existing borrowings. Details of any interest 
rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 25(e).
Interest rate exposure of the Group’s borrowings is given in Note 23. 
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in interest rates in relation to 
the ﬁnancial instruments held as at the reporting date. The impact on proﬁt or loss is as a result 
of the effect on interest expense in respect of ﬂoating rate borrowings, and interest income in 
respect of cash and cash equivalents. The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair 
value of derivative instruments which are effective designated cash ﬂow hedges. The calculation 
assumes that all other variables, such as currency rates, remain constant.
If the interest rate increased by 1%, based on the ﬁnancial instruments held as at the reporting 
date, net earnings would have increased by US$19.9 million (2009 – US$12.3 million) and 
hedging reserves in equity would have increased by US$10.5 million (2009 – US$13.6 million). 
This does not include the effect on the income statement of changes in the fair value of the 
Group’s liquid investments relating to the underlying investments in ﬁxed income instruments.
(iv) Other price risk
The Group is exposed to equity price risk on its available-for-sale equity investments. 
Equity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the equity values of the 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets held as at the reporting date.
If the value of the available-for-sale investments had increased by 10% as at the reporting date, 
equity would have increased by US$2.2 million (2009 – US$0.1 million). There would have been 
no impact on the income statement.
(v) Cash ﬂow risk
The Group’s future cash ﬂows depend on a number of factors, including commodity prices, 
production and sales levels, operating costs, capital expenditure levels and ﬁnancial income 
and costs. Its cash ﬂows are therefore subject to the exchange, interest rate and commodity 
price risks described above as well as operational factors and input costs. Further information 
on production and sales levels and operating costs are given in the Operational Review on 
pages 26 to 45.
(vi) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from trade and other receivables, cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments 
and derivative ﬁnancial instruments. The Group’s credit risk is primarily to trade receivables. 
The credit risk on cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments and on derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments is limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit agencies. 
All customers are subject to credit review procedures, including the use of external credit ratings 
where available. Credit is provided only within set limits, which are regularly reviewed. 
Outstanding receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
The carrying value of ﬁnancial assets recorded in the ﬁnancial statements represents the 
maximum exposure to credit risk. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for any doubtful receivables.
(vii) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and ﬁnancing facilities, 
through the review of forecast and actual cash ﬂows.
The Group typically holds surplus cash in demand or term deposits or highly liquid investments, 
which typically can be accessed or liquidated within 24 hours, and in all cases not more than ﬁve 
days, while the majority of borrowings comprise corporate loans at Los Pelambres, repayable 
over periods of up to ﬁve years, corporate loans at El Tesoro repayable over approximately four 
years, and corporate loans at Esperanza, repayable over approximately 12 years. 
At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the Group was in a net cash position, as disclosed in Note 
33. Details of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments are given in Note 22, while details 
of borrowings including the maturity proﬁle are given in Note 23. Details of undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities are also given in Note 23.
The following table analyses the maturity of the Group’s contractual commitments in respect of 
its ﬁnancial liabilities and derivative ﬁnancial instruments. The table has been drawn up based 
on the undiscounted cash ﬂows on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. 
The table includes both interest and principal cash ﬂows.  Financial Statements

* The preference shares pay an annual dividend of £100,000 (US$154,420) in perpetuity, and accordingly it is not possible to determine total amounts payable for periods without a ﬁxed end date. 
(viii) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives are to return capital to shareholders whilst leaving the Group with 
sufﬁcient funds to progress its short, medium and long-term growth plans as well as preserving 
the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. This policy remains 
unchanged. The Group monitors capital on the basis of net cash (deﬁned as cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments less borrowings) which was US$1,345.1 million at 
31 December 2010 (2009: US$1,595.7 million), as well as gross cash (deﬁned as cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments) which was US$3,541.6 million at 31 December 2010 
(2009: US$3,222.3 million). The Group’s total cash is held in a combination of demand and 
term deposits and managed funds investing in high quality, ﬁxed income instruments. Some of 
the managed funds have been instructed to invest in instruments with average maturities greater 
than 90 days. These amounts are presented as liquid investments but are included in net cash 
for monitoring and decision-making purposes. The Group has a risk averse investment strategy. 
The Group’s borrowings are detailed in Note 23. Additional project ﬁnance or shareholder loans 
are taken out by the operating subsidiaries to fund projects on a case-by-case basis.

d) Embedded derivatives – provisionally priced sales
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements 
generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time or month of shipment, with ﬁnal 
pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly 
average molybdenum price for speciﬁed future periods. This normally ranges from 30 to 120 
days after delivery to the customer.
Under IFRS, both gains and losses from the marking-to-market of open sales are recognised 
through adjustments to revenue in the income statement and to trade debtors in the balance 
sheet. The Group determines mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for 
copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end monthly average prices for molybdenum 
concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market for that commodity. 
The mark-to-market adjustments to the balance sheet at the end of each period are as follows: Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

25 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued
e) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group periodically uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The Group does not use such derivative 
instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows have been recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged 
item affects proﬁt or loss. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement have 
been recorded within revenue. The time value element of changes in the fair value of derivative options is excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly 
in the income statement within other ﬁnance items. Realised gains and losses and changes in the fair value of exchange and interest derivatives are recognised within other ﬁnance items for those 
derivatives where hedge accounting has not been applied. When hedge accounting has been applied the realised gains and losses on exchange and interest derivatives are recognised within other 
ﬁnance items and interest expense respectively. 
(i) Mark-to-market adjustments and income statement impact

26 Post-Employment Beneﬁt Obligations
a) Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group operates deﬁned contribution schemes for a limited number of employees. The amount charged to the income statement in 2010 was US$0.1 million (2009 – less than US$0.1 million), 
representing the amount paid in the year. There were no outstanding amounts which remain payable at the end of either year.
b) Severance provisions
Employment terms at some of the Group’s operations provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes to an end. This is typically at the rate of one month for 
each year of service (subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of service) and based on ﬁnal salary level. The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded 
deﬁned beneﬁt plan, and the obligation recognised is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are regularly updated. The obligation 
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the severance indemnity obligation. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in the income statement within 
operating cost.
The most recent valuation was carried out in 2010 by Ernst & Young, a qualiﬁed actuary in Santiago-Chile who is not connected with the Group (2009 – Raúl Benavente, a qualiﬁed actuary in 
Santiago-Chile who was not connected with the Group). 
The main assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of beneﬁt obligations were as follows:
2010 2009
Average nominal discount rate 6.6% 5.5%
Average rate of increase in salaries 2.8% 1.5%
Average staff turnover 3.5% 3.5% Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

The charge to the income statement of US$123.1 million (2009 – US$137.7 million charge) includes a charge for foreign exchange differences of US$2.1 million (2009 – includes a charge of 
US$5.1 million). 
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balance (after offset):
2010 
US$m
2009 
US$m
Deferred tax assets 110.0 31.1 
Deferred tax liabilities (696.3) (509.8)
Net deferred tax balances (586.3) (478.7)
At 31 December 2010, the Group had unused tax losses of US$311.1 million (2009 – US$40.8 million) available for offset against future proﬁts. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect 
of the full US$311.1 million in 2010 (2009 – US$40.8 million). These losses may be carried forward indeﬁnitely.
At 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, there were no other deductible temporary differences, for which no deferred tax assets were recognised in the balance sheet. 
At 31 December 2010, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 
US$3,649.9 million (2009 – US$4,047.3 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences and it is likely that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insigniﬁcant. Financial Statements

Balance at the end of the year (244.4) (127.9)
a) Decommissioning and restoration
Decommissioning and restoration costs relate to the Group’s mining operations. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular independent formal review. 
It is estimated that the provision will be utilised over a period of up to 26 years based on current mine plans. 
During the year ended 31 December 2010 there has been a US$65.2 million charge to operating proﬁt in relation to increases to the restoration provision and US$44.4 million capitalised in relation 
to increases in the decommissioning provision at Los Pelambres following an updated independent review which reﬂects changes to the timing, cost and other assumptions relating to the provision. 
The capitalised provision balances are depreciated over the life of the corresponding asset or mine life if shorter. 
b) Termination of Water concession
The provision for the termination of the Water concession relates to the provision for items of plant, property and equipment and working capital items under Aguas de Antofagasta’s ownership 
to be transferred to the previous state-owned operator ECONSSA (formerly known as ESSAN) at the end of the concession period, and is based on the net present value of the estimated value 
of those assets and liabilities in existence at the end of the concession.

31 Business Combinations
a) Twin Metals Minnesota LLC
On 21 July 2010 the Group signed a deﬁnitive Participation and Limited Liability Company Agreement pursuant to the legally binding Heads of Agreement (“HoA”) signed on 14 January 2010 with 
Duluth Metals Limited (“Duluth”), a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”), to acquire a 40% controlling interest in the project company Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”) 
which holds the Nokomis copper-nickel-platinum group metal (“PGM”) deposit (“Nokomis”), located in the highly prospective Duluth Complex in north-eastern Minnesota, USA.
The agreement includes no transfer of consideration from Antofagasta to Duluth for the participation in Twin Metals LLC. No goodwill was generated in this transaction. The US$0.8 million 
attributable to the non-controlling interest is 60% of the identiﬁable net assets. In order to maintain its interest, Antofagasta will fund US$130 million of exploration and feasibility study expenditure 
over a three-year period and has the option to acquire an additional 25% of the project company (to own in aggregate 65%) upon completion of a bankable feasibility study. Although the Group only 
has a 40% shareholding in Twin Metals, the nature of the agreement is such that the Group has management control over the entity.
US$m
Property, plant and equipment 4.1 
Cash and cash equivalents 0.4 
Trade and other payables (3.1)
Total identiﬁable net assets 1.4 
Antofagasta incurred acquisition-related costs of US$4.1 million, which is included in exploration and evaluation cost in the year to 31 December 2010 in line with the exploration and evaluation 
expense being incurred by this company.
Since the acquisition date Twin Metals has incurred exploration and evaluation expenditure of US$6.8 million. Had Twin Metals been consolidated from 1 January 2010 the impact on the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year to 31 December 2010 would have been an additional net loss of US$8.1 million.
32 Other Transactions
a) Full Metal Minerals Limited
On 10 August 2010, the Group entered into an agreement with Full Metal Minerals Limited (“Full Metal”) of Canada in respect of its Pyramid copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry project in 
south-west Alaska. The Group has the right to earn up to a 51% interest in the project over a four-year period by funding up to US$6.0 million of exploration activities and making cash payments 
totalling US$0.2 million. Antofagasta will have the right to further increase its interest in the project to 65% by funding a scoping study and can then earn an additional 15% interest by funding 
a feasibility study.
b) Minera Picacho (Codelco)
On 20 August 2010, the Group entered into an agreement with Minera Picacho, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Corporacion Nacional del Cobre (Chile) (“Codelco”), in respect of the Cumbres prospect 
in Chile’s Antofagasta Region. The Group has the right to earn a 60% interest over a four-year period by funding US$2.5 million in exploration (with a minimum commitment of US$0.3 million in the 
ﬁrst year) and delivering a feasibility study within a further two years.
c) Monax Mining Limited
In September 2010 the Group entered into an agreement with Monax Mining Limited (“Monax”) in respect of its Punt Hill copper-gold project in South Australia. The Group has the right to earn 
a 51% interest in the deposit over a four-year period by funding US$4.0 million of exploration activities, with a minimum commitment of US$1.5 million. Antofagasta will have the right to increase 
further its interest in the Punt Hill project to 70% by funding a further US$5.0 million of exploration and development activities.
d) TEAL Exploration & Mining Incorporated
During 2008 the Group entered into an agreement with TEAL Exploration & Mining Incorporated (“TEAL ”) to acquire an initial 30% interest in two of TEAL ’s exploration licences on the Zambian 
Copperbelt for a consideration of US$5.0 million. After evaluation of the results of the exploration activities to date the Group has decided not to proceed further with the partnership with TEAL, and 
accordingly has withdrawn from the agreement. The Group received US$3.5 million from TEAL for assigning its interests in the mining licences relating to the project. 
e) International Base Metals Limited
After evaluation of the results of the exploration activities to date, the Group decided in October 2010 not to proceed further with its agreement with International Base Metals Limited of Australia 
in respect of its Kopermyn mining property in northern Namibia.  Financial Statements

35 Concession Arrangements
In 2003, the Group was awarded a 30-year concession to operate the water rights and facilities 
in the Antofagasta Region of Chile previously controlled by the state-owned operator ECONSSA 
(formerly known as ESSAN). The concession consists of two businesses, one an unregulated 
business supplying mines and other industrial users and the other a regulated Water business 
supplying domestic customers. The concession contract was signed and control of the assets 
and operation assumed on 29 December 2003 by Aguas de Antofagasta S.A., a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Group.
Under the concession contract, certain assets and liabilities (mainly certain speciﬁc tangible 
ﬁxed assets and working capital items) were transferred to Aguas de Antofagasta by way 
of sale. Other assets (mainly water rights and infrastructure) were transferred by way of 
concession and will devolve to ESSAN at the end of the 30-year period. 
Aguas de Antofagasta will also be required to transfer to ESSAN any tangible ﬁxed assets 
and working capital items under its ownership at the end of the 30-year concession period. 
A provision for the termination of the Water concession has been created for the ﬁxed assets 
and working capital items under Aguas de Antofagasta’s ownership to be transferred to ESSAN 
at the end of the concession period. The provision is based on the net present value of the 
estimated value of these assets and liabilities in existence at the end of the concession. 
The release of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of future costs is 
charged to the income statement in each accounting period and is disclosed as a ﬁnancing 
cost. Further details of this provision are given in Note 28(b).
The Chilean Water Regulator (Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios) sets domestic tariffs 
every ﬁve years following a regulatory review including representations from the operator of the 
concession. The last regulatory review was completed during 2006, which resulted in an average 
reduction in tariffs (compared with previous levels) of approximately 5% from July 2006.

k) Franconia Minerals Corporation
On 20 December 2010 the Group entered into arrangements with Duluth Metals Limited in 
connection with Duluth’s proposed acquisition of 100% of Franconia Minerals Corporation 
(“Franconia”). Duluth and Antofagasta have agreed that following the proposed acquisition 
Franconia’s assets will be transferred to Twin Metals and that Antofagasta will contribute 
approximately C$30.0 million in cash to Duluth’s acquisition of Franconia in order to, in part, 
maintain the 40% and 60% interests of Antofagasta and Duluth, respectively, in Twin Metals. 
The Group has also subscribed for an aggregate of 7,604,563 subscription receipts of Duluth, 
by way of private placement, for a price of C$2.63 per subscription to become an approximately 
12.8% shareholder in Duluth. Further details of the acquisition are given in Note 39. Duluth is a 
related party of the Group for the purpose of the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing 
Authority as it holds a substantial interest in Twin Metals.
38 Contingent Liabilities 
There are a number of claims currently outstanding to which Antofagasta plc or its 
subsidiaries (“the Group”) is a party, for which no provision has been made in the ﬁnancial 
statements and are currently not expected to result in any material loss to the Group. 
Details of the principal claims at the end of the year and their current status are set out below:
a) Los Pelambres – Mauro tailings dam
As previously announced, during 2008 Los Pelambres entered into binding settlements in 
respect of litigation relating to the Mauro tailings dam. In December 2008, Los Pelambres 
became aware of further legal proceedings which had been initiated in ﬁrst instance courts in 
Santiago and Los Vilos by certain members of the Caimanes community located near the Mauro 
valley. These claims, some of which have already been rejected by the relevant courts, sought to 
prevent the operation of the Mauro tailings dam. Los Pelambres is continuing to take necessary 
steps to protect its position. 
b) Tethyan Copper Company Limited – Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture
On 26 June 2007 the High Court of Balochistan at Quetta dismissed a petition which had sought 
to declare that the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture of 1993 and the exploration licences 
granted to Tethyan were null and void and overturned an injunction passed earlier by the Court. 
The petition had been ﬁled in November 2006 and was directed at several parties including the 
Group, the Government of Pakistan and the Government of Balochistan.
The petitioners have ﬁled a Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal (“CPLA”) against the judgment. 
The CPLA has now been allowed by the Supreme Court, converting it into an Appeal and is 
hearing it on its merits together with new constitutional petitions ﬁled before the Supreme Court. 
The new petitions primarily relate to whether it is in the public interest for Tethyan to receive a 
mining lease. On 3 February 2011, the Supreme Court issued an interim order providing, among 
other things, that the Government of Balochistan may not take any decision in respect of the 
grant or otherwise of a mining lease to Tethyan until matters before the Supreme Court are 
decided. Further progress on this project will be dependent on the grant of the mining lease for 
which an application has been made and successful conclusion of litigation which is currently 
in progress before the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
39 Events After the Balance Sheet Date
a) Eurasian Minerals Inc
On 18 February 2011, the Group has entered into an agreement in principle for a strategic 
alliance and earn-in agreement with Eurasian Minerals Inc. focused primarily on copper 
exploration in Sweden including the Kiruan South copper project. The Group will contribute 
funding of at least US$250,000 million annually for a two-year period.
The Group may earn a 51% interest in any designated property (other than the Kiruna South 
designated property) by spending an aggregate of US$5.0 million over ﬁve years and making 
a one-time cash payment on or before the ﬁfth anniversary equal to the product obtained 
by multiplying 225,000lbs of copper times the average of the price of copper for the previous 
30 trading days. In the case of the Kiruna South designated project, the above conditions also 
apply except that the earn-in commitment is US$10.0 million over ﬁve years.
The Group will also purchase 1,540,000 units from Eurasian Minerals Inc. at a price of 
C$3.25 per unit. Each unit will consist of one common share and one half of one common share 
purchase warrant. Each full warrant will entitle AMSA to purchase one additional common share 
of Eurasian Minerals Inc. stock for a period of two years at a purchase price of C$4.00 per unit. 
The placement will be subject to TSX Venture exchange approval.
b) Franconia Minerals Corporation
On 20 December 2010 the Group entered into arrangements with Duluth Metals Limited 
(“Duluth”) in connection with Duluth’s proposed acquisition of 100% of Franconia Minerals 
Corporation (“Franconia”). Following approval of the acquisition by Franconia’s shareholders and 
by the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, Duluth completed the acquisition on 7 March 2011. 
Franconia’s principal assets are a 70% interest in the Birch Lake Joint Venture (“BLJV”) which 
holds the Birch Lake, Maturi and Spruce Road copper-nickel-platinum and palladium deposits 
that are contiguous to the Nokomis deposit held through Twin Metals. Franconia announced in 
November 2010 its intention to increase its ownership at the Birch Lake Project to 82% under 
the terms of the BLJV Agreement. The offer valued Franconia at approximately C$77 million 
(approximately US$77 million). Duluth and Antofagasta agreed that following the proposed 
acquisition, Franconia’s assets will be transferred to Twin Metals. Subsequent to the year end, 
Antofagasta has contributed approximately C$30 million (approximately US$30 million) in cash 
to Duluth’s acquisition of Franconia in order to, in part, maintain the 40% and 60% interests 
of Antofagasta and Duluth, respectively, in Twin Metals. Following the completion of Duluth’s 
acquisition it is expected that Franconia’s assets will be transferred to Twin Metals during the 
ﬁrst half of 2011.

41A Basis of Preparation of the Balance Sheet and Related Notes 
of the Parent Company
The Antofagasta plc Parent Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles (“UK GAAP”) 
and in accordance with UK company law. The ﬁnancial information has been prepared on a 
historical cost basis. The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency adopted is US dollars.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below. There were no changes 
in accounting policies in 2010.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with UK GAAP requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the 
date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, following implementation of these standards, actual results may 
differ from those estimates.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the proﬁt and loss account of the 
Parent Company is not presented as part of these ﬁnancial statements. The proﬁt after tax for 
the year of the Parent Company amounted to US$676.8 million (2009 – US$330.3 million).
41B Principal Accounting Policies of the Parent Company
a) Currency translation
The Company’s functional currency is the US dollar. Transactions denominated in other 
currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities, including amounts due from or to 
subsidiaries, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the ﬁnancial year. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the proﬁt and loss account in the year 
in which they arise.
b) Revenue recognition
Interest is accounted for on an accruals basis. Dividends proposed by subsidiaries are recognised 
as income by the Company when they represent a present obligation of the subsidiaries, i.e. in 
the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
c) Dividends payable
Dividends proposed are recognised when they represent a present obligation, i.e. in the period 
in which they are formally approved for payment. Accordingly, an interim dividend is recognised 
when paid and a ﬁnal dividend is recognised when approved by shareholders.
d) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and long-term amounts 
owed by subsidiaries. Such investments are valued at cost less any impairment provisions. 
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, 
the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future 
cash ﬂows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher.
As explained in Note 41D, amounts owed by subsidiaries due in foreign currencies are 
translated at year end rates of exchange with any exchange differences taken to the proﬁt 
and loss account.
e) Current asset investments and cash at bank and in hand
Current asset investments comprise highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value, typically 
maturing within 12 months.
Cash at bank and in hand comprise cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand.
f) Borrowings – preference shares
The sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company carry a ﬁxed rate of return 
without the right to participate in any surplus. They are accordingly classiﬁed as borrowings and 
translated into US dollars at period end rates of exchange. Preference share dividends are 
included within ﬁnance costs.
g) Equity instruments – ordinary share capital and share premium
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity 
instruments of the Company comprise its sterling-denominated issued ordinary share capital and 
related share premium.
As explained above, the presentational and the functional currency of the Company is US dollars, 
and ordinary share capital and share premium are translated into US dollars at historical rates of 
exchange based on dates of issue.
h) Cash ﬂow statement
The Company’s individual ﬁnancial statements are outside the scope of FRS 1 “Cash Flow 
Statements” because the Company prepares publicly available consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
which include a consolidated cash ﬂow statement. Accordingly, the Company does not present 
an individual company cash ﬂow statement.
i) Related party disclosures
The Company’s individual ﬁnancial statements are exempt from the requirements of FRS 8 
“Related Party Disclosures” because its individual ﬁnancial statements are presented together 
with its consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Accordingly, the individual ﬁnancial statements do not 
include related party disclosures. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

The preference shares are non-redeemable and are entitled to a ﬁxed 5% cumulative dividend, 
payable in equal instalments in June and December of each year. On a winding-up, the 
preference shares are entitled to repayment and any arrears of dividend in priority to ordinary 
shareholders, but are not entitled to participate further in any surplus. Each preference share

Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Estimates
At 31 December 2010
Introduction
The ore reserves and mineral resources estimates presented in this report comply with the 
requirements of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources 
and Ore Reserves 2004 edition (the JORC Code) which has been used by the Group as minimum 
standard for the preparation and disclosure of the information contained herein. The deﬁnitions 
and categories of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are set out below.
The information on ore reserves and mineral resources was prepared by or under the supervision 
of Competent Persons as deﬁned in the JORC Code. The Competent Persons have sufﬁcient 
experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and 
to the activity which they are undertaking. The Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in 
this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears. 
The Competent Person for Exploration Results and Mineral Resources is Orlando Rojas 
(MAusIMM), Assistant Manager of Mineral Resource Evaluation for Antofagasta Minerals S.A. 
The Competent Person for Ore Reserves is Murray Canﬁeld (P .Eng. Ontario), Technical Manager 
Operations for Antofagasta Minerals S.A.
The Group’s operations and projects are subject to a comprehensive programme of audits 
aimed at providing assurance in respect of ore reserves and mineral resources estimates. 
The audits are conducted by suitably qualiﬁed Competent Persons from within a particular 
division, another division of the Company or from independent consultants.
The ore reserves and mineral resources estimates represent full reserves and resources, 
with the Group’s attributable share for each mine shown in the ‘Attributable Tonnage’ column. 
The Group’s economic interest in each mine is disclosed in the notes following the estimates 
on pages 138 to 140. The totals in the table may include some small apparent differences 
as the speciﬁc individual ﬁgures have not been rounded.
Deﬁnitions and Categories of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources 
A ‘Mineral Resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest 
in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects 
for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from speciﬁc geological 
evidence and knowledge. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological 
conﬁdence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and 
mineral content can be estimated with a low level of conﬁdence. It is inferred from geological 
evidence and assumed but not veriﬁed geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability.
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, 
shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable 
level of conﬁdence. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 
The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to conﬁrm geological and/or grade 
continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.
A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, 
shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level 
of conﬁdence. It is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. The locations are spaced closely enough to conﬁrm geological 
and grade continuity. 
An ‘Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral 
Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the 
material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include 
consideration of and modiﬁcation by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments 
demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justiﬁed. 
Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing conﬁdence into Probable Ore Reserves 
and Proved Ore Reserves. 
A ‘Probable Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for 
losses which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have 
been carried out, and include consideration of and modiﬁcation by realistically assumed mining, 
metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These 
assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justiﬁed. 
A ‘Proved Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. 
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is 
mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration 
of and modiﬁcation by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time 
of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justiﬁed.  Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

Notes to Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Estimates
The ore reserves mentioned in this report were determined considering speciﬁc cut-off grades 
for each mine and using a long-term copper price of 220 cents per pound (170 cents per pound 
in 2009), US$12.00 per pound molybdenum (US$8.00 per pound in 2009) and US$850 per 
gold ounce (US$650 per gold ounce in 2009), unless otherwise noted. These same values 
have been used for copper equivalent (CuEq) estimates, where appropriate.
In order to ensure that the stated resources represent mineralisation that has “reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic extraction” (JORC code) the resources are enclosed within pit 
shells that were optimised based on measured, indicated and inferred resources and considering 
a copper price of 250 cents per pound. Mineralisation estimated outside these pit shells is not 
included in the resource ﬁgures unless they can expect to be exploited by underground methods.
a) Los Pelambres 
Los Pelambres is 60% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of 
ore reserves and mineral resources is 0.35% copper. For 2010 the mineral resource model 
has been updated with 79 in-ﬁll drill holes for a total of 14,439 metres. In this model, more 
restrictive criteria for estimation have been used, incorporating recommendations included in 
a pre-audit report conducted by AMEC (October 2009). Density and metallurgical models have 
also been updated. 
The decrease in ore reserves is mainly related to depletion corresponding to mine production in 
2010. Other factors are related to the updated resource model that considered more restrictive 
estimation criteria. The ﬁnal pit design has not been modiﬁed for the 2010 ore reserve estimate.
The decrease in mineral resources is related to ore depletion, reﬁnement of the resource block 
model, with more restrictive estimation criteria, and the methodology applied in 2010 to limit the 
resource estimation to those resources contained within an unsmoothed, optimised pit shell 
(using all resource categories and a copper price of 250 cents per pound). Additionally, there 
is a decrease resulting from the elimination of the resources falling within the Las Tigresas 
concessions (which are 100% owned by the Group, not directly by Los Pelambres), which 
are adjacent to the concessions owned by Los Pelambres.
b) Esperanza Sulphides 
Esperanza is 70% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore 
reserves is 0.20% equivalent copper, with 0.15% copper used as a cut-off grade for mineral 
resources (which is a change from 0.20% copper used in 2009).
During 2010 a small part of ore reserves were depleted to feed the concentrator plant. 
The small increase in ore reserves is related to mixed (oxide and sulphide) material that was 
considered as a ROM oxide resource in the original block model but has now been redeﬁned 
as mill feed for the Esperanza concentrator plant. The ﬁnal pit design has not been modiﬁed 
for the 2010 ore reserve estimate.
During 2010 the Esperanza block model was updated with the incorporation of 15 in-ﬁll drill 
holes for a total of 2,914 metres. The focus of this programme was to better identify the oxide/
sulphide interface. Included in the updated block model is a reinterpretation of the estimation 
parameters to deﬁne inferred resources. This resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in this category 
of resources in the estimate.
Mineral resources have been limited to those contained within an unsmoothed, optimised pit 
shell using a copper price of 250 cents per pound. The optimised pit shell used to limit mineral 
resources is based on an integrated block model that joins the Esperanza and Telégrafo 
orebodies into one model.
c) El Tesoro 
El Tesoro is 70% owned by the Group. The ore reserves and mineral resources are made up 
of the El Tesoro, Tesoro North-East and Mirador deposits, which are processed by heap leaching, 
and the Run-of-Mine (ROM) Oxide ore reserves and mineral resources from the Esperanza Mine, 
located ﬁve kilometres south-east of El Tesoro. An agreement was entered into in 2008 whereby 
the Esperanza Oxide mineral resources were purchased by El Tesoro for a one-time payment. 
Esperanza delivers the ROM ore released during the pre-stripping and operating phases of the 
Esperanza operation to a permanent leach pad constructed and operated by the El Tesoro mine. 
At the request of El Tesoro, some of the higher grade Esperanza oxide ore is sent directly to the 
El Tesoro heap leach pads.
The cut-off grade used for estimation of ore reserves and mineral resources for the El Tesoro 
and Tesoro North-East deposits is 0.41% copper. The cut-off grade used for estimation of ore 
reserves and mineral resources for the Mirador deposit is 0.30% copper, reﬂecting higher 
projected recoveries and lower acid consumption for the Mirador deposit (in the 2010 Mid-year 
Update, the cut-off grade used for the Mirador deposit was 0.35% copper). Ore reserves for 
Mirador increased from 22.2 million tonnes, as reported in the 2010 Mid-year Update, to 
25.1 million tonnes in this report.
Proved and probable ore reserves for the El Tesoro open pits were depleted by 5.6 million tonnes 
as plant feed (the remainder of plant feed came from higher grade Esperanza oxides). For 2010, 
the signiﬁcant increase in ore reserves is related to the incorporation of the Mirador deposit into 
ore reserve ﬁgures. 
Two principal factors are responsible for the decrease in mineral resources compared to 2009 
(the 2009 ﬁgures have been modiﬁed to incorporate the Mirador deposit mineral resources into 
the El Tesoro portion of the table, with the Attributable Tonnage values for 2009 reﬂecting the 
100% ownership interest in Mirador at that time). An increase in mineral resources, related to the 
inclusion of stockpiled ore which was omitted from the 2009 report, has been more than offset 
by a reduction in mineral resources as a result of the methodology applied in 2010 to limit the 
resource estimation to those resources contained within an unsmoothed, optimised pit shell 
(using all resource categories and a copper price of 250 cents per pound).
The cut-off grade used for estimation of both ore reserves and mineral resources for the 
El Tesoro ROM (Esperanza Oxides) is 0.20% copper. During the year, 28.4 million tonnes of oxide 
ore reserves were extracted from the Esperanza pit, of which 4.1 million tonnes of higher grade 
oxide ore were delivered directly to the El Tesoro heap leach pads and subsequently depleted. 
A total of 37.1 million tonnes are in the ROM leach pads and have been partially leached, 
and another 25.4 million tonnes have been delivered to the ROM leach pads or stockpiles 
and have not yet been put under leach.
This year the Esperanza resource model has been updated (see note “b”) which results in a 
small portion of the original ROM oxide resource (higher grade mixed oxides and sulphides) 
being redeﬁned as mill feed for the Esperanza concentrator plant.
d) Michilla 
Michilla is 74.2% owned by the Group and its operations comprise an open pit mine, an 
underground mine and other workings. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore 
reserves and mineral resources is 0.40% copper for open pits, 1.2% copper for the Estefanía 
underground mine and 1.0% copper for other workings.
During 2010 ore reserves were depleted by a net 3.7 million tonnes. Plant feed was 5.2 million 
tonnes, with the difference coming from additional ore not considered in the mine plan. The ore 
reserve estimate for 2010 is still based on a mine plan developed in 2009 that extends to 2012. 
Mine staff have been working on in-ﬁll drilling and evaluation studies to extend the mine plan to 
2015 and potentially beyond. During 2010 in-ﬁll and exploration drilling was carried out on the 
Estefanía/Lince deposits and on several other satellite deposits for a total of 86,650 metres in 
493 drill holes.
The 2010 mineral resources estimate includes several changes from 2009. The most 
substantive change is the incorporation of the Aurora deposit into the Michilla mineral resources. 
The Aurora deposit was previously accounted for in the ‘Other Mineral Inventory’ section of the 
notes. Another relevant change is a reversion of the 2009 decision to include the Lince mineral 
resources, not included in the existing open pit mine plan, as underground resources with a 
cut-off grade of 1.0% copper. Upon further review, there is a potential for one or two more 
push-backs in the Lince open pit.  Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review
139 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
As a result, as in other projects, the open pit mineral resource estimate includes those resources contained within an unsmoothed, optimised pit shell (using all resource categories and a copper 
price of 250 cents per pound) and applying a cut-off grade of 0.40% copper within the pit shell. This same methodology was applied to two other areas that have potential for open pit exploitation: 
the Aurora and Nucleo deposits. The mineral resources estimate for Michilla includes several resource block models, incorporating the multiple deposits on the property. A portion of the extensive 
drilling programme carried out in 2009 and continuing in 2010 has been included in resource block model updates for the 2010 mineral resources estimates. The ore reserve estimate has not 
yet fully incorporated these changes in the resource block models.
Not included in the mineral resources estimate is the spent ore deposited on site. This is material that is removed from the dynamic heap leach pads after the primary leach cycle is completed. 
Since the beginning of the Lince project in 1994 between 65 and 70 million tonnes of spent ore has been deposited in a spent ore dump, adjacent to the dynamic leach pads. The grade of this 
material is expected to be in the range of 0.20 to 0.30% copper. During 2010 testwork was done on an industrial scale to determine the potential viability of re-leaching this material by removing 
it from the spent ore dump and placing it under leach on the dynamic pads. Testwork will continue in 2011 and it is expected that spent ore will contribute an increasing amount to copper 
production through this re-leaching process.
e) Antucoya
Antucoya is 100% owned by the Group. A feasibility study on the project, which started in 2009, will be complete in 2011. The concept for processing is a combination of heap leaching on 
dynamic pads and Run-of-Mine (ROM) leaching on permanent pads. 
There have been no changes to mineral resources estimated for Antucoya. The cut-off grade applied to the mineral resources estimate is 0.10% copper and include those mineral resources 
contained within an unsmoothed, optimised pit shell using a copper price of 250 cents per pound.
f) Telégrafo
Telégrafo is owned 70% by the Group and is adjacent to the Esperanza deposit. This is a project which was reported in ‘Other Mineral Inventory’ in 2009 and was included into resource ﬁgures 
in the “2010 Mid-year Update to Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Estimates”. 
During the second half of 2010 an upgrade of the resource block model was carried out incorporating the results from 98 in-ﬁll drill holes for a total of 44,389 metres, and also an update to the 
geological and grade models. The cut-off grade applied to the mineral resources estimate is 0.15% copper for both oxides and sulphides and include those mineral resources contained within 
an unsmoothed, optimised pit shell using a copper price of 250 cents per pound. This is a change from the cut-off grade used in the Mid-year Update, which was 0.20% copper. The optimised 
pit shell used to limit mineral resources is based on an integrated block model that joins the Esperanza and Telégrafo orebodies into one model.
g) Caracoles
Caracoles is owned 100% by the Group. This is a project which was reported in “Other Mineral Inventory” in 2009 and was included into resource ﬁgures in the “2010 Mid-year Update to Ore 
Reserves and Mineral Resources Estimates”. There have been no changes to the mineral resources estimate during the second half of 2010. The cut-off grade is 0.20% copper for both oxides 
and sulphides and include those mineral resources contained within an unsmoothed, optimised pit shell using a copper price of 250 cents per pound.
h) Reko Diq
The Group holds a 50% interest in Tethyan Copper Company Limited (“Tethyan”), its joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation established in 2006. Tethyan’s principal assets are a 75% interest 
in the exploration licence encompassing the Reko Diq prospects in the Chagai Hills region of south-west Pakistan (in which the Government of Balochistan holds the remaining 25%) including 
the western Porphyries, and a 100% interest in certain other licences in the region.
There have been no changes to the mineral resources estimate for Reko Diq. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources is 0.20% copper equivalent. For Reko Diq, copper 
equivalent values are calculated based on a copper price of 190 cents per pound and a gold price of 725 dollars per ounce. The mineral resources are those contained within unsmoothed optimised 
pit shell using the same prices.
i) Other Mineral Inventory
In addition to the Mineral Resources noted above, the Group has interests in other deposits located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, some of them containing gold and/or molybdenum. 
At the moment they are in exploration or in the process of resource estimation. The potential quantity and grade of each of the deposits is conceptual in nature, there has been insufﬁcient 
exploration to deﬁne these deposits as mineral resources, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a mineral resource. These include:
(i) In the Sierra Gorda District 
In the Sierra Gorda District the Group has two operations (El Tesoro and Esperanza) and others in exploration or under study, such as: Llano-Paleocanal (70% owned by the Group); Centinela 
(51% owned by the Group); and Polo Sur (100% owned by the Group). The Mineral Inventory of these deposits (incorporating both oxide and sulphide mineralisation) is estimated to be in 
the range of 450 to 690 million tonnes with grades in the range of 0.54% to 0.44% copper. The table below lists each of the mineral deposits with its associated tonnage and grade ranges,

(iii) In the El Abra District 
The Group has two mineral deposits within a few kilometres of the El Abra orebody, located near Calama in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. Conchi is a porphyry copper mineral deposit (with oxide 
and sulphide mineralisation), while Brujulina is an exotic-style mineral deposit (oxide mineralisation only). The Mineral Inventory of these deposits is estimated to be in the range of 0.5 to 0.7 billion 
tonnes with grades in the range of 0.7% to 0.5% copper.

j) Antomin 2 and Antomin Investors 
The Group has an approximately 51% interest in two indirect subsidiaries, Antomin 2 Limited (“Antomin 2”) and Antomin Investors Limited (“Antomin Investors Limited”), which own a number of 
copper exploration properties in Chile’s Antofagasta Region and Coquimbo Region. These include (but are not limited to) Centinela (see Note i(i) above) and Conchi and Brujulina (see Note i(iii) above). 
The remaining approximately 49% of Antomin 2 and Antomin Investors is owned by Mineralinvest Establishment (“Mineralinvest”), a company controlled by the Luksic family. 
The Group has the exclusive right to acquire, at fair value under certain conditions, the shareholding of Mineralinvest in Antomin 2 Limited and Antomin Investors, or the underlying properties, 
for a period of ﬁve years from August 2008. The Group also has committed to meet in full any exploration costs relating to the properties held by these two entities.
Further details are set out in Note 37(d) to the ﬁnancial statements.
k) Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (Nokomis project) and Franconia Minerals Corporation (Birch Lake project)
In January 2010 the Group announced an agreement to acquire 40% of the Nokomis project, owned 100% by Duluth Metals Limited (“Duluth”). The deal closed in July 2010 and the joint venture 
Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”) was created as the operating company for the Nokomis project, a copper-nickel-platinum group metal (“PGM”) deposit located in north-east Minnesota, 
USA. See press releases of 14 January and 21 July, 2010 for more information.
In December 2010 the Group announced an agreement to indirectly acquire the Franconia Minerals Corporation (“Franconia”) 70% participation in the Birch Lake project, located adjacent to the 
Nokomis project in Minnesota, through the Twin Metals joint venture (owned 40% by the Group). Franconia announced in November 2010 its intention to increase its participation in the Birch Lake 
project to 82%. See press release of 20 December, 2010 for more information. As explained in Note 39, following approval of the acquisition by Franconia’s shareholders and by the Court of 
Queen’s Bench of Alberta, Duluth completed the acquisition on 7 March, 2011.
Nokomis project
Duluth, the Group’s partner, published an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate consisting of 550 and 274 million tonnes of indicated and inferred resource, respectively, with a combined copper 
grade of approximately 0.6% and a combined copper equivalent grade of approximately 1.5% taking into account the nickel, platinum, palladium and gold content. At the time of reporting, the Group 
is in the process of reviewing the existing mineral resource estimate with a view to incorporating information from the signiﬁcant drilling campaign and testwork that was undertaken during 2010 
into an updated resource model to support further studies.
Birch Lake project
Franconia has published NI 43-101 compliant resource estimates for the Birch Lake deposit, the Maturi deposit and the Spruce Road deposit. The Birch Lake deposit is reported to consist of 
177 and 40 million tonnes of indicated and inferred resource respectively, with a combined copper grade of approximately 0.5% and a combined copper equivalent grade of approximately 1.2%. 
The Maturi deposit is reported to consist of 120 million tonnes of inferred resource with a copper grade of 0.67% and with additional values for nickel, cobalt and PGMs. The Spruce Road deposit 
is reported to consist of inferred resources of 124 million tonnes with a copper grade of 0.59%, and a nickel grade of 0.21%. Strategic Review Other Information Financial Statements Governance Financial Review Operational Review

a) The production ﬁgures represent the total amounts produced for each mine, not the Group’s attributable share for each mine.
b)  Los Pelambres produces copper and molybdenum concentrates, and the ﬁgures for Los Pelambres are expressed in terms of payable metal contained in concentrate. The copper 
concentrate also contains gold and silver, for which Los Pelambres is credited when the concentrate is sold. El Tesoro and Michilla produce copper cathodes with no by-products.
c)  Cash costs are a measure of the cost of operational production expressed in terms of cents per pound of payable copper produced. Cash costs are stated net of by-product credits and 
include tolling charges for concentrate for Los Pelambres. Cash costs exclude depreciation, ﬁnancial income and expenses, hedging gains and losses, exchange gains and losses and 
corporation tax for all three operations. By-product calculations do not take into account unrealised mark-to-market gains for molybdenum at the beginning or end of each period.

Mining Industry
Brownﬁeld  
Project
A development or exploration project in the vicinity of an  
existing operation.
By-products 
(credits in copper 
concentrates)
Products obtained as result of copper processing. The Los Pelambres  
mine produces molybdenum concentrate and also receives credit for 
the gold and silver content in the copper concentrate sold.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration process, such as ﬂotation 
or gravity concentration, which involves separating ore minerals from 
unwanted wasted rock. Concentrates require subsequent processing  
(such as smelting or leaching) to break down or dissolve the ore 
minerals and obtain the desired elements, usually metals.
Contained  
Copper
The proportion or quantity of copper contained in a given quantity 
of ore or concentrate.
Copper Cathode Reﬁned copper produced by electrolytic reﬁning of impure copper 
by electro-winning.
Cut-off Grade The lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic to process 
and used in the calculation of ore reserves and mineral resources.
Flotation A process by which chemicals are added to materials in a solution which 
are attracted to bubbles and ﬂoat, whilst other materials sink, resulting in 
the production of concentrate.
Grade A Copper 
Cathode
Highest quality copper cathode (LME registered and certiﬁcated in the  
case of Michilla and El Tesoro).
Greenﬁeld  
Project
The development or exploration of a new project not previously examined.
Heap Leaching A process for the recovery of copper from ore. The crushed material is  
laid on a slightly sloping, impermeable pad and leached by uniformly 
trickling (gravity fed) chemical solution through the beds to ponds. 
The metal is then recovered from the solution through the SX-EW process.
JORC Joint Ore Reserves Committee of Australia.
Leaching The process by which a soluble mineral can be economically recovered  
by dissolution.
LOM or 
Life Of Mine
The remaining life of a mine expressed in years, calculated by reference  
to scheduled production rates (i.e. comparing the rate at which ore is 
expected to be extracted from the mine to current deﬁned reserves).
Mineral  
Resources
Material of intrinsic economic interest occurring in such form and quantity 
that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. 
Mineral resources are stated inclusive of ore reserves, as deﬁned by JORC.
MW Megawatts (one million watts).
Open Pit Mine working or excavation which is open to the surface.
Ore Rock from which metal(s) or mineral(s) can be economically and  
legally extracted.
Ore Grade The relative quantity, or the percentage, of metal content in an ore body  
or quantity of processed ore.
Ore Reserves Part of Mineral Resources for which appropriate assessments have been 
carried out to demonstrate at a given date extraction could be reasonably 
justiﬁed and which include consideration of and modiﬁcation by realistically 
assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors.
Oxide and  
Sulphide Ores
Different kinds of ore containing copper. Oxide ore occurs on the 
weathered surface of ore-rich lodes and normally results in the production 
of cathode copper through a heap-leaching process. Sulphide ore comes 
from an unweathered parent ores process and normally results in 
the production of concentrate through a ﬂotation process which then 
requires smelting and reﬁning to produce cathode copper.
Payable Copper The proportion or quantity of contained copper for which payment is 
received after metallurgical deduction.
Porphyry A large body of rock which contains disseminated chalcopyrite and other 
sulphide minerals. Such a deposit is mined in bulk on a large scale, 
generally in open pits, for copper and its by-product molybdenum.
Price  
Participation
Part of the tolling charges for copper concentrate under a sales agreement, 
usually in addition to TC/RCs and calculated as a percentage of the 
difference between the copper price at ﬁnal pricing and an agreed 
reference copper price, and which may result in an increase or decrease  
to TC/RCs.
Price Sharing Tolling charges calculated under a sales agreement as an agreed 
percentage of the price for the metal contained in copper concentrate, 
as an alternative to TC/RCs and/or price participation.
Run-of-Mine 
(ROM)
A process for the recovery of copper from ore, typically used for low-grade 
ores. The mined, uncrushed ore is leached with a chemical solution. 
The metal is then recovered from the solution through the SX-EW process.
Stockpile Material extracted and piled for future use.
SX-EW Solvent-Extraction and Electro-Winning. A process for extracting metal 
from an ore and producing pure metal. First the metal is leached into 
solution; the resulting solution is then puriﬁed in the solvent-extraction 
process; the solution is then treated in an electro chemical process 
(electro-winning) to recover cathode copper.
Tailings Dam Construction used to deposit the rock waste which remains as a result 
of the concentrating process after the recoverable minerals have been 
extracted in concentrate form.
TC/RCs Treatment and reﬁning charges, being terms used to set the smelting and 
reﬁning charge or margin for processing copper concentrate and normally 
set either on an annual basis or on a spot basis.
Tolling Charges Charges or margins for converting concentrate into ﬁnished metal. 
These include TC/RCs, price participation and price sharing for copper 
concentrate and roasting charges for molybdenum concentrate.
Tpd Tonnes per day, normally with reference to the quantity of ore processed 
over a given period of time expressed as a daily average.

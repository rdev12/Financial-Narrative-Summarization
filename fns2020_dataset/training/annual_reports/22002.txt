 N BROWN GROUP PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 N Brown Group plc is a leading digital 
specialist fit fashion retailer , with over  
140 years of experience. 
We offer customers an extensive range of products in 
clothing, footwear and homewares. Our portfolio of 
trusted retail brands all serve a specific niche consumer 
group which we believe are poorly served by the fashion 
industry overall, such as plus-size and more mature 
customers. We are headquartered in Manchester and 
employ over 2,900 people across the UK.

HIGHLIGHTS Our Power Brands – JD Williams, Simply Be and Jacamo, recorded £317.9m 
revenue, up 10.0% year on year. This was driven by further improvements 
to our product offering and innovative digital marketing campaigns. 
Our digital metrics continue to be very strong. Online penetration  
stood at 65%, up 6ppts year on year, and online revenue was up 15%.  
66% of our traffic came from mobile devices in FY16. 
Our new warehouse is now complete – on time and on budget. This state 
of the art facility increases our next day availability, and will support our 
medium-term international ambitions.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 We are in the middle of an amazing  
transformational journey. 
Throughout the year we saw clear 
evidence of the benefits of the way in 
which we are transforming the business. 
We still have more work to do, but we're 
moving in the right direction, making 
significant changes across three key  
areas of our business which will ensure 
we become a leading digital retailer  
fit for an exciting future.

people processes
We are a digital-first retailer,  
and this influences everything  
we do. So, this year, we moved 
our people processes online – 
from recruitment to recognition, 
development to keeping our 
colleagues up to date.
Operating team
The past two years has seen an 
almost entirely new top team at 
N Brown. Our talented operating 
board are all digital natives, experts 
in their fields, and are enthused 
and excited about our journey.

them look and feel amazing.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Looking back on a year  
of transformational  
progress
Our transformation continues apace, with 
progress made during the year. Looking 
forward, we are approaching a crucial period 
for the Group, with the implementation  
of our new systems platform.
Introduction
This year was an important one for the 
Group, with material changes made to 
the way we operate our business and 
communicate with our customers. 
Against this backdrop of significant 
ongoing transformation within the 
business, the Board is satisfied with  
the FY16 results. 
It is hard to overestimate the amount of 
change that has occurred in the business 
over the past few years. There are new 
teams of colleagues, new skill sets and 
capabilities, new outsourcing partners 
and a focused and consolidated portfolio 
of brands. 
Of course, such a busy change agenda 
inevitably makes forecasting business 
performance harder and disruption more 
likely, and it therefore hasn’t been as 
smooth a journey as we would have 
wished. We are confident, however,  
that the right actions are being taken  
to enable us to deliver sustainable 
long-term growth as we transition  
from a direct mail to a digital business. 
This coming year will be a very important 
one for the Group. Our new IT platform 
(Fit 4 the Future) will be implemented, 
bringing necessary and significant 
improvements to all areas of our business. 
However experience suggests that a 
programme of this scale will bring some 
unexpected bumps in the road. A huge 
amount of effort has gone into planning 
and preparing to mitigate these risks.
Continued progress from direct-
mail led to digital-first, with online 
penetration of 65%, up 6ppts.
Active customer accounts +2.2% 
to 4.14m; within this Power 
Brands active customer accounts 
2.00m, up 6.9%. 
Further improvements to product 
quality, style credentials and 
promotional efficiency.
Strong USA performance, with 
revenue up 29% and the first 
profit delivered in the second half.
Our major warehouse extension 
was completed, on time and 
on budget. This new facility will 
enable us to further improve 
our already strong delivery 
proposition. 
We are also in the process of gaining our 
full FCA authorisation, following the FCA 
taking over regulation of the consumer 
credit industry from the OFT previously. 
We are well on with the process and it is 
progressing in line with expectations. 
Our Group is strong, with loyal customers 
and good margins. Once delivered, Fit 4 
the Future will give us the robust platform 
we need for growth in the future.
Dividend 
Whilst continuing to invest in the business, 
particularly on our systems programme Fit 
4 the Future and our new warehouse, we 
also continue to recognise the importance 
of cash returns to our shareholders. We 
intend to pay a final dividend of 8.56p this 
year, taking the total dividend to 14.23p, 
unchanged from FY15.

Board composition 
As I reported in last year’s annual report, 
we had a number of changes to the Board, 
and I am pleased to report that the new 
team is working well together. This year 
there is just one change to announce, 
namely that Simon Patterson stepped 
down in April 2016 to take up the same 
position at a much larger retailer. We wish 
him well and thank him for his time and 
advice. We are currently in the process  
of recruiting a replacement for Simon.
Outlook 
Consumer shopping habits are changing 
at an unprecedented rate. Online 
shopping continues to take share from 
both catalogues and physical stores at  
a pace, and those retailers who prosper 
will be those who can stay ahead of this 
ever-changing backdrop. 
As well as the traditional retail skills  
of buying, merchandising and offering 
great value to our customers, we also 
need to have exceptional data analysis 
skills, digital marketing capabilities  
and a continuously improving delivery 
proposition. Given our home shopping 
heritage we already have some 
significant in-house experience, and  
with almost two-thirds of our sales now 
coming online we are in a much stronger 
position than many of our competitors 
– but we cannot become complacent,  
we must continuously strive to improve. 
The Board is confident in the long-term 
outlook for the business and excited 
about our future growth potential. 
I would like to express my sincere thanks 
to all stakeholders in the business, and  
in particular our fantastic colleagues,  
for all their dedication, hard work and 
enthusiasm throughout the year.

GUSTO shapes our culture. GUSTO celebrates positive attitudes  
and behaviours. GUSTO is how we do things around here.
Glow with pride
We're proud to make great products that 
people love. Our clothes generate a feel-good 
factor – for our customers and for us. 
Understanding is everything
Everything starts and ends with understanding 
and respecting the customer. They are our 
passion, their shopping habits and preferences 
our priority. They’re why we exist, and why 
we succeed. 
Saving makes sense
Waste is the enemy. We value simplicity  
and the saving of resources and time.
Togetherness is crucial 
Teamwork triumphs in the end. There are few 
tasks and even fewer problems that can’t be 
tackled successfully though togetherness, 
shared goals and collective effort. 
Opportunity exists everywhere 
There are always things to improve, chances 
to be seized and ideas to be unleashed.  
We take the opportunities to build a better 
business, and to build a better you. 
Value back into business

We invest into our business to ensure that 
we can drive profitable, sustainable growth

Our shareholders are very important to us, 
and we value the support and input they 
give us. We are focused on a progressive 
dividend policy. 
“Taking Care of Our World”
We believe we should be a major force

It’s a huge responsibility, and a purpose 
way beyond profit.

Strategic report
17
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 It has been a very busy year for N Brown as 
we continue to transform the way we operate 
as a fashion retailer – from a direct mail led 
model to a digital led model. We are midway 
through this journey and are delighted to see 
the benefits coming through, importantly 
delivering 11%
1
 profit growth in the second 
half of the year.
Introduction 
The transformation of our business 
model continues at pace. We have a clear 
focus on our three fashion Power Brands  
–  JD Williams, Simply Be and Jacamo,  
and I am pleased to report that revenue 
here was up 10% year-on-year. I am  
also pleased with the strong online 
metrics we are delivering, with online 
penetration at a new record 65%. We  
are taking decisive actions to improve  
the performance of our Traditional 
Segment which remains an important, 
profitable part of the Group. 
Our performance in FY16 was in line with 
expectations, with strong 11%
1
 profit 
growth achieved in H2, as we annualised a 
number of changes made to the business 
in FY15. We had a good Christmas period 
and for the first time were able to be truly 
agile in our trading approach, particularly 
for our digital brands. 
We continue to roll-out our systems 
investment programme, ‘Fit 4 the Future’ , 
and all areas of the business are focused 
on ensuring this lands on time and with 
minimal disruption. So far progress is  
on track and within budget. 
Looking forward, whilst we face 
challenging market conditions for  
the fashion sector overall, we remain 
confident in our ability to make further 
progress this year.  
This is based on the strong appeal of 
our specialist fit proposition, continuous 
improvement in the customer experience 
and changes in customer shopping 
behaviour, driven by targeted marketing.
Strategic progress
Our vision is to be the universally loved 
experts in fashion that fits, helping our 
customers look and feel amazing through 
our trusted family of fashion brands.  
We operate in attractive market niches  
– plus-size and age 50-plus – which we 
believe to be under-served by the fashion 
industry overall, providing our customers 
with high quality and competitive 
product offerings, fit-specialism and  
a strong delivery proposition. 
Foundations  
for future growth
We are really pleased with  
our performance to date in  
the USA. We have been building  
a sustainable, profitable business 
model, built upon customer 
loyalty, and this will serve us  
well when we accelerate our 
growth in this country. 
Beyond the USA, our future 
capability enabled by global  
ship anywhere will allow us to 
unlock the international potential 
of our brands. 
We are excited about the growth 
potential that our new Financial 
Services systems will give us. 
We will be able to charge 
variable APRs, allowing us to 
offer our customers a far more 
personalised choice of Financial 
Services products, broadening 
our appeal.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
SEIZING FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES
18
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 We are mid-way through a significant 
transformation which will allow us to 
deliver sustainable, profitable growth 
over the long term, driven by our four 
strategic foundations:
• Product 
• Price 
• People 
• Place 
Our systems transformation project,  
Fit 4 the Future, is progressing well. 
During the second half we launched our 
Simply Be Euro website (the first phase  
of our Global Multi-channel release) and 
Powercurve (the foundation of our Credit 
release). Both launches were on-time  
and results continue to be encouraging.
Fit 4 the Future is the largest project  
ever undertaken by the Group, and as 
such there are inevitably risks, but we 
continue to do everything possible to 
ensure that risks and business disruption 
are minimised and that the future benefits 
of the investment are maximised. The 
benefits case is unchanged and we 
expect these to start to ramp up from 
FY18 onwards. As previously disclosed, 
some of these benefits will be reinvested 
back into the business. 
The timetable for Fit 4 the Future is also 
unchanged. This August we plan to start 
the roll-out of our new web platform and 
new financial services systems, initially  
to the USA, and then to a number of our 
smaller UK brands in September. Our 
main brands will move onto the new 
systems in early 2017 , after peak trading. 
In May we completed the roll-out  
of the first phase of our Planning 
transformation, giving us improved 
tools for assortment and range 
planning. This will allow us greater 
visibility, control and consistency.  
The second phase of the Planning 
release, which will give us item-level 
forecasting tools, improving markdown 
efficiency, will go live in early 2017.
I am also happy to report that the 
warehouse extension at our main 
warehouse facility, in Shaw, is now 
complete and in the process of coming  
on stream. The project was completed  
on time and to budget. The new facility 
has doubled our through-put capacity, 
ensuring we continue to operate 
efficiently. Importantly it will also 
materially improve our next day 
availability, allow us to further extend  
our cut-off for next day delivery, and 
underpin our international expansion 
plans for the future. 
Outlook 
Trading since the year end has been 
subdued, with sales lower year on  
year. This is mainly the result of the 
industry backdrop which has been  
more challenging since January.  
We also have a headwind from our 
Traditional Segment which we believe  
we can address through improved 
targeted marketing. We expect to  
see performance strengthen over  
the first half. 
From a non-trading perspective, FX  
rates represent a significant challenge 
year on year and we have also decided  
to undertake a one-off exercise to more 
aggressively clear some one to two year 
old inventory, enabled by our new online 
clearance tools.
Overall, we remain confident in our  
ability to make further progress this year. 
This is based on the strong appeal of  
our specialist fit proposition, continuous 
improvement in the customer experience 
and changes in customer shopping 
behaviour, driven by targeted marketing.

  Performance Review  p32
Economic trends
The global economic backdrop  
is uncertain, with recent volatility, 
particularly in foreign exchange  
rates, as a result of the upcoming EU 
referendum, unhelpful particularly 
from a sourcing standpoint. 
Consumer confidence in the UK  
is currently relatively fragile. The 
introduction of the National Living 
Wage is a net positive for the Group, 
as it should result in higher disposable 
income for our customers, although 
cuts to benefits would likely be a 
negative. Overall, when forecasting 
we assume a generally benign 
economic environment. 
Retail trends
Shopping globally is increasingly 
online; the BRC estimates that over 
20% of all non-food retail spending 
now takes place online. We are 
well-placed to benefit from this trend, 
given our digital-first approach. 
Customers increasingly shop through 
their mobiles; again we are ahead of 
this trend, with 66% of traffic coming 
from mobile devices. From a delivery 
standpoint customers increasingly

over 5,000 collection points and have

Market trends
Customers are increasingly driven  
by product newness, with shopping 
‘just in time’ during the season having 
replaced traditional purchase trends of 
buying at the start of seasons. We are 
accordingly increasing the frequency 
of new products being offered to our 
customers, and to facilitate this are 
increasing our sourcing from countries 
closer to the UK. Competition in the 
UK retail sector remains as tough as 
ever; we believe our niche positions  
of plus-sizes and older customers are 
important against this backdrop.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Previously, we relied on 
external design agencies and 
tended to follow the high 
street, meaning our ranges 
weren’t as fashionable as they 
could have been. Over the last 
18 months we have significantly 
invested in a new in-house team 
of talented designers. This  
team ensures that our product 
offering captures all the latest 
trends in comprehensive and 
brand-appropriate ways. 
Our designers fulfill a range of tasks. 
They make sure we are on-trend 
and have fashionable collections 
which appeal both to our loyal 
existing customers and attract new 
ones. They translate the colours, 
shapes and styles of the season to 
fit and flatter our customers, 
whatever their age or size. 
Having the team has also 
allowed us to introduce new 
ranges which are designed 
in-house from scratch, such  
as the fast fashion Simply Be 
Unique range and the Lorraine 
Kelly for JD Williams collection. 
Initially the team was primarily 
focused on Womenswear,  
but we continue to expand,  
with recruits in Footwear, 
Accessories, Menswear and  
a dedicated print designer  
all recently joining.

Attractive promotions 
which drive cash margin
As we reported in last year’s 
report, Autumn 2014 saw us 
undertake a strategic price 
re-calibration, rebasing our prices 
to ensure we were competitive. 
This year our focus was on 
improving our promotional 
efficiency, ensuring that we  
drove volumes and as a result 
generated positive cash margin. 
This was most apparent over the 
Black Friday and Cyber Monday 
week. We planned the event 
months in advance, buying some 
great products specifically for it, 
at attractive margins – so both 
our customers, and our business, 
got some great deals.

The new building has doubled our pick-face, 
increased our throughput capacity by 30%

enable us to get products to our customers

This KPI is a measure of customer

and we are very pleased with  
the 120bps improvement this 
year. Product mix (the relative 
outperformance of Homewares 
and Menswear), further 
improvements to our product 
quality and fit, and the increase  
in cash customers all contributed 
to the decline in our returns rate, 
in roughly equal measure. 
Outlook
The relative outperformance of 
Homewares and Menswear is 
unlikely to continue indefinitely; 
Womenswear growth is positive 
in margin terms but a headwind 
to our returns rate. Product

A clear process  
for risk management
Risk management
The directors have overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the Group maintains a 
sound system of internal control. There 
are inherent limitations in any system  
of internal control and no system can 
provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatement, loss or failure. 
Equally no system can guarantee 
elimination of the risk of failure to  
meet the objectives of the business. 
Against this background, the board  
has established a continuous process  
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks the Group faces in 
order to give it reasonable assurances 
regarding its operations and compliance 
with laws and regulations.
In order to ensure key business 
developments and emerging risks are 
appropriately factored into the risk 
management process, the Group’s 
internal auditors again facilitated a board 
level risk session in the year. The Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer and 
head of internal audit, along with the 
operational directors identified, ranked 
and reviewed the key risks facing the 
business and appraised the structure of 
internal controls and identified current 
and proposed activities to mitigate these 
risks. The committee was provided with 
and discussed the outputs from this 
process which were used by internal 
audit as a key driver in developing the 
annual internal audit plan.
An enterprise wide mapping of activities 
across business functions was also 
undertaken by internal audit during the 
year to assess the level of risk within each 
activity. Output from this process has also 
been reflected in the annual audit plan.
Appropriate responsibilities and 
accountabilities have been set to  
ensure that there is ownership of the 
actions required to mitigate risk across 
the business.
Risk committee 
Operational management is asked to 
present on a cyclical basis on the progress 
of agreed actions against the major risks 
identified by the process. The output is 
shared with the audit committee and the 
full board.

Audit committee
Receives and reviews reports from senior 
management to consider whether significant

are being identified, evaluated, managed

The Audit Committee report is set out in 
pages 59 to 61. 
Board committees
The board believes that appropriate 
internal financial, operational and 
compliance controls are in place 
throughout the Group, the most significant 
of which have been specifically referred to 
in this report. The Group has a well-
defined organisational structure, with clear 
lines of responsibility and explicit authority 
delegated to divisional boards and 
executive management. The Group also 
has a comprehensive financial reporting 
system with good communication of plans, 
budgets and monthly results to relevant 
levels of management and the board.
The Group has complied, and continues 
to comply, with the provisions of the 
Code on internal controls. There is an 
on-going process in place for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks facing the Group that has been in 
place throughout the year and to the 
date of this report. The process has  
been reviewed by the committee and  
the board and accords with guidance 
appended to the Code.
The principal risks which the Group  
has identified, together with actions to 
mitigate those risks are set out overleaf.
The directors have 
overall responsibility 
for ensuring that  
the Group maintains  
a sound system  
of internal control.
Risk Appetite
The Group’s framework for managing  
its consideration of risk appetite forms 
part of the annual Risk Management 
Cycle and is used to drive and inform  
any actions undertaken in response  
to the principal risks identified by the 
board. Within this framework, the 
Group’s appetite for risk is defined with 
reference to the expectations of the 
board for both commercial opportunity 
and internal control and is used to inform 
the Group’s Internal Audit Plan.

JD Williams 
goes from strength to 
strength, with our stylish 
product offer, digital 
marketing skills and ‘life 
begins at 50’ mantra really 
resonating with customers. 
Simply Be 
is an empowering online 
fashion brand, bringing stylish 
products to all regardless of 
size. The brand is gaining 
significant momentum both  
at home and in the USA. 
4.7%
Product revenue increase, to £151.2m
15.6% 
Product revenue increase, to £103.9m
The JD Williams brand continues to 
perform well, as the improvements we are 
making to our products, our PR activity 
and our digital marketing campaigns 
continue to yield strong results. 
This season we significantly extended  
the menswear range within JD Williams, 
which is called Williams & Brown, and 
performance has exceeded expectations. 
Our JD Williams VIP scheme, first 
launched in May 2015 and offered to  
our most loyal JD Williams customers, 
continues to drive encouraging results  
in both frequency of spend and  
customer retention. 
In February, on the eve of London 
Fashion Week, we hosted a JD Williams 
fashion show dedicated to females  
over 50 in partnership with the London 
College of Fashion. This was live-
streamed onto JDWilliams.co.uk and 
received significant press coverage, 
further building brand awareness. 
We continue to improve our digital 
marketing expertise and social 
engagement, championing size  
inclusivity and body confidence. 
We also continue to improve our 
products, delivering newness to 
customers every week and extending  
our ranges with Coast (exclusively in 
larger sizes) and Sprinkle of Glitter in 
SS16 after a great customer reaction  
in AW15. 
Our digital marketing capabilities – 
increasing personalisation, offering 
exciting offers to our customers, and 
ensuring our site looks inspirational – 
continue to drive conversion and 
frequency of spend. In the coming  
year we are planning to launch a  
loyalty app to further drive retention.
We are excited about the global growth 
opportunity that Simply Be represents.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Strategic report Overall online penetration now at 90%
Excluding stores, 97% of new customer 
orders now come online
Refreshed the brand look and feel  
during the past year
Driving on Dave sponsorship
Improved the fit of our smaller sizes
Jacamo 
continues to grow strongly, 
with customers loving its 
digital offer and collections 
available in a market-leading 
range of sizes, from Small  
to 5XL. 
Secondary Brands 
delivered a pleasing 
performance during the year. 
We believe that we could serve these 
customers better, and have therefore 
taken a number of actions to improve 
performance. These actions include 
establishing a dedicated marketing team, 
changing our approach to promotions 
and giving a renewed focus on  
ensuring our product offering inspires 
and delights these customers. The low 
online penetration of this segment means 
that it is likely to take until the Autumn 
season before performance is improved, 
although we are confident that the 
actions we are taking will yield results. 
International 
continues to deliver 
impressive results. This  
year our USA business  
grew revenue by 29%,  
and delivered a profit  
for the first time in H2.
We are pleased with our performance  
in the USA, with revenue of £14.3m, up 
29% year on year and 20% in constant 
currency terms. We reduced the 
operating loss significantly, from  
£2.5m last year to £1.0m this year. 
In H2 we made a profit for the first  
time on a constant currency basis,  
of $0.2m compared to a loss of $0.9m  
in H2 FY15. This marks an important 
milestone for our USA operations. The 
significant improvement year on year 
was driven by a combination of factors, 
14.6%
Product revenue increase, to £62.8m
1.9%
Product revenue increase, to £152.7m
We have made significant product 
improvements during the quarter, 
focused particularly on broadening the 
brand appeal, the styling of the product 
range and the fit of our smaller sizes, 
which has resulted in strong sales and  
an encouraging reduction in the returns 
rate of these sizes. 
During the second half of the year we 
refreshed the look and feel of the brand, 
improving cut-through. In December 
Jacamo became the official sponsors  
of the Driving shows on Dave TV, which 
has a real resonance with our customers. 
Jacamo has also teamed up with 
Paralympian Jonnie Peacock for our  
new SS16 campaign, championing 
inclusivity and promoting body diversity 
and confidence. 
Overall revenue of this Group was up 
1.9% year on year to £152.7m, with 
Fashion World performing particularly 
well within this. 
All four of these brands are digital-first  
in their approach. Our central approach 
also means that running them is  
highly efficient. 
Traditional Segment 
revenue was down 5.5% year 
on year, and we are taking 
decisive actions to improve 
performance.
5.5%
Product revenue decrease, to £1 36.0m
Whilst not a future growth driver, the 
Traditional Segment remains relevant to 
the Group’s overall portfolio. We have 
loyal customers who we know well, and 
long-established internal skillsets and 
capabilities in serving these customers.  
It is an attractive and accessible market, 
underserved by other retailers, and  
we generate a good financial return.  
In addition, our central approach to 
running our portfolio of brands means 
that operating these traditional titles  
is highly efficient for us. 
Our Traditional titles have seen a 
disappointing revenue performance 
during FY16, with revenue down 5.5%. 
Whilst we see greater near-term growth 
opportunities in our Power Brands, our 
Secondary Brands – the main brands here 
being Figleaves, High and Mighty, Fashion 
World and Marisota – are all strong, with 
specific customer niche focuses, and all 
have attractive growth potential.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 including the loyalty of our customer 
base, continued marketing efficiency,  
an improvement in promotional 
efficiency and a small change to our 
delivery offering. 
In March 2016 we launched the JD 
Williams brand in the USA and, whilst 
early days, the initial performance  
has been very encouraging. 
Our new international web platform  
goes live in the USA in August. This will 
give us much improved personalisation 
tools and a more agile site from an 
operations perspective. Until this 
platform is live we will remain in cautious 
expansion mode in the USA, with a focus 
on further improving customer loyalty, 
building brand awareness and 
increasing profitability. 
Ireland
Our Ireland business delivered a good 
performance in FY16, with revenue 
growth of 4% in constant currency  
terms. We have a well-established  
and loyal customer file in Ireland,  
and, encouragingly, the revenue  
growth in FY16 was also driven by  
new customers, who are responding  
well to our improved product offering.  
In sterling terms Ireland revenues were 
£13.4m in FY16, down 7% year on year. 
Stores 
remain an important enabler 
for our business, driving both 
online sales in their catchment 
areas and brand awareness.
Stores remain a small part of our overall 
Group, although we see them as an 
important enabler of our overall growth 
strategy. Sales from our store estate were 
up 18% to £27 .0m. The operating loss 
was £1.0m versus £0.8m last year. There 
remains more to do in terms of improving 
the efficiency of our store estate. 
We have 14 dual-fascia Simply Be and 
Jacamo stores. Our long-term strategy 
here is unchanged – we plan to ultimately 
have 25 stores in total, covering 85%  
of the population. We continue to see  
a positive halo effect from our store 
portfolio and they are also important in 
terms of serving customers and building 
brand awareness. 
 
Financial Services 
performed well during FY16 
and offers our customers a 
way of spreading the cost  
of their purchases over time.
2.1%
Revenue increase, to £259.6m
Financial Services revenue was up 2.1% 
to £259.6m. This includes the £19.0m 
increase to revenue as a result of the 
IAS 39 restatement (FY15: £19.2m); 
more detail on the restatement is  
within the Financial Review. 
Our aim is to grow two key customer 
bases – customers who utilise their 
account (internally termed our ‘rollers’) 
and cash customers, who pay immediately 
on a credit or debit card. Currently half of 
new customers opt to open a credit 
account, and half are cash customers. 
Whilst less profitable, cash customers 
generate attractive returns, and are 
important in terms of driving our growth, 
broadening our appeal and enabling us to 
gain economies of scale. Once our new 
Financial Services offering is live we will 
aim to convert some of our new and 
existing cash customers to account 
customers; this is not currently a focus 
given our relatively inflexible offering. 
At the first half results we reported  
an increase in new credit customer 
recruits who roll a balance, the first such 
increase for three years. We are pleased 
to report that this trend has continued, 
up 2% in the second half. This is a 
slowdown on the figure reported in  
the first half, however, primarily as a 
result of tightened fraud rules. We 
continue to believe that the primary 
driver of an increase in new credit 
customers is our improved product 
proposition. 
Over Christmas we ran a small trial on  
a few of our brands offering 0% interest 
to new customers. The initial results of 
this trial are positive, although we need 
to assess the behaviour of customers 
who took up the offer over the course 
of the current season before we will be 
able to fully judge the result. 
Our new Financial Services Director 
Steve Johnson joined in February  
and is already making a significant 
contribution in improving and 
modernising our operations. We are 
assessing our approach to data capture 
and processes, and believe there are 
changes we could make to not only 
improve our efficiency, but also the 
customer experience. 
The Credit release of Fit 4 the Future 
goes live from Autumn 2016, with the 
main brands moving onto the new 
credit platform in early calendar 2017 . 
The new platform will allow us to  
charge variable APRs for the first time, 
as well as offer promotional interest 
free periods and other new credit 
products. This will broaden our appeal 
and further enable future growth. 
In common with the wider industry, we 
are now regulated by the FCA, having 
historically been regulated by the OFT. 
Our FCA application is progressing in 
line with expectations.

GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER'S REVIEW

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 IAS 39 restatement
In late February we announced that  
we would be restating our debtor 
impairment provisions as a consequence 
of a review of the application of IAS 39;  
the year on year movement of the 
restated provisions has resulted in  
an increase to profit before tax in  
both FY16 and FY15 of £3.8m and  
£2.0m respectively. 
Importantly, this change in the  
technical interpretation of this accounting 
standard has no effect on the way in 
which we have operated or will operate 
our business. 
Unless otherwise stated, the following 
financial results and commentary is 
inclusive of the impacts as a result of  
the restatement. 
Revenue performance
Total continuing Group revenue was 
+3.5% to £866.2m. Product revenue 
increased by 4.1% to £606.6m. Financial 
Services revenue increased by 2.1% to 
£259.6m (FY15: £254.3m). 
Revenue performance by brand is  
shown on the table to the right. We  
have changed our categorisation to more 
clearly show externally the performance 
of our brands. In line with our strategy of 
focusing our efforts and marketing spend 
on our Power Brands, revenue from our 
Traditional Segment and Secondary 
Brands combined accounted for 47 .6%  
of product revenue, down 280bps versus 
last year. 
Revenue by category is also shown  
to the right. Ladieswear revenue was  
up 0.9%, with the headwind of our 
Traditional Segment partially offsetting 
strong growth in both JD Williams and 
Simply Be. Menswear revenue was up 
0.7%, with an improving trend through 
the year; first half revenue was down 
2.9%, whilst second half was up 4.5%. 
Footwear saw strong growth of 5.2% 
driven by improvements in our products 
and pricing architecture. 
Home and Gift revenue was up 9.3%, 
with second half growth below the  
level recorded in the first half as a result 
of tougher comparatives and a more 
subdued performance of House of  
Bath. Our strategy in Home remains 
unchanged – we aim to recruit new 
customers to our Fashion offering,  
but then see customers using their  
account to also buy Homewares. Within 
Homewares we focus on our “Famous 
Five” categories given their higher gross 
margin (these are Furniture, Gifting, 
Home Textiles, Kitchen and Home Décor, 
and Outdoor Living and Christmas). 
Famous Five categories were up by  
12% year on year, with a particularly 
strong performance in Furniture. 
Gross margin
Product COGS were £265.7m in FY16, 
compared to £253.9m in FY15. Product 
gross margin was 56.2%, down 20bps 
year on year. This was driven by the  
price re-calibration exercise previously 
disclosed, which impacted first half gross 
margin, partially offset by promotional 
efficiency and bought-in margin gains. 
H2 gross margin increased by 90bps  
to 54.7%. 
Turning to Financial Services, gross  
bad debt was £110.3m (FY15: £109.0m). 
This bad debt charge, combined with a 
small number of direct financial services 
costs, resulted in a Financial Services 
gross margin of 54.6%, up 20bps year  
on year (FY15: 54.4%). The improvement 
was driven by lower write-offs as a 
consequence of the improved quality  
of the debtor book.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Strategic report Operating costs
Warehouse and Fulfilment costs 
increased by 3.8% to £76.7m. This was 
driven primarily by volumes, although 
these were partially offset by lower  
fuel costs and efficiency savings. 
The 4.5% increase in marketing and 
production costs was driven by a 
continued shift into digital channels. 
Whilst marketing and production costs  
as a percentage of sales increased,  
this is skewed by the outsourcing of  
our creative production function,  
which resulted in some costs effectively 
being transferred from payroll into  
this cost category; this accounted  
for approximately half of the increase  
as a percentage of revenue. 
Admin and payroll costs continue to be 
managed tightly, broadly flat at £122.6m, 
with these costs falling by 3% in the 
second half specifically. Depreciation  
and amortisation increased by 18.9%  
as a result of the investments we have 
made into the business. 
Overall, operating profit before 
exceptional items was £96.4m.  
This includes a £3.8m credit (FY15:  
credit £2.0m) as a result of the IAS 39 
restatement. Excluding these credits, 
FY16 operating profit was £92.6m  
(FY15: £93.8m). In the second half, 
operating profit (prior to IAS 39 
restatement and exceptional items) 
increased by 10.7% to £53.8m  
(FY15: £48.6m). 
Net finance costs were £8.1m compared 
to £7 .6m last year, as a result of a higher 
debt position.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 FX sensitivity guide
Every 0.05 rate move in $/£ (for instance 
1.45 to 1.40) represents approximately a 
£1m impact on PBT. We are significantly 
less exposed to movements in the €/£ 
exchange rate, with each 0.05 move 
representing approximately a £0.3m  
PBT impact. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional costs totalled £17 .2m, of 
which £14.0m was incurred in the first 
half. The majority of these costs were  
as a result of strategic re-organisation 
and the closure of our small estate of 
clearance stores. 
Discontinued operation  
– Gray & Osbourn
As previously announced, the Board 
decided to close the Gray & Osbourn 
catalogue business in January 2015. 
Given the decision to close this business 
it is now classified as a discontinued 
operation. The loss after tax from  
this business was £0.6m (FY15: loss  
of £10.4m). 
Taxation
The effective rate of corporation tax for 
the year is 23.9% (FY15: 21.5%). The FY16 
rate was impacted by an adjustment 
relating to historical periods in respect  
of outstanding items with HMRC. The  
tax charge for the year was £17 .3m  
(FY15: £16.8m) which meant that profit 
from continuing operations was £54.9m  
(FY15: £61.5m). 
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 24.02p  
(FY15: 24.61p). Earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 19.45p  
(FY15: 21.84p).
Dividends
The Board proposes a final dividend of 
8.56p, flat year on year, taking the full 
year dividend to 14.23p, also unchanged 
on last year. This is covered 1.7 times 
(FY15: 1.7 times).
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for the year was 
£58.7m (FY15: £63.3m). The majority  
of this investment was on our systems 
transformation programme Fit 4 the 
Future, with a further £12m spent on the 
final stage of our warehouse extension. 
Balance sheet and cash flow 
Inventory levels at the year-end increased 
by 7 .1% to £101.5m (FY15: £94.8m)  
driven primarily by the timing of the  
new season intake. 
Trade receivables, before provision, 
decreased by 0.5% to £624.7m  
(FY15: £627 .9m). The reduction in  
the provision from £100.9m to £97 .6m 
reflects the improvement in customer 
arrears profiles. 
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme has moved from a deficit of 
£3.3m last year to a surplus of £10.8m. 
The movement predominately arises 
from an actuarial gain of £12.5m as a 
result of an increase in corporate bond 
yields and a fall in market expectations 
for inflation.
Cash generated from operations was 
£86.9m compared to £93.8m last year. 
After funding capital expenditure, 
finance costs, taxation and dividends,  
net debt increased by £43.1m to £289.7m 
(FY15: £246.6m). Gearing levels increased 
from 55% to 61%.

We’re determined to understand our 
effect on the world, and find better 
smarter and more sustainable ways  
of working. To learn and to teach, to 
recycle, reuse and respect, wherever  
we are on our big beautiful planet. 
We are looking at opportunities to 
improve the performance of our supply 
chain to promote more sustainable ways 
of working such as working with less 
packaging for our footwear teams and 
reducing waste within the supply chain.
EVERY PRODUCT
OUR PRODUCTS SHOULD 
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL AS 
GOOD AS THEY LOOK
The Group has been working closely with 
its suppliers over the last couple of years  
to improve the customer experience  
and promote responsible sourcing.  
This means partnering with suppliers  
who share our values and standards.  
By working together, we hope to create 
more responsible and sustainable 
products that our customers can enjoy 
with confidence. 
Since opening our Sourcing Office in 
Dhaka in October 2015, we have been 
able to work more directly with suppliers 
and gain better visibility of our wider 
supply chain.  
ALL PEOPLE
WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
CONCERNED, SO ARE WE
We want everyone who works for us, 
wherever they are, to be treated with 
fairness, dignity, equality and respect. 
Everything we achieve as a business  
we will achieve through people.
In the last year we have increased levels 
of CSR training and awareness of our 
staff with compliance and ethical trading. 
We will continue to invest in this initiative 
and roll out more CSR training to staff.
We are proud to be one of the  
founding members of the ACT (Action, 
Collaboration & Transformation Working 
Group) which promotes fair, living  
wages for individuals working in factories 
making products for retailers. We feel 
membership of this is important because 
it allows us to lobby for support at all 
levels from governments to trade 
organisations and Civil Society groups.
We continue to work closely with 
partners on the Shomotha Project in 
Bangladesh. The Shomotha Project  
is a TGVCI (Trade in Global Values  
Chains Initiative), jointly funded by  
N Brown Group and DFID (Department  
for International Development) and 
promotes gender equality throughout 
organisations from Senior Management 
to Operational Staff. The first tangible 
results are expected later in 2016.
During 2015/6, we established our first 
sourcing office in Bangladesh, which  
has enabled us to work much closer with 
suppliers, local partners, civil societies 
and government agencies. We have 10 
staff on the ground in Bangladesh to 
manage quality and compliance activities 
throughout the South East Asian region.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 This has not only helped build better 
relationships and improve product 
quality but has enabled us to accelerate 
our CSR activities where it matters and 
make product margin improvements. 
We continue to be signatories of and 
active participants in the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC) and the Ethical 
Trading Initiative (ETI); which underpins 
our CSR aims. We will continue to work 
closely with the UNGC and ETI in 2016/7 
to address current and emerging issues 
such as tackling working conditions and 
discrimination of migrant workers in 
countries (for example in Turkey).
As part of our participation in the UNGC 
working group we are still in dialogue 
with internal and external stakeholders  
to formulate our anti-slavery policy and 
will publish our statement in due course. 
We have continued to work with the 
other retailers, brands and the ETI to 
improve working conditions in Leicester, 
UK which is now starting to address 
some of the issues which were 
highlighted such as excessive working 
hours, low wages and regular 
unauthorised sub-contractors. 
We continue to work closely with the 
ACCORD in Bangladesh which was 
established to improve building standards, 
fire and electrical safety and support those 
who participate in CSR related matters 
(see http://bangladeshaccord.org/).  
We are signatories of the ACCORD 
Agreement together with over 180  
global retailers who source from 
Bangladesh. We were a founding 
member and this involves a five-year 
commitment to improve standards in  
the Bangladesh garment industry.  
All our factories are now being regularly 
inspected by qualified engineers who  
we work collaboratively with to correct 
any issues or findings, with corrective 
plans publically disclosed. 
In Bangladesh we employed a Regional 
CSR manager to help improve our 
understanding of our entire supply  
chain initially in South East Asia (India, 
Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and 
this appointment has helped to make 
great progress during 2015 by working in 
partnership with the likes of the ACCORD 
to improve building, fire and electrical 
safety within our entire Bangladesh 
supply chain. 
We have worked hard to strengthen our 
supply base during the year, allowing us 
to increase the number of products we 
source directly.
Having introduced several policies in 
2014/5 such as our human rights policy, 
animal welfare and forestry/deforestation 
Policy, we will continue to develop and 
make financial investments in technology 
and people to enable us to monitor and 
report on improvements in the next 
couple of years.

ENVIRONMENT 
Overview
Our sustainability strategy and 
environmental performance has  
become an integral element of our  
core business strategy. As a responsible 
multi-channel retailer, we have formally 
committed to reduction targets and 
continually strive to exceed expectations 
of our customers, staff and investors. 
Group-wide sustainability responsibility 
has been assigned to Ian Carr, director  
of logistics, who sits on the operational 
board of J D Williams & Company 
Limited and who reports to the Chief 
Executive Officer and, through her,  
to the board of directors.
Since 2007 , the Group has been actively 
working alongside its environmental 
partners, Envantage Limited and  
Viridor Limited, to boost environmental 
performance and increase Group-wide 
environmental awareness and 
accountability. Ongoing investment  
into energy, carbon, waste and water 
minimisation initiatives has led to  
a reduction in our carbon emissions  
and water footprint profiles.
Green House Gas (GHG)  
emissions profile
Our Green House Gas (GHG) emissions 
inventory is calculated for the global 
Group under the operational control 
approach, in accordance with the GHG 
Protocol and GHG emissions factors 
published by DECC. The inventory is 
independently calculated by our carbon 
consultants partner Envantage Ltd.
Under GHG reporting guidelines,  
scope 1 and 2 emissions are the key 
mandatory areas to report, illustrating 
the environmental impact of the Group 
for activities where we have direct control 
i.e. operation of our sites and vehicles.  
As a responsible retailer we have also 
taken steps to quantify as many extra 
optional scope 3 emission sources 
related to our operation to boost our 
environmental impact assessment and 
emissions reduction plan.
The table and chart below illustrate our 
GHG emissions across all our reporting 
areas, for the global Group from  
1 March 2015 to 29 February 2016 and 
the previous year.

New for 2016 - market based 
greenhouse gas reporting
Overview
In January 2015, the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol updated their Scope 2 reporting 
guidelines on how organisations shall 
report their emissions relating to 
purchased electricity, heat and steam. 
Companies shall now report two sets of 
Scope 2 emissions: one using a location 
based method and another using a 
market based method. This is termed  
as “dual reporting”.
The location based method reflects the 
average emissions intensity of grids on 
which energy consumption occurs; the 
same way that electricity emissions have 
been reported historically. The market 
based method reflects the emissions for 
the energy that a company is purchasing, 
as supplies under different contracts  
emit more or less greenhouse gases 
depending on the energy source or 
technology used. As the market based 
method has only recently been 
introduced there are some areas of 
concern or uncertainty as outlined below.
Uncertainties and concerns
The fuel mix disclosures provided by 
suppliers are released “after the event” 
each year. For example, the disclosures 
for April 2015 - March 2016 are not 
available until the summer of 2016. 
Green electricity purchase
As well as making efforts to reduce 
emissions by reducing energy 
consumption, the Group are also 
committed to reducing emissions by 
purchasing energy from greener 
technologies and sources. During the  
last inventory period green electricity 
accounted for 82% of our total electricity 
profile. In addition to purchasing green 
electricity we have been generating our 
own green energy via a solar PV plant at 
our main distribution centre since March 
2016. This is in addition to solar power 
generation which has been used at our 
Devon Mill distribution centre since 
January 2014.
When calculating emissions using the 
grid average GHG factors, emissions 
arising from electricity consumption 
account for over half of the total Group 
emissions. However, the actual emissions 
associated with the green energy 
supplies are lower, as explained below.
Total GHG tCO

Market based Electricity 7,462 7,460 0.0 %
Market based-adjusted Electricity 1,644 1,406 -14.5 %
Therefore the 2014 to 2015 disclosures 
have been used for this year’s calculation 
and are likely to change depending  
on how each supplier sourced their 
electricity during this year’s reporting 
period.
Certain suppliers are unable to provide 
the exact fuel mix for the different 
contracts and supplies that they provide 
and tend to only provide a general fuel 
mix disclosure. This is a concern as  
the Group purchase over 80% of their 
electricity through a green contract  
but are unable to take full credit for  
this in their market based emissions 
quantification due to the supplier  
not being able to define the renewable 
fuel mix for this contract.
Dual reporting for N Brown Group
To account for the uncertainty in fuel 
mixes, an adjusted market based  
method has been calculated to reflect 
the expected emissions from the green 
supplies. A summary of emissions 
resulting from all three approaches  
is detailed below. The market based 
emissions factors are only available  
in CO
2
, not CO
2
 equivalent, therefore  
the location based greenhouse gases 
have been reported as CO
2
 to show  
a like-for-like comparison.

Mandatory GHG reporting notes
This data is disclosed is in conformance 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. GHG emissions 
disclosed under the required reporting 
categories fall within the Group’s 
consolidated financial statement.  
Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been 
calculated on a global scale where the 
Group have operation control using the 
GHG protocol. The quantified emissions  
are for the reporting year 1 March 2015 
to 29 February 2016. 
GHG emissions factors published by 
DECC for 2015 have been used to 
calculated GHG emissions. 
Noted change in emissions for 2014-2015 
• Data accuracy: Some data for the 
2014-2015 inventory has been updated 
based on actual data or more accurate 
data for some sources. 
• Update in DECC emissions factors: 
Emissions from the previous published 
report for the period 2014 - 2015 have 
been recalculated with the newly 
published factors for 2015, affecting 
the months of January and February 
2015 (2015 factors were not available 
at time of publish). This has resulted in 
a slight change in emissions reported.
• Revised gas kWh consumption  
at Waterside Hadfield: Since the  
2014 – 2015 emissions figures were 
reported, issues with the two gas 
meters at the Waterside Hadfield site 
were identified. The consumption 
relating to these meters was re-billed 
resulting in a lower kWh than was 
previously reported.
Noted change in emissions historically
• Removal of call centre emissions: 
Operations carried out at the call 
centre were outsourced from 1 
January 2015 onwards. All emissions 
associated with Martin House have 
been removed from the GHG 
inventory base year and all historical 
reporting years, in line with re-
baselining guidance.
Data records
• Natural Gas and electricity: Data is 
primarily calculated based on actual 
metered consumption from invoices  
or meter readings. Where actual 
metered data is not available as energy 
is billed as part of a landlord service 
charge, energy consumption has  
been estimated using floor areas and 
published benchmarks. Some data has 
been estimated where quarterly bills 
have not yet been published.
• Gas oil: Fuel is used in stand by 
generators and onsite transport 
(forklifts etc.). Data for onsite  
transport is calculated using actual  
fuel usage from invoices. This year  
a full set of invoices was not possible  
to obtain so data was taken from 
internal records of gas oil deliveries. 
Generator fuel usage has been 
estimated using generator fuel 
demand per hour and activation 
information.
• Diesel: Data is calculated based on 
actual fuel consumption from invoices.
• Company car: Data is primarily 
calculated for the Group using  
data logged in our Global Expense 
system which records distance 
travelled, and vehicle information  
for each business travel expense 
claimed. The Global Expense system 
was replaced with a Concur system 
part-way through the reporting period 
therefore data has been taken from 
both systems for the relevant periods. 
Any company cars not logged on this 
system have been estimated based  
on milometer readings. 
• HFC: Refrigeration emissions  
have been calculated from the  
F-Gas register for applicable  
plant where provided. This year, 
confirmation of leakages from  
units falling under F-Gas regulation  
at Griffin House and Skyland have  
not been provided, therefore  
leakages have been estimated using 
DECC leakage tables. Emissions for 
plant not affected by this regulation 
(smaller systems) have been calculated 
using data provided by full service 
records. Where service records were 
not available for a very small number  
of shops refrigeration losses have  
been estimated using DECC leakage 
tables. For a very small number of 
shops, details of the systems were  
not known and therefore estimation  
of emissions has not been possible.

Key activities for the committee 
included support and oversight 
of the closure of the Group’s 
defined benefit scheme to  
new accruals and a review of 
and recommendation to the 
board in respect of the Group’s 
incentives schemes. The 
committee also reviewed the 
remuneration packages of  
all executive directors and 
senior executives.
Activities 
During the year we successfully 
launched the Group’s CSR Charter 
“Taking Care of Our World”, 
highlighting our passion for fair 
fashion and introduced a new 
three year CSR strategy aligned 
with the Group’s sourcing and 
commercial strategies. In 
Bangladesh we now directly 
employ skilled personnel , allowing 
us to work collaboratively with 
suppliers, NGO’s, and government 
bodies on the ground.
Activities 
Our activities this year have 
included a review of the Group’s 
succession planning, a board 
evaluation exercise and 
consideration of the skills and 
experience required for a new 
non- executive director in light 
of the current composition, 
skills, expertise and experience 
of the board.
Some of the key activities that the board has covered over the past year are:
•  Strengthening the operating board through the appointment of Steve Johnson, an experienced financial 
services executive and the appointment of Craig Lovelace, our new CFO who has experience in dealing with 
multi-site multi-platform businesses;
•  Reviewing the progress and costs of the Fit 4 the Future Project;
•  Assessing the progress of the Group’s international and High Street strategies; and
•  Reviewing and improving communications with our investors and appointing a Director of Investor Relations.
1. Resigned 1 April 2016.
2. Resigned 28 April 2016.
Outlook
Under the Chairmanship of Fiona 
Laird, we will focus on identifying 
and developing the Group’s 
future leaders and will review  
our executive and non-executive 
director induction and training 
programmes. Together with our 
appointed consultants we will 
seek to appoint a suitably skilled 
and experienced non-executive 
director. 
Outlook
Our focus for 2017 will be on 
investing in technology and 
people to better enable us to 
monitor and report on CSR 
improvements. We are also 
refining our anti-slavery policy 
and will publish our anti-slavery 
statement later this year and 
continuing to identify ways in 
which we can improve the 
performance of our supply 
chain to promote more 
sustainable ways of working. 
Outlook
As we move into delivery of  
Fit 4 the Future, the Committee  
will oversee the implementation 
of the revised incentive 
arrangements which aim to  
focus executives on delivering 
transformation. The Committee 
will also look to foster closer 
relationships with shareholders 
and to provide oversight of the 
new gender pay gap reporting 
requirements.
Outlook
As transformation of the business 
model continues apace, the 
committee will focus on those 
areas which have been identified 
through our risk assessment 
process as being key to the 
delivery of our strategy. This will 
include a review the Group’s 
marketing investment to provide 
assurance that the significant 
investment in this area delivers 
improved targeted marketing to 
all customer segments, a review 
of the delivery of the anticipated 
capabilities and benefits of Fit 4 
the Future and oversight of the 
implementation of a more 
flexible and tailored financial 
services offering.

Act. The review also describes the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group and provides a fair review of 
the Group’s business at the end of the 
financial year.

processes to manage risks appropriately. 
The executive directors and operating

Further detail can be found on pages 28

a holding nor on the transfer of shares 
which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Company's Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation 
(except as set out below in the section 
entitled “Voting Rights and Restrictions 
on Transfers”). No person has any special 
rights over the Group’s share capital and 
all issued shares are fully paid.
Details of outstanding employee share 
options and the operation of the relevant 
schemes are shown in note 29 on page 108. 
The directors have no current plans to 
issue shares other than in connection 
with employee share options.

to be incorporated into this report by 
cross-reference.

The terms of reference for the board

other director had any interest in any 
disclosable contract or arrangements 
with the Group or any subsidiary 
company either during or at the end  
of the year.
Directors’ and officers’ liabilities 
The company’s Articles of Association 
provide that, in so far as the law permits, 
every director of the Group or 
associated company may be indemnified 
by the company against liability. In 
accordance with section 236 of the 
Companies Act, qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions are in place for the 
directors in respect of liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office, to the extent 
permitted by law. In addition, the Group 
maintains insurance for directors and 
officers of the Group, indemnifying them 
against certain liabilities incurred by them 
whilst acting on behalf of the Group. 
Both the insurance and indemnities 
applied throughout the financial year 
ended 27 February 2016 and through  
to the date of this report.

charitable donations of £13,315 (2015, 
£40,818). No political donations have 
been made (2015, nil). No contributions 
have been made to non-EU political 
parties (2015, nil).
Auto-enrolment and  
Stakeholder pension
Until 31st October 2015, The People 
Pension’ was the auto-enrolment 
provider for weekly paid employees, 
whilst Prudential auto-enrolled monthly 
paid employees and ran the Stakeholder 
Pension for weekly employees already  
in the scheme. With effect from  
1 November 2015, Zurich has been 
appointed as provider for all qualifying 
employees. As at 31 May 2016 86.9% of all 
employees were members of a qualifying 
pension scheme with 1,216 employees 
being auto-enrolled as at the date of  
this report. At the date of this report  
the opt out rate is 4.3%.
Financial risk management,  
objectives and policies 
The Group is exposed to certain  
financial risks, namely interest rate risk, 
currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. 
Information regarding such financial risks 
is detailed in note 21 on page 103.  
The Group’s risk management policies 
and procedures and the table of principal 
risks and mitigations can be found on 
pages 28 to 31.
Change of control
There are a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the company  
such as commercial contracts, bank  
loan agreements, property lease 
arrangements and employee share plans. 
None of these are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact 
on the business of the Group as a whole. 
Executive directors’ service contracts  
are terminable by the Group on  
giving 12 months’ notice. There are no 
agreements between the Group and its 
directors or employees that provide for 
additional compensation for loss  
of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid. No relevant 
events were reported in the year.
Significant contracts
The Group has a number of contractual 
arrangements with suppliers (both  
of goods and services) and occupies 
leasehold premises for the purpose  
of conducting its business. Whilst  
these arrangements are important to  
the business of the Group, individually 
none of them are essential to the 
business of the Group and do not  
require disclosure under section 417(5)  
(c) of the Companies Act.
Tax status 
The company is not a close company 
within the meaning of the Corporation 
Tax Act 2010. 
Independent auditor 
The Group’s independent auditors, 
KPMG LLP (“KPMG”), have indicated 
their willingness to continue in office and 
the Audit Committee has recommended 
that KPMG remain in office. A resolution 
to re-appoint the independent auditors 
will be proposed at the AGM. 
The auditor’s fees for both audit and 
non-audit work are given in the Audit 
Committee report on page 61.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Governance Voting rights and restrictions on 
transfer of shares
None of the ordinary shares in the  
Group carry any special rights with 
regard to control of the Group. There  
are no restrictions on transfers of  
shares other than:
• certain restrictions which may from 
time to time be imposed by laws or 
regulations such as those relating  
to insider dealing;
• pursuant to the company's code for 
securities transactions whereby the 
directors and designated employees 
require approval to deal in the 
company's shares; and
• where a person with an interest in  
the company’s shares has been  
served with a disclosure notice and  
has failed to provide the company  
with information concerning interests 
in those shares.
The directors are not aware of any 
arrangements between shareholders  
that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or voting rights.  
The rights and obligations attaching  
to the company's ordinary shares are  
set out in the Articles of Association.
Amendment of the company’s Articles 
of Association
The company’s Articles of Association 
may only be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of 
shareholders. Where class rights are 
varied, such amendments must be 
approved by the members of each  
class of shares separately. The company 
currently only has one class of share.
Powers of the directors
The directors are responsible for the 
management of the business of the 
company and may exercise all powers  
of the company subject to applicable 
legislation and regulation and the 
company’s articles of association.
At the 2015 annual general meeting, the 
directors were given the power to issue 
new shares up to a nominal amount of 
£10,442,189. This power will expire on  
the earlier of the conclusion of the  
2016 annual general meeting or 14 July 
2016. Accordingly, a resolution will be 
proposed at the 2016 annual general 
meeting to renew the Company’s 
authority to issue new shares. 
Directors were also given the power to 
issue new issue shares up to a further 
nominal amount of £10,442,189 in 
connection with an offer by way of a 
rights issue. This authority too will expire 
on the earlier of the conclusion of the 
2016 annual general meeting or 14 July 
2016, and a resolution will be proposed 
at the 2016 annual general meeting to 
renew it. 
Approval was also given at the 2015 
annual general meeting for a certain 
number of shares up to a maximum 
nominal value of £1,566,328 – to be 
allotted pursuant to the authority 
granted to directors set out above 
without being covered by statutory 
pre-emption rights regime. As with the 
previously mentioned approvals, this 
authority too will expire on the earlier of 
the conclusion of the 2016 annual general 
meeting or 14 July 2016, and a resolution 
will be proposed at the 2016 annual 
general meeting to renew this authority.
As in previous years, authorisation for  
the directors to buy back the company’s 
shares will not be sought at the 2016 
annual general meeting.
Employee share schemes  
– rights of control
The trustees of the N Brown Group plc 
Employee Share Ownership Trust hold 
shares on trust for the benefit of the 
executive directors and employees of  
the Group. The shares held by the trust 
are used in connection with the Group's 
various share incentive plans. The 
trustees currently abstain from voting  
but have the power to vote for or against, 
or not at all, at their discretion in respect 
of any shares in the company held in  
the trust. The trustees may, upon the 
recommendation of the company, accept 
or reject any offer relating to the shares 
in any way they see fit, without incurring 
any liability and without being required 
to give reasons for their decision. In 
exercising their trustee powers the 
trustees may take all of the following 
matters into account:
• the long-term interests of beneficiaries;
• the interests of beneficiaries other than 
financial interests;
• the interests of beneficiaries in their 
capacity as employees or former 
employees or their dependants;
• the interests of persons (whether  
or not identified) who may become 
beneficiaries in the future; and
• considerations of a local, moral,  
ethical, environmental or social nature. 
Going concern 
The directors have adopted the going 
concern basis in the financial statements 
and their opinion is explained on pages 
92 and 93.
Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 revision of the Code, the Directors 
have assessed the longer term viability of 
the Group and can confirm that they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue to operate and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due for the three 
year period from approval of this Annual 
Report. The Group uses a three year 
timescale to forecast its strategic plan  
on a rolling basis, as it is felt that a longer 
period would not produce a reliable 
result given the current pace of 
development both within the Group  
and the wider retail sector in which it 
operates. The Directors’ assessment  
has been made with reference to the 
Group’s current position and prospects, 
the Group’s strategy, the Board’s risk 
appetite and the Group’s principal risks 
and how these are managed, as detailed 
in the Corporate Governance Report.
The strategy and associated principal  
risks underpin the Group’s three year plan 
and scenario testing, which the Directors 
review at least annually. The three year 
plan makes certain assumptions about 
our core product and financial services 
growth drivers, margins and operating 
costs, together with the Group's cash 
flows, general liquidity and other key 
financial ratios. Although the strategic 
plan reflects the directors’ best estimate 
of the future prospects of the business, 
they have also tested the potential impact 
on the Group of a number of scenarios 
over and above those included in the 
plan, by quantifying their financial impact 
and overlaying this on the detailed 
financial forecasts in the plan. The plan 
has been subjected to severe but 
plausible stress tests using four primary 
downside scenarios which have been 
derived as part of the Board’s review  
of the Group’s principal risks detailed  
in the Corporate Governance Report.  
They represent ‘severe but plausible’ 
circumstances that the Group could 
experience. The stress tests apply a range 
of sensitivities to our headline interest 
rate, bad debt levels, Group revenue 
sensitivities and current tax positions; 
reflecting the principal risks of the 
business, primarily through a reduction  
in the credit activities of the Group,  
a negative potential customer impact 
arising from increased LIBOR rates, 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED
54
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 potential trading restrictions dealing with 
the impact of a cyber-attack and negative 
outcomes from a number of tax positions 
we are currently defending.
The three year plan review is solidly 
underpinned by the regular Board 
briefings provided by the Group’s 
operating board and the discussion of 
any new strategies undertaken by the 
Board in its normal course of business. 
These reviews consider both the market 
opportunity and the associated risks, 
principally the ability to operationally 
deliver any new initiatives, to manage  
its working capital performance and the 
level of financial resources available to 
the Group. Implausible scenarios, such  
as multiple circumstances occurring at 
the same time are assumed to not occur. 
The Directors do not consider it plausible  
that any of the key risks would crystallise 
together in a way that would create  
a worst outcome over the three year 
assessment period. In the unlikely event 
of multiple risks occurring and having a 
particularly severe effect on the Group, 
all potential actions such as constraining 
capital spending and reducing payments 
to shareholders would be taken on a 
timely basis. Thus, the Directors believe  
it has the early warning mechanisms to 
identify the need for such actions and the 
ability to implement them on a timely 
basis if necessary. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and 
the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with  
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards, including FRS  
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent company and  
of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates  
that are reasonable and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the EU; 
• for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the parent company financial 
statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations,  
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement 
that complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The directors are responsible for  
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss  
of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report, taken together, include a  
fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and  
the position of the company and  
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

complied with the provisions of the code.
Board composition 
The board comprises nine directors of 
whom seven are non-executive including 
the chairman. Of the seven non-executive 
directors, Lord Alliance of Manchester 
and Ivan Fallon are not considered by the 
board to be independent. The Chairman 
was considered independent at the time 
of his appointment.
Full biographical details of all directors 
appear on pages 50 and 51.
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman, Andrew 
Higginson, who is responsible for the 
effective operation of the board and the 
Chief Executive, Angela Spindler, who is 
responsible for the Group’s operational 
performance. 
The board understands the need for 
non-executive directors to be and remain 
independent of the management in 
order to be able to exercise proper 
oversight and effectively challenge the 
executive directors. The non-executive 
directors who served during the financial 
year ended 27 February 2016 were: 
• Andrew Higginson (Chairman);
• Lord Alliance of Manchester;
• Ivan Fallon;  
• Fiona Laird;
• Simon Patterson  
(resigned 1 April 2016); 
• Ron McMillan; and
• Lesley Jones 
Simon Patterson resigned from the  
board in April 2016 in order to take  
up another role outside the company.  
I would like to thank Simon personally  
for his contribution to the company.  
An external agency has been appointed 
to assist in the recruitment of a 
replacement non-executive director,  
in relation to which an announcement  
will follow in due course.
The board considers that, throughout the 
year, at least half of the board, excluding 
the chairman, comprised independent 
non-executive directors and that the 
composition of the board had the 
necessary balance of executive and 
non-executive directors to provide  
the requisite skills, experience, challenge 
and judgement appropriate for the 
requirements of the business and full 
board effectiveness. 
Save for Simon Patterson, all board 
members remain in place as at the  
date of this report.
Pursuant to the Code, all directors are 
required to retire and submit themselves 
for re-election annually. Accordingly, 
each of the continuing directors will  
retire at the forthcoming annual general 
meeting and offer themselves for 
reappointment at that meeting. 
With the exception of Ivan Fallon,  
who remains on a three month rolling 
arrangement, all non-executive directors 
serve on letters of appointments 
stipulating 3 year terms. All appointments 
are terminable, without compensation,  
on between three and six months’ notice 
by either party and are subject to other 
early termination provisions without 
compensation, for example in the  
event a director is not re-elected at  
the annual general meeting. 
The board, having carried out a 
performance evaluation, believes the 
performance of all directors and their 
commitment to the role of director 
continues to be fully effective. Further 
details of this evaluation can be found  
on page 58. 
Appointments to the board are made 
solely on merit based on the skills and 
experience offered by the candidate and 
required by the role. This ensures that all 
appointees have the best mix of skills and 
time to devote themselves effectively  
to the business of the board and to 
discharge their duties to the best of  
their ability. 
Details of directors’ contract terms  
are shown in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 70 to 72. In accordance with  
the Code, the company has made the 
terms and conditions of appointment  
of the non-executive directors available 
for inspection
Diversity
The board recognises the importance  
of diversity, including gender, at all levels 
of the company as well as on the board. 
The company is committed to equal 
opportunities and increasing diversity 
across our operations in terms of relevant 
skills, experience, ethnicity and gender. 
The board now comprises five male 
directors and three female directors.  
The board continues to consider how 
diversity can be enhanced through the 
board and the senior management teams 
and across the Group generally, whilst 
ensuring that it appoints only the most 
appropriate candidates to the board. 
Gender diversity
We currently have 33% female diversity 
at board level and 37 .5% on the Home 
Shopping board. This is over the current 
Government target of 25% by 2015, 
established in the Davies review, and 
significantly higher than the current  
FTSE 250 who have achieved 
representation at 19.9%. We believe  
that gender representation makes good 
business sense, given that women make 
up over half of the UK population and 
almost 60% of our total workforce.
Strengthening our executive pipeline 
remains a priority for us and we continue 
to open up new opportunities for women 
in the business, working with head-
hunters and agencies that can provide 
true gender diversification in their 
candidate bases.
To provide role models in the business 
and break the glass ceiling we are 
members of “Women on Boards”.  
Our aim is to allow development of  
board directors and to allow directors  
to take up non-executive roles in other 
businesses where opportunities arise.

The board is responsible for all major 
policy decisions and for determining the 
operational and strategic risks it is willing 
to take in achieving its objectives. The 
board has, where necessary, delegated 
operational matters to its committees 
and sub-committees, and to its executive 
and operational directors and senior 
officers. The board is collectively 
responsible for providing effective 
leadership and promoting the success  
of the Group and works to a formal  
list of matters reserved for the board  
(a copy of which is available on the 
company’s website, www.nbrown.co.uk). 
Matters reserved to the board include, 
amongst other things, decisions on 
business strategy, the approval of 
financial statements, the annual capital 
and operating expenditure plans, 
investment, treasury and dividend 
policies, governance issues, major  
capital projects, overseeing the  
Group’s risk control procedures, board 
membership and the composition of  
its committees and the Group’s ethical, 
social and environmental policies. 
The board governs through clearly 
mandated committees, accompanied by 
robust monitoring and reporting 
systems. Further detail is given below. 
Day-to-day management of the Group’s 
activities is delegated to the operational 
board, known as the Home Shopping 
board, on which Angela Spindler and 
Craig Lovelace (from 11 May 2015) sit as 
chief executive officer and chief financial 
officer respectively.  
Details of all of the members of the Home 
Shopping Board is set out on page 23.
In November the members of the board 
met with the Home Shopping Board over 
a two day period to review the progress 
being made against, and the future 
development of, the Group’s long-term 
rolling strategic plan.
Board papers include detailed 
management reports from the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, 
management accounts, broker analyses, 
compliance and regulatory briefings and 
bespoke reports. A comprehensive pack 
of papers is electronically circulated to 
each director not less than seven days 
prior to each board meeting. Budgetary 
performance and forecasts are reviewed 
and revised at each meeting. Outside  
of the meeting there is a regular flow  
of information between the directors 
including the weekly dissemination of 
management information statistics. 
Non-executive directors meet with 
operational teams and the Home 
Shopping Board and undertake site  
visits to ensure that they have the  
most up-to-date knowledge and 
understanding of the company and  
its activities and to enable the broader 
population of the Group to benefit  
from the skills and experience of the 
non-executive directors. 
All board members are permitted to 
obtain independent professional advice 
in respect of their own fiduciary duties 
and obligations and have full and direct 
access to the Company Secretary, who  
is a qualified solicitor and who attends  
all board and committee meetings as 
secretary. The Company Secretary 
provides an on-going programme of 
briefings for directors covering legal and 
regulatory changes and developments 
relevant to the Group’s activities and 
director’s areas of responsibility. The 
Company Secretary is also responsible 
for the induction of new directors.  
New directors are provided with a 
comprehensive pack of information 
(including terms of reference, information 
regarding the business and guidance on 
their roles and duties as directors) and 
meetings/site visits with key employee 
contacts are arranged as appropriate. 
Inductions to the business for new 
directors are designed to expose them  
to all areas of the Group’s operations  
but with particular emphasis on each 
director’s area of expertise.

Governance Board effectiveness appraisal
In accordance with Main Principle  
B.6 of the Code an internal effectiveness 
review of the board, its committees and 
its individual directors was undertaken 
during the second half of the year by way 
of a tailored, high-level questionnaire  
which was distributed for the directors  
to complete. 
The responses to the evaluation of the 
Board and its Committees were reviewed 
with the Chairman and then considered 
by the Board. The overall view was that 
the Board remains effective, positive and 
cohesive and there has been progress in 
relation to the areas for improvement 
identified in the 2014 evaluation exercise. 
Some actions were identified as a result 
of the evaluation and based on these, the 
Board has agreed a set of objectives for 
2016/17. 
Beyond the annual evaluation, the 
performance of the executive directors  
is continuously monitored throughout  
the year by the Chairman and the senior 
non-executive director. 
The Chairman reviews and agrees  
with each director their training and 
development needs.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Articles of Association of the 
company give the directors the power  
to consider and, if appropriate, authorise 
conflict situations where a director’s 
declared interest may conflict or  
does conflict with the interests of  
the company.
Procedures are in place at every meeting 
for individual directors to report and 
record any potential or actual conflicts 
which arise. The register of reported 
conflicts is reviewed by the board at least 
annually. The board has complied with 
these procedures during the year.
External appointments or other 
significant commitments of the  
directors require the prior approval  
of the Board. Details of such external 
appointments can be found in the 
directors’ biographies set out on  
pages 50 and 51. 
Board activities in 2015/16
Some of the key activities that the board 
has covered over the past year are:
• Setting and reviewing the Group’s 
business plan and annual budget.
• Oversight of major capital projects, 
including the major warehouse 
extension at Shaw and Fit 4 the Future.
• Governance and risk control, including 
oversight of our application to the FCA 
for full authorisation.
• Performance of a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten 
the business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity,  
and a review of all internal controls 
material, more details of which are set 
out in pages 28 and 29 of this report.
• Monitoring the Group's risk 
management and internal control 
systems, including a review of their 
effectiveness. 
Committees of the Board
The board delegates authority to a 
number of committees to deal with 
specific aspects of management  
and to maintain supervision over the 
internal control policies and procedures 
of the Group. These committees meet 
regularly and have formal written  
terms of reference which are available  
for inspection on the company’s website. 
The minutes of the meetings of these 
committees are circulated to all 
committee members in advance of  
the next following committee meeting,  
at which they are ratified. The following 
committees of the board have been 
established: 
• an audit committee;
• a remuneration committee; 
• a nominations and governance 
committee; and
• a corporate social responsibility 
committee.
After each committee meeting the 
chairman of that committee makes a 
formal report to the board of directors 
detailing the business carried out by  
the committee and setting out its 
recommendations.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016 THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  
RESPONSIBILITIES
PRIORITIES FOR 2017
Dear Shareholder
The Audit Committee exercises oversight of the Group’s 
financial policies and reporting. It monitors the integrity of  
the financial statements and reviews and considers significant 
financial and accounting estimates and judgements. The 
committee satisfies itself that the disclosures in the financial 
statements about these judgements and estimates are 
appropriate and obtains from the external auditor an 
independent view of the key disclosure issues and risks. 
Amongst other things, during the year the committee 
considered:
• The regulatory environment in which the Group operates;
• The Group’s approach to and methodology for provisioning 
for bad and doubtful receivables, in particular the application 
of IAS 39;
• The Group’s approach to and methodology for provisioning 
for inventory; 
• The Group’s exposure to corporate tax and VAT risks;
• Treasury and cash management;
• Financial crime and fraud; 
• The Viability Statement; 
• The presentation and appropriateness of exceptional  
items; and
• The capitalisation of software development costs.
A key responsibility of the committee is to review the scope, 
nature and effectiveness of internal and external audits.  
The committee ensures that the head of internal audit has 
appropriate independence and authority, that the scope of 
internal audit’s work is not restricted and that the function  
has adequate resources. The head of internal audit has a  
direct reporting line to me. The committee has also continued 
to monitor and review the key aspects of the Group’s external 
audit and, in relation to risk, the Committee undertook a full 
re-scoring of the corporate risk assessment during the year.
Further information on the committee’s responsibilities and  
the way in which they have been discharged is set out below.
I will be available at the annual general meeting in July to 
answer any questions you may have on this report and would 
like to thank my colleagues on the audit committee for their 
help and support this year.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
59
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Governance Committee composition
The committee comprises a minimum of three members, all of 
whom are non-executive directors. Two members constitute a 
quorum. The committee requires the inclusion of one financially 
qualified member with recent and relevant financial experience. 
The committee chairman fulfils that requirement. All members 
are expected to have an understanding of financial reporting, 
the Group’s internal audit control environment, relevant 
corporate legislation, the roles and functions of internal and 
external audit and the regulatory framework of the business.
The members of the committee were:
• Ron McMillan (Chairman) 
• Simon Patterson (resigned 1 April 2016)
• Fiona Laird (appointed 1 April 2016)
• Lesley Jones
The Chairman, Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
head of internal audit and the external auditor are invited to 
attend audit committee meetings where appropriate.
In addition to scheduled meetings, the chairman of the 
committee met with the Chief Financial Officer, the head  
of internal audit and the external auditor on a number of 
occasions during the year.
Activities
The key matters considered by the committee during the  
year were:
Regulatory environment
In common with the wider industry, the Group is now regulated  
by the FCA, having historically being regulated by the OFT.  
Our FCA application is progressing in line with expectations. 
We recognise that changes in laws and regulations may impact 
the Groups business, sector and market and the committee 
therefore continues to review the work carried out by the 
Group’s compliance function in order to satisfy itself that  
action is being taken to address the changes that are  
required to comply with new regulations.
Bad and doubtful debts
Following a review of the Group's accounting policies, 
specifically the application of International Accounting Standard 
39 ("IAS 39") in relation to the provisioning for bad and doubtful 
receivables, the Group announced a restatement of its debtor 
impairment provisions and consequent increases to reported 
profits during the year. This was as a direct result of a change  
in the technical interpretation of this accounting standard  
and did not affect the way in which the Group operates.  
The committee is satisfied that the change in interpretation  
of IAS 39 does not reflect any changes to the Group's underlying 
trading performance or on the risk profile of the Group's debtor 
balances. The Group's current business practices, approach  
to payment arrangements and customer rehabilitation are all 
unaffected by the revised IAS 39 accounting treatment. 
Exposure to corporate tax and VAT
The Group has a number of open items with the tax authorities 
and the calculation of the Group’s potential liabilities or assets  
in respect of these necessarily involves a degree of estimation 
and judgement. The Board sets and oversees the Group’s tax 
strategy which evaluates tax risk. In undertaking this task the 
Group uses its tax advisors and legal counsel. During the year 
the Group’s tax advisers have kept the committee appraised of 
existing and emerging risks and the committee has considered 
the appropriateness of related tax provisions and assets.
Inventory valuation
Provision is made where the net realisable value of stock is 
estimated to be lower than cost. The committee recognises 
that there is an element of uncertainty in relation to the 
estimation of net realisable value but considers that, taking  
into account historical experience, likely future selling values 
and the availability of disposal channels, the provision made  
is appropriate.
Capitalisation of software development costs
The committee has reviewed the treatment of the significant 
software and project costs in respect of Fit 4 the Future in order 
to satisfy itself that the Group’s current approach in capitalising 
costs to the extent that future economic benefits are expected 
to be generated remains appropriate. 
In addition to the above matters and those set out in the letter 
from the chairman of the committee on page 59, the work of 
the committee during the year included:
• Reviewing the draft interim and annual reports and considering:
1. The accounting principles, policies and practices adopted 
and the adequacy of related disclosures in the reports;
2. The significant accounting issues, estimates and 
judgements of management in relation to financial 
reporting;
3.  Whether any significant adjustments were required 
arising from the audit; 
4.  Compliance with statutory tax obligations and the 
Group’s tax policy; and
5. Meeting with the internal and external auditor, both  
with and in the absence of the executive directors.
• Reviewing and approving the resources of, the scope of work 
undertaken by and the reports prepared by internal audit.
• Reviewing the reports prepared by the external auditor  
on key audit findings and any significant deficiencies in the 
financial control environment.
• Reviewing and considering the Group’s systems of internal 
risk control, sources of assurance and exposure to fraud and 
overseeing the development of a new risk model for aligning 
identified risks with mitigating actions.
• Overseeing the management of the Group’s whistleblowing 
procedures which contain procedures for the committee to 
receive, in confidence, complaints on all operational matters.
• Reporting to the board on how it has discharged its 
responsibilities, and
• Making recommendations to the board in respect  
of its findings in respect of all of the above matters.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED
60
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Internal controls
The committee has established a continuous process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the 
Group faces. This monitoring is principally based on reviewing 
reports from senior management to consider whether significant 
operational risks are being identified, evaluated, managed and 
controlled and whether any significant weaknesses exist which 
need to be addressed. During the year, committee members 
have continued to receive, consider and approve updated risk 
evaluations from the operational directors. Further details are 
given in the Risk Management section of this report. 
During the year the committee has reviewed reports from 
internal audit on the following topics:
• Risk management, including the Group's three lines of 
defence document
• The linkages between the internal audit programme and 
identified risks
• Governance over the fit 4 the Future programme
• Returns management
• Credit marketing
• Pricing and margins
• FCA compliance
• Stock and retail audit outputs
• Financial crime, including whistleblowing, money laundering, 
fraud and bribery and corruption
The committee also reviewed through discussion the 
performance of internal audit.
The board considers that the processes undertaken by the audit 
committee continue to be appropriately robust and effective and 
in compliance with the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. During the year the board has not been advised by the 
audit committee of, nor identified itself, any failings, frauds or 
weaknesses in internal control which it has determined to be 
material in the context of the financial statements. 
External auditors
In the 2015 Annual Report the Audit Committee confirmed  
that it was undertaking a competitive tender to appoint new 
external auditors. As part of the tender process a number of 
firms were approached and from this a short list was selected. 
Following presentations from the short listed firms the Audit 
Committee recommended to the Board that KPMG be 
appointed as the Company Auditors. The appointment  
was confirmed by shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
The total fees paid to KPMG for the year ended 27 February 
2016 were £0.8m, of which £0.5m was in respect of non-audit 
services. Further details are set out in note 6 to the financial 
statements.
The committee has reviewed through discussion the 
performance of the external auditor, including their relationship 
with the Group, the Group’s use of the auditor for non-audit 
services and the balance of audit and non-audit fees paid to  
the auditors. Non-audit services are generally subject to tender 
processes and the allocations of work are done on the basis of 
competence, cost effectiveness, regulatory requirements, the 
potential for conflicts to arise and knowledge of the Group’s 
business. KPMG LLP has, during the year provided non-audit 
services in the form of pensions advisory work and regulatory 
compliance. KPMG LLP was retained in relation to these 
services prior to its appointment as the Group’s auditor.  
It was considered appropriate that KPMG should complete  
its work in relation to these matters. The committee is  
satisfied that, in relation to these services, KPMG LLP has  
taken actions to ensure that any potential conflicts of interest 
are properly managed.
The committee is mindful of the attitude investors now have  
to the auditors performing non audit services and of the new 
guidance in this are which is operative for accounting periods 
starting on or after 16 June 2016. Going forward, the 
committee will ensure that fees for non audit services 
performed by the auditors will not exceed 70% of aggregate 
audit fees measured over a  three year period.

year CSR strategy to align our CSR activities with the Group’s 
Sourcing and Commercial strategies. This Strategy is designed 
to embrace the three CSR pillars which make up our Charter – 
“All People, One Planet, Every Product”.
We aim to align our ethical policies with our commercial 
activities, integrating them with our buying strategies in  
order to achieve tangible results and benefits.

RESPONSIBILITIES
PRIORITIES FOR 2017
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for 2015/16 on behalf of the Board and to summarise the 
remuneration committee's main activities during the year.
This report contains the following parts:
• This “Annual Statement” which identifies the key messages 
on remuneration for the year under review and explains the 
business context in which the Committee’s major decisions 
during the period were taken;
• An amended proposed forward looking Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Report subject to a binding vote at  
the 2016 annual general meeting; and
• An “Annual Report on Remuneration” which provides 
shareholders with details of the remuneration that was 
actually delivered to the company’s directors during 2015/16. 
This final part of the report will be subject to an advisory vote 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
The Group is currently undergoing a significant transformation 
and is keen to ensure that the incentive arrangements remain 
appropriate to successfully deliver this. As a result, over the year 
the remuneration committee have undertaken a review of the 
long term incentive arrangements in place and we are now 
proposing to introduce a change to the performance conditions 
for the LTIP . This is designed to focus participants on the success 
of the current business strategy and transformation. This change 
requires shareholder approval for a new Policy at the 2016 AGM. 
There will be no other substantive changes made to the policy 
although minor changes to take account of developments in 
best practice and the passage of time will be made.
The Board believes that maintaining the highest standards of 
corporate governance is essential to protecting shareholder 
value; the alignment of remuneration with the forward looking 
business strategy is an integral part of this process. As such  
the Board has fully debated and approved the proposed 
remuneration changes to ensure that the incentive plans in  
place appropriately reward the delivery of our transformation 
plan whilst ensuring alignment with shareholders. We have  
also consulted with our top ten shareholders and investor  
bodies on this change and have taken on board their feedback.
Setting and reviewing the remuneration policy and 
determining the total individual remuneration package 
for all executive directors, the company’s chairman  
and other designated senior executives recommending 
and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration 
for senior management having regard to pay and 
employment conditions across the Group;
Approving the design of, and determine targets for, 
any performance-related pay schemes operated by 
the company and approve the total annual payments 
made under such schemes (in accordance with 
provisions of the Code);
Reviewing the design of all share incentive plans  
for approval by the board and shareholders;
Overseeing any major changes in employee benefits 
structures throughout the company or Group; and
Ensuring that the company maintains contact as 
required with its principal shareholders about 
remuneration.
 The committee will continue to foster a close 
relationship with shareholders in developing the 
remuneration policy.
The committee will oversee the introduction of  
the proposed new incentive schemes as detailed  
in this report.
The committee will oversee the implementation of new 
requirements in relation to gender pay gap reporting.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Proposed new LTIP performance conditions
Over the year, the Remuneration Committee have undertaken a 
detailed review of the appropriateness of the LTIP performance 
conditions in the context of the Company’s transformation plan. 
The current LTIP performance conditions are adjusted EPS 
growth in excess of RPI (60% weighting) and relative TSR against 
a peer group of retailers (40% weighting). As part of the review, 
we have considered a range of performance measures and are 
proposing the following changes to performance conditions  
to better align participants with the current business strategy 
and transformation:
• Removal of relative TSR as a performance measure for the 
LTIP – it is our view that the use of relative TSR no longer 
accurately reflects the performance of our business and is  
an inappropriate way in which to incentivise participants  
as it does not directly align participants with the delivery  
of the strategic plan;
• Maintain adjusted EPS as a measure but reduce the 
weighting from 60% to 50% - our rationale remains that EPS 
accurately reflects the performance of our business and the 
experience of our shareholders;
• Introduction of free cash flow measure (30% weighting) –  
free cash flow aligns with the transformation agenda and is 
commonly used by retailers to monitor the flows of cash in 
and out of the business as well as providing an assessment  
of underlying profitability; and
• Introduction of revenue measure (20% weighting) – revenue 
growth is a critical KPI for the business and given that 
earnings measures make up the majority of the plan, there  
is an appropriate balance to encourage revenue growth 
whilst maintaining margin.
The target ranges applying to each measure for awards to be 
made in 2016 are set out in full on page 75.
The Committee works hard to ensure that targets are 
appropriately stretching and motivating to management. In 
particular, following consultation with shareholders, we have 
listened to views about the maximum target under  the EPS 
metric and we propose to increase the point at which 100%  
of this element of the LTIP is payable from the current level  
of 7 .5% annual growth in adjusted EPS in excess of RPI over 
three financial years to 9% . 
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that the changes 
will provide a stable footing for remuneration to support the  
“Fit 4 the Future” strategy and achieve the following:
• Provide an incentive structure that supports the strategic 
transformation of N Brown and incentivises participants;
• Provide a more coherent incentive arrangement aligned  
to shareholder value;
• Balance the need to retain and motivate the Executive team 
with sufficiently challenging targets; and
• Remain in line with market practice, the views of investor 
bodies and the increasing use of multiple metrics to monitor 
performance of executives.
Remuneration outcomes for 2015/16
Annual bonus is paid 60% in cash and 40% deferred as a 
conditional award of shares that vest at the end of 3 years after 
the grant. The principal performance metric for the normal 
annual bonus was based on Group profit. The committee 
determined that this element of the annual bonus targets had 
not been met. The remainder of the normal annual bonus was 
based on meeting corporate and personal objectives and the 
committee determined that 27 .9% of salary was payable to the 
CEO and 20.7% of salary was payable to the CFO. 
The committee reviewed the EPS and TSR performance of the 
company in respect of the 2013 Long Term Incentive Share  
Plan (“LTISP”) award. The company was ranked below median 
against its peers at the end of the three year performance 
period and did not meet the threshold EPS targets, as a result  
of which the award lapsed. 
Upon her appointment the CEO was granted two one-off share 
awards as detailed in the 2013 Annual Report. Vesting of the 
first, over shares worth £520,000 at the time of grant, was 
subject to employment conditions over two years which were 
met in the year. The second, over shares worth £1,040,000 at  
the time of grant are subject to the achievement of strategic 
objectives measured over a period of three years as detailed  
in our 2015 Annual Report.
The committee reviewed the salaries of the executive directors 
in April 2016 and determined that the CEO's salary should be 
increased by 2%, in-line with most of the general workforce,  
with effect from 1 October 2016. Following bench marking and 
a review of the industry backdrop, the committee determined 
that the CFO's salary should be increased by 5% with effect 
from 1 May 2016.
Awards with a face value of 150% of salary in respect of Angela 
Spindler and 125% of salary in respect of Craig Lovelace were 
granted in July 2015. Vesting of these awards is subject to 
growth in adjusted EPS in excess of RPI (60% weighting) and 
relative TSR against a peer Group of retailers (40% weighting).  
In 2016 Angela Spindler and Craig Lovelace will again receive  
awards with a face value of 150% and 125% of salary 
respectively. The award will be granted in July 2016 and will be 
subject to the revised performance conditions set out above.
In May 2015, Craig Lovelace joined the company as Chief 
Financial Officer on terms described in last year’s Remuneration 
Report. Dean Moore stepped down as Finance Director in  
April 2015. As was noted in last year’s report, in accordance  
with the Remuneration Policy, Dean Moore has been paid the 
balance of his notice period. Payments were phased over the 
remaining 9 months of his contractual notice period and were 
subject to an obligation to mitigate. After due consideration the 
Committee determined that Dean Moore was a “good leaver” 
and the terms in relation to “good leaver” therefore applied.
I will be available to answer any questions at the annual general 
meeting in July and very much hope that you will support the 
revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy and Annual Report on 
Remuneration at our forthcoming meeting.
I would like to thank all of my colleagues on the remuneration 
committee for all their hard work in reviewing the suitability of 
the LTIP performance conditions and generally with the day to 
day tasks of the committee over the last year.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Governance This report sets out the information required by Part 4 of the 
Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended. 
The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, and describes how 
the board has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions relating to directors’ remuneration in the Code. 
It summarises the committee’s remuneration policy for the 
executive directors which, if approved by shareholders at  
the 2016 annual general meeting will become effective 
immediately for a period of three years. 
The committee’s policy is designed to ensure that the main 
elements of the remuneration package are linked to the 
company’s annual and long-term strategy, are appropriate in 
quantum and capable of attracting, motivating and retaining 
executive directors. The policy aims to reward executive 
directors and senior executives by offering them competitive 
remuneration packages, which are prudently constructed, 
sufficiently stretching and linked to long-term profitability and 
which do not encourage excessive risk taking. 
In particular, the committee strives to ensure that remuneration 
packages are:
• aligned with the Group’s strategic plan;
• aligned with shareholders' interests;
• measured against stretching targets, both in absolute and 
relative terms;
• competitive and sufficiently flexible to support the 
recruitment needs of the business;
• paid in a combination of cash and shares; and
• linked to performance measured over annual and three-year 
performance periods.
Summary of components of executive directors' 
remuneration
The table below summarises the committee's policy for the 
main components of remuneration.

Notes:
1. A description of how the company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2016/17 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
2.  The remuneration policy for the executive directors and other senior executives is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole. However, there 
are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for senior executives. In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements 
that are market competitive for the various categories of individuals. They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the executive directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis 
tends to be placed on performance-related pay in the market. 
3. All-employee share plans do not have performance conditions. Executive directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE and SIP on the same terms as other employees. 
4. Copies of the LTIP rules are available on request from the company secretary.
5. LTISP awards granted prior to 2014 and LTIP awards prior to 2016 are subject to performance conditions described in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
6.  The company also operates share ownership guidelines requiring executive directors to acquire and hold a specified level of shareholding. The current level of holding expected 
under the guidelines is described in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
7. Awards may be structured as nil cost options, conditional awards of shares and may be delivered through a Joint Share Ownership Plan structure.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 How employees' pay is taken into account
The remuneration policy for the executive directors is 
designed with regard to the policy for employees across  
the Group as a whole. The company's ability to meet growth 
expectations and compete effectively is dependent on the 
skills, experience and performance of all of our employees. 
As a result our employment policies, remuneration and 
benefit packages for employees are regularly reviewed. 
Whilst there are some differences in the structure of the 
remuneration policy, these reflect individuals' differing 
responsibilities, with the principal difference being the 
increased emphasis on performance related pay for the  
more senior executives within the organisation. 
Although the committee does not consult directly with 
employees on directors' pay, the committee does take into 
consideration the pay and employment conditions of all 
employees when setting the policy for directors' remuneration. 
The committee is also mindful of any changes to the pay  
and benefit conditions for employees more generally when 
considering the policy for directors' pay. 
Committee discretions
The committee operates the Group’s variable incentive  
plans according to their respective rules and in accordance  
with HMRC rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient 
administration of these plans and to be consistent with  
market practice, the committee will retain certain operational 
discretions. These include:
• selecting plan participants;
• determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
• determining the quantum of awards and/or payments  
(within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment 
of performance;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, rights issues,  
corporate restructuring events, and special dividends); 
• determining “good leaver” status for incentive plan purposes 
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan  
and LTIP from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the Annual Bonus Plan, 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan or LTIP performance conditions and/
or targets being deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material 
acquisition or divestment), the committee will have the ability  
to adjust appropriately the measures and/or targets and alter 
weightings, provided that the revised conditions or targets  
are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may,  
as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the 
company's major shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
In approving the remuneration policy, authority is given to  
the company to honour any commitments previously entered 
into with the current or former directors in accordance with  
the relevant plan rules, where applicable. It is also part of this 
policy that the company will honour payments or awards 
crystallising after the effective date of this policy but arising 
from commitments entered into at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a director at the company. Details of any 
payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Selection of performance metrics and targets
All incentives are subject to the individual review and scrutiny  
of the committee, particularly in the case of share incentives, 
both at award and vesting to ensure that performance has  
been correctly adjudicated and to safeguard against excessive 
overall reward. Variable pay and remuneration is linked to both 
corporate and individual performance and is benchmarked  
to attract and retain the highest quality people. 
The annual bonus is designed to thoroughly stretch the 
performance of the executive and is linked to absolute growth 
in annual Group profit, the achievement of certain business 
targets and of personal objectives. These targets are reviewed 
and agreed by the committee at the beginning of each financial 
year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market 
conditions and the long-term strategy of the company, and that 
they continue to remain stretching and challenging. The targets 
are linked to KPIs which are drawn from, and relate to, the 
achievement of ‘milestones’ contained in the company’s 
strategic long-term plan. This ensures they are aligned to the 
strategic objectives of the company and designed to increase 
shareholder value, whilst being prudent and safeguarding the 
long-term future of the company. 
For 2016, the committee has decided to maintain a condition 
based on growth in adjusted EPS and introduce free cashflow 
and revenue measures for the LTIP . Adjusted EPS is considered 
appropriate as it is easily understood, is a key measure of 
financial performance and closely aligned to the company's 
objectives of driving profitable growth. The measure takes 
account of fair value adjustments to financial instruments (net  
of tax) as well as other non-recurring items such as unplanned 
investments in IT infrastructure, acquisitions and/or disposals. 
As the targets are set as a rate of growth in excess of RPI it  
also takes into account inflation. The free cash flow measure  
is defined as cashflow generated from operations excluding 
receivables and is seen as a key measure for N Brown to 
monitor the flows of cash in and out of the business as well as 
providing an assessment of underlying profitability. Revenue  
is a critical KPI for the business and management have clear  
line of sight over this measure and given that earnings measures 
make up the majority of the plan, there is an appropriate 
balance to encourage revenue growth whilst maintaining 
margin. The committee retains the discretion to change the 
performance measures to reflect its strategy.

The committee considers the Group’s performance on 
environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) issues when 
setting the remuneration of any executive director and is of the 
opinion that the incentive arrangements for senior managers  
do not raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour or the taking of undue risks with the business.
Shareholding guidelines
It is the board's policy that executive directors build and retain a 
minimum shareholding in the company. Under these guidelines 
the chief executive and the finance director are respectively 
required to hold company shares equal in value (at the time of 
acquisition) to 200% and 100% of their base salary, respectively 
and to have met this guideline within 5 years of appointment. 
Details of the current shareholdings of the executive directors 
are provided later in this report.
How shareholders' views are taken into account
The committee considers shareholder feedback received 
regarding the directors’ remuneration report and guidance 
from shareholder representative bodies more generally.  
As appropriate, the committee also seeks feedback from 
shareholders on specific matters. These views are key inputs 
when shaping remuneration policy. 
In developing the changes proposed to the Policy from  
2016 onwards, the Committee has engaged with its major 
shareholders and representative bodies. This process of 
engagement was still ongoing at the time this report  
was prepared.
Executive directors' service agreements and  
termination policy 
It is the company’s policy that executive directors should have 
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of  
12 months' notice. 
The policy is that the company does not make payments 
beyond its contractual obligations on termination. In addition, 
executive directors are expected to mitigate their loss or, 
within existing contractual constraints, accept phased 
payments. The committee seeks to ensure that there are  
no unjustified payments for failure. Neither of the executive 
directors’ contracts provides for liquidated damages.  
There are no special provisions contained in any of the 
executive directors’ contracts that provide for longer  
periods of notice on a change of control of the company. 
Furthermore, there are no special provisions providing for 
additional compensation on an executive director’s cessation 
of employment with the company. Where the director may  
be entitled to pursue a legal claim, the company will be 
entitled to negotiate settlement terms that the committee 
considers to be in the best interests of the company and  
to enter into a settlement agreement to effect the terms 
agreed under the service contract and any additional  
statutory or other claims. The committee may pay reasonable 
outplacement and legal fees where considered appropriate. 
Potential termination payments are summarised on page 71.
Assumptions
1. Fixed pay = salary as paid in year, benefits and pension provision. 
2.  On target = fixed pay plus target annual bonus (50% of the maximum) of 75% of salary for the chief executive and 62.5% of salary for the finance director plus target LTIP awards  
of 37.5% of salary for the chief executive and 31.25% for the finance director. 
3.  Maximum = fixed pay plus maximum annual bonus of 150% of salary for the chief executive and 125% for the finance director plus maximum LTIP awards of 150% of salary for the 
chief executive and 125% for the finance director. 
4.  Salary levels (on which other elements of the packages are calculated) are based on those effective from 1 October 2015 (£543,660 for the chief executive and £320,000 for the 
finance director). 
5.  The value of taxable benefits is based on an estimated cost of £19,000 in respect of the chief executive and £17,000 for the financial director and includes a car allowance and 
health insurance.  
6. Pension provision is 15% of salary for the chief executive and 10% for the finance director.

Craig Lovelace 6 January 2015 12 months' salary  
and benefits
Other than in certain “good leaver” circumstances (including, 
but not limited to, redundancy, ill-health or retirement or on  
a change of control), no bonus would be payable unless the 
individual remains employed and is not under notice at the 
payment date. Any bonuses paid to a “good leaver” would be 
based on an assessment of their individual and the company's 
performance over the period, and normally pro-rated for the 
proportion of the bonus year worked.
Deferred bonus share awards will also normally lapse on 
cessation of employment, unless the executive director is 
deemed to be a “good leaver” by the Committee. Awards  
will vest early on a change of control subject to the plan rules.
With regards to long-term incentive awards, the LTIP rules 
provide that other than in certain “good leaver” circumstances, 
awards lapse on cessation of employment. Where an individual 
is a “good leaver”, the committee’s policy for future LTIP awards 
will be to permit awards to remain outstanding until the end  
of the original performance period, when a pro-rata reduction 
will be made to take account of the proportion of the vesting 
period that elapsed prior to termination of employment, 
although the committee has discretion to partly or completely 
disapply pro-rating in certain circumstances. On a change of 
control awards would vest, subject to the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been achieved and, normally, 
pro-rating for time. The committee has discretion to determine 
“good leaver” treatment. In doing so, it will take account  
of the reason for their departure and the performance of  
the individual. 
For awards granted under the LTISP , awards lapse if cessation 
occurs during the financial year in which an award is granted. 
Thereafter awards held by good leavers may vest subject to 
performance without pro-rating. On a change of control 
existing awards would not be pro-rated. 
Apart from service contracts, no executive director has  
any material interest in any contract with the company or  
its subsidiaries.
Copies of executive directors’ service contracts (and also 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment) are available 
for inspection at the company’s registered office on application 
to the company secretary.
Recruitment of executive directors
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with the company's 
remuneration policy, taking account of the executive's skills, 
experience and their current remuneration package. Where  
it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of  
above inflation increases to the desired salary positioning  
may be given over subsequent years subject to individual  
and company performance. 
Benefits and pension will generally be provided in accordance 
with the approved policy, with relocation expenses and/or  
an expatriate allowance paid for if necessary. For an overseas 
appointment, the benefit and pension arrangements may be 
tailored to reflect local market practice (subject to the overall 
maximum limits set out in the policy table). Assistance with 
relocation may be provided where appropriate. Tax equalisation 
may also be considered as may payment of the executive's legal 
fees in connection with the appointment.
The variable pay opportunity will be in accordance with the 
company's approved policy as detailed above. However, 
different performance measures and targets may be set for  
the first year in the case of the annual bonus and long-term 
incentives taking into account the responsibilities of the 
individual, and the point in the financial year at which they 
joined. A new employee may be granted normal annual PSP 
awards in the first year of employment in addition to any awards 
made with respect to prior employment being forfeited.  
Such awards would normally be made shortly following an 
appointment (assuming the company is not in a close period).
If it is necessary to buy-out incentive pay, which would be 
forfeited by reason of leaving the previous employer, in  
order to secure the appointment, this would be provided  
for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing  
and expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing 
performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited  
and such other specific matters as it considers relevant.  
Existing arrangements may be bought out on terms that are  
no more favourable than the committee considers is required  
to provide reasonable compensation to the incoming director 
for the awards they will be losing. Existing plans will be used to 
the extent possible (subject to the exceptional limits contained 
in the plan rules), however, the committee retains discretion  
to agree bespoke arrangements and, if required, to make use 
of the flexibility provided by the Listing Rules to make awards 
without prior shareholder approval when buying out existing 
entitlements. The service contract for a new appointment 
would be in accordance with the policy for the current  
executive directors.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay 
awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to  
pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set  
in line with the approved policy.

All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement

the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on 
independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors  
of similar companies
The chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities.  
The non-executives are paid a basic fee. The Chairs of committee 
and senior independent director receive additional fees to reflect 
their extra responsibilities
Non-executive directors may not participate in any of the 
company’s share incentive schemes or performance-based plans 
and are not eligible to join the company’s pension scheme.
Any reasonable business related expenses (including tax thereon) 
can be reimbursed if determined to be a taxable benefit and 
limited benefits relating to travel, accommodation, secretarial 
support and hospitality provided in relation to the performance  
of their duties
When reviewing fee levels, account is taken of market movements 
in non-executive director fees, board committee responsibilities, 
ongoing time commitments, the general economic environment 
and the level of increases awarded to the wider workforce
In exceptional circumstances, additional fees may be paid where 
there is a substantial increase in the time commitment required  
of non-executive directors
If there is a temporary yet material increase in the time commitment 
required of non-executive directors, the Board may pay additional 
fees on a pro-rata basis to recognise the additional workload

This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the revised Schedule 8 set out in The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended), and 9.8.6R of the Listing Rules. The Annual 
Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 annual general meeting. The information on pages 
74 to 79 has been audited.

Members of the Remuneration Committee
Name From To
Fiona Laird 1 April 2013 To date
Ron McMillan 1 April 2013 To date

General Counsel and company secretary, Theresa Casey, acts as secretary to the committee and the chief executive, Angela 
Spindler, the chairman, Andrew Higginson, and the Group HR director, Caroline Massingham, may also attend meetings by 
invitation. However, no director played any part in discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
The committee members have no personal financial interest (other than as shareholders) in matters to be decided, no potential 
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business and are considered  
by the company to be independent. The committee has formal written terms of reference which are available for shareholders  
to inspect and on the corporate website. The committee met 3 times during the year. See page 64 for details of attendance.
Advisers
The committee received advice from New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited, part of Aon plc). New Bridge 
Street was formally appointed by the committee. In addition, KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) and Pinsent Masons LLP provided advice  
to the Group during the year which materially assisted the committee in relation to the closure to new accruals of the Group’s 
defined benefit scheme. Neither firm was specifically appointed by the committee. KPMG who are also the Group’s auditors  
were appointed to provide pension consultancy services in relation to the closure of the defined benefit scheme prior to their 
appointment as auditors. KPMG and Pinsent Mason LLPs have no other connections with the Group other than as set out above. 
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct, which sets out guidelines to ensure 
that its advice is independent and free from undue influence. The Group received no other services from New Bridge Street or any 
other part of the Aon group of companies, during the year. The fees paid to New Bridge Street in 2015/16 were £40,512 (2014/15: 
£100,365). The committee reviews the performance and independence of its advisers on an annual basis and it satisfied that the 
advice received is objective and independent.
The advisors' terms of engagement are available on request from the Company Secretary.

to employment conditions and were subject to a financial performance condition requiring that growth in the company's EPS must 
at least equal the growth in RPI over the deferral period. The matching element of the deferred annual bonus scheme will operate 
for the last time in respect of the finance director’s bonus outcome for 2013/14.

Governance Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit:
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of N Brown Group PLC for the year ended 27 February 2016 set out on pages 84 to 118.  
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 27 February 
2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect  
on our audit were as follows:
The Risk Our response
Allowance for 
doubtful debts 
£97.6m  
(2015, £100.9m)
Refer to page 60 
(Audit Committee 
Report), pages 88, 
91 and 93 
(accounting 
policy), pages 101 
to 106 (financial 
disclosures)
The allowance for doubtful debts requires the Directors 
to assess which accounts are considered impaired. This 
assessment is particularly judgmental in the case of 
customers in early arrears or under revised payment 
terms and may have a material impact upon the 
provision. The large percentage of the Group’s 
customers that are subject to revised payment terms,  
in particular where interest has been temporarily waived 
make the impact of this judgment more significant for 
N Brown.
The Group has altered the population considered for 
doubtful debts to include all accounts with revised 
payment terms, resulting in a prior year restatement 
within the current year financial statements. 
The other key judgements are in respect of the 
probability of default and the timing and value of  
cash flows.
To assess the probability of default, the Group estimates 
a customer’s likelihood of entering default based  
upon the experience of customers with comparable 
characteristics such as arrears status and payment 
history. These estimates are inherently uncertain 
because they are reliant upon historic, non-predictive 
data and are impacted by the Group’s segmentation of 
customers with comparable impairment characteristics.
The timing and value of cash flows are estimated based  
on the historical cash receipts and write-offs incurred for 
customers with comparable arrears status and payment 
history, interest and fees charged and debt sale rates. 
These estimates are inherently uncertain because of  
the long-term nature of the cash receipts and the  
exposure of the portfolio to the credit performance  
of many individual customers.
Due to the quantity of data involved in assessing all of 
these elements of the provision, it is a complex model 
for which the completeness and accuracy of data inputs 
and the accuracy of calculations are, in themselves, risks.
Our audit procedures included:
We critically assessed the Group’s definition of “impaired” 
customer receivables against the requirements of the 
relevant accounting standards, including evidence of the 
Group’s experience of customers with comparable 
characteristics.
We compared the assumptions made in respect of the 
probabilities of default against our understanding of the 
Group as well as our knowledge of market counterparts, 
and consistency with the historic internal data available.
We assessed the assumptions made in respect of timing 
and value of cash flows for all segments of the model 
(including customers in arrears and subject to revised 
payment terms) against historic internal data available.
We assessed the accuracy of the allowance for doubtful debt 
model (including for prior year restatements), with assistance 
from our IT specialists, by reviewing the detail of the model, 
and compared the methodology used to our interpretation  
of the requirements of the relevant accounting standards. 
This included testing of the completeness and accuracy of 
data through testing a sample of customer data back to the 
source system. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in relation to the allowance for doubtful debts 
for compliance with the relevant accounting policies. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF N BROWN GROUP PLC ONLY
80
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 The Risk Our response
Regulatory risk
Refer to page 60 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page 93 
(accounting policy 
and financial 
disclosures)
The Group’s provision of credit services to customers 
mean that it operates within a regulated environment 
which requires the Group to comply with the 
requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
and maintain FCA permissions. These permissions could 
be suspended or withdrawn by the FCA, significantly 
impacting the Group’s ability to continue with its current 
business model.
The requirement for FCA permissions includes the fair 
treatment of customers, protections for vulnerable 
customers and appropriate and clear disclosure of terms 
to customers and, given the current context of media 
coverage and large scale customer redress provisions 
across the financial services industry, there is a risk that 
any non-compliance with regulations could trigger 
significant customer redress programmes or lead to 
material fines from the FCA.
Our audit procedures included:
We assessed the areas of non-compliance and customer 
complaints identified and documented by the Group, 
against the wider industry and discussed with management 
the financial implications of these issues. This included 
estimation of the likely impact of any known areas of 
non-compliance until the resolution of this issue.
We assessed the entity-wide governance processes  
for the identification of regulatory issues and areas of 
non-compliance.
We reviewed correspondence with the regulators  
and assessed customer complaints for indications of 
significant or non-identified areas of customer detriment 
that may require provision in the financial statements.
Taxation 
Provisions
Refer to page 60 
(Audit Committee 
Report), pages 91 
and 93 (accounting 
policy), pages 97 
to 98 and 106 
(financial 
disclosures)
The outcome of a number of open VAT and corporation 
taxation positions, some of which are proceeding to 
litigation, is uncertain and as such have required the 
Directors to make significant judgements and estimates 
in relation to the likely outcome of these tax issues and 
exposures. There is a risk that the judgements made by 
the Directors, and therefore the amounts recorded in the 
financial statements will differ from any final settlements 
agreed with HMRC. Given the significant value and 
judgmental nature of this provisioning, this is considered 
to be an area of significant audit risk.
Our audit procedures included, with assistance from our 
own tax specialists, challenging the Directors’ assessment 
of the provisions required by:
Inspecting correspondence with HMRC and evaluating the 
Directors’ interpretation of this correspondence by forming 
our own expectations of the provisions required in the 
financial statements. This evaluation was based on our 
knowledge of the business and experience of the industry 
in which it operates, together with our knowledge and 
experience of the application of the relevant legislation  
by authorities and courts. 
Specifically in relation to VAT, we inspected legal counsel 
opinion received by the Directors in relation to the Group’s 
likelihood of success in each of the open VAT exposures 
and critically assessed whether amounts recorded in the 
financial statements were consistent with this legal opinion.
Carrying value  
of inventories: 
£101.5m  
(2015, £94.8m)
Refer to page 60 
(Audit Committee 
Report), pages 91 
and 93 (accounting 
policy), page 100 
(financial 
disclosures)
The Group has significant levels of inventory and 
judgements are taken by the Group with regard to the 
categorisation of inventory as current and non-current  
at year end and the forecast disposal plans when 
estimating the inventory provision. Furthermore,  
the seasonal nature of a retail business and changes  
in customer preferences and spending patterns, 
primarily driven by the wider fashion industry,  
introduce uncertainty over the recoverability of 
inventories. Given the level of judgements and  
estimates involved this is considered to be a key  
audit risk.
Our audit procedures included comparing inventory levels, 
by season, to sales data to test whether slow moving and 
obsolete inventories had been appropriately identified.  
We considered sales of inventories during the year,  
in particular of inventory that has been held for greater 
than one year and clearance categories, and compared 
these sales to the Group’s forecast disposal  
plan at the period end date.
We utilised data analytics to test the adequacy of inventory 
provision by comparing the selling price of inventory in the 
year to the cost of the inventory as well as analysing the 
ageing of inventory items. We also considered whether  
the Group’s accounting policies had been consistently 
applied and the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of the judgement and estimation made in respect 
of inventory provisioning.

Financial statements The Risk Our response
Capitalised 
software and 
development 
costs: £116.0m 
(2015, £89.4m)
Refer to page 60 
(Audit Committee 
Report), pages 90 
and 93 (accounting 
policy), pages 99 
to 100 (financial 
disclosures)
The Group has incurred significant software and 
development project costs in the year in respect  
of the Fit 4 Future project, a significant systems 
infrastructure programme. The Group capitalises 
both internal and external costs to the extent that 
future economic benefits are expected to be 
generated by the project. This requires judgement 
as to whether the costs incurred are capital in 
nature, whether the project will be completed 
successfully and, whether sufficient revenue and 
profitability will be generated to recover the costs 
capitalised. The Directors also apply judgment as  
to whether the software and development costs 
incurred are for technically feasible systems  
and websites. Given the significant value and 
judgmental nature of the classification of software 
and development assets, between operational  
and capital expenditure, this is considered to be  
an area of significant audit risk.
For the key inputs into the project’s profitability 
forecast, specifically revenue growth, cost reduction 
and the timing and amount of capital expenditure,  
we critically assessed the reasonableness of the 
assumptions with reference to internal and external 
data from Project and Infrastructure leads, Board-
approved capital spending forecasts, an independent 
financial benefits review and knowledge gained  
from performing our other audit procedures. We 
challenged the Group’s assessment of the technical 
feasibility of the different project releases based on 
our discussions with key project leads and reviews  
of detailed business cases produced internally and 
externally, outlining the proposed features and 
expected completion dates. We assessed whether 
costs had been appropriately capitalised, by reference 
to the recognition criteria of the applicable accounting 
standards, for a sample of costs agreed to source 
documentation. We evaluated the adequacy of the 
Group's disclosures in respect of the judgements 
made by management that economic benefit will  
be derived from the projects.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £3.8 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Group profit before tax, normalised to exclude exceptional items relating to reorganisation costs and the write down of stock 
following the closure of clearance stores, of £17 .2 million, of which it represents 4.3%.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.2 million, in addition  
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was 
performed using the materiality level set out above and covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax, and total 
Group assets.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ Viability statement on pages 54 and 55, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that,  
the Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 2019; or
• the disclosures in note 2 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.

Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations are those which management identify 
separately and where notice has been given that they are to be 
discontinued. As a result of notice being given regarding the 
closure of Gray & Osbourn in 2015 as detailed in note 5, both the 
current year and prior year income statement exclude the results 
of Gray & Osbourn under continuing activities.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost 
basis except that derivative financial instrument are stated at 
their fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
set out as follows.
Accounting period
Throughout the accounts, the directors report and financial 
review, reference to 2016 means at 27 February 2016 or the  
52 weeks then ended; reference to 2015 means at 28 February 
2015 or the 52 weeks then ended unless otherwise stated.
Restatement
International accounting statement 39 ("IAS39"), in relation to 
the provisioning for bad and doubtful receivables, was adopted 
by the Group in 2005 at it's introduction. Deloitte, as the 
Group's auditors, consistently confirmed that the Group's 
financial statements were appropriately prepared in accordance 
with IAS39.
Following the appointment of KPMG as auditor's during the  
year ended 27 February 2016, the Group determined that it was 
necessary to make a change in the technical interpretation of 
IAS39. This in no way affects the way in which the Group has 
operated or will operate its business. The revised interpretation  
of IAS39 relates to the judgement over whether a credit loss has 
been incurred when interest or other charges are temporarily 
waived, even for customers who ultimately repay their full  
capital balance. For customers who find themselves in financial 
difficulties, the Group may offer revised payment terms to  
support the customer, encourage rehabilitation and thereby 
maximise long term returns. For customers under such payment 
arrangements where interest and/or other charges are waived, 
the Group's financial statements now reflect an impairment 
provision for the foregone interest income upfront and the Group 
is recognising interest or other income over time on the impaired 
balances. Previously, in focusing primarily on the underlying 
cashflow risk to the business, and in arriving at provisions against 
such balances, the Group was focused upon the capital element 
of receivables and did not consider loss of interest as an 
impairment loss.

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the company and entities controlled by the 
company (its subsidiaries) made up to the Saturday that falls 
closest to 28 February each year. The Employee Share 
Ownership Trust is also made up to a date coterminous  
with the financial period of the parent company.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group 
controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has  
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The 
acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to 
the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the  
date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary 
are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so 
causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies  
used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses  
are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the 
purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured  
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange,  
of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control  
of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets,  
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions  
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value  
at the acquisition date.
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset on the 
date control is acquired and initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment,  
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities. and contingent liabilities exceeds 
the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in  
the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 March 1998 
was charged against reserves in the year of acquisition in 
accordance with UK GAAP and has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Financial statements 2 Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents the total amount 
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business net of returns, VAT and sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered  
and title has passed. Financial services sales includes interest, 
administrative charges and arrangement fees. Interest income 
is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and the applicable effective interest rate which  
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial assets to that asset’s 
net carrying amount. Revenue from non-interest related 
financial income is recognised when the services have  
been performed.
Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets  
to their estimated residual values, based on current prices  
at the balance sheet date, over their remaining useful lives, 
using the straight-line method. No depreciation is charged  
on freehold land. In this respect the following annual 
depreciation rates apply:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property and 
improvements
over the period of the lease
Motor vehicles 20%
Computer equipment between 14% and 20%
Plant and machinery between 5% and 20%
Fixtures and equipment between 10% and 20%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an  
asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to  
get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost 
of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which they are incurred.
Intangible assets
Computer software development costs that generate economic 
benefits beyond one year are capitalised as intangible assets 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over a range of five to 
seven years. 
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product 
or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group 
intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to 
complete development, future economic benefits are probable 
and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable 
to the intangible asset during its development. Development 
activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure 
capitalised includes the cost of materials and direct labour. Other 
development expenditure is recognised in the income statement 
as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure 
is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Customer databases arising on acquisitions assessed under  
the requirements of IFRS 3 are amortised over their useful 
economic lives, which have been assessed as being five years.
Legally protected or otherwise separable trade names acquired 
as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value  
on acquisition. Brand names are individually assessed and are 
assumed to have an indefinite life and are not amortised,  
but are subject to annual impairment tests.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding 
goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value 
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. For goodwill and intangible assets that have 
indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to  
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using  
a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimate of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as 
income immediately.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms  
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.

N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS
CONTINUED Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease even 
where payments are not made on such a basis.
Assets held under finance leases are included in tangible fixed 
assets at a value equal to the original costs incurred by the lessor 
less depreciation, and obligations to the lessor are shown as  
part of creditors. The interest element is charged to the income 
statement over the period of the lease to produce a constant 
rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Inventories
Inventories have been valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Provision is made based on the age of the 
inventory. Cost comprises direct materials and those overheads 
that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present 
location and condition based on the standard costing method. 
Cost has been calculated on a first-in first-out basis. Net 
realisable value means estimated selling price less all costs  
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the  
tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected  
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset  
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each Group company are expressed in pounds 
sterling, which is the functional currency of the Group, and the 
presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statement of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.  
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items 
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary 
items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included 
in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on 
the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are 
included in profit or loss for the period except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect  
of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.  
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of  
that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange 
risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts and options 
(see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in 
respect of such derivative financial instruments).
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial 
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated  
at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange 
rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case  
the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity  
and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such 
translation differences are recognised as income or as  
expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Profits and losses on 
financial instruments are recognised in the income statement  
as they arise.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or  
loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired 
based on specific customer patterns of behaviour which may  
be affected by external economic conditions.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value  
of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Trade receivables are assessed for impairment on a collective 
basis. Objective evidence of impairment could include the 
Group’s past experience of collecting payments and observable 
changes in national and local economic conditions that could 
correlate with a default event.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group  
after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the 
income statement using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value, 
are not interest bearing and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at  
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks  
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the 
purchase of overseas sourced products, and interest rates 
relating to the Group’s debt. The Group uses foreign exchange 
forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts where 
appropriate to hedge these exposures. In accordance with  
its treasury policy, the Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s 
policies approved by the board of directors, which provide 
written principles on the use of financial derivatives. 
Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives contracts is their quoted market value at 
the balance sheet date.
Market values are based on the duration of the derivative 
instrument together with the quoted market data including 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at 
the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts 
is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay 
to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into 
account prevailing interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivative financial 
instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments  
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of a Black- Scholes 
model. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting 
conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment 
is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up  
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Own shares held by ESOT
Transactions of the group-sponsored Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (ESOT) are included in the Group financial statements. The 
trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited 
and credited directly to equity.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes 
are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to 
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as 
payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s 
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising  
in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of 
providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at 
the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if 
applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) 
are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge 
or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the 
statement of comprehensive income is not recycled. Past 
service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of 
scheme amendment. Net-interest is calculated by applying  
a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
• current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses  
on curtailments and settlements;
• net-interest expense or income; and
• remeasurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined 
benefit costs within operating expenses (see note 30) in its 
consolidated income statement. Curtailments gains and losses 
are accounted for as past-service cost. Net-interest expense  
or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 10).
The retirement benefit asset/(obligation) recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the defined 
benefit asset/(obligation), as reduced by the fair value of 
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is 
restricted to the past service cost plus the present value  
of available refunds and reductions in future contributions.
Supplier rebates
The Group enter into volume based rebate arrangements with 
suppliers. Rebates are calculated annually based on agreements 
in place, which stipulate an agreed percentage of purchase be 
grated as a rebate. Rebates are agreed with suppliers before 
they are recognised in the Income Statement. 
Going concern
In determining whether the Group’s accounts can be prepared 
on a going concern basis, the directors considered the Group’s 
business activities together with factors likely to affect its future 
92
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS
CONTINUED development, performance and its financial position including 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and the 
principal risks and uncertainties relating to its business 
activities. These are set out within the Risk Management Report 
on pages 28 to 31.
The Group has considered carefully its cash flows and banking 
covenants for the next twelve months from the date of signing 
the audited financial statements. These have been appraised  
in light of the current economic climate. As such, conservative 
assumptions for working capital performance have been used 
to determine the level of financial resources available to the 
company and to assess liquidity risk. 
The Group’s forecasts and projections, after sensitivity to  
take account of all reasonably foreseeable changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group will have sufficient 
headroom within its current loan facilities of £405m – which  
are committed until 2020 – and its £20m overdraft facility. 
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the company and the Group  
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in the preparation of the annual report and accounts.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one  
off, non-recurring in nature and so material that the directors 
believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion 
of underlying performance and should be separately presented 
on the face of the income statement.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the year end date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below.
Trade receivables
An appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable trade 
receivables is derived where there is an identified event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence of a potential 
reduction in the recoverability of future cash flows. This 
estimation is based on assumed collection rates which, 
although based on the Group’s historical experience of 
customer repayment patterns, remains inherently uncertain. 
Changes in the assumptions applied could have a significant 
impact on the carrying value of trade receivables.
As a result this is continually assessed for relevance and 
adjusted appropriately. Further information is given in note 18.
Taxation
The Group’s tax balances comprise income tax, which is the sum 
of the total current and deferred tax balances, and VAT. The 
Group has on-going discussions with HMRC in respect of open 
taxation positions and the calculation of the Group’s potential 
liabilities or assets in respect of these necessarily involves a 
degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose 
tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has 
been reached with HMRC or, as appropriate, through a formal 
legal process. Issues can, and often do, take a number of years 
to resolve. The amounts recognised or disclosed are derived 
from the Group’s best estimation and judgement and, where 
appropriate, legal counsel’s opinion has been sought. However, 
the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these means 
eventual realisation could differ from the accounting estimates 
and therefore impact the Group’s results and cash flows.
Inventory
Provision is made for those items of inventory where the net 
realisable value is estimated to be lower than cost. Net realisable 
value is based on both historical experience and assumptions 
regarding future selling values and disposal channels, and is 
consequently a source of estimation uncertainty.
Regulatory
The regulatory environment in which the Group operates is 
both complex and changing and the Group continues to review 
and develop its compliance with the requirements of the FCA. 
This can be a critical area of judgement when considering any 
liabilities that could arise as a result of the legislation in place.
Software Development Costs
Included within intangibles assets are significant software  
and development project costs in respect of the Groups 
transformation project, Fit 4 the Future. Costs are capitalised  
to the extent that future economic benefits are expected to  
be generated by the project, which requires judgment to be 
made as to whether the project will be completed successfully, 
will be technically feasible and whether sufficient revenue and 
profitability will be generated to recover the costs capitalised.  
If these criteria are not subsequently met, the asset would  
be subject to a future impairment charge which would impact  
the Groups results. This is consequently a source of estimation 
uncertainty.

The Group has one reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8 - Operating Segments, which is the Home Shopping segment. 
The Group's board receives monthly financial information at this level and uses this information to monitor the performance of the 
Home Shopping segment, allocate resources and make operational decisions. Internal reporting focuses on the Group as a whole 
and does not identify individual segments. To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary 
disclosure analysing product revenue within the reportable segment, by brand categorisation and product type categorisation.

Given the significant change being implemented across our business as we become a digital-first, product-led, specialist-fit fashion 
retailer, we have sought to enhance our income statement disclosure in several ways:
•  changing the allocation of certain cost lines from product gross margin to operating costs, to bring our disclosure more in line 
with typical retail practice.
•  splitting the gross margin performance of Product and Financial Services.
• enhancing our operating cost disclosure to provide further clarity, moving from two categories – Distribution and Sales  
& Administration costs, to four – Warehouse & Fulfilment, Marketing & Production, Depreciation & amortisation,  
Other admin & payroll.
All the prior year comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 20.08% (2015, 21.17%) of the estimated assessable profit for the period. Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. 
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2017)  
and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. The deferred tax assets and liabilities at  
2016 has been calculated based on these rates. 
An additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was announced in the budget on 16 March 2016. This will reduce  
the company's future current tax charge accordingly.

Financial statements 11 Tax (continued)
The Group has on-going discussions with HMRC in respect of open taxation positions. The calculation of the Group's potential 
liabilities or assets in respect of these involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose tax treatment 
cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with HMRC or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process. 
Issues can, and often do, take a number of years to resolve. The amounts recognised or disclosed are derived from the Group's 
best estimation and judgement and, where appropriate, legal counsel's opinion has been sought. However the inherent 
uncertainty regarding the outcome of these means eventual realisation could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore 
impact the Group's results and cash flows.

Impairment testing of Software intangible assets
The Group is currently undertaking a Systems transformation project. Fit 4 the Future, Elements of Fit 4 the Future are not yet 
available for use therefore management have conducted impairment testing as at 27 February 2016. The recoverable amount has 
been based on the present value of future cashflows using the following key assumptions:
Cash flows over the seven year useful economic life of the asset represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 
27 February 2016, and are based upon the Group’s forecasts for 2017 – 2023.
The main assumptions underlying the cashflows relate to improvements in buying, marketing and credit management due to the 
use of an integrated platform as well as changes in costs due to reductions in finance time, and will be driven by exploitation of the 
Group’s new IT platform and further investments made during 2017 . Cash flows into perpetuity have not been incorporated into 
the calculation for prudence, however the asset is expected to generate economic benefit for the Group significantly past 2023.  
A pre-tax discount rate of 8% has been used in the forecast, consistent with the Brand impairment testing performed. The analysis 
performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value and as such, no impairment was 
identified. It is on this basis, that management do not consider an impairment to exist at 27 February 2016. No reasonably possible 
change in a key assumption on which management has based its determination of the assets recoverable amount would cause the 
assets carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
The amortisation periods for intangible assets are:

Impairment testing of Brand intangibles
The brand names arising from the acquisition of High and Mighty, Slimma, Figleaves, Diva and Dannimac are deemed to have 
indefinite lives as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which they are expected to generate cash inflows and are 
subject to annual impairment tests.
As a result of the decision to close the Gray & Osbourn catalogue business in 2015 the carrying value of the brand was 
permanently impaired to a value of £nil.
The carrying value of the brand names have been determined from a value in use calculation. The key assumptions for this 
calculation are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
99
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Financial statements 14 Intangible assets (continued)
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent three year financial budgets approved by management and 
thereafter extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity (with 2.7% growth assumed) to reflect that there is no foreseeable limit to the period 
over which cash flows are expected to be generated. The rate used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows is 8.0% (2015, 7 .4%). 
The directors consider that the value in use calculation has sufficient headroom above the carrying value of the brand names.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed with both the growth rate and discount rate adjusted by +7%, and under these sensitivities 
significant headroom is maintained.
The carrying value in relation to Gray & Osbourn is £nil (2015, £nil), £7 .1m (2015, £7 .1m) for Figleaves and for High and Mighty is 
£1.0m (2015, £1.0m). Whilst the directors do not consider that either brand name is impaired as at the balance sheet date, should 
there be a downturn in future or forecasted cashflows, then there is a risk of impairment to these brand names.

Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost.
The average credit period given to customers for the sale of goods is 222 days (2015 restated, 230 days). Interest is charged at 
58.7% (2015, 58.7%) on the outstanding balance. Where there is objective evidence of financial difficulty, a provision of estimated 
irrecoverable amounts is determined by reference to past default experience. A provision is held for all trade receivables that reach 
the trigger point of 56 days past due. For customers who find themselves in financial difficulties, the Group may offer revised 
payment terms to support the customer, encouraging customer rehabilitation and thereby maximising long term returns. However 
as the customer is not meeting their original payment terms a provision is held for these receivables. Generally, receivables over 
150 days past due are written off in full.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit 
quality and defines credit limits by customer. Credit limits and scores attributed to customers are reviewed every 28 days.  
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, with regard to the historical default rate has 
remained stable.

is not possible to determine how the matter will be resolved. However within our year end VAT debtor is an asset of £21.7m which 
has arisen as a result of cash payments made under protective assessments raised by HMRC. Based on legal counsel's opinion,  
we believe that we will recover this amount in full from HMRC and we are engaged in a legal process to do so. 
Other debtors and prepayments do not include impaired assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is  
the carrying value of each class of asset. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
i. Bank overdrafts which are nil at the current and prior year ends are repayable on demand, unsecured and bear interest at a 
margin over bank base rates.
ii. The Group has a bank loan of £250m (2015, £250m) secured by a charge over certain ‘eligible’ trade debtors (current and 0–28 
days past due) of the Group and is without recourse to any of the Group’s other assets. The facility has a current limit of £280m 
for which finance costs are linked to US commercial paper rates which is committed until August 2020. 
 
The Group also has unsecured bank loans of £85m (2015, £37m) drawn down under a medium term bank revolving credit 
facility, of £125 million, which is committed until September 2020.
iii. All borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group may use 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps where appropriate to manage this risk. None have been used in the current or prior year. 
Based on weighted average interest rates and the value of bank loans at 27 February 2016 the estimated future interest cost per 
annum until maturity would be £2.3m (2015, £2.0m).
At 27 February 2016, the Group had available £90m (2015, £83m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all 
conditions precedent had been met.
Note 21 summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies 
for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of the Group’s borrowings.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists  
of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 26 and equity attributable 
to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 24 to 25 and the

Financial risk management objectives
The financial risks facing the Group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group seeks 
to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed 
by the Group’s policies. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments,  
for speculative purposes.

Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations 
arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for  
the purchase of overseas sourced products. Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

exposure to interest rate fluctuations on indebtedness is managed by using derivatives such as interest rate swaps.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS
CONTINUED Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit before tax for the 52 weeks 
ended 27 February 2016 would have decreased by £1.4m (2015, £1.4m).
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net 
debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. 
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved by  
the board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, supplied by independent rating 
agencies. Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual  
cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 19 is a description of additional 
undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal and details of the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative 
financial liabilities.

Fair value of financial instruments
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted 
interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at the amortised cost in the financial statements 
approximate to their fair values, with the exception of trade receivables. 
As discussed in Note 18, where a customer finds themselves in financial difficulty, we may offer revised payment terms. This 
maximises long term returns to the business, but may not maximise the present value of the receivable. Therefore, the Group 
believes the amortised cost does not reflect the fair value of these receivables, which we have calculated as £554.0m.

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS
CONTINUED The fair value of management and sharesave options/awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
2016 2015 
Weighted average share price at date of grant (pence) 339 441
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 97 193
Expected volatility (%) 27.7 – 34.2 26.0 – 36.2
Expected life (years) 2.5 – 5.5 2.5 – 5.5
Risk-free rate (%) 0.9 1.2
Dividend yield (%) 4.2 3.4
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period equivalent to 
the expected life of the option. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £2.2m and £2.1m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2016 
and 2015 respectively.
30 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The Group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits. 
The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £3.1m (2015, £3.3m) represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 27 February 2016, contributions of £0.3m (2015, £0.4m) due in respect of the current 
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund. Under the scheme, the employees are entitled 
to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002. On 29 
February 2016 the scheme was closed to future accrual. A past service credit in respect of this closure has been recognised in 
2016, as the company was both committed to the change, and had the right to apply the change by the balance sheet date. No 
other post-retirement benefits are provided. The scheme is a funded scheme and operates under UK trust law and the trust is a 
separate legal entity from the Group. The scheme is governed by a board of trustees. The trustees are required by law to act in the 
best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies (eg investment funding) together with the 
Group. The scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and investment risk.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 
30 June 2012 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service 
cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal actuarial assumptions used in 
determining the Group’s net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows:
2016 2015
Discount rate 3.90% 3.50%
Future pension increases 2.15% 2.12%

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate and inflation.  
An increase of 0.25% in the discount rate used would decrease the defined benefit obligation by £5.8m (2015, £7 .0m).  
An increase of 0.25% in the inflation assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by £4.4m (2015, £4.7m).
The above sensitivities are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. Whilst the analysis 
does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows under the scheme, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity  
of the assumptions shown. No changes have been made to the method and assumptions used in this analysis from those used in 
the previous period.
The scheme is funded by the group and current employee members. Funding the scheme is based on a separate actuarial 
valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above. Funding requirements are 
formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the trustees 
and the Group.
Whilst no commitment has been made as at the balance sheet date, the Group expects to contribute £0.2m (2015, £1.8m) to the 
defined benefit scheme in the next financial year.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 27 February 2016 is approximately 24 years (2015, 24 years).
The defined benefit obligation at 27 February 2016 can be approximately attributed to the scheme members as follows:
• Active members: 0% (2015, 44%)
• Deferred members: 68% (2015, 36%)
• Pensioner members; 32% (2015, 20%)
All benefits are vested at 27 February 2016 (unchanged from 28 February 2015).

RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING PROFIT TO NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY 32 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
N Brown Group plc ("the Company") is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. These financial statements present 
information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group. These financial statements were prepared 
in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”). The amendments to FRS 101 
(2014/15 Cycle) issued in July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary  
in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has 
been taken. 
In the transition to FRS 101, the Company has made no measurement and recognition adjustments and has applied IFRS 1 whilst 
ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101. 
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period however none are applicable 
to these financial statements.
The Company is the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group and also prepares consolidated financial statements. The 
consolidated financial statements of N Brown Group plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and are available to the public and may be obtained from it registered office address.
The Company proposes to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements. The principal 
accounting policies summarised below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
accounts and in preparing an opening FRS 101 IFRS balance sheet at 1 March 2014 for the purposes of the transition to FRS 101.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except  
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised 
directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than  
in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred 
tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Company’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents on the basis there is 
right to offset.
Own shares held by ESOT
Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) are treated as being those of the Company and 
are therefore reflected in the company financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company 
are debited and credited directly to equity.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016
NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS 33 Prior period restatement
N Brown plc operates Group wide equity settled share incentive schemes. Whilst the Company has no own employees of its own, it 
settles all share incentive schemes granted to employees of its subsidiaries. In 2016 the directors reviewed the application of IFRS 2 
share based payments. In prior periods, the Group wide schemes had not been reflected in the individual accounts of N Brown Group 
plc. The Company accounts have been restated with the Company now recognising a credit to equity in respect of all group wide 
equity settled share based payment schemes. As subsidiaries are not recharged for the share based payment charge, the amount is 
debited to cost of investment. The impact on the balance sheet in 2015 and 2014 is shown below, described as Adjustment 1.
The Company also acts as sponsor transferring cash and selling sufficient shares to enable an employee benefit trust to meet 
obligations of the Group wide equity settled share incentive schemes. In prior periods, the trust was accounted for in the Group 
accounts only and not in the Company accounts. On the basis that the trust is merely acting as an agent of the Company, the 
Company accounts have been restated to account for the assets and liabilities of the trust as if they were assets and liabilities of 
the Company. The Company cashflow statement has been restated on the same basis. Under this treatment, the accounting in  
the Company accounts is the same as the accounting in the Group accounts. The impact on the balance sheet in 2015 and 2014  
is shown below, described as Adjustment 2.

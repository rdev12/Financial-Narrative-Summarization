Annual Report 2011
Chairman’s statement
in which we operate are able to see tangible and long-lasting 
beneﬁts from our activities. We are particularly proud to provide 
employment and training for over 1,200 Sierra Leoneans. 2012 is 
signiﬁcant as we will contribute directly to the economy of Sierra 
Leone through payments of royalty and taxes to the Government 
of Sierra Leone; and indirectly through our social development 
royalty, local employment and local supply chain initiatives. 
As we enter a new phase of operations, construction and 
development we are ever more appreciative of the need to 
minimise the impact of our operations to the surrounding 
environment and communities and to keep our employees safe. 
We continue to aim for zero harm and are pleased to report zero 
fatalities in 2011. We formed a Health, Safety and Environment 
committee   in 2011, we aim to monitor, report and improve on 
health and safety performance over the coming year.
Governance and Board 
We were able to strengthen our Board signiﬁcantly in 2011 
with the appointment of Colin Harris, Benjamin Lee and 
Luciano Ramos. Colin has been appointed as an independent 
Non-Executive Director and brings extensive mining experience 
to London Mining, as an exploration geologist with over 40 
years’ industry expertise. Benjamin and Luciano have been vital 
components of London Mining’s success since joining the 
Company, including developing and disposing of our asset in 
Brazil as well as contributing to the ﬁnancing, construction and 
ongoing operation of Marampa. Their appointment ensures that 
the Board is able to beneﬁt fully from their insights and expertise.
Our people 
Our people are key to delivering on our strategy. We have 
made two new senior appointments: Claude Perras as 
Head of Sustainability and Rosh Bardien as Group Head 
of Human Resources. 
Outlook
The people, high quality assets and sound ﬁnancial footing we 
now have in place will ensure 2012 will be a year of consolidation 
for future growth for London Mining as we continue to deliver  
our production ramp-up and ﬁnalise our long term growth plans.  
We are proud of what we have achieved at Marampa and our 
other assets in 2011. The Board would like to congratulate 
Graeme and his team for their hard work this year and for 
delivering on our strategic goals and moving London Mining from 
a developer to a producer as we build towards a FTSE listing.
Dr Colin Knight
Chairman
2011 was a milestone year for London 
Mining. We moved from being a developer 
to a producer in December and laid the 
groundwork to ship our ﬁrst iron ore from 
the Marampa mine in January 2012. 
201 1 was in many ways like 2008 for London Mining in that  
we developed a mine in a climate of uncertainty in the global 
ﬁnancial markets and have once again delivered a new source  
of iron ore capacity at low capital cost as well as deﬁning a 
production proﬁle that will contribute to strong upward earnings 
momentum for several years to come. We believe that demand 
for iron ore will remain robust due to continued demand for steel 
from emerging economies. Competition for capital means that 
existing producers will be in the strongest position to grow as 
they are able to fund production expansion from cash ﬂow and 
to provide greater visibility on product speciﬁcation and volume 
to customers.
Results and progress 
Restarting the Marampa mine after almost 40 years of inactivity 
is a huge achievement for London Mining and for Sierra Leone. 
The production of high speciﬁcation iron ore after decades of 
mine inactivity marked the beginning of our Phase 1 ramp up  
and forms the basis for our planned phased expansions to over 
16Mtpa. Our plan for Marampa evolved signiﬁcantly in 201 1 as  
we fully deﬁned the opportunities presented by the signiﬁcant 
addition of resources. Together with expert insights from our 
technical team, production growth in the short term can be 
accelerated through simple optimisation of the processing plant 
and logistics. The longer term plan to develop Marampa from 
an operation with capacity of 1.5Mtpa to over 16Mtpa was also 
deﬁned by the April 201 1 prefeasibility study (“PFS”) and we look 
forward to the completion of a bankable feasibility study (“BFS”) 
in Q3 2012 for the ﬁrst increment of this expansion to 9Mtpa. 
We continue to build and develop our investment case and  
we have a clear strategy for growing value. We have been 
encouraged by the continued support from our shareholders 
through their participation in the USD 1 10 million convertible 
bond issue in January 201 1 and in the issuance of USD 91 million 
of new equity in January 2012. We have also raised to date 
USD 210 million through alternative sources of ﬁnance. 
The progress achieved at our projects in Greenland, Colombia 
and Saudi Arabia is testament to the energy, commitment and 
expertise of our management teams.

What we do 
We are a fast growing new supplier of high quality iron ore to the 
global steel industry. We are developing three iron ore mines in 
Sierra Leone, Greenland and Saudi Arabia, together with an 
integrated coking operation in Colombia. Production and export 
have now commenced from our mine in Sierra Leone.
Typically a London Mining asset will have potential for a large 
resource, a deliverable logistics solution with access to the  
seaborne market and critically must be capable of producing 
a consistent product at a sustainable margin. 
We focus on building production rapidly and we often have a 
staged development plan whereby cash ﬂows generated from 
early production can be used to ﬁnance larger scale development.
Our philosophy 
We aim to provide steelmakers with a high quality, reliable 
and consistent supply from a growing resource base. We 
have a responsible approach to doing business and consider 
all stakeholders in the development of our assets.

potential strategic investors. Our joint venture in the Wadi 
Sawawin project advanced further in its aims to produce  
direct reduction (“DR”) quality pellets in Saudi Arabia as we 
continued to work with National Mining Company, (“NMC”) to 
conclude the preconstruction engineering design and arrange 
full ﬁnancing for the project.
Key events through the year
We had a busy year and some of the key events are highlighted here:
Our primary focus for 201 1 was on ﬁnancing, developing and 
implementing an expanded operation at Marampa following 
conﬁrmation of over 1 billion tonnes of JORC resource of which 
81% now falls in the Indicated category. The increased resource 
formed the basis of a PFS in April which outlined the development 
plan for a greater than 16Mtpa operation. This plan set out a 
staged development, starting with reprocessing of tailings from 
previous operations then moving to mining and processing of 
weathered ore and then the unweathered primary ore for a large 
scale-long term mining operation. Test work continued through the 
year and key ﬁndings were incorporated and engineered into the 
initial plant design. As a result, our Stage 1 plan which originally 
targeted 1.5Mtpa from tailings has now been expanded to a 
planned 5Mtpa from a blend of tailings and highly weathered 
ore. Marampa began production of high speciﬁcation iron ore 
in December 201 1 and shipments of Marampa concentrate, 
to both Europe and China, began in January 2012.
Highlights at our other projects included the completion of  
a BFS demonstrating compelling economics for a 15Mtpa 
operation in Greenland, commissioning and ﬁrst production 
from the coke production unit in Colombia and progressing 
the Wadi Sawawin project with our joint venture partner NMC.
Through the year, we arranged a variety of ﬁnancings to support 
our development activities and the implementation of a larger project 
at Marampa than originally planned. These included a convertible  
bond placement of USD 1 10.0 million, a corporate debt facility  
of USD 90.7 million with Standard Chartered Bank, initial offtake  
prepayment facility with Glencore of up to USD 27.0 million, and 
a 1% royalty arrangement on Isua for USD 30.0 million with Anglo 
Paciﬁc. In the post period we have secured net proceeds USD 
18.4 million of lease ﬁnancing through Oldendorff for the “Pride 
of Marampa” Floating Offshore Transhipment Platform (“FOTP”) 
and gross proceeds of USD 90.7 million through an issue of 
new common shares and signed a prepayment agreement linked 
to offtake of USD 45.0 million from Vitol. We are conﬁdent of 
continuing to fund growth in our projects through various methods 
of ﬁnance as may be appropriate for each project. This will be based 
on identifying clear value creation potential through expansion or 
implementation and demonstrating the expertise to carry it out. For 
larger capital projects such as Greenland, we are pursuing strategic 
partner funding.
With its ﬁrst production coming on line 
and an increase in its longer term growth 
potential, our Marampa mine was a key 
highlight for us this year. We are very 
proud of what we are achieving there, 
but it is part of a bigger story. The start 
of production at Marampa marks one of 
many planned high points as we continue 
to deliver on our promise to provide high 
quality iron ore supply for the global steel 
industry in a way that creates long term 
value for our business and for the 
communities we live and work in.
Twenty months on from ordering our long lead items for the 
Marampa mine and logistics system in Sierra Leone, we produced 
our ﬁrst ore in December 201 1. As well as reaching this milestone 
we also signiﬁcantly improved the long term economics of the 
project through the continuous optimisation of the production  
plan following a 10-fold increase in historical resources. 
The Marampa plant and logistics system is working as designed 
and began regular shipments of premium speciﬁcation iron ore 
sinter feed concentrate from January 2012 as we ramp up to 
initial installed capacity of 1.5Mtpa.
Marampa is particularly attractive because of its good location 
and the nature and quality of its ore. It is located only 40km from 
tidewater, allowing simple and low cost logistics. What is more, 
the nature of the types of ore present – now clearly identiﬁed after 
90,000 metres of drilling – allows us to develop it very ﬂexibly in a 
series of increments towards its ultimate planned yearly capacity of 
greater than 16Mtpa. As a result, we can produce signiﬁcant cash 
ﬂows early and defer other capital expenditure to later stages 
of development, signiﬁcantly funded from early cash ﬂow. An 
additional differentiating factor is that the mine produces high 
speciﬁcation product which commands a premium price over 
more standard products. This high grade is preferred by steel 
mills who are encountering falling grades from other suppliers. 
Through 2011, we have continued to progress our projects 
elsewhere and to implement our clear strategy for growing 
value for shareholders by moving good near term projects 
through the development curve. Colombia became our third 
producing London Mining asset, after Brazil (which was sold in 
2008) and Marampa. In addition, the recently completed BFS 
for Isua indicates the project is a compelling proposition for 
201 1 was a breakthrough year for London Mining  
as we moved from a developer to a producer.  
We achieved this goal in line with our promise  
to provide the global steel industry with a new 
high quality supply of iron ore.

fund further expansion. All our current iron ore projects are located 
no further than 1 10km from deep water suitable for the loading of 
ocean-going vessels. They have either been previously producing 
or had signiﬁcant resource identiﬁcation and feasibility work carried 
out and are able to produce a high speciﬁcation product that is 
readily saleable on the seaborne iron ore market and are low cost for 
the type of product they produce. 
Staged production growth
This can involve both staged expansion of an operating asset 
as well as bringing additional projects into production. Building 
production rapidly to generate cash ﬂow to fund and drive further 
expansion is our preferred development strategy and is taking 
place in both our Sierra Leonean and Colombian operations. We 
see strong feasibility work as the basis for attracting investment to 
larger capital projects and expansion phases. 
Our business model
We develop mines to supply the global steel industry and aim  
to become a top 10 global producer of iron ore. To this end, we 
apply a very simple and practical business model to enable the 
development of multiple projects. This is based on applying strong 
operational and technical competencies to assets which meet our 
evaluation criteria and taking an appropriate ﬁnancing approach to 
each asset. As we develop and realise this value for all our 
stakeholders we intend to both reinvest selectively in further 
signiﬁcant value opportunities where we can employ our core 
competencies and return proﬁts to shareholders.
Growing our resource base of valuable assets
We select assets with near term production or expansion potential, 
with viable logistics and long term sustainable margins. Our assets 
have simple and self determined logistics and some have potential 
to be brought quickly to production with cash ﬂow often able to

Chief Executive’s strategic review
continued
We ﬁnance our projects on a case-by-case basis in the 
most appropriate way for each asset. This makes sense 
because each asset has a distinct ﬁnancing solution and 
opportunities to optimise value for our shareholders.  
At Marampa for example, the presence of tailings from 
former operations and presence of soft, highly weathered 
ore means that production can be developed quickly for 
relatively low initial capital expenditure with fast capital 
payback and then expanded in stages using early cash ﬂow. 
Marampa also beneﬁts from its ability to produce a premium 
product enabling us to secure offtake-related ﬁnancing with 
pricing related to the spot benchmark. This modular 
approach at Marampa means we are able to plan on the 
basis of later expansions being funded from a combination 
of cash ﬂow, offtake arrangements and debt. There is also 
potential to accelerate our Phase 2 expansion at Marampa 
to over 16Mtpa if ﬁnance on suitable value accretive terms 
were provided by a strategic investor. For the Isua project in 
Greenland, funds to complete drilling and a BFS were 
raised by selling a project-speciﬁc royalty based on the 
quality and compelling nature of the project.
The right strategic partnerships create important mutually 
beneﬁcial opportunities to fund and participate in ownership in 
larger capital projects. At Isua for example, we have involved 
Chinese engineering groups and have also been actively 
speaking to potential Chinese funding partners.
Skilled people
Skilled people and skilled teams are a vital part of our business 
as they enable us to drive our fast track development capability. 
Our growth proﬁle, asset base and successful track record has 
allowed us to attract the highest quality professionals who wish 
to share in our ambitions to grow and succeed. We have built a 
world-class technical team with expertise drawn from many of the 
large diversiﬁed mining and engineering companies. The creativity 
and ﬂexibility of our people has enabled us to move quickly in fast 
tracking progress and to adapt rapidly to new opportunities. At 
Marampa for example, our technical team designed a versatile 
plant and ﬂexible logistics solution which has enabled us to 
accommodate signiﬁcant new resources into our short term mine 
plan much earlier than anticipated and for low additional capital 
expenditure. What is more, being able to begin production and 
cash ﬂow early from processing existing tailings has enabled us 
to get into production and cash ﬂows years earlier than would 
a typical larger company approach.
London Mining project pipeline – delivering low cost, high quality supply Overview
13
London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
Our business plan
1.   To deliver proﬁtable near term production growth 
We are focused on delivering high margin (through low cost/high 
quality) production quickly, within a disciplined framework, to 
meet the immediate needs of the global steel industry and 
become a long term supplier of choice for our customers through 
quality and consistency of product and reliability of supply. 
Progress in 2011 
During 2011 we began production in Marampa and 
demonstrated the possibility for a 10-fold increase in production 
capacity following the completion of a PFS in April and the 
delineation of over 1 billion tonnes of resources at Marampa,  
a 30 fold increase on our maiden resource statement for the 
project in December 2010. We completed construction of  
our ﬁrst processing plant and are ramping up production.  
We have also commenced construction for our second plant  
to complete the Phase 1 expansion to 5Mtpa. 
We moved closer towards establishing a growing coke and 
coking coal business in Colombia, completing construction of 
the ﬁrst phase of coke ovens and beginning initial production 
started in January 2012. A logistics capability for export has 
also been secured.
Looking forward 
We expect to deliver 1.5Mt of iron ore production from Marampa 
in 2012 and through construction of our second plant grow to 
4.2Mt in 2013 and to 5Mt in 2014.
We expect that the BFS for the Marampa expansion to 9Mtpa 
will be completed in Q3 2012. This will provide us with the 
opportunity to invest further in the project using cash ﬂow from 
operations to expand production and generate exceptional 
ﬁnancial returns. 
We have commenced production from our coke ovens in 
Colombia from local coking coal supply and will ramp up to 
200ktpa by the end of 2012. We are looking to secure coking 
coal feedstock though our exploration activities to develop 
integrated production and opportunities for export.
2. To identify further growth opportunities and further assets 
from which we can leverage growth 
We have a track record of identifying and acquiring assets that 
have the potential to be rapidly developed using our experience 
and technical capability and which provide signiﬁcant value 
creation potential by bringing on near term production. We are 
adept at optimising our assets to reach their economic potential. 
Progress in 2011
2011 has been a year of implementing production and logistics 
systems and of adding value to existing development projects. 
We have achieved great success by further developing existing 
projects, most notably at Marampa. project value and return at 
Marampa has been greatly enhanced by adding resources, 
enhancing the near term mining plan and expanding next  
stage potential. 
We have completed a BFS for our Isua project in Greenland which 
shows the project to have extremely robust fundamentals. Our 
201 1 drilling campaign at Isua conﬁrmed over a billion tonnes of 
JORC resources and also delineated further mineralisation 
potential of between 950 and 1,500Mt including a high grade 
hematite target of between 150 and 300Mt. 
Looking forward
Our current focus is on further developing the operation  
at Marampa so that it can reach its full economic potential 
through considered and systematic expansion. We intend to 
ﬁnd a funding partner to allow construction of the 15Mtpa 
operation in Greenland to commence and thereby build a 
second signiﬁcant production centre in this stable OECD 
country. We intend to move our Colombian and Saudi Arabian 
strategies forward to achieve our near term production aims.  
In the longer term we continue to assess investment opportunities 
which best suit strategy, capabilities and experience.

3. To build ﬁnancing capability through multiple means to fund 
our growth proﬁle 
To achieve our optimum growth proﬁle we expect both to  
build near term signiﬁcant cash ﬂows for reinvestment and to 
develop strong relationships with industry customers/partners 
and ﬁnancial institutions. 
Progress in 2011
Our ﬁnancial capability has been greatly enhanced following  
the commencement of production at Marampa. The production 
of high speciﬁcation product has enabled us to secure low  
cost debt ﬁnance through offtake relationships: Marampa 
developments this year have enhanced our production proﬁle 
and we have been encouraged by the continued support from 
our shareholders through their participation in the USD 110.0 
million convertible bond issue in January 2011 and in the 
issuance of USD 90.7 million of new equity in January 2012.  
We have also secured USD 30.0 million to fund the development 
of Isua through a royalty agreement with Anglo Paciﬁc and 
secured a USD 90.0 million revolving credit facility with 
Standard Chartered Bank. USD 18.4 million of lease ﬁnancing  
for the Pride of Marampa FOTP in 2012 was also provided by 
Oldendorff and USD 45.0 million offtake related prepayment  
has been signed with Vitol.
Looking forward
We are focused on cash ﬂow from near term production 
opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet and debt 
capability. We await the results of the BFS for the Marampa 
expansion to 9Mtpa which will deﬁne the capital requirement 
and availability of product for future offtake agreements. We are 
also assessing the option to bring on a strategic partner or 
partners to fund accelerated growth at Marampa and production 
at Isua. We will continue to evaluate offtake-related funding 
opportunities for our growing production. We are also conﬁdent 
that by adhering to international best practice we will be able 
to form partnerships with international ﬁnance institutions to 
develop infrastructure that can beneﬁt multiple stakeholders. 
4. To be a responsible and sustainable business 
Our commitment to sustainable development underpins 
everything that we do as it is through this that we gain and 
maintain our licence to operate. We believe that we have 
the opportunity to bring long term and positive beneﬁts 
for the communities in which we operate. 
Progress in 2011
Our ongoing success in Sierra Leone depends on maintaining 
our good relationships with all stakeholders, including local 
communities and Government. We are extremely proud of 
our contribution to the Sierra Leone economy. The economic 
beneﬁt of our operations at Marampa will form a very signiﬁcant 
part of Sierra Leone’s GDP and our success encourages other 
companies and ﬁnancial institutions to invest in the country. 
Even at this stage we have generated over 1,200 local jobs, 
with 89% of jobs at Marampa going to Sierra Leoneans.  
The multiplier effect in the local economy of our economic 
activity and local procurement is creating widespread new 
opportunity. We have established a form of equitable treaty  
with the Government, including an active social investment 
program, which gives surety to our investment plans and 
allows Marampa to attain its full economic potential and 
beneﬁt all stakeholders. 
Looking forward
We commenced royalty payments to the Government of Sierra 
Leone and began contributions into a social development fund 
through a revenue-based royalty in Q1 2012. The appointment 
of Claude Perras as our Head of Sustainability will help give us 
the capability to develop sustainable production and economic 
returns whilst delivering tangible beneﬁts to stakeholders.  
We will achieve this by building partnerships with NGOs, 
development agencies and government, providing 
infrastructure investment opportunities for international ﬁnance 
institutions and developing and implementing local content 
policies. Attaining international best practice standards in 
addressing the needs of all our stakeholders as well as the 
application of appropriate community and environmental  
policy will help build our reputation and credibility to ensure  
we can secure ﬁnancing and a social licence to operate in  
all jurisdictions.
Summary
At London Mining we have a clear strategy to grow value for  
all stakeholders – from delivering good ﬁnancial returns to 
improving the lives of our communities, from keeping our 
employees safe and healthy to responsibly contributing to the 
countries in which we operate. Our disciplined approach to  
developing our assets has enabled us to plan for the expansion 
and further development of our assets. We are excited about 
our future and look forward to continuing to execute our 
strategy and grow the business for the long term within 
a disciplined framework.

China
The iron ore market is currently 
dominated by the big four iron ore 
producers who also account for 60 to 
65% of the required future growth in 
capacity. London Mining aims to become 
an alternative “supplier of choice” to steel 
makers by delivering sustainable new 
sources of production. 
Steel production continues to grow 
Crude steel production continued to grow in 2011, albeit at  
a slower rate than in 2010. The World Steel Organisation 
estimates crude steel production to be 1,490Mt – up by 4% 
from the previous year, compared with a 16% increase in 2010. 
Looking ahead, CRU International (“CRU”) expects crude steel 
production to increase to over 2,000Mt by 2021. 
Developing regions will continue to drive the bulk of this 
growth, with strong expectations for expansion in the Middle 
East, South America and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS). The majority of new steel production, however, 
will come from Asia. Signiﬁcant amounts of new capacity will 
come on stream in China, where crude steel production 
capacity is expected to increase by 60Mt this year. 
Iron ore demand and supply 
China
Iron ore demand in China stalled in the second half of 2011. 
Once steel prices began to fall in earnest during the last 
quarter of 2011, the drop in real ore demand was accentuated 
by sharp destocking, which drove down ore prices and 
decreased import volumes. Looking ahead to 2012, the CRU 
base case economic forecast predicts trends supportive of 
higher steel consumption, bringing with it rising iron ore 
consumption and advances in demand for imported ore. 
However, CRU notes that there are downside risks to these 
forecasts due to uncertainty in the European Market. 
The Middle East
The Middle East should be one of the fastest growing ore 
importing regions over the medium term, which could very well 
beneﬁt London Mining. Steel consumption should continue to 
increase due to strong energy prices resulting in demand for oil 
and gas pipelines and a signiﬁcant expansion in regional DRI 
capacity, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. CRU forecast 
this to add 17Mt to seaborne iron ore trade by 2015, in 
particular in pellets and pellet feed.

Western Europe
Iron ore consumption in Western Europe slowed dramatically 
in the latter half of 2011, with at least nine blast furnaces idled 
across the region. Nonetheless, CRU expects iron ore demand 
to remain stable, with imports of ore in 2012 estimated to be 
virtually identical to 2011 at 110Mt. Slight improvements are 
expected by 2015, as imports increase to 120Mt per year.  
We expect the proximity of our Marampa mine in Sierra Leone 
to the European market as well as its product speciﬁcation to 
allow us to penetrate this market in the medium term. In January 
2011 we entered into an agreement with Glencore to sell the 
ﬁrst 1.8Mtpa of production from Marampa on to the seaborne 
market. The agreement assumes that sales will primarily be 
directed into China, with upside on pricing if the product is 
placed into the European market.
The longer term outlook
Looking further ahead, CRU estimates global iron ore 
consumption will increase by c380Mtpa over the period 2015 
and 2021. This is equivalent to an expected Compound Annual 
Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 3.6% over the period 2011 to 2021, 
following predicted steel production growth of c680Mtpa 
between 2011 and 2021.
The net effect is that global seaborne trade is expected to 
expand by 4% in 2012 and to maintain a consistent growth rate 
over the medium term of around 6–9% per year. 
With Chinese domestic ore supply clearly constrained despite 
high prices, any further increases in demand over the medium 
term are likely to feed through directly to import demand. 
Indeed, the constraints on domestic ore supply mean that 
import demand is likely to remain above the underlying rate 
of growth in iron ore consumption. 
CRU forecasts growth in global iron ore production of 75Mt 
over the coming year, equivalent to 4.1% growth year-on-year. 
This growth is forecast to come mostly from Brazil and 
Australia but also West Africa. India is forecast to show a 26Mt 
decrease. CRU’s production forecast for Australia could prove 
to be too high, given the proposed mining tax. The 30% tax, for 
which the ﬁnal go-ahead will be given in 2012, may deter 
investors from Australian projects. 18

Further signiﬁcant growth in production is expected in West 
Africa in 2012. By 2015, CRU predicts total exports of around 
26Mt (excluding Mauritania’s output). On a global scale, these 
volumes are modest. However, we expect greater increases 
beyond 2015 from several of the large diversiﬁed miners. This will 
potentially have a material impact on the global market balance. 
By 2015, CRU expects global exports of iron ore to reach 
almost 1.5 billion tonnes. Pellet supply will continue to be 
dominated by Brazil, with signiﬁcant growth from the Middle 
East. Lump exports, which are set for slower growth, will 
primarily originate from Australia, Brazil and South Africa. CRU 
estimates pellet production will increase from 434Mt in 2011 
to 574Mt in 2015, while lump production should increase from 
238Mt in 2011 to 287Mt in 2015.
Looking to the longer term, CRU remains bullish about Chinese 
ore consumption to 2015 as Chinese ore imports are still 
expected to advance signiﬁcantly and at a signiﬁcantly faster 
pace than in 2010/11. CRU forecasts that by 2015 Chinese 
imports will increase by 324Mt to almost 1 billion tonnes, nearly 
50% higher than in 2011. Growth in Chinese imports should 
be augmented by higher imports across much of the rest of 
Asia and the Middle East. Notwithstanding likely weakness 
in European and Japanese demand going forward, global 
seaborne trade in iron ore is expected to advance by around 
350Mt by 2015.

CRU believes supply will need to ramp up by approximately 
380Mt over the next four years, implying that both Australia 
and Brazil will increase their share of global exports over the 
medium term. New supply from West Africa, including our 
Marampa mine in Sierra Leone, will also be in a position to 
displace higher cost and lower grade ore supply, adding some 
40Mt tonnes to global production. Much of the displaced high 
cost supply is likely to be from China, where CRU expects 
effective ore supply to decline by 20% from 2011 to 2015, 
equivalent to 370Mt. 
Marampa – delivering a new source of high quality  
iron ore supply 
We estimate Marampa’s 2015 site-level costs to be higher than 
the top quartile existing producers but signiﬁcantly lower than 
high cost producers, predominantly located in India and China. 
Nevertheless, a number of other factors will also affect the 
relative competitiveness of the project, including freight costs, 
marketing costs and value-in-use. Freight costs are important in 
the case of bulk commodities such as iron ore and depend on 
the location of the ﬁnal consumer. Regarding value-in-use, we 
expect to receive a higher price for Marampa’s product than the 
benchmark price (62% ﬁnes delivered to China) chieﬂy due to 
its high iron content (66%) but also because of lower impurities.
Marampa’s position on cost curve
 
New supply from West Africa including our 
Marampa mine will displace higher cost and 
lower grade supply. 20

History
We started production at our Marampa mine in December 
2011. Marampa was formerly operated by the Sierra Leone 
Development Company and William Baird between 1933 and 
1975. It reached a peak production of 2.5Mtpa in the 1960s 
before low iron ore prices forced its closure. Continuing weak 
market economics, outdated processing technology and civil 
war prevented redevelopment of the mine for over 30 years, 
until we acquired the mining licence in 2006.

Marampa, location and logistics
the total capital expenditure for the ﬁrst 5Mtpa of production is 
estimated to be USD 310 million, equivalent to installed capital 
intensity of USD 62/annual tonne of capacity which is very low 
compared to industry norms. 
During the total Phase 1 development, in addition to the capital 
cost, London Mining will incur and expects to capitalise USD 25 
million owners’ team construction salaries, of which USD 14.7 
million had been capitalised at year end, and also as required 
by international accounting standards, London Mining will 
capitalise all direct preproduction operating overheads prior to 
reaching commercial production. Separately, the USD 21 million 
installed cost for the “Pride of Marampa” FOTP has been 
funded through a USD 19.0 million ﬁnance lease arrangement 
with Oldendorff Carriers GmbH and Co. KG with the balance 
ﬁnanced by London Mining.
The key logistics for Marampa are now in place for a 5Mtpa 
operation. The haul road has been activated and the trucking 
ﬂeet has operated at a run rate of approximately 5kt/day and a 
stockpile established at Thofeyim. Commissioning of the FOTP 
commenced in March 2012. Once installed the FOTP will 
provide transhipping capacity of up to 20kt/day.
Pricing
By mid-March we had shipped 243,190wmt of concentrates in 
ﬁve supramax vessels through Glencore to both Chinese and 
European customers and have realised a signiﬁcant quality-
related premium to the Platts 62% cfr China benchmark after 
an adjustment for freight and marketing.
Expanding in stages
We plan to develop Marampa in two phases. In Phase 1 we 
are processing tailings from previous operations with highly 
weathered ore to produce 5Mtpa of premium sinter 
concentrate at a total estimated capital cost of USD 310 
million. We are considering a plan to expand production from 
this plant to 9Mtpa – the BFS will be completed in Q3 2012. 
An ultimate expansion to over 16Mtpa was considered in PFS 
completed in April 2011. 
Constructing, commissioning and ramping up Phase 1 
Production from Marampa’s ﬁrst processing plant began in 
December 2011 and we are ramping up to the initial nameplate 
capacity of 125kt/month or 1.5Mtpa. At 26 March a total of 
271,892wmt had been produced from the Marampa plant in 
accordance with ramp up plans. The integration of a grinding 
circuit in Q3 2012 will increase production further to 150kt/
month and addition of a gravity circuit will enable a further 
increase in the nameplate capacity to over 200kt/month. A 
second identical plant will be constructed in 2012 for 
commissioning in Q1 2013, resulting in combined installed 
capacity of 5Mtpa. We expect production to be 1.5Mt in 2012, 
4.2Mt in 2013 and 5Mt in 2014. 
The preproduction capital expenditure was USD 168 million. 
Capital expenditure for the installation of the second plant and 
processing optimisation (including retroﬁtting of milling and 
gravity circuits in the ﬁrst plant) is expected to be USD 92 
million. With further expenditure to increase plant efﬁciency 
and to upgrade and improve logistics of USD 40 to 50 million  24

Improving production
We have been able to signiﬁcantly improve the production plan 
for Marampa following an upgrade in resources and the results 
of metallurgical test work undertaken for the expansion BFS. 
Following the completion of the 90,000m diamond drilling 
campaign, a further 54Mt of weathered ore was delineated in 
December 2011, representing a 350% increase in the previous 
estimate. In addition it was shown that the inclusion of a gravity 
circuit to the Phase 1 ﬂow sheet would increase capacity from 
3.6Mtpa to 5Mtpa.
Increasing Indicated resources
We undertook a further 35,000m of drilling during 2011, 
concluding our 90,000m campaign in July 2011. This resulted in 
a 109% increase in Indicated resources over the year, forming 
the basis for completion of the Marampa BFS in Q2 2012. More 
signiﬁcantly, the addition of a further 54Mt of highly weathered 
material can be considered in the Phase 1 mine plan. 
By mid March we had shipped 243,190wMt of concentrates in 
ﬁve supramax vessels through Glencore to both Chinese and 
European customers and have realised a signiﬁcant quality-related 
premium to the Platts 62% cfr China benchmark after an 
adjustment for freight. 
Expanding to 9Mtpa and over 16Mtpa
A BFS for an expansion of the Phase 1 plant to 9Mtpa will be 
completed in Q3 2012. The study will consider the processing 
of all weathered resources and the reconﬁguration of the plant 
to handle harder unweathered material after approximately eight 
years of operations. The work builds on the PFS completed in 
April 2011 which considered a three-stage development of 
Marampa, with an ultimate installed capacity of 16Mtpa. 
Reviewing ﬁscal incentives
We engaged with a Government of Sierra Leone sponsored 
committee to consider changes to the ﬁscal agreement 
previously ratiﬁed by Parliament as part of the February 2010 
Mining Lease Agreement (“MLA”). The new MLA was ratiﬁed 
by Parliament on 27 March 2012. 
The original MLA set a ﬁscal regime for ﬁve years, starting 
1 January 2010 and the recent negotiations permitted the ﬁxing 
of a ﬁscal regime for a 10 year period, starting 1 January 2011. 
This provides a clear stable platform for long term growth 
as we look to accelerate the expansion and development 
of the mine to reach our targeted production of over 16Mtpa. 
Although the corporate tax rate has increased to 25% from 
6%, from 1 January 2014, a year earlier than envisaged in the 
2010 MLA, there has been no material change to the valuation 
of the overall project and development continues as planned. 
The ﬁscal regime set for the extended period, as expected, is 
largely in line with ﬁscal concessions granted to other 
developing mining companies in the country, incentivises early 
reinvestment of proﬁts to expand and encourages sustainable 
long term investment in Sierra Leone. Performance

Marampa, Sierra Leone 
Gaining and managing environmental permits
We received our full environmental permit for Marampa at the 
beginning of January 2011. The permit was issued following 
the formal approval and acceptance by the Sierra Leone 
Environmental Protection Agency (“SLEPA”) of London 
Mining’s Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”). The EIA 
was discussed openly via four public hearings in Sierra Leone, 
which were attended by members of the public and NGOs. 
The permit is subject to an administrative annual renewal by 
SLEPA, which requires ongoing environmental compliance in 
accordance with the Sierra Leone Environmental Act 2008 
and the payment of an annual fee. The EIA meets all local 
regulations and we are working with an internationally 
recognised environmental consultant to ensure compliance 
with international best practice.
Hedging, offtake and marketing
On 28 March 2012, we signed a USD 45 million prepayment 
agreement with the Vitol Group regarding the offtake of  
2Mwmt of iron ore per annum over ﬁve years, commencing in 
2013 in parallel with London Mining’s ramp up in production to 
5Mtpa. Pricing will be based off the Platts 63.5/63% Index and 
will include a premium to reﬂect the Fe content of the product. 
Subject to certain additional conditions being met, the facility 
may be increased to USD 55 million, and the offtake contract 
extended for a further year. The facility is repayable in two 
tranches over three and ﬁve years respectively, with no 
payments due in the ﬁrst 12 months.
We signed an offtake agreement for Marampa with the trading 
house Glencore on 26 January 2011. The offtake covered  
9.5Mwmt production from Phase 1. The ﬁve year agreement 
included a prepayment facility for up to USD 27.0 million and 
provides guaranteed offtake and shipping from Sierra Leone for 
the ﬁrst 1.8Mtpa of production. The off-take is based on Platts 
62% cfr China benchmark, with an upward adjustment for the 
Fe content of our 65% Fe sinter feed concentrate, and an 
incentive to place product at locations such as Europe where 
there is a net pricing beneﬁt through lower shipping costs. The 
agreement accommodates our ramp up expectations and is 
ﬂexible to accommodate varying shipping sizes and frequencies 
to supply European, Chinese and other markets.
As part of our debt ﬁnance facility with Standard Chartered Bank 
we hedged 513kt of our 2012 production at USD 148/t referenced 
to 62% Fe China. This price excludes the grade-related premium 
and freight.  26

Premium quality potential
Located 150km north-east of Nuuk and 110km from a 
proposed deep seawater port, Isua will produce a premium 
quality 70% Fe pellet feed concentrate with low impurities. Isua 
beneﬁts from its position in the warmer south-west corner of 
Greenland which allows for year-round shipping. 
In February 2011 we released the results of a scoping study 
compiled by SNC Lavalin International Inc. (“SLII”), for the Isua 
iron ore project in Greenland. The scoping study considered an 
initial 15 year mine life with 15Mtpa open pit, processing plant, 
pipeline and a deep water port.
A BFS with AACE Class 3 estimates for a 15Mtpa operation 
was completed in March 2012. A 10 year mine life based 
on the currently available amount of Indicated resources 
was considered. A 15 year scenario was also evaluated 
to demonstrate the greater potential of the asset. The BFS 
supports the initial ﬁndings of the scoping study, provides a 
more accurate estimate of cost and provides the foundation 
to ﬁnance and construct a mine at Isua. The detailed results 
of the BFS for the next stage of the project are outlined below.
Resources and mine life
As part of the BFS program, 7,656m of drilling was completed 
during the summer of 2011 which forms the basis for an 
updated resource statement. Snowden Mining Industry 
Consultants “Snowden” now estimate a total resource for 
Isua of 1,107Mt grading 32.3% Fe. This improved result has 
increased the resource by 10% in resource tonnage from the 
March 2011 resource statement. The modest reduction in Fe 
grade is the result of the decision to report internally diluted 
head grades due to incorporation of waste bearing structures 
in the block model rather than consideration of a selective 
mining method. Performance

The new resource represents a substantial 82% increase in 
Indicated resources from 209Mt to 380Mt which is sufﬁcient 
to support a 10 year mine life. Potential to extend the mine life 
could be achieved though further drilling necessary to convert 
Inferred resources into the Indicated category.

Potential for additional resource
The 201 1 drilling campaign also conﬁrmed additional mineral 
resource potential originally identiﬁed by Rio Tinto in 1997. This area 
of mineralisation potential is the down dip extrapolation of the Isua 
banded iron formation (“BIF”). An area of hematite BIF interpreted at 
the top of the BIF unit forms part of this potential. This area appears 
to be underlain by the more typical magnetite BIF.

BFS results 
The March 2012 BFS considers a 15Mtpa operation with a 
mine life of 10 years. The main changes, when compared with 
the February 2011 scoping study are the reduced mine life as 
well as increased, albeit more accurate, operating costs and 
capital expenditure.
The mine life of 10 years is based on the current availability  
of Indicated resources whereas the scoping study included 
Inferred resources in its 15 year mine plan. Snowden expects 
further Indicated resources could be deﬁned if additional inﬁll 
drilling were undertaken.
The operating cost estimates have increased from an average 
of USD 30/t to an average of USD 46/t principally as a result 
of anticipated increased power consumption based on more 
representative testwork indicating greater hardness of Isua ore 
than previously considered. The strip ratio has also increased 
as Inferred resources in the pit are now considered as waste 
rather than ore in the February scoping study.
Capital expenditure for the project is now estimated at USD 2.350 
billion. This represents an increase of 15% from the February 201 1 
scoping study which estimated the capital cost for a 15Mtpa 
operation to be USD 2.05 billion. The capital estimate is however 
constrained within a much narrower degree of conﬁdence,  
+/– 15% versus –30%/+40% based on more detailed analysis.
Testwork by SGS Lakeﬁeld has conﬁrmed the ﬁnal pellet feed 
product from Isua to be a premium quality blast furnace grade 
pellet feed with 70.2% of Fe and less than 2.0% Silica (SiO
2
) 
and Alumina (Al
2
O
3
). Sulphur levels will be either 0.12% or 
0.3% depending on the grade of sulphur in the ore processed. 
Financial analysis
Two pricing scenarios were considered in the study. The base 
case scenario considers the sale of 5Mtpa of low sulphur pellet 
feed into Europe and 10Mtpa of higher sulphur product into China 
with a more conservative case assuming the sale of all products 
into China. Long term market study and price forecasts were 
undertaken by Raw Materials Group (“RMG”). RMG assume a 
conservative premium of USD 3 per Fe unit above benchmark with 
freight costs of USD 34/wmt for capesize shipping to China and 
USD 9/wmt into Europe. Three scenarios were considered for the 
purposes of ﬁnancial modelling. The base case scenario assumes 
a 10 year mine life and pricing based on sales of product into both 
Europe and China. Two further scenarios were considered both 
incorporating Inferred resources into the mineable resource to 
achieve a 15 year mine life. One of these scenarios assumed the 
sale of all products into China. The results are shown below.

Entering into a royalty agreement with Anglo Paciﬁc
In August 2011, we announced that we had entered into a 
royalty agreement with Anglo Paciﬁc Group Plc (“Anglo 
Paciﬁc”) regarding future iron ore production at Isua. Under 
the terms of the royalty agreement, Anglo Paciﬁc paid USD 30 
million to our subsidiary London Mining Greenland (received 
in August 2011) in return for 1% royalty over all consideration 
received from the sale of iron ore concentrate from Isua. We 
used this money primarily to fund the completion of the BFS on 
Isua. If we do not fulﬁl certain milestones, of which the earliest 
was the completion of a BFS by no later than 31 December 
2012, Anglo Paciﬁc can demand repayment of the USD 30.0 
million. We can make this repayment in cash or London Mining 
shares at our discretion.
Next steps – permitting and ﬁnancing
In order to apply for conversion of its existing exploration licence, 
we are also required to complete an EIA, a Social Impact 
Assessment ‘(SIA)’ and a Closure Plan which have been prepared 
in parallel with the BFS report. We are preparing to commence the 
permitting process, which includes a technical review and public 
hearing by the Greenland Government. This process is expected 
to take six months to complete. At the same time, we will continue 
to look at all ﬁnancing options to develop the project. Once 
ﬁnancing has been agreed, the EPCM phase will start and 
construction will begin.  Performance

London Mining acquired the remaining 80% of its Colombian 
operations in March 2010, and has been constructing coking 
coal ovens in the Boyaca region of Colombia and conducting 
exploration in the surrounding area and other prospective regions.
We continue to pursue our aim to develop an integrated coking 
coal and coke operation in Colombia. During 2011, we 
completed our ﬁrst coke ovens in Boyaca, and are continuing 
with construction to achieve a total oven capacity of 200ktpa 
by Q4 2012. Coking coal stocks have started to be acquired, 
and supply contracts put in place to provide the coking coal to 
feed the ovens. A logistics solution to the port of Barranquilla 
has been developed and port capacity in Barranquilla has been 
secured for up to 400ktpa of exports over time. The operation 
is focusing on the oven build out, ramping up production, 
optimising product speciﬁcation and commencing transport 
of coke by road to Barranquilla.
Exploration has been ongoing, with the focus on four concessions 
in the Socha region close to our ovens. In 2011 over 10,000m of 
drilling was completed, and we expect to announce a coking coal 
resource in 2012. The coking coal resources are being deﬁned, 
which will allow for the development and construction in the 
future of low and mid volatility coking coal mines to provide 
feedstock for the coke ovens. Vertical integration will enable us  
to capture increased margins and allow for greater control of the 
process and product quality, and in addition will facilitate the 
expansion to 400ktpa oven capacity.
We have built up a strong platform in Colombia, with a full 
operations team for the ovens and a strong group of geologists 
undertaking exploration, backed up by the country ofﬁce in 
Bogota. We have been on the ground in Colombia for over four 
years and have developed a network of relationships which will 
drive forward the growth of the business through identifying 
proﬁtable opportunities. 
We recorded a USD 10.1 million impairment to goodwill in 
relation to our Colombia operations as a result of delays to 
production and increased capital cost caused by heavy rains, 
landslides, road blockages and certain design changes.

The Wadi Sawawin project is located in the north-west corner 
of Saudi Arabia, 125km from Tabuk and 60km from the Red 
Sea port of Duba. Wadi Sawawin is of strategic and economic 
importance to Saudi Arabia as it will provide a domestic source 
of Direct Reduction (“DR”) pellets for use in the DRI steel 
plants which account for 90% of steel production in the Middle 
East and North African region. Wadi Sawawin’s location will 
provide it with a competitive advantage over competing 
Brazilian and European supply thanks to reduced freight rates 
from its deep water port in the Red Sea and access to low cost 
Saudi Arabian energy. In addition, the project will assist with 
the program to diversify the economy which is an important 
element of Saudi Arabian economic policy. The government is 
expected to provide low cost funding via the Public Investment 
Fund (“PIF”) and Saudi Investment Development Fund.
Following the successful completion of a BFS in June 2010,  
we have been working with our joint venture partners NMC to 
secure the necessary ﬁnance to construct the Wadi Sawawin 
iron ore complex. On 19th November 2011, NMC signed an 
agreement with STX Heavy Industries (“STX”) of Korea to carry 
out the Front End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) works to 
conclude the ﬁnal estimates and the total installed cost and to 
continue the program of assistance to arrange full ﬁnancing for 
Wadi Sawawin. We are working with STX to undertake the ﬁnal

EBITDA
EBITDA loss for the year increased by USD 9.1 million to USD 
40.5 million, (2010: USD 31.4 million). The increase was the 
result of: higher corporate costs (USD 4.2 million) due to 
increased head count, project travel and legal costs; increased 
activity at Marampa (USD 2.6 million) as operations ramp up; 
increased Isua costs (USD 0.7 million) as BFS work was being 
undertaken; increased Colombia cost (USD 2.0 million) 
reﬂecting a full year’s consolidation and higher activity; offset 
by lower activity at the Saudi project (USD 0.3 million). 
EBITDA comprises Group administration expenses excluding 
depreciation and including:
• USD 4.6 million (2010: USD 3.9 million) key management 
remuneration. The increase is due to an increase in salaries, 
bonuses and an increase in the size of the Board.
• USD 10.7 million (2010: USD 5.4 million) other staff costs. 
The increase results from higher staff count across all key 
locations as the Group transforms from developer to operator.
• USD 2.0 million (2010: USD 4.7 million) non-cash share 
based payment and return bonus plan charges, the decrease 
being the result of options and awards having vested in 
previous years.
• USD 10.5 million (2010: USD 7.0 million) consulting and legal 
fees. The increase reﬂects in particular fundraising activity during 
the year. During 201 1 the Group opened a China representative 
ofﬁce at an expected annual running cost of USD 1.0 million. In 
addition, 201 1 also includes an expensed one off item of USD 
2.0 million in respect of loans and litigation costs associated 
with the Group’s investment in China (written down to a carrying 
value of USD nil for the year ended 31 December 2010). 
• USD 3.5 million project travel costs (2010: USD 3.1 million).
• USD 4.8 million other operating Sierra Leone overheads 
(2010: USD 4.0 million) increasing as the operation moved 
into production during the year. 32
London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
Impairment and fair value gain on deferred consideration
The Group has recorded a USD 10.1 million impairment to 
goodwill in relation to the Colombia project as a result of delays 
to production and increased capital cost caused by heavy 
rains, landslides and road blockages and certain design 
changes. These operational issues have also contributed to  
the recognition of a USD 14.7 million fair value gain in the 
income statement for deferred consideration that was released 
because it is no longer assessed as being payable. At the  
time of acquisition deferred consideration was previously 
recognised in goodwill at a value of USD 10.1 million which  
has now been released. See note 9 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Management’s focus is to optimise the operating performance 
and design of the Phase 1 ovens (200ktpa) prior to an 
assessment of an expansion to increase production to 400ktpa.
A further impairment charge of USD 3.3 million has been made 
to assets held for sale in relation to the DMC investment which 
brings the residual carrying value to USD nil. At 31 December 
2010 the investment was held at a carrying value of USD 28.1 
million and in October 2011 the Group received cash proceeds 
of USD 24.8 million from the sale of DMC shares. Management 
continues to pursue further recovery of the investment up to 
an additional USD 15.2 million under a downside protection 
agreement signed with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer of DMC but due to the uncertainty around the 
timing of the recovery, has determined to impair the residual 
carrying value of USD 3.3 million.
Taxation
A tax charge of USD 18.4 million has arisen on the recognition 
of a deferred tax liability of USD 27.3 million for accelerated 
capital allowances in Sierra Leone due to differences in the 
tax rates between deduction and realisation. This is largely 
due to the revised tax rates in the new MLA, increasing the 
corporation tax rate from 6% (when tax allowances are taken)
to 25% (when timing differences reverse) with effect from 
1 January 2014. This has been partially offset by the recognition 
of deferred tax assets for carry forward losses in Sierra Leone, 
(USD 6.7 million) and Colombia, (USD 2.2 million) which are 
expected to be utilised against future taxable proﬁts.

Paciﬁc, see below. 
In addition there has been continued development at the 
Colombia project with USD 16.1 million additions in respect of 
the oven project (ﬁrst production achieved January 2012) and 
ongoing exploration of coal licences (USD 6.3 million) – prior 
to the impairment of USD 10.1 million noted above.

i)  Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables at 31 December 2011 include  
USD 11.2 million in relation to the acquisition of the FOTP, 
“Pride of Marampa”, which was paid and ﬁnanced in January 
2012 following the receipt of proceeds of USD 18.4 million from 
the ﬁnance lease agreement signed with Oldendorff, (see note 
34 to the ﬁnancial statements). Also included are prepayments 
for Marampa sales of USD 8.1 million under the terms of the 
facility provided by Glencore. The remaining balance relates 
largely to outstanding creditors for the Phase 1a construction 
project at Marampa which was completed at the end of the year. 
ii) Borrowings
During the year the Group issued unsecured convertible loan notes 
with a par value of USD 1 10.0 million and made a drawdown of 
USD 90.0 million from a secured revolving credit facility held with 
Standard Chartered Bank. The facility tenure is for two years, 
ending in October 2012, with an extension option of 12 months. 
The ability to exercise the extension is subject to certain conditions 
which are under management’s control, in addition to credit 
committee approval from Standard Chartered Bank. Although 
management expects to receive the necessary credit approval and 
roll the loan for 12 months, the loan is presented as current liability 
in accordance with International Accounting Standards. Full details 
of borrowings are provided in note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements.

iii) Deferred consideration payable
The USD 10.6 million of deferred consideration relates to the 
acquisition of Colombia and comprises potential deferred cash 
and non-cash share consideration, the vesting of which are 
subject to performance milestones. Following delayed production 
and other operational matters, the fair value of consideration 
payable has reduced, see note 9 to the ﬁnancial statements. 
iv) Deferred tax and provisions
A net deferred tax liability of USD 19.4 million has been 
recognised in Sierra Leone, comprising of accelerated capital 
allowances of USD 27.3 million, net of a deferred tax asset 
of USD 6.7 million for carry forward losses. A restoration 
and decommissioning provision of USD 1.4 million has been 
recorded representing the present value of closure costs 
at the end of the Sierra Leone mine life.
v) Other non-current liabilities
In August 2011 the Group entered into a royalty agreement 
with Anglo Paciﬁc regarding the Isua project in Greenland. 
Under the terms the Group received gross proceeds of USD 
30.0 million in return for 1% royalty over all sales of iron ore 
concentrate from the project. The USD 30.0 million has no 
interest accruing and is only repayable if certain development 
milestone targets are not met. Upon commercial production the 
liability will be extinguished and treated as a partial disposal of 
the Group’s economic interest in the project, in consideration 
of a royalty.

Cash outﬂow from operating activities was USD 34.4 million, an 
increase of USD 4.9 million. This increase primarily related to an 
increased EBITDA loss due to higher activity across key projects 
as noted above, as well as build up of inventory at Marampa and 
Colombia prior to ﬁrst commercial revenues expected in Q1 2012. 
This has been offset by an increase in payables, which includes 
USD 8.1 million of prepaid revenue in respect of Marampa sales, 
(under the terms of the Glencore facility agreement).
ii) Investing activities
Net cash ﬂow from investing activities was USD 192.9 million  
(2010: USD 98.1 million). Included in this amount is the receipt 
of proceeds of USD 24.8 million from the sale of the DMC assets 
held for sale. Capital investment in projects was USD 21 7.6 million 
and included:
• USD 166.6 million for the Marampa project.
• USD 26.3 million for the Isua project BFS.
• USD 20.8 million for Colombia development covering the oven 
project (USD 14.5 million) and exploration (USD 6.3 million).

iii) Financing activities
During 2011 the Group had net cash inﬂow from ﬁnancing 
activities of USD 218.4 million (2010: outﬂow USD 0.4 million). 
The source of ﬁnancing during the year included:
• USD 105.1 million net proceeds from the convertible bond 
raise in January 2011;
• USD 87.3 million net proceeds from the credit facility with 
Standard Chartered Bank;
• USD 28.4 million net proceeds from the royalty agreement 
signed with Anglo Paciﬁc;
• USD 2.1 million recovery of stamp duty, paid in respect of the 
Oslo listing; less
• (USD 4.9 million) interest expense including USD 4.4 million 
interest paid in relation to convertible loan notes.
4. Liquidity and going concern
At 31 December 201 1 the Group had cash on hand of 
USD 67.8 million. In 2012 London Mining has received further 
funding from an equity placing of USD 87.3 million (net after fees), 
USD 18.4 million from a ﬁnance lease facility and USD 45 million 
offtake prepayment agreement with Vitol Group, signed on 
28 March 2012. 
London Mining has sufﬁcient cash resources to; accelerate 
Marampa Phase 1 production to 5Mtpa (with target production of 
1.5Mt in 2012 and 4.2Mt in 2013); to fund the Marampa Phase 1 
BFS for an expansion to 9Mtpa and for initial coke production and 
exploration activity in Colombia. 
Project funding for the more capital intensive projects in Greenland 
and Saudi Arabia will be sought from external sources into these 
projects directly, with ﬁnancial and strategic partners being considered. 
During 201 1 management drew down its entire USD 90.0 million 
credit facility with Standard Chartered Bank. The facility tenure 
is for two years, ending on 31 October 2012, with an extension 
option of 12 months. The ability to exercise the extension option 
is subject to certain conditions which are under management’s and 
USD 45 million offtake prepayment agreement with Vitol Group, 
signed on 28 March 2012.
control, in addition to Standard Chartered Bank’s credit committee 
approval. Management expects to receive the necessary credit 
approval from the lender to extend the facility, due to forecast cash 
generation and proﬁtability at the Sierra Leone operations in the 
second half of 2012 and into 2013. In the unlikely event consent is 
not given by the lenders to the extension, the loan would become 
repayable in October 2012 and management would need to seek 
alternative solutions to reﬁnance the facility, such as additional 
offtake, or debt funding, at that time.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the 
timing of project commissioning, show that the Group has 
sufﬁcient committed liquidity to fund its committed expenditure, 
that all relevant covenants on its Standard Chartered Bank facility 
will be met and that it will be able to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Group 
continues to adopt the going concern basis.
5. Treasury management and ﬁnancial instruments
A condition of entering into the SCB facility, (fully drawndown in 
201 1) required the Group to enter into a commodity price derivative 
representing one third of 2012 production (513Kt). It remains 
Group policy not to hedge commodity prices other than for 
speciﬁc strategic reasons including the securing of ﬁnancing. 
Details of treasury management and ﬁnancial instruments are 
disclosed within note 31 to the ﬁnancial statements.

Sustainability at London Mining 
 
Recognising the importance of sustainability
We are looking to the future and how we will live and work together 
with the communities and organisations around our operations 
now and in the years ahead. We recognise the importance of 
exploring fully all the options that will enable us to meet our long 
term responsibility for our resources and surroundings. This 
genuine commitment to sustainability is a key part of the way we 
will contribute, endure and prosper.
We carefully manage the environmental, economic and social 
dimensions of our operations to ensure sustainable outcomes. 
Healthy environments provide the foundation for vital goods 
and services. Sustainable economics support future ﬁnancial 
actions. Social sustainability reinforces the acceptability of our 
operations to local and global communities.
We also focus on the health, safety and environment (“HSE”) 
aspect of our mining operations. We manage this as a separate 
area of sustainability as we recognise the importance and 
speciﬁc requirements of keeping our workforce safe and able 
to continue their daily tasks.
Developing and implementing a sustainability 
framework for London Mining 
In 201 1 we appointed Claude Perras as Head of Sustainability. The 
purpose of his role is to develop a Group-level sustainability vision, 
framework and governance process. The framework will enable us 
to provide greater oversight and, in turn, control of our resources at 
both corporate and project levels. It will also increase our ability to 
predict and deal with both risk and opportunity, while maintaining 
the drive and focus of the individuals and teams around the world.
As we continue to develop our mining assets, 
we are ever more aware of how important 
sustainability is to our operations. It is at the 
heart of how we develop a lasting business, 
make a long term contribution and deliver value.

We have begun to implement the framework by putting into

to help our employees ensure all actions are in line with 
Group strategy. 
The proposed governance structure will consist of a corporate 
sustainability advisory committee, with members from the Board 
and representatives from civil society. A similar advisory committee 
will also be established in each country of operations. 
Social 
Marampa, Sierra Leone 
We believe engaging stakeholders is crucial to the success  
of every project. To this end, at Marampa we manage our 
communication channels with local communities through a 
dedicated steering committee made up of representatives from 
major demographic groups in the region. The committee meets 
regularly to discuss any issues they are experiencing and to 
learn about the project’s development. This two-way exchange 
of information is very important for both parties. It helps both 
sides gain a better understanding of the mutual risks and 
opportunities surrounding the project. This allows for a more 
open and ﬂexible working relationship with the local communities. 
We have also set up a public information centre in the 
neighbouring town of Lunsar where people are able to access 
information about our operations.
We are constantly looking for practical ways to increase the 
local content of all our projects. We currently employ around 
1,200 local people at the mine site and our ofﬁce in Freetown. 
We are training and improving the skills of our employees to 
ensure a sustainable future work force for the mine while 
creating a newly skilled generation of Sierra Leoneans to fuel 
the country’s growing economy. We have also modiﬁed our

procurement processes in order to enable local businesses to 
have increased ability with larger international organisations to 
supply the site. This has included breaking down larger orders 
into smaller, more manageable pieces and reducing the 
turnaround time for invoices to allow for smaller businesses 
with tighter working capital considerations.
To assist in the educational needs of the local communities,  
we have created scholarship programmes in schools within the 
Marampa and Maforki Chiefdoms in Port Loko. In all, over 750 
scholarships have been awarded to children in both primary 
and secondary schools in the chiefdoms. Beneﬁciaries were 
selected on the basis of their family circumstances and/or 
academic performance.
Isua, Greenland
Since 2009 to 2011, we consulted Greenlandic local 
communities, civil organisations and governmental agencies as 
part of a comprehensive communication plan. It involved a wide 
range of communications tools, formats and actions, including:
• Field workshops with local communities, civil organisations 
and governmental agencies;
• Public information meetings covered by the local media;
• A dedicated London Mining website for the Greenland and Isua 
project, where technical reports are made available to the public;
• A public information centre which we set up in the capital city 
of Nuuk, where people are invited to obtain project 
information in Greenlandic and other languages; and
• Isua Advisory Committee which we set up to gather leaders 
of local civil organisations such as Labour Union, Fishermen’s 
Association, Employers’ Association and others.
We will present the details of these consultations to the 
Bureau of Metals and Petroleum in a SIA which is expected 
in Q2 2012. 
The issues raised in this report will be monitored, recorded  
and communicated with stakeholders throughout the life of the 
mine. This will help us ensure that local communities are kept 
up to date with operations so they can better understand what 
is happening at the mine site. This two-way ﬂow of information 
will help to secure our social license and help keep operations 
running smoothly.
Colombia
We are planning a study into the feasibility of supporting local 
businesses to build new accommodation in Socha, Colombia that 
can be leased to mine staff. Currently there is a shortage of 
accommodation near the mine site, so workers have to spend a 
long time travelling between the site and lodgings. The aim is to 
work together to produce a solution that beneﬁts everyone going 
forward – the local businesses, our business and our people. 
In close coordination with government and donors, we aim to 
develop a skill and vocational training program to meet labour 
requirements for the next ﬁve years in line with our local 
employment policy.
Environmental
Marampa, Sierra Leone
We carry out thorough environmental monitoring to ensure any 
changes resulting from the mining operations would be quickly 
discovered and can be acted upon to minimise the disturbance 
to local habitats and communities.
We take weekly water samples at 26 sites around the concession. 
The sites have been chosen in collaboration with the Community 
Relations team to ensure that representative samples are taken 
with respect to possible effects on local people and their farm land. 
The samples are thoroughly tested for any chemical or physical 
changes. To date, only two samples have been shown to be 
inﬂuenced by our operations and we have taken the relevant 
actions to rectify the changes identiﬁed by the sample.
We monitor ambient dust around the site, haul road and 
surrounding areas. All readings have been below international 
standards but dust monitoring and dampening remains an area 
of focus during the dry season.
Isua, Greenland
We have completed two full seasons of baseline data collection 
at Isua targeting the following areas: mine rock geochemistry 
and lake water chemistry, hydrology, meteorology, studies on 
glacier and sea ice, regional biodiversity, archaeology and local 
socio-economic systems. This will ensure we can base our 
future monitoring on reliable data. We will be able to detect any 
impacts quickly and conﬁdently, which in turn will allow us to 
react promptly and appropriately and to continue operating in 
such a sensitive environment.
Colombia
Colombia is the most progressive country on climate change in 
Latin America and the green growth agenda is a key priority for 
the Colombian Government. We have signed up for the Guia 
Del Sistema de Seguridad, Salud Ocupational y Ambiente para 
Contratista of the Consejo Colombiano de Seguridad, which 
includes guidance on environmental practices. A detailed 
project ESIA will be carried out in 2012 and will be submitted 
to our management as soon as possible to ensure any 
environmental and social impacts are addressed quickly and 
in line with international best practice. Performance

Economic
Marampa, Sierra Leone
Iron ore mining is predicted to contribute to a GDP growth 
of 50% in Sierra Leone in 2012. The start of production at 
Marampa in January 2012 has resulted in the ﬁrst royalty 
payment to the Government of Sierra Leone and to the 
Marampa community development fund. The community 
development fund will be used for both regional and national 
development projects.
We have held initial meetings with several international ﬁnance 
institutions and bilateral development agencies including the 
African Development Bank, the World Bank, UK Department  
for International Development (DIFD), German Technical  
Co-operation (GIZ) and the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID), on future co-ﬁnancing of projects in the 
countries in which we operate. This includes, for example, co-
funding of research and the production of an in-depth report on 
Sierra Leone’s employment and skills market. This information will 
help us focus our community projects on developing the future of 
Sierra Leone in a long term and sustainable way.
We are engaging with the German Technical Co-operation, 
Government of Sierra Leone, USAID, UK Department 
for International Development and the United Nations 
Development Program to develop a skills and vocational 
training program and a capacity building program for 
local businesses. Our aim is to meet our requirements for 
operational expansion over the next ﬁve years while at the 
same time enhancing local employment and procurement. 
We are also engaging with the Sierra Leone Ministry of Finance 
and Economic Development, the African Development Bank 
and World Bank on infrastructure planning schemes. This 
includes a study into the development of a deep sea port.
We are talking with the Sierra Leone National Registration 
Ofﬁce to arrange a site visit to get the local workforce  
supplied with National ID cards. This will not only enable us  
to have accurate and reliable data on the individuals working  
at our site, it will also mean these individuals can register to  
vote in elections.
Case studies
Sierra Leone 
  Many of our uniforms are made by a local business outside 
Freetown, this operation uses a combination of imported 
and locally sourced materials and 100% local labour to 
provide shirts, overalls and jackets to our employees. This 
synergy cuts down on shipping costs and feeds revenue 
directly back in to the local private sector. The company we 
use is in the process of rebuilding its capabilities after it was 
ambushed to make uniforms for the rebels during the civil 
war. We also source other clothing such as hats and belts 
from local business and are in the process of trialling other 
suppliers for equipment procurement.
  80 drivers used for logistics at the site and in Freetown 
have been trained in defensive driving to UK standards 
and receive certiﬁcates.
  We have signed an agreement with the Lunsar Pig Rearers 
Association, to whom we deliver our food waste daily, 
creating a sustainable and hygienic way to dispose of the 
food waste from the site whilst assisting local businesses.
  At Port Thofeyim Patricia Sonkoi, widow of the former 
Paramount Chief of the Maforki district, has been 
contracted in replacement of an imported contractor to feed 
the workers at the barging site. Her and her team of family 
members and local workers prepare traditional local dishes, 
using 100% regionally sourced produce.
  London Mining uses locally owned and run passenger boats 
to travel around the region, a necessary part of the transfer 
between the airport and the ofﬁce in the capital. This has 
encouraged boat operators to improve health and safety 
standards to attract international passengers creating a 
service that attracts local and overseas passengers. 40

Isua, Greenland
Our Isua project is predicted to employ around 480 local 
people. This number will build over the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the 
mine life as local people are trained in the skills to take the 
place of overseas workers. These overseas workers will initially 
help to provide the knowledge and capacity to train the 
Greenlandic in the necessary operations. We aim to hire as 
many local people as possible who have shown the ability to 
learn and develop to take positions of responsibility. As the 
Greenlandic workforce grows, so does the contribution from 
our project into the local economy. This in turn increases our 
economic support of Greenland’s public and private sector.
Colombia
Working closely with international development banks and the 
Colombian Government (Bancoldex), we are studying the 
feasibility of developing a capacity building program for local 
businesses to support our growth plans and the local economy. 
Health and Safety 
Marampa, Sierra Leone
It is vital we educate our workforce in an environment with no 
existing safety culture. To this end, all workers go through a 
safety induction before joining the team. On completing the 
training, they are given full personal protection equipment 
relevant to their work. Each worker wears a badge with basic 
safety rules and responsibilities on it and has had these points 
explained to them in detail. Every safety breach or event is 
recorded. Incidents are infrequent and decreasing. 
Colombia
We are developing a policy and management plan for 
occupational health for our Colombia operations. It is designed 
to comply with the Colombian Government’s HSE guidelines: 
the Guia Del Sistema de Seguridad, Salud Ocupational y 
Ambiente para Contratista of the Consejo Colombiano de 
Seguridad. We expect the plan to be completed and approved 
by our management in Q2 2012. The plan will include guidance 
on working standards relating to external and internal 
incidences relevant to all aspects of personal and environmental 
safety. There will be particular focus on risks and events speciﬁc 
to our Colombian operations.
Where possible procurement for operations and expansion 
over the next ﬁve years will draw directly from local private 
sector growth thus promoting local private sector growth. As 
part of this commitment, we are looking into the opportunity of 
supporting a local business initative to build now accomodation 
in Socha that can be leased to mine staff. Performance

Planning for the future
Our priorities for 2012 are to understand where we are 
and where we want to be, by consulting our shareholders, 
employees, communities and other key stakeholders. To realise 
this goal we will review the main sustainable development 
trends in the mining sector and identify best industry practices. 
In doing this, we will align ourselves with our peers and identify 
where we are currently performing well and where we need to 
improve. We will use this clear understanding of our current 
position as a foundation to deﬁne future action – choosing 
strategic priorities and concrete actions to realise our vision 
and address social expectations while upholding our 
commitments to sustainability and international standards.
Our vision is to maximise value for all stakeholders and to 
become a top 10 supplier to the steel industry within the next 
ﬁve years. We will do this through partnerships that create 
an environment conducive to investment and ensure local 
economic, environmental and social conditions are improved 
through our operating presence.
Globally, we face a number of challenges:
• Increased shareholder and stakeholder activism;
• A greater connection between grassroots NGOs and 
international movements; 
• Increased competition due to globalisation;
• Greater capital and credit constraints leading to risk aversion 
from global ﬁnancial institutions; and
• Growing resource nationalism, putting at risk new mine 
development which requires long term capital commitment.
Differentiation in today’s commodity markets comes from being 
the Company of choice globally. 
In order to improve ﬁnancial return, as well as mitigate the 
potential strategic threats posed by these challenges, we  
will work to embed sustainability in our core global business. 
We plan to:
• Leverage partnership funding and expertise to ensure 
sustainability projects are collaborative;
• Ensure sustainability is embedded within future business 
development projects and current capital investment projects 
in its regions;
• Ensure that all sustainability indicators are jointly agreed 
upon, monitored and evaluated with key stakeholders; and
• Partner with organisations that appreciate cross-sectoral 
collaboration as opportunities for value-creation.

London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
1. Commercial and business strategy 
Business strategy and planning
Risk cause: That chosen business strategy, in terms of acquisition 
and investment, funding strategy and resource allocation is not 
optimal or does not consider all appropriate options.
Impact: Shareholder return could be adversely affected if 
investments or acquisitions do not deliver expected value.
Mitigation: The Board is responsible for determining business 
strategy and appropriate authority is delegated to executive and 
project management.
Business strategy is reviewed regularly to ensure all strategic 
options are duly considered and appraised.
Investment decisions are based on ﬁnancial and strategic 
metrics and are assessed and prioritised accordingly.
Key personnel
Risk cause: Strong competition for experienced mining 
personnel, combined with failure to maintain competitive 
remuneration may lead to loss of critical personnel or inability 
to recruit suitable candidates.
Impact: The Group’s success may be impaired if it cannot 
retain continued services of key management and certain 
technical personnel.
Mitigation: Regular reviews of remuneration and incentive 
plans are carried out in order to attract, retain and incentivise 
key employees.
Staff succession planning
Risk cause: Failure to adequately prepare for planned and 
unplanned staff departures.
Impact: Signiﬁcant and sudden loss of knowledge/skills; 
reduced efﬁciency and effectiveness; delayed project delivery 
or business development.
Mitigation: Succession planning is an important issue on the 
Board’s agenda.
2. Operating and technical
Project delivery and performance
Risk cause: The development of Group projects may not meet 
project budgets’ timescales due to a number of factors, some 
of which are outside of the Group’s control.
These include technical uncertainties, regulatory requirements, 
infrastructure constraints availability of inputs and adverse 
weather conditions.
Impact: Failure to effectively deliver projects could increase 
costs and/or delay production and proﬁtability.
Mitigation: The Group has experienced management teams 
in place for each project. Feasibility studies are performed to 
reduce technical risk and to identify project risk factors.
Project performance is monitored through reporting and 
regular management meetings.
Development progress and cost control is captured and 
monitored through appropriate software and is subject to 
review and challenge.
Reserves and resources
Risk cause: There are inherent uncertainties in estimating 
mineral reserves and resources.
Impact: There is no guarantee that estimated mineral 
resources can be recovered through mining activities. If the 
Group cannot access reserves and resources, future 
proﬁtability maybe impacted.
Mitigation: Reserves and resources are estimated using 
industry standard methodologies which reduce the risk of 
signiﬁcant variation.

2. Operating and technical continued
Exploration
Risk cause: Exploration is by nature a speculative activity with 
no guarantee of success.
Impact: Failure to discover new mineral resources of sufﬁcient 
economic value could adverse the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
Mitigation: The Group has experienced exploration teams 
supported by specialist contractors. Exploration programs are 
targeted to maximise the opportunity for resource development.
Export logistics
Risk cause: Revenues are dependent on secure logistics 
to deliver product to market, in particular the barging and 
transhipment solution at Marampa. Logistics could be 
impacted by marine risks including poor navigation, inadequate 
dredging, adverse weather and marine trafﬁc.
Impact: Disruption to logistics could impact the ability 
to get product to market and materially affect revenues 
and proﬁtability.
Mitigation: Logistics arrangements are carefully planned and 
reviewed. Specialist contractors with appropriate experience 
have been engaged to operate logistics solutions and their 
performance monitored regularly.
Supply risks
Risk cause: The inability to obtain key materials or equipment 
in a timely manner to operational locations. Certain key items 
have long lead times to replace.
Impact: Production could be delayed or shutdown which 
would signiﬁcantly impact cash ﬂow and proﬁtability.
Mitigation: The Group works closely with key suppliers 
in order to prevent delays in delivery of equipment.
Contingency plans are in place to address issues around  
key bottlenecks.
3. Financial
Liquidity
Risk cause: The Group may not be able to secure sufﬁcient 
ﬁnancing to meet liabilities as they fall due and as a result, 
cease trading. 
The Group must comply with all covenants to ensure loan 
facilities are not in default.
Volatility in capital and credit markets could reduce the Group’s 
ability to raise ﬁnance and to service current debt and obligations.
Impact: If the Group is unable to raise adequate funding this 
may mean the Group is unable to develop and/or meet its 
operational commitments and business strategy. This could 
result in delays to development and reduced proﬁtability.
Mitigation: The Group seeks to monitor its cash ﬂow 
forecasts closely and regularly reforecasts its cash ﬂows to 
ensure there are sufﬁcient committed funds in place to meet  
all committed expenditures for the foreseeable future. 
Business plans are periodically reviewed and monitored by 
the Board.
Capital intensive projects such as Greenland and Saudi Arabia 
will require external ﬁnancing to fund development.
Commodity price volatility
Risk cause: The commodity prices for iron ore and coal are 
strongly inﬂuenced by macroeconomic factors.
Impact: The Group’s share price and ﬁnancial results could 
be adversely affected by declines in commodity prices.
Mitigation: The Group does not typically implement hedge or 
price management strategies, but did hedge a portion of 2012 
production in conjunction with entering into a loan facility. 
Currency ﬂuctuations
Risk cause: The Company’s functional currency is USD. 
Revenues from iron and coal are denominated in USD while  
the Group’s costs are incurred in several currencies
Impact: Fluctuations in exchange rates, speciﬁcally the 
Colombian Peso and GBP sterling, may adversely impact costs 
and ﬁnancial results.
Mitigation: Group policy is to negotiate all contracts and 
costs where possible in USD.
The Group does undertake certain hedging strategies, but 
there is no assurance hedging strategies will be successful.
Principal risks and  
uncertainties
continued Performance
45
London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
 
3. Financial continued
Cost control
Risk cause: the Group has an active investment program 
across its operations and in particular at Marampa.
Operating costs generally include inputs which are susceptible 
to inﬂationary and supply and demand pressures, including 
fuel, labour and equipment costs.
Impact: Failure to deliver capital investment programs on 
budget or timescale may have an adverse impact on proﬁtability.
Mitigation: Capital program progress and operating cost 
performance is monitored continually through budgets, reports 
and management meetings.
Insurance
Risk cause: Policy cover may not provide sufﬁcient coverage 
for all potential insurance risks which may arise.
Impact: The Group may suffer ﬁnancial losses if uninsured 
risks materialise.
Mitigation: Insurance policies are monitored on a regular 
basis in conjunction with insurance specialists. Insurance risk 
workshops are performed at key operations. 
4. Legal and regulatory
Licences and permits
Risk cause: The Group is dependent on the granting and 
renewal of mining and exploration licences in order to explore 
for and produce mineral resources.
Impact: Failure to obtain a licence or permit renewal could 
have a material adverse impact on the Group’s operations  
and expansion plans and adversely impact share price and 
ﬁnancial performance.
Mitigation: There are established processes in place to monitor 
licences and permits on an ongoing basis and processes are in 
place to ensure compliance with all licences and permits.
Country speciﬁc risks
Risk cause: The Group is exposed to political and regulatory 
developments in the countries we operate, including Sierra 
Leone, Colombia, Greenland and Saudi Arabia. Local political 
developments or changes in ﬁscal or mining regulations are 
beyond the Group’s control.
Impact: Potential impacts could include political instability 
and civil unrest, nulliﬁcation of existing agreements, licences or 
permits, expropriation of assets, imposition of increase royalties 
or taxes, or restrictions on exports.
Mitigation: The Group monitors political and regulatory 
developments and seeks to positively inﬂuence signiﬁcant 
changes through active dialogue with governments, international 
agencies, NGOs and all other appropriate parties.
The Group mitigates this risk by ensuring compliance with all 
local laws and legislation.
Bribery and corruption
Risk cause: The Group operates in jurisdictions where the 
perceived risk of corruption is high.
Impact: Financial loss could result from fraudulent acts, and 
reputational damage from failure to comply with legislation.
Mitigation: The Group has documented principles relating 
to business conduct and adopts a zero tolerance approach 
to deviations and has a whistle-blowing procedure in place.  
An anti-corruption training program was completed  
during the year. 
5. Health, safety and environmental
Health, safety and environment
Risk cause: Mining is an inherently hazardous industry due 
to the nature of operations and working conditions.
Impact: In addition to personal injury, fatality and damage to 
the environment, impacts include ﬁnes and penalties, liability  
to third parties, impairment to reputation and industrial action.
Mitigation: The Group is in compliance with all laws and 
regulations. A zero tolerance approach is adopted in respect  
of all health and safety matters.
The Group has appointed a Head of Sustainability.
Social and community
Risk cause: Disputes may arise with local communities in 
close proximity to the Group’s operations, including the 
Marampa operation which involves resettlement of 
communities.
Impact: Failure to properly engage and manage local 
communities could result in prolonged disputes which  
could cause project delay and reputational damage.
Mitigation: The Group has established a comprehensive 
process for proactively engaging community involvement 
activities surrounding all of our projects and for dealing 
promptly with any potential disputes. 46

London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
Dear Shareholder
As an AIM-listed company, London Mining is not required to  
follow the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). It has 
however endeavoured to follow the principles and provisions of 
the Code keeping in mind its size, structure and the need for an 
entrepreneurial outlook. Since the Company listed its shares on 
AIM in November 2009 the corporate governance structure of  
the Company has evolved with the progress and development  
of the Company. London Mining has now progressed from being 
a developer to a producer of iron ore and the Board recognises 
that this key development brings with it enhanced shareholder 
expectations with respect to governance. 
Given the Company’s current shareholder base, shareholder 
feedback and the Company’s aims to become a premium  
listed company the Board is committed to further enhancing  
its corporate governance structure and, in particular, focusing  
on those matters brought to its attention by its shareholders. 
Whilst the Code allows companies to explain their reasons for  
non-compliance with any of its provisions, London Mining wishes 
to minimise its areas of non-compliance with the Code and has 
formulated a plan for addressing the key areas of non-compliance.
The key components of the plan are:
 Changes to Board structure and composition
—  Appoint two new additional independent Non-Executive 
Directors in 2012
—  New independent Non-Executive Directors will be expected 
to chair the audit and remuneration committees
—  Make changes to the Board committees to ensure that 
they contain at least a majority of independent Non-
Executive Directors and are in accordance with the Code.
 Independence of current Non-Executive Directors
—  Implement a plan that will equitably dispense with options 
issued to current Non-Executive Directors (that are 
considered by the Board to be independent) to ensure wider 
acceptance of the Board’s view that they are independent
—  No further grants of share options will be made to Non-
Executive Directors.
  New executive remuneration policy in line with ABI guidelines
—  Strategic objectives linked to individual key 
performance indicators
—  Strongly align executive remuneration with enhanced 
shareholder expectations
—  Underpin a pay-for-performance culture.
We look forward to a continuing and productive dialogue  
with you this year.

London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
 
Governance of London Mining
London Mining is committed to maintaining the highest standards 
of corporate governance. This section of the Annual Report sets 
out the corporate governance framework for the Company and 
how it has evolved since London Mining listed its shares on the 
AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange in November 2009.
The Code sets out the standards for good practice in relation  
to corporate governance in the form of a set of principles and 
provisions. Under the AIM rules London Mining is not required 
to comply with the Code nor state whether it departs from it. 
The Board has however chosen to apply the Code to promote 
good governance where it is considered practical for a 
company of its size and development.
Board balance and independence
The UK Code requires that companies below the FTSE 350 
should have at least two independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Colin Harris, appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 12 May 
2011, is considered by the Board to be independent. Sir Nicholas 
Bonsor and Graham Mascall are also considered by the Board to 
be independent having not had any previous connection with the 
Company prior to their appointments to the Board. The Board is 
of the opinion that Sir Nicholas Bonsor and Graham Mascall 
remain independent with regards to their character and judgment. 
In the past, in keeping with the entrepreneurial nature of the 
Company, the Board was keen to ensure that Directors’ interests 
were aligned with the interests of shareholders. Therefore, in 
earlier years it was the Board’s practice to issue a small number 
of share options to Directors, including Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board did not believe that this practice impaired the 
independence of Non-Executive Directors, however it is aware 
that the granting of share options to Non-Executive Directors is 
not consistent with the Code. Non-Executive Directors are 
therefore no longer granted options and Colin Harris does not 
hold share options. To address shareholder concerns with 
respect to share options held by Sir Nicholas Bonsor and 
Graham Mascall the Board has worked with shareholders to 
establish a way to equitably dispense with the options held by Sir 
Nicholas Bonsor and Graham Mascall to enable shareholders to 
be more comfortable with their independence. Accordingly, the 
Board intends to cancel the options held by these Non-Executive 
Directors in consideration for the payment of a fairly valued cash 
sum and to allow these Non-Executive Directors to use the 
proceeds to subscribe for shares in the Company on the basis 
that they hold such shares for a period of two years. An 
independent consultant will be appointed to carry out the 
valuation of the options and oversee the procedure. The 
Company will disclose full details of the process once approved.
One of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors, (excluding the 
Chairman) is not considered independent. Malcolm Groat was an 
Executive Director of the Company (Part-time Finance Director) in 
2008. The Company considers that whilst Malcolm Groat is not 
considered independent, his appointment as a Non-Executive 
Director with extensive ﬁnancial, accounting and mining expertise 
and experience enhances the overall strength of the Board and 
outweighs any perceived compromise to his independence.

of identifying suitable candidates that will have the independence, 
expertise and suitability to chair the audit and remuneration 
committees, respectively. When making these appointments the 
Board intends to recognise the importance of considering a wide 
range of diverse candidates. Further details of the plans for these 
appointments and their impact on the membership of the Board 
committees are set out later in this report.

Annual Report 2011
Board process
The Board holds at least six scheduled Board meetings a year 
following a timetable of subject matter to consider, set at the 
beginning of each year. The Board also meets on an ad hoc 
basis in response to the needs of the business. A table of 
attendance of members of the Board and Board committees  
at meetings held during 2011 is set out on page 57.
The Directors receive appropriate brieﬁng papers on substantive 
items, circulated prior to each Board meeting to give the Directors 
adequate time to prepare for the meeting and to enable any 
Director who is unable to attend the meeting to have an opportunity 
to review the matters to be discussed and, if necessary, to provide 
comments to the Chairman in advance of the meeting. The 
Directors also receive regular updates on ﬁnancial information 
between Board meetings. All Directors have the right to have their 
concerns about the running of the Company, or a proposed action 
which cannot be resolved, recorded in the minutes. 
Board development
Programs of continuing professional development are arranged 
as required, taking into account the individual qualiﬁcations and 
experience of the Directors. The Chairman is responsible for 
ensuring induction and training programs are provided and the 
Company Secretary is tasked with organising such programs. 
Individual Directors, with the support of the Company Secretary, 
are also expected to take responsibility for identifying their own 
training needs and to ensure that they are adequately informed 
about the Group and their responsibilities as a Director. Due to 
the current plans to enhance corporate governance in 2012, the 
Board requested that they receive further training in this area. 
A comprehensive corporate governance workshop and training 
program has been organised for the Board in May 2012. The 
workshop will be run by an external consultant and will update and 
refresh the Board on current and key corporate governance matters. 
As part of their role the Executive Directors are on site on a 
regular basis. During 2011 a number of the Non-Executive 
Directors attended site visits to Sierra Leone, Colombia,  
China and Greenland. 
Board advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Head of Legal and Company Secretary, who is responsible to 
the Board for ensuring that the correct Board procedures are 
followed and that Board members receive legal and company 
secretarial advice. Both the appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary are a matter for the Board as a whole.  
All Directors also have access to the Group’s professional 
advisers whom they can consult at the Company’s expense 
should they consider this necessary in order to better discharge 
their responsibilities. 
Conﬂicts of interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Board is permitted to consider and if it sees ﬁt, to authorise 
situations where a Director has an interest that conﬂicts, or may 
possibly conﬂict, with the interests of the Company. A schedule 
of conﬂicts or potential conﬂicts for each Director is reviewed  
at least annually. A Director who had a conﬂict of interest would 
not be counted in a quorum or counted in a vote when the Board 
considered the matter in which the Director had an interest.
Board evaluation
Prism Cosec is currently advising the Company on a number  
of aspects of corporate governance and company secretarial 
matters. As part of this work Prism Cosec have carried out  
an Evaluation of the Board and its three principal committees  
(the audit committee, the remuneration committee and the 
nomination committee) conducted using a detailed and 
conﬁdential questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions 
about the effectiveness of the executive and the Non-Executive 
Directors and the Board as a whole. The results of the evaluation 
were collated in a form which did not identify individual comments 
(so as to ensure candid feedback), and the collated feedback 
was reviewed by the Chairman and the Company Secretary  
and discussed by the Board. The main conclusions from the 
evaluation were that the Board continued to operate as an 
effective body which provided strong entrepreneurial leadership. 
A number of comments related to the structure and composition 
of the Board and enhancing corporate governance and this will 
be addressed as part of the Company’s corporate governance 
developments planned for 2012. In particular, the Board 
requested further Board brieﬁngs on corporate governance to  
be arranged to ensure the corporate governance of the Company 
develops in line with the growing proﬁle of the Company.
Re-election of Directors at the  
Annual General Meeting 
Directors are elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual 
General Meeting ‘(AGM)’ after their appointment and, after that, 
offer themselves up for re-election at regular intervals by a vote 
of shareholders at least once every three years. The Company 
intends to continue with this practice but will review this 
regularly. If the Company becomes a member of the FTSE 350 
the Directors will offer themselves for annual re-election.  
Rachel Rhodes and Malcolm Groat will retire by rotation at the 
forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-
election. Colin Harris will be offering himself for election as this 
will be the ﬁrst AGM since his appointment on 12 May 2011. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the 
management, direction and performance of 
the Group and its businesses. 56

the Code as follows:
Audit committee – members will be independent Non-
Executive Directors in accordance with Code Provision C.3.1;
Remuneration committee – members will be independent Non-
Executive Directors in accordance with Code Provision D. 2.1;

Audit committee
The audit committee is chaired by Malcolm Groat. Other 
members of the committee are Dr Colin Knight, Sir Nicholas 
Bonsor, Colin Harris and Graham Mascall. As a fellow of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales who 
qualiﬁed with Price Waterhouse in London, and holds an MBA, 
Malcolm Groat has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. He 
also has a full and comprehensive ﬁnancial background and 
experience both inside and outside of mining, including global 
listed businesses both AIM and FTSE 250. He has previous 
experience as an audit committee chair in a business with over 
10,000 shareholders and he currently serves as ﬁnance Director 
of a UK-based mining company. He is therefore, at present, 
considered by the Board to be the best candidate for chairman 
of the audit committee. The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Rachel 
Rhodes, the Finance Controller and the Head of Internal audit 
have all attended committee meetings by invitation. The 
Company’s auditors, Deloitte LLP also attend by invitation.
Under its terms of reference, the audit committee is required  
to meet at least three times a year or more frequently as 
circumstances require. The audit committee reports on its 
activities to the Board meeting immediately following its meetings.

Committee activities
In 2011 the audit committee met four times. During the year,  
the committees’ activities included following:
• Reviewing and approving the external audit plans;
• Key accounting judgements including going concern and 
liquidity;
• Accounting treatments regarding ﬁnance raised during the year;
• Considering the accounting value of assets;
• Consideration of the preliminary, interim and quarterly 
announcements; and
• Reviewing internal controls and external audit effectiveness.
Relationships with external auditors
The audit committee monitors the relationship with the 
Company’s external auditors relating to the provision of non-audit 
services to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence is 
safeguarded. This is achieved by disclosure of the extent and 
nature of non-audit services (see note 6 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements) and the prohibition of selected services  
by the external auditor. The audit committee has considered 
information pertaining to the balance between fees for audit and  58
London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
non-audit work performed for the Group in 2011 and concluded 
that the nature and extent of non-audit fees do not present a 
threat to the external auditor’s objectivity or independence.
The reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external auditors 
is reviewed on an annual basis by the audit committee. The 
committee’s assessment of the external auditors’ performance and 
independence underpins its recommendation to reappoint Deloitte 
LLP as auditors until the conclusion of the AGM in 2013. 
Resolutions to authorise the Board to reappoint the auditors and 
to determine their remuneration for the year ending 31 December 
2012 will be proposed at the AGM on 23 May 2012.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal controls and risk management systems to 
safeguard shareholders’ investment and Company assets.
i) Risk identiﬁcation and evaluation
A comprehensive and structured risk management process 
was introduced for material business units during the year 
and will continue to be further developed during 2012. A Risk 
Management Policy has been established to provide a broad 
framework for identifying and managing major areas of risk.  
The Board has ultimate responsibility for setting the Group’s 
approach to risk to support its strategy and objectives and 
executive management have responsibility for ongoing risk 
review and management. The basic approach incorporated:
• Identifying and evaluating risks: risks that could have a 
signiﬁcant impact were identiﬁed into broad categories and 
evaluated, (for likelihood and impact) and subsequently 
ranked. This was achieved through risk workshops and 
discussions with key personnel at both project and Corporate 
level and, where applicable, utilising external expertise.
• Designing and implementing responses: appropriate controls 
and mitigation responses were documented and developed 
on formal risk registers at a local and Group level. Risk 
registers will be regularly monitored to ensure effective 
implementation.
• Reporting risks: a summary risk register was produced and 
reviewed by executive management and reported to the 
Board. The summary risk register will be reviewed annually  
by the Board.
Details of the risks the Company is exposed to are set out in 
the Operational and Financial Reviews on pages 22 to 35.
ii) Control environment
The system of internal control has been designed to manage 
and mitigate rather than eliminate risk and provide reasonable 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
A review of the effectiveness of the internal control systems of 
the Group’s material business units was conducted during the 
year. The Board conducted this review by considering reports 
from management on key risks, key controls and mitigations 
and management representations. 
The Board also receives assurance from the audit committee 
which considers all matters reported to it by internal and external 
audit. The Board has not identiﬁed nor been advised of any 
failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be signiﬁcant.
The system of internal control continues to develop as the 
Company transitions from development and exploration into 
operations and expansion which creates new and additional 
risks. A number of control initiatives are planned and in 
progress to address such operational risks and will form  
part of the review of the effectiveness of control in 2012.
Internal audit
During the year the Group established an Internal audit 
function. Internal audit supported the Group by developing 
policies and procedures around risk management, anti-fraud, 
anti-bribery and corruption and by performing an assessment 
of the effectiveness of controls. Internal audit will continue to 
support the Group in the development of risk management and 
internal control with particular focus on operational controls as 
the Group moves from development into a producing operation.
UK Bribery Act and whistle-blowing
Whistle-blowing
A formal whistle-blowing policy that enables employees to  
raise concerns they may have about workplace fraud or 
mismanagement on a conﬁdential basis is in place. Safecall 
Limited provides a conﬁdential hotline and email service through 
which employees can report their concerns. The Chairman  
of the audit committee is provided with reports from the  
whistle-blowing system. The whistle-blowing policy has been 
communicated to all of London Mining’s subsidiaries, employees 
and contractors. The existence of the whistle-blowing hotline has 
also been advertised through the use of posters on-site in Sierra 
Leone and Colombia and public sponsorship by the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and project Directors.

Annual Report 2011
UK Bribery Act and training
The Company has undertaken an extensive review of its policies 
and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of the UK Bribery Act. One element of this review 
focused on the leadership given by the Board and to continue a 
culture of compliance driven by the “tone at the top”. As a result, 
a Bribery Act steering committee was set up with key Board 
members including the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer as members. The 
committee met frequently during the year to administer and 
agree the necessary policies and procedures, review key risk 
areas identiﬁed by the Company and through a report prepared 
by Deloitte, and to ensure the key aspects of the Company’s 
policies and procedures are understood by new and existing 
employees, consultants, joint venture partners and other key 
associates. The Company’s auditors (Deloitte LLP) and legal 
advisers (Travers Smith) assisted in an initial risk assessment 
exercise to help the Company assess the existing governance 
arrangements and controls of the Company, outline clear 
objectives and goals and develop policies and procedures to 
ensure full compliance. A Bribery Act Operating committee 
comprising of key executive management at head ofﬁce and 
operating subsidiary levels was also formed. The operating 
committee was tasked with overseeing implementation of 
policies, monitoring risk, testing controls and determining 
priority actions to ensure compliance.
Health, Safety and Environment committee
Although ultimate responsibility for Health, Safety and 
Environment matters remains with the Board, during 2011 a 
Health, Safety and Environment committee was formed to give 
an additional focus on Health, Safety and Environment matters 
now that the Company is in production at two of its projects. 
The Health, Safety and Environment committee will assist the 
Board in obtaining assurance that appropriate systems are in 
place to deal with the management of safety, health and 
environmental risks. Under its terms of reference the committee 
will meet at least twice a year and has met once since its 
formation in June 2011. The members of the Health, Safety and 
Environment committee are Graham Mascall (Chairman of the 
committee), Graeme Hossie, Rachel Rhodes, Colin Harris and 
Luciano Ramos. The Chairman of the committee will attend the 
AGM.
Details of the Company’s sustainability initiatives can be found 
on pages 36 to 41.
Nomination committee
The members of the nomination committee are Dr Colin Knight 
(committee Chairman), Sir Nicholas Bonsor,  
Malcolm Groat, Colin Harris and Graham Mascall.
Under its terms of reference, the nomination committee is 
responsible for reviewing the structure, size and composition, 
including the skills, knowledge and experience of the Board 
and make recommendations to the Board about adjustments. 
The committee also considers succession planning for 
Directors and other senior executives. When making an 
appointment, the committee is required by its terms of 
reference to evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board and consider candidates on merit  
and against objective criteria, taking care that appointees have 
enough time available to devote to the position. In searching  
for new independent Non-Executive Directors in 2012 the 
nomination committee’s mandate will be to identify individuals 
with outstanding credentials in creating value for shareholders 
and wide international experience. The mandate will also 
recognise the importance of considering a diverse range of 
candidates to augment the Board’s diversity. The committee 
met once during the year to discuss succession planning and 
new appointments.
Remuneration committee
The members of the remuneration committee are Sir Nicholas 
Bonsor (Chairman of the committee), Dr Colin Knight, Malcolm 
Groat, Colin Harris and Graham Mascall.
Under its terms of reference, the remuneration committee  
is required to meet at least twice a year or more frequently  
as circumstances require. In 2011 the remuneration 
committee met nine times, primarily to develop a new executive 
remuneration policy in line with ABI guidelines. To assist in the 
creation of this new executive remuneration policy the committee 
sought the advice of KPMG LLP to provide guidance on market 
practice, to establish a pay for performance remuneration 
structure, to position the senior team with respect to their  
peers and make recommendations based on their analysis. The 
committee has worked closely with KPMG throughout 2011 to 
formulate an appropriate executive remuneration policy. Details of 
this policy and the committee’s activities are contained in the 
Directors’ remuneration report set out on pages 61 to 70. The 
remuneration committee reports on its activities to the Board 
meeting immediately following its meetings. 60

Executive committee
London Mining established an executive committee during 
2011 which focuses on monitoring the Company’s business, 
reviewing investments, progress against agreed plans and 
targets and making recommendations to the Board. The 
executive committee comprises the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer,  
the Corporate Development Director, the Head of Investor 
Relations, the Head of Legal, the Head of Sustainability  
and the Head of Human Resources. 
The executive committee meets on a bi-monthly basis. The 
executive committee members receive papers in advance of the 
meetings. Agenda items for each meeting include operation 
reviews, ﬁnancial reviews, management accounts and ﬁnancial 
performance, update on projects, use of funds and funding 
requirements, legal matters and corporate governance. 
Relations with investors 
The Company is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of disclosure ensuring that all investors and 
potential investors have the same access to high quality, 
relevant information in an accessible and timely manner to 
assist them in making informed decisions. The investor 
relations department manages the ﬂow of information to all 
investors and potential investors and regular presentations 
take place at the time of the quarterly, half year and ﬁnal 
results as well as during the rest of the year. The Company  
has consulted with a number of its major shareholders on  
its new remuneration policy and listened to shareholders’ 
views regarding corporate governance matters.
Any concerns raised by a shareholder in relation to the 
Company and its affairs are communicated to the Board.
Copies of announcements to the stock exchanges on which 
the Company is or has been listed, investor presentations, 
interim ﬁnancial reports, the Annual Report and other  
relevant information are posted to the Company’s  
website at www.londonmining.co.uk
The Annual General Meeting 
The Notice of AGM will be dispatched to shareholders, 
together with explanatory notes or a circular on items of 
special business, at least 20 working days before the meeting. 
Separate resolutions will be proposed on each substantially 
separate issue including a resolution relating to the Report 
and Accounts. 
The Chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination 
committees normally attend the AGM and are available to 
answer questions. All Directors usually attend the meeting. 
The Board welcomes questions from shareholders who have 
an opportunity to raise issues informally or formally before or  
at the AGM. 
For each resolution the proxy appointment forms provide 
shareholders with the option to direct their proxy vote either for 
or against the resolution or to withhold their vote. The Company 
will ensure that the proxy form and any announcement of the 
results of a vote will make it clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a 
vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the 
proportion of the votes for and against the resolution.
All valid proxy appointments are properly recorded and counted. 
For each resolution, after the vote has been taken, information 
on the number of proxy votes for and against the resolution, and 
the number of shares in respect of which the vote was withheld, 
are given at the meeting and are made available on the 
Company’s website at www.londonmining.co.uk
UK Corporate Governance Code compliance
As an AIM-listed company, London Mining is not required to 
follow the Code however the Board have chosen to apply the 
Code in so far as it is appropriate for a company of its size  
and development.
Areas of non-compliance with the Code relate to the 
membership of the Board committees and the remuneration 
policy. Details of the areas of non-compliance relating to the 
remuneration policy along with improvements made are set out 
in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 61 to 70.
Code Provision C.3.1 requires a company below FTSE 350 to 
establish an audit committee of at least two independent Non-
Executive Directors. The audit committee of London Mining 
includes Malcolm Groat as its Chairman. Malcolm Groat is not 
considered independent due to his short period as a part-time 
Finance Director to the Company in 2008. Malcom does however 
have extensive, recent and relevant ﬁnancial as well as mining 
experience enhancing the strength of the audit committee and is 
therefore a necessary and valued member of the committee. 
Code Provision D.2.1 requires a company below FTSE 350 to 
establish a remuneration committee of at least two independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Malcolm Groat is also a member of 
the remuneration committee. Malcolm’s extensive accounting 
and mining experience is also considered by the Board to lend 
strength to the remuneration committee.

Annual Report 2011
Dear Shareholder
It is with pleasure that I introduce the Directors’ remuneration 
report for the year ended 31 December 2011. This report has 
been prepared by the remuneration committee and approved 
by the Board. 
The Company is going through a critical stage in its evolution 
with the commencement of ﬁrst production at the Marampa 
mine in Sierra Leone in December 2011 and ﬁrst shipment  
in January 2012. It is therefore critical that the Company’s 
approach to remuneration evolves with the Company to 
support the recruitment, retention, incentivisation and 
motivation of key management and staff. 
As an entrepreneurial exploration and development company 
London Mining has followed a remuneration policy that has 
suited its entrepreneurial needs rewarding key management  
for individual operational objectives attained over shorter 
periods. This has suited the Company in obtaining its strategic 
development objectives and in aligning its goals with shareholder 
interests. As the Company progresses from being a developer 
to a producer of iron ore, more empirical measures of 
performance for key management need to be used to clearly 
demonstrate the alignment of remuneration with ongoing 
strategic corporate objectives and with enhanced shareholder 
expectations. The committee recognises, however, that there is 
a competitive market for successful executives with experience 
in the mining industry and that the provision of appropriate 
rewards for superior performance is important  
for the continued growth of the business. 
In response to the Company’s development needs and also 
shareholder feedback received since our last remuneration 
report, the remuneration committee’s key priority in 2011 was 
to overhaul the Company’s remuneration structure for  
key management. The remuneration committee’s aim was to 
implement a coherent, appropriate and relevant remuneration 
policy for the Company’s key management. 
To assist in the creation of this new executive remuneration 
policy, the committee sought the advice of KPMG LLP to 
provide guidance on market practice, to establish a pay  
for performance remuneration structure, to position  
key management with respect to their peers and make 
recommendations based on their analysis. The committee 
has worked closely with KPMG throughout 2011 to formulate 
an appropriate executive remuneration policy. Shareholders 
have also been consulted throughout the process of the 
policy development. The key details of this new policy are  
set out in this report, and the framework which will be  
used in 2012 to create a Group-wide remuneration structure.
Annual General Meeting
As usual the shareholders will be asked to vote on the 
Directors’ remuneration report at the AGM in May 2012  
and I will be available then to answer any questions on the 
committee’s activities.

This report is produced in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and  
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts  
and Reports) Regulations 2008. Although not required to as an AIM-listed company, 
London Mining has endeavoured to follow the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’). Derogations from the Code are contained within 
this report. This report contains both auditable and non-auditable information. The 
information subject to audit is set out in tables a to c on pages 69 to 70.

Components of Executive Directors’ remuneration  
1 January 2011–31 December 2011 
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually by the committee and take 
account of relevant benchmark data, and pay quantum and 
structure more generally throughout the Group. None of the 
Directors serving during the year received any remuneration  
in respect of post-retirement beneﬁts.
Annual bonus
For the year ending 31 December 2011, the performance 
measures for the annual bonus arrangements have been based 
on a balanced scorecard approach. The metrics of the balanced 
scorecard were people, process, ﬁnancial and client/external. 
2011 achievements were measured in the context of targets and 
stretch measures and key performance indicators. The KPIs 
under these metrics on which the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer and Corporate Development Director were 
measured on included health and safety, production targets, 
adherence to budget and funding initiatives. A weighting was 
applied to each metric depending on the role of the individual. 
In determining the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s bonus the remuneration 
committee assessed his personal KPIs relating to securing funding, 
pipeline growth, moving the Company from developer to operator, 
driving the safety policy, investor relations and enhancing the 
executive team.
The maximum bonus potential for 201 1, payable for exceptional levels 
of performance, was set at 150% of base salary for the Executive 
Directors. Not all targets for 201 1 were met; accordingly, 
approximately half of the maximum bonus was paid to the Executive 
Directors for 201 1. Details of the actual amounts paid for 201 1 are 
set out in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 69.
Deferred shares
In 2010 the full bonuses considered by the remuneration 
committee were not in fact approved and paid, notwithstanding 
the fact that the Executive Directors had met all the relevant 
objectives. The remuneration committee were mindful of the 
effects on cash ﬂow at a critical time in the Company’s 
development in the lead up to becoming a producer and 
therefore a portion of the bonuses were not approved. During 
2011 no LTIPs or share options were granted to Executive 
Directors whilst the remuneration committee considered the 
development of a new remuneration policy with appropriate 
corporate performance metrics for the vesting of options and 
LTIPs. The remuneration committee has therefore agreed, as 
part of the Executive Directors bonus for 2011, a share amount 
equal to 100% of 2010 base salaries to be issued in London 
Mining shares in 2012. These deferred shares will vest in two 
years, subject to the risk of forfeiture should an Executive 
Director leave the Company in this period.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP allows the committee to make awards which are  
a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil 
consideration. An award will normally vest, i.e. become 
exercisable, on the third anniversary of its grant provided  
that the grantee remains in continuous employment with the 
Company over this period. Current LTIPs held by Executive 
Directors are subject to them remaining in continuous 
employment with the Company over a three year period from 
the date of grant. All future grants under the LTIP will be 
subject to meeting predetermined total shareholder return 
targets measured over three years from the date of grant and 
the grantee remaining in continuous employment with the 
Company over a three year period from the date of grant. 
No LTIPs were granted to Executive Directors during 2011.
The new remuneration policy will  
strongly align executive remuneration 
with shareholders’ interests. 64

Share option awards
In the past some share options have been granted that  
could potentially (subject to performance criteria) vest in 
less than three years. In future share options granted to 
employees will be subject to them remaining in continuous 
employment with the Company over a three year period 
and satisfying further performance criteria. No options 
were granted to Executive Directors during 2011.
Directors’ contracts
The Executive Directors have indeﬁnite term contracts and  
the notice periods are set out below. With the exception of  
Luciano Ramos the Executive Directors’ contracts provide  
for a termination payment in excess of 12 months’ salary  
in the result of a change of control.

Outside appointments
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to 
accept outside appointments on external Boards or committees 
so long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business 
of the Company. Any fees in respect of those appointments are 
retained by the Executive Directors concerned. Graeme Hossie 
is the founder and a Director of Venture Development Partners 
Limited a family-owned company, for which he receives a small 
annual fee. He is also founder and a Director of Steribottle 
Limited and Steribottle Global Limited, companies producing

Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors (other than  
the Chairman) is a matter for the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. Fees are designed to ensure that the Company 
attracts and retains high calibre individuals. They are reviewed 
on an annual basis and account is taken of the level of fees  
paid by other companies of a similar size and complexity. Non-
Executive Directors do not participate in any annual bonus plan 
or pension arrangements. The Company repays the reasonable 
expenses that Non-Executive Directors incur in carrying out 
their duties as Directors. 
Non-Executive Directors and share options
In the past, as an entrepreneurial AIM company, London 
Mining has awarded some of its Non-Executive Directors’ 
share options. The Corporate Governance Report on pages 
52 to 60 sets out the intended treatment for the options 
granted to Non-Executive Directors to address shareholder 
concerns with respect to Non-Executive Directors’ holding 
options. In future Non-Executive Directors will not participate 
in any LTIP or share option arrangements.

Remuneration Policy – a new start for 2012
During 2011 KPMG LLP were appointed to assist the 
committee in developing an appropriate design for the  
future structure of executive remuneration. Other services 
provided to the Company by KPMG include tax advice and 
audits of a subsidiary of the Company in Sierra Leone. In 
formulating the proposals, benchmarking against mining  
and other peer group companies was utilised using publicly 
available information.
The Company’s new executive remuneration policy is 
focused on providing a level of remuneration which attracts, 
retains, incentivises and motivates Directors and senior 
executives of sufﬁcient calibre to achieve the Group’s 
strategic goals and enhance shareholder value, whilst 
ensuring that remuneration is consistent with best practice 
and provides an appropriate alignment with personal  
and business performance and shareholder interests. 
The key objectives of the new executive remuneration  
policy are to:
  Strongly align executive remuneration with shareholders’ 
interests and link remuneration with the strategy and 
objectives of the business;
  Underpin a pay-for-performance culture; and
  Support the retention, motivation and recruitment 
of talented people who are performance driven, 
commercially astute and creative.
Components of Executive Directors’ remuneration 
commencing 1 January 2012
The remuneration committee have agreed with the Board  
the following policy for executive remuneration which will  
be applied for 2012 onwards.
Executive remuneration will be made up of ﬁxed pay and 
performance-related pay (annual and long term):
Base salary – Base salary will be targeted at between 
median and upper quartile of the Company’s peers based on 
independent benchmarking reports although ﬂexibility will be 
retained. The remuneration committee aims to pay competitive base 
salaries having regard to market practice, internal relativities, 
performance and affordability. Salaries for key management below 
Board level are benchmarked against appropriate market 
comparisons and taken into account by the committee when 
considering the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Annual bonus with KPIs – The payout range for the annual bonus 
will be 50% of salary at threshold performance up to 150% at the 
maximum for Executive Directors for outstanding performance 
based  on stretch targets. For other members of key management 
the bonus will be 50% of salary at threshold performance, with 
discretion to pay up to a maximum of 100% of salary in exceptional 
circumstances. Any bonus will be paid in cash following the end of 
the ﬁnancial year.
Individual KPIs will be designed to incentivise performance  
and reward achievement in line with corporate strategy 
targets. KPIs will be both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial including 
ﬁnancial performance against EBITDA forecasts and budget, 
production targets, strategic development, HSE and 
developing community initiatives.
Share incentives – LTIPs – Annual grants will be made 
with three year performance measurement periods and continued 
employment. Additional grants to secure or retain executives  and 
to compensate for forgone share awards in other companies on 
being recruited to London Mining or in renewing contracts with 
reference to market may be made from time to time as the 
remuneration committee determines appropriate. Awards will be at 
the remuneration committee’s discretion and based on the market 
practice of the Company’s peer group. All awards will have 
corporate performance measures. The remuneration committee 
initially considered corporate performance measures such as 
earnings, share price and operational targets but concluded that all 
of these measures in the near term would be represented within 
the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) metric and that the setting of 
speciﬁc other targets risked not aligning management incentives 
with shareholder interests during a ramp up period. The committee 
believes that TSR is the most appropriate metric given the current 
stage of the Company’s growth. Considerable thought has been

given to the peer group to ensure an accurate relative performance measure. The committee will continually review corporate 
performance measures and the TSR comparator index in future years. 
The companies to be used for the TSR measurement index for grants in 2012 are set out below:
A. West African miners (45%)
B. FTSE 250 single  
commodity mining companies (45%) C. FTSE 100 (10%)

Cape Lambert Resources Kenmare Resources Glencore
New World Resources Randgold Resources
Petropavlovsk Rio Tinto
Talvivara Mining Company Vedanta Resources
Using relative TSR as a performance condition is consistent 
with market practice. TSR has been selected as a performance 
condition to support the drive for long term shareholder value. 
TSR is measured over a three year period from the date of 
grant of the LTIP award.
Performance criteria for future LTIP awards are as set out below:
Performance level TSR% (vesting levels)
Below median 0
Median 25 
Upper quartile 100 
Top 10% LTIP multiplier of 2 times  
total grant amount
The number of awards vesting after the three year period will 
be determined based on a straight-line basis between median 
and top 10%.
Value sharing plan – A value sharing plan (LTIP multiplier) 
will be available if the TSR performance is within the top 10% 
at which point the level of the initial awards made may be 
increased to up to 2 times the original award.
Other beneﬁts – At present the Company does not provide 
pension, car, housing or other beneﬁts to UK employees, other 
than medical insurance. The Company will be considering 
pension arrangements over the next year.
The committee believes that TSR  
is the most appropriate metric  
given the current stage of growth. 68

The new remuneration policy is also aligned to the strategy and nature of the Company, reﬂecting the importance of total 
shareholder return and the long term nature of the Company’s business.
The committee has considered whether there are any aspects of the remuneration policy which could inadvertently encourage 
executives to take inappropriate risks and has concluded that the policy is appropriate in this regard.

Annual Report 2011
Directors’ report 
The Directors have pleasure in submitting the statutory ﬁnancial 
statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Principal activities and business review
London Mining is producing from its Marampa mine in Sierra 
Leone and developing two other iron ore mines in Saudi Arabia 
and Greenland as well as a coking coal operation in Colombia. 
All London Mining’s assets have deliverable production with 
potential for expansion.
A detailed Business Review for the Group as required by 
section 417 of the Companies Act 2006 can be found in the 
sections of this Annual Report as listed below. These comment 
on the operation and development of the business and its 
future prospects along with details of key performance 
indicators and the description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group.
• Chairman’s Statement on page 5;
• Chief Executive’s Strategic Review on pages 10 to 14;
• Key Performance Indicators on page 15;
• Operational and Financial Reviews on pages 22 to 35;
• Principle risks and uncertainties on pages 42 to 45;
This Business Review and other sections of this Annual Report 
contain forward looking statements. The extent to which the 
Company shareholders or anyone may rely on these forward 
looking statements is set out in section 7 of the Financial Review.
Dividends
The Directors recommend that no ﬁnal dividend be paid for the 
year. No interim dividend was paid during the year.
Share capital
The Company’s authorised and issued share capital as at 31 
December 2011, together with details of share allotments and 
purchases of own shares during the year, are set out in note 26 
on pages 97 and 98.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28 on 
pages 99 and 100.
Going concern
The ﬁnancial position, cash ﬂows and liquidity position of the 
Group are set out in the Financial Review on pages 31 to 35.
Following an equity placing of USD 87.3 million (net after fees) 
in 2012, London Mining has sufﬁcient committed liquidity to 
fund its committed expenditure. During 2011 management 
drew down its entire USD 90.0 million credit facility with 
Standard Chartered Bank. The facility is repayable in October 
2012, with an extension option of 12 months. The ability to 
exercise the extension option is subject to certain conditions 
which are under management’s control, in addition to credit 
approval from Standard Chartered Bank. Management expects 
to receive the necessary credit committee approval due to 
forecast cash generation and proﬁtability at the Sierra Leone 
operations in the second half of 2012 and in to 2013. In the 
unlikely event consent is not given by the lenders to the 
extension, the loan would become repayable in October 2012 
and management would need to seek alternative solutions to 
reﬁnance the facility, such as additional offtake, or debt 
funding, at that time.
The Directors have considered the Group’s cash ﬂow forecasts 
and projections, taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance and the timing of project 
commissioning and are satisﬁed that the Group has sufﬁcient 
committed liquidity to fund its committed expenditure and will 
be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly the Group continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
 
For the year ended 31 December 2011
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the Parent 
Company ﬁnancial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 
the proﬁt or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing 
these ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting Standard 
1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and 
ﬁnancial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Annual Report 2011 76
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of London Mining Plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash ﬂow statement and the related notes 1 to 35, the parent 
company balance sheet, the parent company statement of changes in equity, the parent company cash ﬂow statement and the 
related notes 1 to 5. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company 
ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware  
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2011 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Other matters
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that would have applied were the Company a quoted company.
Although not required to do so, the Directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate governance statement detailing the 
extent of their compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. We reviewed:
• the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ report, in relation to going concern; 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.

1. General information
London Mining Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and listed on the AIM stock 
exchange. The address of the registered ofﬁce is 103 Wigmore Street, London W1U 1QS. The nature of the Group’s operations 
and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the Operational and Financial Reviews on pages 22 to 35.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate funding resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the ﬁnancial statements (see page 71 of the Directors’ Report).
2. New and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
(a) Adoption of new and revised IFRSs
In the year ended 2011 the Group has adopted IAS 24 (Revised) Related party disclosures retrospectively with no impact on the 
Group’s results in the current or prior year. 
There are no other standards or interpretations which apply for the ﬁrst time in the year ended 31 December 2011 which are 
expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(b) New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015)
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IAS 27 (reissued) Separate Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IAS 28 (reissued) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IFRIC 20 Stripping costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013).
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on 
the ﬁnancial statements of the Group.
3. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
(a) Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The 
ﬁnancial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group 
ﬁnancial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain ﬁnancial instruments which are 
measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under section 405 of the Companies Act 2006 and consequently the income 
statement of the parent company is not presented as part of these ﬁnancial statements. The net loss recorded by the parent 
company for the ﬁnancial year amounted to USD 21.7 million (2010 loss: USD 94.3 million).
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group. All intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Investments in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture entity is an entity in which the Group holds a long term interest and shares joint control over the strategic, ﬁnancial 
and operating decisions with one or more other ventures under a contractual arrangement.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control, through 
participation in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee. 
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and investments in associates are incorporated in the ﬁnancial statements using 
the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011 83
Financial statements
London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
3. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of fair values of the identiﬁable assets of the associate at the date of 
acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for 
impairment as part of that investment. If the Group’s share of the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets of the associate at the 
date of acquisition exceeds the cost of acquisition the difference is credited in the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
(d) Foreign currencies
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at 
fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when fair value was 
determined. Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at 
the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classiﬁed as equity and are recognised in the Group’s 
foreign exchange reserve. On disposal these exchange differences are recycled to form part of the Group’s calculation of the 
proﬁt and loss on disposal.
(e) Business combinations and goodwill arising thereon 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued 
by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The 
acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities 
recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
(f) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction rather than continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when a sale is highly probable and 
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁcation. Disposal 
groups are groups of assets, and liabilities directly associated with those assets, that are to be disposed of together as a group in 
a single transaction. 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classiﬁed as held-for-sale are initially measured at the lower of carrying value and fair 
value less costs to sell. At subsequent reporting dates non-current assets (and disposal groups) are remeasured to the latest 
estimate of fair value less costs to sell. As a result of this remeasurement any impairment is recognised by charging to the 
Consolidated Income Statement, any increase in fair value is applied to reverse previous impairment charges on the non-current 
assets (or disposal groups) to a maximum of the original amortised cost. 
(g) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the net invoice value of goods and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after 
deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have passed, and when revenue can be measured 
reliably. This is generally when title and any insurance risk have passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a 
contractually agreed location.
Gains and losses on matured hedges are included within revenue as these pertain to gains or losses as iron ore hedges are 
settled and the actual price is received.
(h) Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognised in the 
income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
(i) Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, the accumulation of 
interest on provisions and foreign exchange losses. London Mining Plc

(j) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of any deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
(k) Intangible assets (exploration and evaluation expenditure)
The costs of exploration properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring prospective properties and exploration rights, 
are capitalised as intangible assets.
Mineral rights and exploration and evaluation costs arise from expenditure incurred prior to development activities and include the 
cost of acquiring and maintaining the rights to explore, investigate, examine and evaluate an area for mineralisation. These costs 
include metallurgical testing, conducting geological and environmental studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, market studies, 
engineering consulting and other such costs incurred in evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a 
mineral resource. 
Mineral rights and exploration and evaluation expenditure are capitalised within intangible assets until such time that the activities 
have reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially exploitable reserves. Once this 
has occurred, the respective costs previously held as intangible assets are transferred to mineral properties within property, plant 
and equipment. 
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for impairment in accordance with the indicators set out in IFRS 6 
Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Reserves. In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative costs 
relating to the property are written off.
(l) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Each item’s estimated useful life is based on the physical life limitation of the speciﬁc asset. Estimates of remaining useful lives are 
made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, plant and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Changes in 
estimates are accounted for prospectively and depreciation commences when the item is available for use.
Capitalisation ceases when commercial levels of production are achieved, at such point mineral properties are depreciated on a 
units of production basis based on proved and probable reserves.
Buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated down to their residual values at varying rates, on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives or life of the mine, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives normally vary from up to 10 years for items of 
plant and equipment to a maximum of 25 years for buildings. Fixtures and ﬁttings are depreciated over three years.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the year the item 
is derecognised. Assets under construction are capitalised and included as work in progress at purchase price plus directly 
attributable costs to bring the asset into working condition for its intended use. On completion construction in progress is 
transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
(m) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
ﬂows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately in the consolidated income statement. London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011 85
Financial statements
London Mining Plc
Annual Report 2011
3. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the Group of cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to 
beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group’s 
Board of Directors for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount of the CGUs or group of CGUs to which goodwill 
has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each ﬁnancial year, or when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Impairments 
of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
(n) Inventories
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business 
in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost for raw materials and consumables is purchase price and for 
work in progress and ﬁnished goods is the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and 
overheads. Raw materials and consumables are stated on a ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out (“FIFO”) basis. The cost of work in progress and 
ﬁnished goods is based on the weighted average cost method. In the case of work in progress and ﬁnished goods, cost includes 
an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal.
(o) Receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value net of an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. 
(p) Loans and receivables
In the consolidated balance sheet, the Group’s ﬁnancial assets investments have all been classiﬁed as “loans and receivables”. 
These are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The 
Company’s ﬁnancial asset investments include amounts owed by subsidiaries, classiﬁed as “loans and receivables” and equity 
holdings in subsidiaries and associates, which are held at cost less any provision for impairment. Provision is raised against these 
assets when there is a doubt over future realisation as a result of a known event or circumstance.
Derivatives embedded in ﬁnancial instruments (including rights to convert loan receivables to equity investments) or non-ﬁnancial 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host 
contracts and the host contracts themselves are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income 
statement. Changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Convertible bonds are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability and an equity component. At the date of issue, 
the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt and is 
recorded within borrowings and carried at amortised cost. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond 
and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the 
Group is included within equity.
(q) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
(r) Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs. Interest is accounted for 
on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the ﬁnancing of qualifying capital projects under construction is added to the capitalised 
cost of those projects during the construction phase, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 
sale which, in the case of mining properties, is when they are capable of commercial production. Where funds have been 
borrowed speciﬁcally to ﬁnance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the 
funds used to ﬁnance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of 
rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. 
They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
(s) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value or amortised cost.
(t) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which  
it is probable that an outﬂow of an economic beneﬁt will occur. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.  London Mining Plc

3. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
The Group has an obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs when environmental disturbance is 
caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining property. These costs are estimated on the basis of a formal 
closure plan and are subject to regular review. Such costs are discounted to net present value and are provided for and 
capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur costs arises. Provision is not made for additional 
obligations expected to arise from future disturbance and costs of subsequent site damage created on an ongoing basis  
during production are provided for at their net present values and charged against proﬁts as extraction progresses. 
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised and depreciated through operating costs.  
The provision is discounted to present value and the unwinding of the discount is included in ﬁnance costs.
(u) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(v) Share-based payments (including warrants)
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and consultants. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. The fair value is determined at grant date by use of a Black Scholes model and taking account of market-based 
vesting conditions.
(w) Return Bonus Plan
The London Mining Return Bonus Plan (the “RBP”) was adopted by the Group on 4 September 2008. Under the RBP, cash 
bonus awards can be made to participants in the London Mining Plc Share Option Plan, the London Mining Plc No. 1 (employees 
only) Share Option Plan (together, the “Plans”) and the LTIP if either a special dividend or return of share capital is made by the 
Company (the “Return of Cash”) after the date of grant of the bonus award but prior to the exercise/vesting of the related option/
LTIP award granted under the Plans/LTIP and no compensating adjustment is made to such option/LTIP award to take account of 
the Return of Cash. Participants in the LTIP have the choice to participate in the RBP or to have a compensatory adjustment made 
to the number of their underlying awards.
The bonus awards granted under the RBP entitle participants to receive a cash payment equal to the number of ordinary shares 
under the related option/LTIP award multiplied by the aggregate amount due per ordinary share under the Return of Cash. The 
bonus awards vest and lapse in accordance with the terms of the related option/LTIP award held under the Plans/LTIP, and are 
accounted for in accordance with the Group’s policy for share-based payments, set out above.
(x) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses iron ore forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts as derivatives to manage the 
risks associated with commodity and foreign exchange risks. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured  
to their fair value at each balance sheet date, using quoted market prices for derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are traded on an 
active market, or appropriate valuation techniques for those that are not traded on an active market. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in proﬁt or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument. The Group 
designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of ﬁrm 
commitments (cash ﬂow hedges). 
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised 
as a ﬁnancial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are 
presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
At the inception of a designated hedge accounting relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument has been and is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash ﬂows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised 
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss, and 
is included in the “other gains and losses” line item.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recycled to proﬁt or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in proﬁt or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship; the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised; or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in proﬁt or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in 
proﬁt or loss. London Mining Plc

3. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
(y) Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised in accordance with the Group’s policy on 
borrowing costs. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where 
another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic beneﬁts for the lease are consumed. 
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
(a) Impairment of assets
The Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets are impaired. The recoverable amount of those assets is measured at the higher of their fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use.
Directors necessarily apply their judgement in estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash ﬂows and in 
selecting appropriate discount rates and useful economic lives to be applied within the value in use calculation. Such estimates 
and forecasts include commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditure, future commissioning dates, production 
targets, operating costs and timelines of the granting of licences and permits. Subsequent changes to estimates and assumptions 
in the value in use calculation could impact the carrying value of the respective assets. 
The carrying value is also dependent on the estimate of mining reserves and resources, for which there are inherent uncertainties 
as the estimation is a subjective process based on the quality and quantity of available data.
(b) Valuation of share-based payments
In order to value options and warrants granted, the Group has made judgements as to the volatility of its own ordinary shares, the 
probable life of the options and warrants granted and the time of exercise of those options and warrants. During the year ended 
31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the Group has used Black Scholes methodology for valuing share-based payments. 
In prior years, the bi-nominal method was applied. This has not had a material impact on these accounts.
(c) Tax provisions
Judgement is required in determining tax positions for the Group as it is subject to tax in several jurisdictions. Assessments are 
made on the advice of independent tax advisers and through consultation with relevant tax authorities. While the Directors believe 
that these estimates and forecasts are reasonable, actual results could vary signiﬁcantly from these estimates.
(d) Estimation of provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs and timing of expenditure
Estimating the cost of settling the legal or constructive obligation for rehabilitation, including decommissioning and dismantling 
equipment and restoring the mine site from damage caused to the environment during the development can be complicated and 
subjective. These costs are likely to be signiﬁcant and are likely to be impacted by future regulatory obligations, future 
technological developments and the future costs of engineers and other skilled labour. Determining the timing of future cash ﬂows 
and an appropriate discount rate will also impact the provision required. 
Where Directors believe that the provisions for restoration and rehabilitation will be signiﬁcant, the Group obtains third-party 
valuations to estimate the likely cost. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the 
relevant facts and circumstances but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements.
5. Segment reporting
The Group operates in four principal geographical areas, Sierra Leone, Greenland, Saudi Arabia and Colombia.
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group’s results from continuing operations by reportable segment. The key segment result 
presented to the Board of Directors for strategic decision making and allocation of resources is EBITDA. Group EBITDA 
represents earnings/losses from operations excluding depreciation and amortisation, (and therefore excludes Group’s share of 
results of joint ventures and associates (net of tax) and impairments). Group EBITDA is analysed below.

  Details of the Return Bonus Plan (“RBP”) are set out in note 3 (w). Following the approval of the Return of Cash to shareholders of 200 pence per ordinary share at the General 
Meeting held on 10 November 2008, bonus awards were made under the RBP to all optionholders and two L TIP awardholders. Payments are due on vesting of the related option/
L TIP award. The USD 0.4 million charge to the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: USD 1.9 million) represents the non-cash charge. Cash payments 
in the year were USD 1.8 million (2010: USD 2.9 million) and a further USD 2.3 million is due (subject to the return bonus plan rules), payable over the next two years, of which 
USD 1.6 million will be covered by proceeds from the exercise of respective options granted in 2009.

On 5 May 2010 London Mining completed the 100% acquisition of London Mining Colombia, (formerly International Coal 
Company) for initial consideration of USD 5.5 million and 3.5 million newly issued London Mining shares. Potential further 
consideration of up to USD 8.5 million cash and up to 6.3 million in shares is payable subject to performance conditions. These 
conditions include meeting annual or cumulative EBITDA targets in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the completion of feasibility studies 
or the acquisition of mining concessions and port opportunities.
USD 18.2 million of expected deferred consideration was accrued and included in the goodwill recognised at acquisition, which 
related to expected cash payments of USD 5.0 million and issuance of 4.25 million shares.
At each reporting date the deferred consideration is re-stated to market value based on a re-assessment of the probability of the 
achievement of individual milestones and the fair value of cash and equity consideration. 
As at 31 December 2011 it has been concluded that certain performance conditions will no longer be met following a delay  
in expected production and increased capital expenditure relative to that assumed at acquisition, due to heavy rains and 
landslides resulting in road blockages and necessary design changes to the project. As a result cash and share consideration  
of USD 2.5 million and 2,500,000 respectively has been derecognised as at 31 December 2011. This has resulted in a fair value 
gain of USD 14.2 million recorded in the income statement. A further USD 0.5 million gain is recorded as a decrease in the fair 
value of outstanding share consideration (1,750,000) resulting from the fall in share price from GBP 3.15 as at 31 December 
2010 to GBP 2.97 as at 31 December 2011.
The fair value of contingent cash and share consideration has been discounted using a discount rate appropriate for the 
anticipated settlement dates. 
(b) Impairment
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of London Mining Colombia was attributed to the acquisition of land, environmental and 
construction permits and detailed plans to build coke ovens with a nameplate capacity of up to 400ktpa.
Heavy rains at the project resulted in landslides and road blockages and in addition certain design changes have been required to 
the conﬁguration of the project which has resulted in delays to expected production and in particular, to a delay in the expansion 
of the project to full planned capacity. In addition local market conditions for the purchase of coke have softened. Given these 
operational issues and delays the Group has recorded an impairment of USD 10.1 million against the carrying value of goodwill 
and recorded the charge within impairments in the income statement.
These same issues have also contributed to an offsetting gain in the income statement of USD 14.7 million as the result of 
deferred consideration no longer being payable. Of this USD 14.7 million fair value gain USD 10.1 million was valued and 
recorded in goodwill at the date of acquisition. 
Management’s focus is to optimise the operating performance and design of the Phase 1 ovens (200ktpa) prior to an assessment 
of an expansion to increase production to 400ktpa.
The impairment brings the carrying value of London Mining Colombia in line with fair value (less costs to sell), determined by a 
value in use calculation on the basis of latest prices and growth forecasts for commodity prices and exchange rates consistent 
with external sources of information and an asset life of 20 years, discounted appropriately at the Group’s weighted average cost 
of capital applicable to Colombia, and assumes the expansion to 400ktpa is delayed. The fair value is sensitive to changes in the 
assumed coke price and in the event market conditions worsened further this would result in an indication of further impairments.
(c) Merger reserve
Following the issue of the initial 3.5 million shares on acquisition, an amount of USD 12.0 million has been recognised in the 
merger reserve in relation to the fair value of shares issued over the nominal value, in accordance with Companies Act 2006. London Mining Plc

Mineral rights and evaluation and exploration costs consist of costs incurred on the exploration of the Group’s projects located in 
Greenland, Saudi Arabia and Colombia. 
The Group has certain licences which will be subject to renewal during 2012 but management has no reason to believe that these 
will not be renewed in the ordinary course of business. Mineral rights and exploration and evaluation costs will be transferred to 
property plant and equipment once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the respective projects is demonstrable. 
These costs will then be depreciated on a unit of production basis of tonnes mined over the proven and probable reserves. 
Software costs capitalised as intangible assets are amortised over three years. London Mining Plc

The forward contracts are designated and effective as cash ﬂow hedges and are due for settlement within one year. Proﬁt or loss 
will be affected with each settlement. All amounts have been recognised in other comprehensive income in the period.
The forward contracts have been highly effective in the period and no amounts have been recognised in proﬁt or loss in respect

In October 2011 the Group received USD 24.8 million in cash for its investment in DMC Group from Sable Mining Africa Limited. 
Full provision has been made at year end against the residual investment carrying value of USD 3.3 million, although management 
continues to pursue settlement of an agreement dated 19 January 2010 with the private investment vehicles of Heine van Niekerk 
and Pieter Wiese, (Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer respectively of DMC Group), which, inter alia, guaranteed 
that London Mining would receive total proceeds of USD 40.0 million in the event of the sale of DMC Group. London Mining is 
therefore due under the private agreement a further USD 15.2 million, which it expects to be paid in DMC shares. Approval has 
been received from The South African Regulatory Bank in respect of enforcement of the downside protection agreement. 
Management believes the Group has a very strong case to receive the downside protection but is uncertain on the timing of 
when this will occur. London Mining Plc

Non-current liabilities
Consideration for royalty payments 28,836 –
The liability for future royalty payments relates to the Anglo Paciﬁc (‘AP’) funding for the Greenland BFS. In return for the 
consideration of USD 30 million, AP is entitled to 1 – 1.4% of all future revenues of the Isua project in Greenland. The USD 30 
million has no interest accruing and is otherwise repayable if milestone targets are not met by pre-agreed dates:
a. The BFS being completed by 31 December 2012;
b. An exploitation licence obtained by 31 December 2013;
c. Commercial production not occurring before the long stop date of 30 June 2017;
d. A change in control; or
e. The revocation of any right of London Mining to the area deﬁned in the mining licence.
The consideration was received in August 2011 net of issue costs of USD 1.6 million at USD 28.4 million. Until commercial 
production when the liability will be extinguished and treated as a disposal of the Group’s economic interest in the Greenland 
project, a repayment obligation exists for USD 30 million. This has been treated as a ﬁnancial liability at amortised cost, being the 
principal less transaction costs plus accretion of the issue costs (see note 12), as the impact of discounting to a market rate of 
interest is immaterial. The carrying value at 31 December 2011 was USD 28.8 million.
The Directors consider the fair value of trade and other payables at 31 December 2011 not to be materially different to their 
carrying value.

24. Borrowings continued
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
(i)  The Bank loans are held with Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”) as an amended revolving credit facility dated July 2011.  
The facility tenure is for two years, ending in October 2012, with an extension option of 12 months. The ability to exercise  
the extension is subject to certain conditions which are under management’s control, in addition to credit committee approval 
from SCB. Although management expects to receive the necessary credit approval and roll the loan for 12 months, the loan  
is presented as a current liability in accordance with International Accounting Standards. 
  The total facility bears a blended interest rate at 5.5% above LIBOR, falling to 4.8% based on the ratio of EBITDA to net debt. 
The effective interest rate is 10.6%.
  The loans are secured on the Group’s assets and the Group is subject to ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial covenants. Interest is 
payable bi-annually. 
(ii)  The 1,100 senior, unsecured convertible loan notes were issued by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary London Mining 
(Jersey) Plc on 15 February 2011 at an issue price of USD 100,000 per note. The notes have a coupon of 8% per annum and 
are convertible into ordinary shares of the Company at any time between April 2011 and January 2016 at a conversion price of 
USD 7.71, representing a 38% premium to the share price of the ordinary shares at the date the convertible loan notes were 
issued (GBP 3.51) ﬁxed at an exchange rate of 1.5922. The maturity date of the bonds is 15 February 2016. 
  The Company has a call option to redeem the shares at par plus accrued interest from 15 February 2014 if the share price 
exceeds GBP 6.29 for more than 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days or at any time if 15% or fewer of the bonds remain 
outstanding. Interest of 8% per annum will be paid semi-annually up until that settlement date. 
  The net value received from the issue of the convertible loan notes have been split between the ﬁnancial liability element and 
an equity component, the latter representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the ﬁnancial liability into equity 
of the Company. The fair value of the liability component included in non-current borrowings at inception was calculated  
by discounting the future cash ﬂows using a market interest rate for an equivalent instrument without a conversion option.  
The discount rate applied was 13.0%.
  The equity component of USD 17.6 million has been credited to a convertible debt reserve. 
  The interest charged for the period is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 13.4%.

Restoration and decommissioning provision 1,405 –
The restoration and decommissioning provision is based on management’s best estimate of the cost of remediation of the current 
disturbance of the Marampa lease in Sierra Leone and is expected to be incurred at the end of the mine’s life. An equal amount 
is included within mineral properties of property, plant and equipment (see note 16). The provision has been recognised at 
31 December 2011, accordingly no amounts have been incurred or charged against the provision and no unwinding of discount 
has occurred.

In 2010 further shares were issued on the acquisition of International Coal Company (3,500,000) and on exercise of warrants 
by a consultant (500,000).
Employee Beneﬁt Trust
The Company established the EBT as a discretionary trust, for the beneﬁt of employees of the London Mining Group. The 
independent trustee of the Trust, Fenlight Trustees Limited (the “Trustee”) has agreed to purchase shares in the Company from 
the market and to use those shares to satisfy certain options or awards made under the terms of the Group’s LTIP and share 
options plans. During 2011 400,000 shares (2010: 4,718,884 shares) were distributed on the exercise of LTIP awards, no shares 
(2010: 100,000 shares) were transferred into a second discretionary trust, no shares (2010: 587,722 shares) were acquired 
in the year and no shares (2010: 2,812,781 shares) were sold during the year. The Group’s EBT had 1,267,000 shares at 
31 December 2011 (2010: 1,667,000). On 10 June 2010 100,000 shares were transferred to a second trust to hold jointly 
owned shares with a key management employee. At the year end this trust “Spartacus Trustees” held 100,000 jointly owned 
shares (2010: 100,000). These jointly held shares cannot be purchased from the trust by the employee until the third anniversary 
of the date of joint ownership.

28. Share-based payments
Share options and warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Company are granted to certain employees, Directors and 
consultants providing services to the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the closing quoted price of the 
Company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period varies from immediate settlement to three years and there may or may 
not be other vesting/performance conditions. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Each employee share option or LTIP award converts into one ordinary share on exercise. No amounts are paid or payable by the 
recipient on receipt of an LTIP award. An amount equal to the share price at the date of grant is payable by the recipient on the 
exercise of each option. The options carry neither rights to dividends nor voting rights. Options may be exercised at any time from 
the date of vesting to the date of their expiry.
The number of options granted is calculated in accordance with the performance-based formula approved by shareholders at 
a previous AGM and is subject to approval by the remuneration committee.

28. Share-based payments continued
Of the outstanding options, warrants and awards the following were outstanding:
• 7,535,999 options (2010: 5,994,999) 
• no warrants (2010: none) or JSOP options (2010: none)
• 314,592 LTIP awards (2010: none).
The related weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options and warrants exercised during 2011 was  
USD 4.87 (2010: USD 4.72). The options outstanding at the end of 31 December 2011 had a weighted average exercise price  
of USD 2.72 (2010: 2.30) and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.79 years (2010: 5.96 years). The inputs into the 
pricing model for all share options granted during the year and the preceding year were as follows:
2011 2010
Weighted average fair value of option (USD) 0.98 0.6145
Weighted average exercise price (USD) 4.8762 3.1005
Expected volatility 36% 38%
Expected life 2 years 1.80 years
Risk-free rates 0.52% – 1.05% 0.99%
Expected dividend yields 0% 0%
The estimated aggregate fair value of the options granted during the year to 31 December 2011 was USD 1.8 million  
(2010: USD 1.0 million).
Expected volatility of the options issued during the year to 31 December 2011 was determined by calculating the average volatility 
of the 90 days prior to the granting of the option. The expected volatility of any options or warrants issued during the prior year 
were determined on a weighted average basis using the average volatility between the 7 October 2007 date of listing on the Oslo 
Axess Stock Exchange and the date of grant. See note 6 for the total expense recognised in the income statement for share 
options and warrants granted to Directors and employees.

30. Contingent liabilities
The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
As part of the disposal of the Brazilian operations, London Mining granted certain warranties and indemnities to the purchaser, 
ArcelorMittal. Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes the likelihood of a material liability arising is remote.
In December 2011, London Mining was served with a claim by Fraser Turner Limited seeking declarations relating to its alleged 
entitlement to receive an additional royalty payment under the terms of a Facilitation Agreement dated 28 February 2007. As 
disclosed in London Mining’s Admission Document dated 3 November 2009, the agreement provides for the payment of an 
additional royalty payment per tonne of iron ore sold where the royalty payable by London Mining to the Government of Sierra 
Leone is reduced to a lower level than the Standard Government Royalty within 24 months following execution of the agreement. 
The amount of any additional royalty payment is limited to the difference between the Standard Government Royalty and the 
actual government royalty required to be paid by London Mining, capped at 2%. The Group believes that there was no reduction 
to a lower level and therefore the additional royalty payment is not payable and accordingly intends to vigorously defend the claim. 
As part of the acquisition of its Chinese joint venture, the vendor has an entitlement to receive further consideration of up to 
USD 38.6 million under consulting agreements payable subject to continuing employment for up to eight years and available cash 
in CGMR after the priority repayment of the Group’s USD 44.5 million initial investment and subsequent ingoing distribution 
rights. The Group has not recognised any provision for the year ended 31 December 2011 based on the Directors’ current 
expectation that the likelihood of the vendor being entitled to a material balance is remote. 
In December 2011 London Mining ﬁled an action against Wits Basin Precious Minerals Inc (“Wits Basin”), the Group’s partner in 
the CGMR joint venture, seeking the repayment of USD 1.0 million plus interest and costs of indebtedness on promissory notes.  
Wits Basin ﬁled an answer and counterclaim in January 2012 asserting that the loan is not yet due and claiming damages of  
at least USD 650.0 million for actions and breaches of ﬁduciary duty relating to the CGMR joint venture. London Mining believes 
the answer and counterclaim to be completely without merit with the chance of loss being remote, and there is no valid defence 
against repayment of the USD 1.0 million loan.
31. Financial instruments, risk management and exposure
(a) Financial risk and risk management
The following disclosures represent the risk management policies and procedures of the Group:
Credit Risk
The Group is principally exposed to credit risk from cash and cash equivalents and deposits held with ﬁnancial institutions, loans 
and other receivables. It is Group policy to manage credit risk by:
• Holding and investing cash in multiple, reputable ﬁnancial institutions
• Dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk.
i) Cash and cash equivalents
The objective in respect of cash and cash equivalents is to maximise returns whilst minimising risks. To maximise credit protection 
all cash and cash equivalents are held with a variety of major banks and invested in AAA funds to minimise credit risk. 
The policy of the Group is to hold funds at parent company level and minimise funds held within operating and service 
subsidiaries. This reduces credit risk by ensuring funds are held in higher rated funds. A cash call process occurs each month. 
Each subsidiary submits a monthly cash call with support to be approved and released by the parent company.
The Group has a policy of ensuring any signiﬁcant advance payments against major contracts are protected by bond or escrow.
ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables represent a potential credit risk due to the possibility of default.
Loans and other receivables primarily relate to advance and mobilisation payments to contractors.
Liquidity risk
The Group has sufﬁcient cash resources and available ﬁnancing facilities which provide liquidity to support Group strategy in the 
medium term. 
Certain of the Group’s mining projects require signiﬁcant additional ﬁnancing which represents a liquidity risk to the Group. 
To mitigate this risk bankable feasibility studies are conducted in advance of funds being committed or to support the raising of 
external ﬁnance. Forecast and actual cash ﬂows are monitored to estimate the timing and size of any funding gap. This is updated 
at least quarterly and presented to the Board. The forecast includes an expectation of when payments for capital contracts will 
be required. 
It is the policy of the Group not to enter into capital contracts such that commitments exceed available funds at any time. London Mining Plc

Market risk
i) Commodity price risk
Cash ﬂows are forecast using forecast prices for iron ore, coal and coke. Sensitivities are performed using a variety of commodity 
price assumptions to highlight commodity price risk. 
The Group has entered into commodity price derivatives this year as part of the agreed terms of the SCB facility (see note 20). 
It remains Group policy to not hedge commodity prices other than for strategic reasons.
On 26 January 2010 the Group entered into an offtake agreement that will cover 9.5 million of wet metric ton production from the 
Marampa project at a sales price directly correlated to the benchmark cfr China price. 
ii) Exchange rate risk 
The functional currency of all Group subsidiaries is the USD. Although the majority of the Group’s transactions are recorded in 
USD, some operating costs and investments are incurred in Sierra Leone Leones, British Pounds (“GBP”), Colombian Pesos, 
Danish Kroner, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Euro.
The Group manages foreign exchange risk by holding cash balances in USD and GBP for respective supplier payments. It is 
anticipated that future commercial transactions for the Group will be in USD which is the same as the functional currency of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. 
The Group policy is to negotiate contract terms where possible in USD to reduce exchange rate risk. A portion of the Group’s 
capital cost will be incurred in currencies which are not denominated in USD. This gives rise to an exchange rate risk in that the 
rate at the time of entering into a contract can be different to when payments are made. 
iii) Interest rate risk
Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of cash investments and ﬁnancing activities, giving rise to interest rate risks. 
The Group has no loans or receivables which have ﬂoating interest rates. 
As at 31 December 2011 the Group had drawn borrowings and therefore exposure to interest rates. The SCB facility of 
USD 90.0 million has a ﬂoating interest rate. The facility bears interest at 5.5% above LIBOR, falling to 4.8% based on the ratio  
of EBITDA to net debt. The effective interest rate is 10.6%.
The USD 110.0 million convertible loan has a ﬁxed interest rate of 8.00% (more detail on this is provided in note 24).
iv) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders.
Capital managed by the Group at December 2011 consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity  
holders of the parent. The capital structure is reviewed by management through regular internal and quarterly ﬁnancial  
reporting and forecasting. As at 31 December 2011 equity attributable to equity holders of the parent is USD 215.8 million,  
(2010 USD 244.4 million) whilst cash and cash equivalents amount to USD 67.8 million, (2010 USD 76.0 million).
The Group is subject to and has complied with externally imposed capital requirements relating to debt ratios as part of the  
SCB facility.
(b) Potential impact of market risks
i) Credit risk 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2011 was USD 77 million (2010: USD 104 million). The Group’s 
ﬁnancial assets do not represent a concentration of material exposure of credit risk.
The Group does not have any ﬁnancial assets that are past due or impaired except those noted in note 8.
ii) Liquidity risk 
At 31 December 2011, the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities consisted primarily of borrowings, trade and other payables and deferred 
consideration payable on the acquisition of London Mining (Colombia), and an amount of USD 2.3 million (2010: USD 3.8 million) 
accrued in respect of the Return Bonus plan, as discussed in note 6. 
iii) Sensitivity analysis
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables, derivative instruments, 
borrowings and trade and other payables. A change in exchange rates would have an immaterial impact on these instruments. 
A change in the interest rate will have a limited effect on proﬁt or loss due to borrowing costs being capitalised. A change in 
commodity prices would not affect proﬁt or loss as no forward contracts have been settled in 2011 and the Group made no sales. London Mining Plc

33. Related party transactions
At 31 December 2011 the Directors of the Group and their related parties, and entities in which they had a beneﬁcial interest, 
controlled 7.3% (2010: 6.4%) of the ordinary shares of the Company.
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, joint venture and its associates. Transactions between Group 
entities are eliminated on consolidation and are not included in this note. 
On 30 March 2010 London Mining acquired the remaining 80% of ICC (now “London Mining Colombia”). Graeme Hossie, the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of London Mining Plc, had a beneﬁcial interest of 12% in ICC and therefore received 15% of the 
consideration paid for the remaining 80% and will receive 15% of deferred contingent consideration. At 31 December 2011 the 
Group recognises this deferred contingent consideration at USD 10.6 million (note 9), of which Graeme Hossie would receive 
USD 1.6 million. 
On 30 July 2010 London Mining entered into a joint venture agreement with Chinese and Chilean-based partner Atacama to 
explore iron ore opportunities in Chile. In consideration for the 50% share capital of Atacama, London Mining converted a 
previously outstanding convertible loan of USD 5.0 million. London Mining also made available loans totalling USD 7.0 million to 
Atacama’s subsidiary, British Mining, to fund acquisitions of a number of concessions in the area and to get exclusive rights from 
joint venture partners on future iron prospects in Chile. At 31 December 2010 and 2011 a total of USD 6.5 million of loans had 
been drawn down by British Mining. Full provision has been made over the recoverability of these loans.

34. Events after the balance sheet date
On 16 January 2012 London Mining completed a sale and leaseback arrangement with Egon Oldendorff (Liberia) Inc 
(“Oldendorff”) in relation to the ﬂoating offshore transhipment vessel the “Pride of Marampa”. Under the arrangement, London 
Mining received net proceeds of USD 18.4 million from the sale of the vessel, and at the same time entered into a 10 year leasing 
agreement over the same vessel. This agreement represents a ﬁnance lease under which London Mining will record the vessel 
within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and recognise a liability for obligations payable under the lease. At 
31 December 2011 London Mining had trade creditors of USD 11.2 million in respect of amounts owing to the manufacturer of 
the vessel which was paid in January from the receipt of proceeds. The “Pride of Marampa” arrived and was discharged into 
Sierra Leone waters on 3 March 2012.
On 24 January 2012 the Company raised USD 87.3 million net of issue costs through placing 22,685,000 new ordinary shares 
at 255 pence per share. 11,199,214 shares were issued on 27 January 2012 with the remaining shares issued after shareholder 
approval was given at a general meeting held on 13 February 2012. The net proceeds are intended to be used primarily to fund 
acceleration of production at the Marampa iron ore project in Sierra Leone. Following the issue London Mining has a total of 
136,816,960 ordinary shares in issue and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Convertible Bonds, the conversion 
Price has been adjusted from GBP 4.8430 to GBP 4.7541.
On 28 March 2012, London Mining signed a USD 45 million prepayment agreement with the Vitol Group regarding the offtake 
of 2 million wet metric tonnes of iron ore per annum over ﬁve years, commencing in 2013 in parallel with London Mining’s ramp 
up in production to 5 million tonnes per annum. Pricing will be based off the Platts 63.5/63% Index and will include a premium 
to reﬂect the Fe content of the product. Subject to certain additional conditions being met, the facility may be increased to 
USD 55 million, and the offtake contract extended for a further year. The facility is repayable in two tranches over three and 
ﬁve years respectively, with no payments due in the ﬁrst 12 months.

“highly weathered material” The portion of the ore body that is often located on the surface that has been broken down 
in situ by environmental processes. This may result in the enrichment of iron and removal 
of gangue minerals. It typically requires less processing than unweathered material
“Indicated mineral resource” The part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical 
characteristics can be estimated with a level of conﬁdence sufﬁcient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of 
the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration 
and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations, such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological 
and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed
“Inferred mineral resource” The part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the 
basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not veriﬁed, 
geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes

characteristics are so well established that that they can be estimated with conﬁdence sufﬁcient 
to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production 
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed 
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely 
enough to conﬁrm both geological and grade continuity
“mineral resource” A concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilised organic material in or on 
the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from speciﬁc geological 
evidence and knowledge
“Mtpa” A million metric tonnes per annum

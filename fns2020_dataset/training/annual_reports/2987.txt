The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 2
Historical financial
information can be found
at www.cpwplc.com
As detailed in the financial statements on pages 36 to 66, the Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards with a transition date of 
28 March 2004. Consequently, while comparatives for 2004/05 have been restated, results for earlier periods are reported under UK GAAP throughout
this Annual Report. Where this materially distorts the trends on Headline financial information, adjustments have been made as noted. Chairman’s Statement
I
t has been a year of strong financial and operational
performance for the Group. The mobile phone
market has continued to grow steadily but our own
rate of growth has far exceeded it as we continue 
to invest in building scale and taking market share. 
On the fixed line side, we have supplemented our
strong organic growth with the acquisition of two
major competitors. The new financial year also
promises to be an exciting one, with the launch of 
our free broadband proposition in April stimulating
unprecedented consumer interest.
Group revenue for the period was £3,046.4m, compared
to £2,355.1m for the prior year, representing growth 
of 29.4%. Headline pre-tax profit was £136.1m, an
increase of 35.5% on the year to March 2005. Earnings
per share on the same basis grew by 33.8% to 12.38p.
Statutory profit before tax, after reorganisation costs 
of £35.2m and acquisition intangibles amortisation 
of £19.8m, decreased by 11.9% from £91.9m to
£81.0m, while statutory earnings per share decreased
by 5.3% from 8.44p to 7.99p. Cash generated from
operations increased by 16.5% from £168.6m to
£196.4m. The Board is proposing a final dividend of
1.75p, taking the total for the year to 2.50p, up 38.9%
on last year’s pay-out.
I believe there are two fundamental factors that make
Carphone Warehouse different from most other
companies: its approach to business, and the quality
of its people. It is a privilege to be involved with 
a company that makes bold business decisions, 
and will not compromise its ability to pursue long-term
strategic goals because of the risk to short-term
earnings targets. The launch of TalkTalk three years
ago showed the conviction and determination of the
management team to seize the opportunity with both
hands despite the short-term cost, and that approach
has been vindicated. The same is true today with the
planned investment in TalkTalk broadband and our
MVNO operations. It is worth noting that our share
register has remained remarkably stable over the last
three years, underlining the support for this approach
from our major external shareholders.
However, at the same time as pursuing new and
exciting opportunities, we continue to invest in our
core Distribution business. After opening over 550
stores over the last two years, we plan to open a
further 250 stores in the forthcoming year, to take our
total portfolio over 2,000 stores. New space continues

to generate a very attractive return for us, and we see
plenty of room for further growth in our ten markets.
We will continue to pursue our successful strategy 
of reinvesting the benefits of our increasing scale into
the customer proposition rather than our margin, to
establish a business with economics that remain
sustainable in the long term.
The year has seen a number of changes to the Board.
I would like to thank Hans Roger Snook for his three
years’ service as Chairman during a period of rapid
and successful growth for the Group. In addition,
Martin Dawes stepped down as a Non-Executive
Director, and just after the year end Geoffroy Roux 
de Bezieux relinquished his role as Chief Operating
Officer, Distribution, to run our new mobile venture in
France under the Virgin brand. Geoffroy has played 
a pivotal role in the successful development of our
retail proposition across Europe and I would like to
thank him for his significant contribution.
David Goldie, Chief Operating Officer, Telecoms, 
joined the Board during the year, and Andrew
Harrison, Chief Executive of the UK business, joined
just after the year end. We have also attracted three
new Non-Executives of the highest calibre in Steven
Esom, David Mansfield and Sally Morgan, and they
have already made valuable contributions to our 
Board discussions. 
As I highlighted above, the quality of the Group’s
people is a fundamental factor in its continued
success. This year we have welcomed more people
than ever before into the business, both through our
continued organic growth and the acquisitions we
have made. I would like to thank all our employees 
for their outstanding contributions and commitment.
Key achievements Chief Executive’s Review
I
am pleased to report that we have achieved another
year of strong growth. The Group floated over five
years ago now, and has grown at a rate that we could
never have predicted. However, we are absolutely
committed to approaching business as we always
have done: by being entrepreneurial, quick to act 
and opportunistic, within a broad strategic framework.
We retain the same flat structure and accountability
that has allowed us to thrive in the dynamic markets 
of the last fifteen years.
More importantly perhaps, we maintain a private
company mentality when it comes to investment 
and growth opportunities. Our focus is primarily 
on long-term value creation. As a result, we will
continue to invest in new business areas where we 
are confident of generating incremental growth in
future cash earnings, even if short-term returns are
depressed as a result. Business opportunities do not
conveniently arise in a timely or regular fashion, so it 
is an important aspect of our role as a management
team to communicate the scale, timing and impact 
of new business initiatives so that investors can make
informed decisions when short-term earnings are
depressed by investment.
Strategic context
Our strategic approach is built on three 
primary objectives:
• To continue to grow market share in all our
geographical markets, by investing in new store
openings, generating like-for-like growth from 
our existing estate, and developing additional
distribution channels;
• To maximise the lifetime value of our customers,
both by providing a level of service that encourages
repeat business, and by identifying relevant new
products and services where our brand, service 
and distribution give us an advantage over other
suppliers; and
• To become the leading alternative provider of fixed
line telecommunications services in the UK.
I wrote last year about the importance of combining
our key assets – stores, people, fixed line infrastructure
and supplier relationships – to provide a range of
services where we believe we have a sustainable
advantage. However, there is a further and crucial
element to this approach which is coming to define
the way we do business.
Whether in retail or telecoms, our goal is to create the
best possible value proposition for our customers. We
do this by aiming to control costs and drive volume
over margin. As scale or investment benefits accrue,
we look to reinvest those benefits in improving the
customer proposition and driving more volume, rather
than increasing margin. This creates a virtuous circle.
This is a familiar strategy in the retail industry, where a
number of companies with this mindset have achieved
very strong positions in their subsectors. At the same
time, there are numerous examples of companies that
have been too profitable for too long, thus becoming
uncompetitive and allowing new entrants to come in
and undercut them.
In the telecoms industry, the prevailing attitude seems
to be to price services according to what customers
are prepared to pay, and margins across the board are
generally high. Our approach, as highlighted in April
2006’s broadband launch, is to charge customers as
little as possible while still making a reasonable return
for the business. Thus our infrastructure investment
over the next 12 months gives us the opportunity to
pass on the bulk of our savings on regulated costs,
rather than improve our customer margins.
Growing our retail presence
At the start of the year we set a target of 250 store
openings across our ten markets, maintaining the
acceleration in roll-out from the previous year. In the
end we significantly exceeded this target, opening 
317 stores in the last 12 months. Of these, we 
opened 68 stores in the UK and 99 in Spain.
Our distribution strategy has been enhanced over the
last two years by the growth of our Online operations
in the UK, and the development of a franchise store
model in a number of markets. Through organic
growth and acquisition, our Online operations have
achieved compound annual connections growth of

We maintain a private 
company mentality when 
it comes to investment 
and growth opportunities Key targets
More recently, as telecoms markets have become
liberalised, we have recognised the potential for selling
fixed line services over the counter. In the UK, within
three years we have built a business in TalkTalk that
has a realistic opportunity to be the number one
alternative home telecoms provider in the UK, as 
I highlight below. But we are also now adding value 
in six other markets through selling fixed line services
in store to enhance our recurring revenue platform. 
One of our strategic challenges over the next two
years is to respond to the changes in market structure
that regulation is stimulating in each of these markets,
to ensure that we have the most appropriate business
model in place. For example, in some markets
customer spend is sufficiently high that we can
continue to be a pure reseller (with none of our own
network infrastructure) and still make an attractive
return. In other markets we may be better off simply
taking a commission from selling another provider’s
service than packaging our own. Either way, we 
are generating an incremental income stream from 
a predominantly fixed cost base.
Over the last 12 months we have brought a renewed
focus to our mobile virtual network operations (MVNOs),
where we buy wholesale capacity from mobile network
operators and repackage it under our own brand 
and tariffs. The UK launch of Mobile World, a service
providing market-beating rates for calls to international
destinations from a mobile handset, was very successful,
and we intend to roll out a similar service in a number
of other countries this year. We relaunched Fresh, 
our no-frills proposition, in October 2005, and again
demand exceeded our expectations. Although both
businesses are currently running at a loss, the lifetime
value of customers is greater than the profit on third
party pre-pay sales, making it an area of strategic
importance in the medium term.
Our biggest new initiative in the MVNO business is 
the launch of Virgin Mobile in France, a joint venture
between Carphone Warehouse and the Virgin Group.
We believe that the French market offers us a
significant opportunity to build a valuable business,
combining the strength of the Virgin brand with 
our own store network and market expertise. The
venture will make losses in the short term as we 
invest aggressively in growing scale, but we expect 
it to generate material incremental profits in the 
longer term.
43.0% over the last three years. The Online channel
remains a significant opportunity in other markets,
which as yet we have not succeeded in grasping. 
The franchise platform now extends to 140 stores 
out of the total portfolio of 1,778.
Both of these channels complement the core Retail
chain by increasing our overall scale. As our market
share grows in each territory we carry greater weight
with the network operators and our terms improve,
allowing us to stimulate volume growth through
investment in the customer proposition. At the same
time, our handset purchasing power continues to
increase. Importantly, we are increasingly seeking 
to differentiate our proposition through a focus on
handset range and availability. While price is clearly a
valuable benefit of scale, our ability to source exclusive
handsets or work in partnership with vendors to
develop new products will, we believe, be a more
significant driver of the business going forward. Our
ground-breaking deal with Motorola on the pink V3
over Christmas 2005 was a clear example of this
power and innovation.
Looking forward, we plan to open a further 250 stores
this year. Even in the UK, where we now have 669
stores, we continue to generate an excellent return on
our investment in new space. This gives us confidence
in our ability to grow our Retail presence and market
share across all our markets.
Maximising customer lifetime value
There are two core factors behind our focus on
customer lifetime value. Firstly, the consultative 
nature of our interaction with customers allows us 
to introduce additional products and services into the
sales mix, generating a significantly enhanced overall
return on our store investment. Secondly, the recurring
nature of these additional services improves the quality
and visibility of Group earnings.
Historically the main avenue for additional profits
beyond the point of sale has been through our
Insurance service. Ten years since its inception, we
have built it up into a business with nearly two million
customers, revenues of £116.1m and contribution 
of £45.5m. This service owes much to our stores and
our relationship with customers, and is the most
tangible evidence of our ability to leverage our retail
asset to deliver additional value to customers 
and shareholders alike.

CUSTOMERS BY MARCH 2009  Becoming the leading alternative fixed line 
provider in the UK
We have set our UK fixed line operations a bold
objective but one that we believe, with the combination
of assets that we have at our disposal, is achievable:
to become the leading alternative fixed line provider.
Four years ago, we had no presence in the fixed line
market. Through the combination of acquisitions and
strong organic growth, we have built a business that
now has a 10% share of the residential market for 
voice calls and is the clear number three operator. The
highlights of the year were our acquisitions of Onetel
and Tele2 UK, two of our biggest competitors in the
Carrier Pre-Select (CPS) market, which not only took our
combined customer base to 2.6m at the year end but
also underlined the success of our own business model. 
We have always maintained that the ability to recruit
customers through our store base has given us 
a much lower overall cost of customer acquisition, 
and our ownership of a highly efficient voice network 
in Opal has allowed us to generate an attractive and
sustainable margin on our tariffs. These deals
demonstrate that our strategy to date has been the
right one, and we expect the combined residential CPS
businesses to deliver a contribution of approximately
£50m in the coming year. A key goal this year will be 
to sell line rental as well as voice services to as many of
our customers as possible. While there is no additional
margin in the wholesale line rental product, it does
serve to strengthen the customer relationship. We aim
to have 60% of our CPS customers on our own line
rental service by March 2007.
The most important development of the last 12 months
has been the establishment by the regulator, Ofcom,
of a structure for the industry that encourages
infrastructure-based competition on a level playing
field. As a result, we have announced plans to invest
in local loop unbundling, a process that allows us to
install our own exchange equipment on BT’s premises,
and take over the copper wire between a customer’s
house and the local exchange at fair rates. 
On 11 April 2006, we were pleased to announce 
our new proposition: TalkTalk broadband for free, for
customers who take our line rental and Talk 3 calls
package. This offer has re-priced the broadband
market in the UK, undercutting similar bundled tariffs
from competitors by up to 60%. Our approach has

INVESTMENT
Our long-term approach to investment creates
sustainable competitive advantage in our
chosen markets. Investment is not just about
capex – although our commitment to store
openings and exchange unbundling is
significant – it is also about marketing, 
brand-building and customer recruitment.
PROPOSITION
We are absolutely committed to delivering
value to customers across all our services.
Investment in the right platforms is key to 
our ability to develop a compelling customer
proposition, as it allows us to build scale 
and offer greater value.
SCALE
We aim to be a mass market provider in our
major business lines by driving for volume
ahead of margin. We then use our increased
presence in the market to improve our supplier
terms and reinvest these benefits in the
customer proposition.
EFFICIENCY
Scale also creates significant efficiencies for
our business, through leveraging our fixed cost
store base and telecoms infrastructure. We
seek to maintain our competitive advantage 
by continued investment across the business. % OF CONTRIBUTION FROM

in sales and gross profit, but the strong trading
performance of the last two years creates ever higher
hurdles to clear. Growth in Ongoing (our ARPU sharing
agreements with networks) and Insurance will continue
to be driven by subscription connections.
On the fixed line side, the progress of the new
broadband proposition from TalkTalk will be crucial to
enhancing the long-term value of the Group. The outlook
is promising and the early customer take-up has far
exceeded our expectations, but we expect a more
concerted competitive response from other industry
players as the year progresses, and the major risks of
this new initiative lie in our ability to execute successfully.
In our MVNO operations we expect a year of intensive
customer recruitment as we build a business to 
deliver meaningful profitability in the future. Our
German service provision business, The Phone 
House Telecom, is already highly profitable, and we 
will continue to add customers to the base here, too.
However, profits are likely to be flat year-on-year, as
the amortisation of subscriber acquisition costs is
forecast to rise on the back of the strong subscriber
push of the last two years.
A strong corporate culture has always been a vital 
part of Carphone Warehouse’s success, and it is 
to the credit of all of our employees that this has 
been maintained during a period of high growth and
expansion. We have made significant demands of
everyone across the business this year and the
response has been uniformly positive. With the
acquisitions and our own organic growth, I am
delighted to welcome a further 3,000 people to 
the Group in the last 12 months, and the rate of
recruitment shows no sign of abating given the
opportunities ahead of us. We are lucky to have 
such a dedicated and talented workforce and 
I would like to say thank you to all of them for 
their continued efforts.
been totally consistent with our retail strategy: to favour
volume over margin, and pass on the benefits of scale
and investment to our customers. This is particularly
true in local loop unbundling, where the investment
profile favours those who are able to take significant
market share. The costs in the short-term will be
significant, with an estimated operating loss from the
project in the current year of £50m, and a cash outflow
of £110m. However, we are confident that the long
term economics of the business are highly attractive.
We have set an initial target of 3.5m residential
telecoms customers by March 2009, of which we
anticipate over half will be on the new bundled
package. Our focus now is on successful execution:
installing our equipment in BT’s exchanges as rapidly
as possible, building up call centre capacity and
expertise, and closely managing the process for
migrating customers from BT’s platform onto our own.
Importantly, our investment in infrastructure stands to
benefit our business-to-business telecoms operations
as well. We have a significant overlap between our
business and residential customers, thus giving us 
two opportunities to generate a good return on our
investment. Opal’s background is one of voice services
into businesses, but with an unbundled platform we
believe that there is a sizeable opportunity to sell data
services into the corporate market. Our plans in this
respect will evolve over the next 12 months.
Outlook
These are exciting times for Carphone Warehouse.
Prospects for the Distribution division are good. 
Mobile networks continue to compete aggressively 
for customers, stimulating the replacement cycle with
lower prices and better tariffs. The market is also
becoming more fragmented, with MVNOs increasingly
prevalent and adding to the breadth of choice available
to customers. Handset manufacturers are more active
than ever, and are now innovating in fashion and
design as much as in technology and functionality.
As outlined above, we will seek to take advantage of
these attractive market conditions through further rapid
expansion of our store base and the development 
of additional distribution channels. Our guidance of
15% growth in mobile connections for the coming 
year reflects the overall growth in our store portfolio. 
As always, we will strive to generate growth in
connections per store to drive like-for-like growth

T
he Distribution division comprises our Retail
operations and all directly-related business
streams. The key operating assets of the division 
are our 1,778 stores across 10 European countries
and our Retail and Online brands. Distribution
revenues grew by 22.0% in the year to £1,753.5m,
and the division generated Headline EBIT of £115.5m,
a rise of 38.7% on the prior year. Growth was strong
across all business units, with Online growth continuing
to be exceptional, supported by the acquisition of One
Stop Phone Shop in March 2005. From the year to
March 2007, we are combining our Retail and Online
business units for reporting purposes.
Retail and Online
The Group achieved 8.19m connections during the
year, representing year-on-year growth of 24.1%.
However, last year was a 53 week accounting period
and on an equivalent 52 week basis, connections
were up 26.0%. 
In subscription connections, the key driver for our
Distribution business, we achieved 52 week growth 
of 23.6% to 3.42m. Market conditions continued to 
be attractive, with further growth in the European
handset market driven by good customer offers 
and the strong handset pipeline. In addition, we
again enjoyed a year of improving execution, allying 
a focus on exclusive product with an aggressive
pricing strategy. We have now achieved compound
annual growth of 17.1% in subscription connections
over the last five years.
Our pre-pay business had a very good year, with 
52 week connections up 31.7% to 4.25m. The
strength of the overall pre-pay market continued
unabated, and we successfully invested in pricing 
to take market share from generalist retailers. Our
SIM-free sales were marginally up year-on-year 
at 0.52m, reflecting the relative strength of the 
pre-pay market.

We opened 362 new stores during the year and
closed 45. The total number of stores increased 
from 1,461 at March 2005 to 1,778 by March 2006.
The total includes 140 franchise stores (March 2005:
70 franchises). Total average selling space excluding
franchises increased by 13.3% to 83,128 sqm 
(2005: 73,399 sqm) and sales per square metre
increased by 4.7% to £16,547 (2005: £15,807). 
Total average selling space including franchises
increased by 16.2% to 87,871 sqm (2005: 75,619
sqm) and sales per square metre increased by 2.0%
to £15,654 (2005: £15,343).
Total Retail revenues grew by 18.6% and gross profit
by 23.1%. Like-for-like, after stripping out the impact
of new store openings and the 53rd week last year,
revenues grew by 5.9% and gross profit by 9.0%. 
The increase in revenues was driven by the strong
connections growth through the year, though offset 
by a fall in revenue per connection from £189.7 
to £185.2 driven by a change in mix.
Average cash gross profit per connection rose 
from £54.0 to £54.7. Gross profit per connection 
for subscription and pre-pay rose 2.9% and 6.9%
respectively, with the average increase of 1.4%
reflecting a higher proportion of pre-pay sales.
Contribution from Retail grew by 26.4% to £127.5m.
The contribution margin rose from 8.7% to 9.3%,
reflecting the strong growth in like-for-like gross profit.
The ratio between contribution and gross profit, which
gives a more meaningful indication of cost efficiency
given the variability of revenues per connection,
improved from 30.6% to 31.4%. Overall Retail direct
costs grew by 21.6%, driven by the greater store 
base and like-for-like growth in commission payments
to our sales consultants. Within these figures, total
rent costs increased by 17.3%, reflecting the rapid
increase in space over the last two years.
In the UK, our store portfolio increased from 601 
stores to 669 stores. New stores continue to generate
an attractive return and the impact on existing outlets is
minimal. We see ample opportunity for further expansion
despite our significant presence, and aim to open a
further 80 stores in the UK in the current year. Our focus
is on retail park units, arterial routes and smaller towns.
Our businesses outside the UK continued to grow
strongly. Spain is now our second largest market 
by some distance, with a portfolio of 338 stores.
Connections were up 23.7% on a 52 week basis.
During the year we acquired Planet Phone, a small
chain of stores acting as an exclusive distributor 
for Telefonica Moviles.
Our French operations enjoyed a year of better growth
after a subdued period of trading, as competition
between the networks began to intensify. We opened
35 stores, taking the portfolio to 220, and achieved 
52 week connections growth of 15.5%, with a better
performance in the second half. We are encouraged
by recent trends in France, with the launch of a
number of MVNOs, including our own Virgin Mobile
joint venture, set to stimulate the market further.
In The Netherlands and Sweden, our next most
important retail markets, connections fell marginally
year-on-year, after prolonged periods of strong market
growth. Both businesses continue to hold good
market positions and made significant contributions 
to overall Retail profitability. They have returned to
growth in the new financial year, and we continue 
to invest in new stores in these territories. 
Across our other five markets, comprising Belgium,
Germany, Ireland, Portugal and Switzerland, we
generated 52 week connections growth of 22.4%,
with all countries trading well. Switzerland, in particular,
achieved a very good turnaround from the poor
performance in the previous year, and after 12 months
of recovery we now intend to invest in further organic
growth in that market.
Online connections increased by 61.7% year-on-year
to 0.76m on a 52 week basis. Revenues were

stream represents an important element of our overall
commercial agreement with many networks. Again,
the key underlying driver for Ongoing is our
subscription connection sales.
Ongoing revenues grew by 25.6% to £58.4m year-
on-year (2005: £46.5m). This performance reflects 
the sustained strong subscription connections growth
over the last few years. We continue to view Ongoing
share as a vital element of our network agreements, 
as it provides us excellent earnings visibility and clearly
aligns our interests with those of the networks.
£203.5m (2005: £128.2m) and contribution was
£14.7m (2005: £7.7m). Underlying growth continued
to be strong as our web and direct sales activities
grew their market share, and overall performance was
boosted by the acquisition of One Stop Phone Shop,
a further online brand in the UK market, at the end 
of the previous year. We continue to review the
European opportunity for direct and online channels.
Insurance
The Group offers a range of insurance products to 
its retail customers, providing protection against 
the replacement cost of a lost, stolen or damaged
handset, as well as cover for any outstanding
contractual liability and the cost of any calls made 
if a mobile phone falls into the wrong hands. Insurance
is a core element of the Group’s customer proposition.
Our Insurance customer base continued to grow
strongly during the year. Overall the customer base
grew by 16.7% to 1.92m. Within this figure, the
business mix improved, with high tier policyholders
(typically mobile subscription customers) up 24.1%.
The non-UK base now represents 45.8% of the total.
Insurance revenues grew 13.8% to £116.1m (2005:
£102.0m) and contribution increased by 30.0% to
£45.5m (2005: £35.0m). The contribution margin
expanded significantly as we began to benefit from 
the scale of our operations in a number of markets,
fully underwriting our own business and the
investment in new systems developed in the prior year.
We continue to see good growth prospects in our
Insurance business. The main driver will continue to 
be growth in our subscription connections, but we
have also recently relaunched the product suite with 
a move to risk-based pricing, which allows us to tailor
individual policies much more closely to a customer’s
needs, while also matching the level of premium to 
the customer risk profile. 
Ongoing
Ongoing revenue represents the share of customer call
spend (or ARPU) we receive as a result of connecting
subscription customers to certain networks. We are
typically contractually entitled to our share of revenue
for as long as a customer is active, so this income

T
he Group’s Telecoms Services operations are 
split into two businesses, Mobile and Fixed. 
The Mobile business encompasses our German
service provision business, The Phone House
Telecom; our Facilities Management (FM) business,
managing mobile customers on behalf of networks 
in the UK and France; and our MVNO operations. 
The Fixed business primarily comprises Opal, our
business-to-business service and network operation,
and TalkTalk, our residential service, both in the 
UK. We also operate a number of smaller fixed 
line businesses across Europe. 
Telecoms Services revenues grew by 40.1% year-
on-year to £1,126.5m (2005: £804.0m), with good
growth across all major business lines. Headline 
EBIT increased by 16.5% to £26.4m (2005: £22.6m).
The Headline EBIT margin fell from 2.8% to 2.3% 
as we invested heavily in our broadband and 
MVNO strategies.
Mobile
Overall we achieved revenue growth of 21.7% 
to £459.8m (2005: £377.7m), with contribution 
rising 6.8% to £48.4m (2005: £45.3m). 
The Phone House Telecom, our German service
provision business, continued to perform well in 
a competitive market. The overall customer base 
was up 30.0%, and by March 2006 we had 1.17m
customers, of whom 0.82m were on two year
subscriptions. During the year we expanded our
distribution channels, as planned, by opening new
stores and signing up new distribution partners.
Revenues rose by 13.1% to £337.4m, with contribution
up by 40.1% to £49.8m. Subscription ARPUs fell, with
one or two new channels delivering significantly lower
customer ARPUs.
Total amortisation of SAC was £30.9m compared 
to £19.2m last year. The total cash cost of SAC during
the year was £44.7m (2005: £22.5m), with the rise
driven by our aggressive customer acquisition strategy.
We anticipate that in the coming year, SAC cash costs
will fall, with amortisation of SAC broadly in line with 
the cash cost.
Our MVNO operations recorded revenues of £46.2m
(2005: £18.6m) and a loss of £9.6m (2005: contribution
of £1.9m), reflecting our investment in building this
segment. Our main goal for the year has been to
relaunch our UK MVNO operations. At the start of

annualised. In addition, Opal benefited from the
inclusion of three months of revenue from the Onetel
business base, acquired in December 2005. 
The overall business environment continued to 
be competitive, which had a negative effect on
contribution margin. Opal’s contribution fell from
£30.6m to £28.0m. However, the year saw investment
in new areas such as TalkTalk Business, targeting the
lower end of the small business market. Customer
take-up has been very encouraging and profits from
this unit, as well as a full year contribution from
Onetel’s business customer base, are expected to
drive strong growth in underlying profits at Opal in 
the coming year. 
From a network perspective, Opal is making good
progress in the development of its own “21st Century
Network” and the local loop unbundling programme.
The new network structure will allow Opal to carry
voice and data over the same platform, reducing 
unit costs and creating opportunities for additional
services. The installation of our own equipment into
BT’s premises to enable us to unbundle customer lines
is a fundamental part of the new network, with Opal’s
business operations set to benefit from the increased
flexibility and lower regulated costs in the same way 
as TalkTalk. A key goal for the year ahead is to develop
our expertise in providing broadband and related
network services to our core business customer base.
Xtra, our Spanish fixed line network, recorded revenues
of £34.7m (2005: £29.6m) and contribution of £1.6m
(2005: £0.9m).
Total residential revenues rose from £159.0m to
£372.0m, and contribution rose to £31.4m (2005:
£2.9m). Our UK residential fixed line service, TalkTalk,
is the main driver of revenues and profitability,
recording turnover of £305.6m and contribution 
of £24.3m during the year, including the impact 
of the Onetel and Tele2 UK acquisitions. After SAC
amortisation of £5.7m relating to broadband
customers (2005: £0.6m) contribution was £18.6m.
The main focus for TalkTalk continued to be customer
recruitment, both through Carphone Warehouse stores
and third party channels. At March 2006 we had 2.6m
residential fixed line customers in the UK up from 0.9m
at March 2005. This was significantly enhanced by the
acquisition of two of our main competitors in the CPS
the year we introduced a new MVNO concept, 
Mobile World, to the market, offering significant
discounts on calls to international numbers. We
believe Mobile World can be exported to a number 
of our other markets. We relaunched Fresh, our 
no frills MVNO service in the UK, in October 2005.
The response has been promising, and we continue 
to refine the proposition.
Our regional MVNO in France, Breizh Mobile,
continued to make good progress in customer
recruitment in Brittany. Just after the year end, we
launched Virgin Mobile France, a joint venture with 
the Virgin Group, as a nationwide MVNO, with the
Breizh operations forming part of the venture. We 
are targeting one million customers within three years,
and are confident that we can build the business into
an effective fourth operator in the French market.
FM revenues were £76.2m (2005: £60.9) and
contribution was £8.2m (2005: £7.8m) Our UK FM
base of customers managed on behalf of O2 and
Vodafone rose 25.2% to 0.88m (2005: 0.67m). 
The contract with Vodafone expires in the summer,
consistent with Vodafone’s strategy of progressively
taking all customer management in house, but this is
not expected to have a material impact on profitability.
The key drivers of our FM businesses are the number
of customers under management, the quality of
service we provide and our ability to retain customers.
We continue to manage 0.6m customers in France on
behalf of Orange and SFR, and will also provide call
centre services to the new Virgin Mobile operation. 
Fixed
Our fixed line operations continued to grow rapidly,
with strong organic growth from customer recruitment
boosted by two significant acquisitions during the year.
Total revenues were £666.7m, up 56.4% year-on-year,
and contribution was £61.1m, a rise of 78.0%. 
Total revenues from business-to-business operations
were £294.7m (2005: £267.3m), and contribution 
was £29.7m (2005: £31.5m). Opal, our UK network
provider, generated revenues of £259.9m, an increase
of 9.3% (2005: £237.7m). Revenues in the first half
were adversely affected by the regulatory cuts to
mobile termination rates made in September 2004,
reducing average revenue per minute by approximately
12% over that period. As expected, revenue growth
picked up in the second half as these effects

PROMISING TRENDS
21ST CENTURY NETWORK 
IN DEVELOPMENT Telecoms Services Division continued
market, Onetel and Tele2 UK, in December 2005,
bringing an additional 1.3m residential customers into
the Group. We have made significant progress on the
integration of these businesses into TalkTalk, a process
that will be completed later this year when we finish
migrating Onetel’s traffic and customers onto our own
network and billing platform. A reorganisation provision
of £22.3m has been made for the cash costs arising
from the integration of the Onetel business.
The market pricing structure for the provision of line
rental to customers was finally addressed during the
year, allowing us to start billing customers for their line
as well as their calls. Previously, the wholesale price
available from BT had been higher than BT’s own 
retail price. Following this change we now have
722,000 customers on a unified bill for calls and line
rental, equating to 28% of the total UK base. Our
target is to increase this to 60% of the voice base in
the coming year, because although line rental is still a
zero margin product, it does increase customer tenure.
During the year we finalised our strategic review 
of the options for providing broadband to residential
customers. As a result of the clear regulatory
framework established by Ofcom and the undertakings
made by BT, in conjunction with our own review of the
market, we announced in November 2005 our plans to
invest in local loop unbundling. Our initial goal was to
install our equipment within 1,000 BT exchanges over
the next three years at a cost of approximately £50m.
Subsequent to the year end, we have launched our
commercial proposition for broadband in the UK: the
provision of free broadband, forever, for customers
taking our line rental and inclusive calls package. To
support this aggressive strategy, we have accelerated
our investment programme, and now aim to have
1,000 exchanges unbundled by May 2007, giving 
us nearly 70% coverage of the population. 
Our longer term goal is a base of 3.5m residential
customers by March 2009, of which at least half will
be on our new bundled broadband proposition. In the
short-term, the costs of recruitment will be high, as a
significant proportion of customers will be loss-making
for us before they are migrated onto unbundled lines:
we anticipate a total operating loss from the project of
approximately £50m in the year to March 2007, with
free cash outflow (after capex and the full cash costs
of acquiring customers) of around £110m. We are
provisionally forecasting an incremental operating 
profit from the project of £30-40m in the year to 
March 2008, and a full payback on the cash
investment within four years.
Our non-UK residential fixed line operations made
steady progress during the year. We now provide
services in Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain
and Switzerland. At the year end we had 341,000
fixed line customers outside the UK, generating
revenues of £66.4m (2005: £35.4m) and contribution
of £7.1m (2005: £1.8m). Throughout Europe our fixed
line model benefits from the low cost of customer
acquisition that our store network gives us. We are
reviewing our product strategy in each country to
reflect market developments, so that in all cases 
we are achieving the maximum return for the Group
from each customer.

Cash generation remains a prime objective of the Group,
allowing us to reinvest in the growth of the business and
pursue a progressive dividend policy. We are proposing
a final dividend of 1.75p per share, taking the total
dividend for the financial year to 2.50p and representing
growth of 38.9% over last year’s 1.80p total dividend,
slightly ahead of Headline EPS growth. The ex-dividend
date is Wednesday 5 July 2006, with a record date of
Friday 7 July 2006 and an intended payment date of
Friday 4 August 2006.

Acquisitions
The Group made the following acquisitions during 
the year:
Intangible assets arising
Net cash Acquisition
considerationintangibles Goodwill
£m £m £m
Onetel 134.6 62.2 96.1
Tele2 UK 8.2 2.0 9.8
Hugh Symons 5.2 – 9.5
Other 9.8 4.4 3.7
157.8 68.6 119.1
Acquisition intangibles relate to customer bases and 
a distribution agreement.
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles and 
goodwill expense
The amortisation charge in respect of acquisition
intangibles amounted to £18.0m (2005: £7.5m), the
increase principally reflecting the Onetel acquisition. 
A goodwill expense of £1.8m (2005: £1.0m) has been
recognised on acquired deferred tax assets that had
not previously been recognised. These figures are
excluded from Headline profit before tax and earnings
per share figures.
Reorganisation costs
Following the acquisition of Onetel in December 2005,
we have commenced a reorganisation programme to
integrate Onetel with the rest of the Group. The costs
of this integration are estimated at £22.3m, reflecting
redundancy and other employee costs, contract
termination costs and network and customer migration
costs. These costs have been recognised in the
reported financial year. The substantial customer
growth achieved through the acquisition of Onetel and
Tele2 UK, together with the Group’s major investment
plans in respect of local loop unbundling and billing
platforms, prompted a review during the period of the
Group’s systems and network infrastructure. This
review resulted in an accelerated amortisation charge
of £12.9m in respect of certain billing, customer

HEADLINE EARNINGS 
PER SHARE UP 33.8%
DIVIDEND UP 38.9%
OPERATING CASH FLOW 
OF £196.4M Financial Performance continued
Total investment increased from £159.9m to £351.1m
year-on-year. In addition to the acquisitions noted
above, the increase reflects an uplift in subscriber
acquisition costs from £25.6m to £51.6m, and a
substantial increase in investment in the Group’s IT
systems and infrastructure.
Balance sheet
The investment described above resulted in an
increase in non-current assets from £730.3m to
£1,014.9m year-on-year.
Acquisitions and organic growth in both Distribution
and Telecoms Services are reflected in an increase in
trade and other receivables from £353.9m to £554.5m.
Correspondingly, there is a year-on-year increase in
trade and other payables from £458.7m to £642.0m.
Provisions have increased from £57.8m to £123.5m
during the year, reflecting reorganisation costs and
other provisions associated with Onetel, and an
increase in sales provisions, principally in respect 
of “cashback” promotions, the anticipated costs 
of which are provided for on sale.
Net deferred tax assets have increased from £0.5m 
to £34.9m, the largest driver of which is deferred 
tax on share-based payments.
Financing and treasury
The Group’s operations are financed by committed
bank facilities, retained profits and equity. During the
period, the Group increased the revolving credit facility
that was originally signed in September 2004 to £450m.
This increased facility will expire in September 2009.
New term loans, totalling £275m, were also agreed
during the period, both to refinance the existing term
loan and to assist with the acquisition of Onetel in
December 2005. A £225m term loan, which expires in
February 2011, was syndicated and was arranged by
HSBC PLC, ING Bank NV, London Branch and The
Royal Bank of Scotland PLC. A £50m bilateral facility
was agreed with The Royal Bank of Scotland (Ireland)
and this facility expires in December 2010. The terms of
all three facilities are similar and the covenant packages
are identical. 
Net borrowings peaked at the end of 2005, mainly 
as a result of the Onetel and Tele2 UK acquisitions 
and the high working capital levels required during 
the peak Christmas trading period. The Group seeks
to maintain comfortable headroom on its committed
facilities at all times.
In addition to the revolving credit facility, the Group 
has a number of uncommitted loan facilities, overdrafts
and guarantee lines – all technically repayable on
demand – which enable it to optimise cash
management efficiency, particularly at times of peak
working capital requirements. Cash and investments
held for insurance purposes of approximately £77m
(2005: £89m) are not immediately available to the
Group. These funds are invested to maximise returns
whilst ensuring at all times that such investments 
are within acceptable risk parameters.
Funding of our subsidiaries is arranged centrally. 
All cross-border funding is provided on an arm’s 
length basis and currency risk is hedged using 
foreign exchange swaps or currency borrowings, 
as appropriate, at all times. Other than through 
inter-company loans and capital funding, balance
sheet translational risk is not hedged against adverse
movements in exchange rates and the results of any
such movements are taken to reserves. The Group 
is exposed to limited cross-border transactional
commitments and, where significant, these are hedged
at inception using forward currency contracts.
Treasury policy permits the use of long-term derivative
treasury products for the management of currency 
and interest rate risk and the Group’s interest rate
exposures are monitored regularly. The Group does
not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.
Return on capital employed 
Total shareholders’ funds at March 2006 were
£619.0m, compared to £548.0m at March 2005. 
After taking into account average net debt, and
adjusting for the amortisation of acquisition intangibles
and goodwill arising on historic minority acquisitions,
the Group generated a return on capital employed 
of 16.9% (2005: 17.8%).
Assuming a weighted average cost of capital for 
the period of 6.6% (2005: 6.9%), this represents 
an increase in economic value added from £52.0m 
to £69.4m, being 11.0% and 10.3% respectively.

volunteer opportunities. In March 2006 Charles
Dunstone and Andrew Harrison hosted the second
charity auction at BAFTA, Piccadilly. With continued
support from suppliers and partners the charitable
income increased to over £107,000. Employees and
guests at the annual company ball raised an additional
£30,000 for Get Connected’s valuable work.
TreeHouse
The aim of TalkTalk is to enable people to communicate,
making TreeHouse an ideal partner. TreeHouse was
established in response to the huge unmet national
need for specialist education for children with autism.
Its aim is to provide an educational centre of
excellence for children with autism and related
communication disorders. TalkTalk has committed 
to donate 1 penny from every call to its directory
enquiries service to help support its work as well as
introducing them into the charity partnership to offer
employees the opportunity to volunteer and raise
funds. TreeHouse has recently launched an appeal 
for £11.5 million to construct a permanent building
that will enable it to increase its support of children 
in need of specialist education. TalkTalk is committed
to helping TreeHouse to see this ambition realised.
Namibia Trek
One of the year’s highlights for both employees and
charities was a trek with a difference to Namibia.
Building on the huge success of previous treks, 
61 employees each raised £2,000 to travel to Namibia
and undertake a project to renovate a school in 
a hugely deprived area in the heart of the Namib
Desert. As well as dramatically improving the lives 
of children who attend the school, the project also
raised in excess of £50,000 for our partner charities
supporting the needs of children in the UK. 
Helping with Homelessness
We have continued our work with Business Action on
Homelessness (BAOH), helping to develop skills and

T
he Group has a strong track record as a responsible
employer, consumer and distributor. This year we
have demonstrated a further increase in our level of
commitment in all key areas of corporate responsibility
from our charity, community and employee activities 
to our social and regulatory responsibilities.
We have a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) manager who co-ordinates strategy and 
actions across both elements, interacting with 
senior management within business operations,
human resources and communications. Following 
the retirement of Martin Dawes at last year’s Annual
General Meeting, we are delighted that Sally Morgan
has agreed to act as Board sponsor of the Group’s
CSR activities.
Charity, community and employee activities
The Carphone Warehouse continued its support of its
two partner charities, Barnardo’s and Get Connected,
with a wide range of activities. The expansion of
TalkTalk, The Carphone Warehouse’s fixed line service,
has enabled it to take on its own partner charity,
TreeHouse, supporting the needs of children with
autism throughout the UK. The Carphone Warehouse
UK Foundation has also maintained its work,
supporting smaller charities nominated by employees,
and this year will expand its activities to provide more
support for local communities. The Group supports
the partnership in many ways, from donating gifts for
sales and raffles, offering extra holiday for employees
undertaking overseas treks and other specific
volunteering activities, to donating profits from sales 
of accessories over the Christmas period.
Get Connected
The Carphone Warehouse has maintained and
developed its six year relationship with Get Connected
providing accommodation, phone lines and IT support
as well as offering employees the opportunity to earn
extra holiday or have matched time off to volunteer. 
In 2005 we undertook improvements to the charity’s
Governance Corporate Responsibility continued
confidence in people who have been homeless by
offering two-week work placements. This is a critical
part of helping them back into the work place and, as
well as developing vocational skills, individuals are also
assisted with advice on CVs and interview techniques.
We have continued supporting Crisis Open Christmas,
offering employees a day’s leave to volunteer in one
of the many shelters set up to provide support for
those who are homeless and alone at Christmas. 
We also provide Crisis with support by providing
mobile communications.
Employees
Our dedicated Human Resources departments
continue to review and improve processes to ensure
that the work environment, recruitment, training
processes and employee satisfaction are of the
highest standard. Each year we ask our employees
how they feel about CPW through BackChat, a
completely anonymous online questionnaire that
enables us to examine the attitudes of every employee
to all aspects of the business.
One of the areas highlighted in the 2004 report was
that although the majority of employees felt that they
could meet the requirements of their jobs without
working excessive hours, this was still an area that
could be improved upon. With this as a focus the
introduction of initiatives such as core working hours,
allowing more flexibility in the work place, have
resulted in an 8% increase in favourable scores. 
Last year 83% of employees felt that the training 
and development they received was valuable and
worthwhile, and increased training opportunities have
meant that the number of employees receiving training
has increased this year by 6%. In addition to internal
year-on-year comparisons we are able to compare our
results to those of the external benchmarking norms
which show very positive scores with particular
highlights being:
• 69% of employees are confident that on important
matters their feelings/thoughts are communicated
upwards by their manager, 14% higher than 
the benchmark;
• 83% are proud to work for The Carphone
Warehouse, 15% above the benchmark; and
• 65% of employees feel that change is managed
effectively which is 32% above the benchmark and a
great achievement in an organisation with high growth.
Once again we will take the results of the survey to
focus our activities across the Group to address areas
that have not seen the improved results we would like.
A range of incentives helps boost pay and self-
esteem, from earning up to £2,000 for recommending
friends for a job to an annual awards ceremony hosted
by celebrities, monthly beer nights and other events
such as the company ball also strengthen working
relationships. The Sunday Times 100 Best Company
survey revealed that 81% of employees say their team
is fun to work with and that their colleagues care a lot
about each other. 
Diversity and inclusion
The Group recognises the importance of diversity 
and inclusion, and has systems in place to recruit
employees of different genders, ages, disabilities and
ethnic origins. We recruit using totaljobs.com and
jobability.com, the leading job site for disabled people,
as well as through a number of ethnic magazines.

To ensure that we are offering disabled customers 
the ability to obtain goods and services in just 
the same way as any other customer we have 
a special needs section on our retail website
(www.carphonewarehouse.com), dedicated phone
numbers for our customers, customer care packs
containing magnifying glasses and easy-grip pens 
and billing in a number of formats for the visually
impaired. Our corporate website complies with the
Royal National Institute of the Blind’s “See It Right”
accessibility criteria and priority level 1 criteria of 
the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.
Induction loops have been provided to all stores, 
and drop counters are now fitted in new stores 
as standard. Over 90% of our UK stores are fully
accessible for wheelchair users. To assist customers,
we have published a list of stores with access
difficulties on our website, with suggested 
alternative stores in the area.
Adult content
We continue to take the risks associated with adult
content seriously and have introduced a code of
practice in the UK to apply to all Carphone Warehouse
branded web channels. As well as clearly classifying
content as suitable for adults only, we include
prerequisites to purchasing – such as only selling via
credit card to ensure that a customer is over 18. This
year we aim to introduce guidelines to address the 
risks associated with children accessing the internet 
via mobile and to advise parents on how best to 
set up mobile technology to prevent such access.
Environment
Our stores have a requirement to ensure that all
packaging and store waste is returned to our
warehouses to be recycled and re-used. The UK
The Group is implementing an online recruitment
system and is also committed to putting in systems 
to measure diversity across the Group. Gender and
race are now voluntarily recorded via BackChat to
enable us to monitor inclusion and recruit and promote
to specific audiences that we feel are under-represented.
Regulatory and social responsibilities
We continue to operate in a relatively low impact
industry and our meetings and discussions with 
Group businesses on social, environmental and 
ethical matters give us confidence both that the risks
to our business in these areas are relatively low, and
also that controls are in place to ensure compliance
with new laws and regulations where necessary.
Below we have identified the key regulatory and social
risks currently affecting the Group. We have aimed to
focus our update on areas where there has been a
change in regulation or our approach during the year,
or where new regulation is on its way. In other areas
such as mobile phone crime and safe driving, there
has been no material development, and our approach
to these social issues is addressed in previous years’
annual reports.
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive &
Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances
Due to further industry consultation, the
implementation of the Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) Directive has been delayed to later
in 2006. However, we are confident that we have the
processes in place to ensure compliance with the
objectives and obligations set out in the directive 
when they are finalised.
The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous
Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
Regulations 2005 Directive will be in force in the 
UK on 1 July 2006 and a working group has been
actively ensuring compliance in line with this date.

MAJOR REVIEW OF 
CARBON EMISSIONS Corporate Responsibility continued
monthly buyers’ guide is made from chlorine free
paper and from wood from sustainable forests. 
In addition, the Group has made a commitment to
ensure that all cleaning products used in its stores and
at the Support Centre are non-toxic and eco-friendly.
We actively promote non-legislative recycling initiatives
encouraging the recycling of paper, toner cartridges,
batteries and drinks cans.
Handset recycling
In an era of global warming and dwindling natural
resources, we are very concerned with the disposal 
of redundant mobile handsets and offer a service to
dispose of old phones responsibly and raise valuable
funds for charity. For every handset received, The
Carphone Warehouse is donating £10 to The CPW
Charity Partnership. 
Funds will be shared between our charity partners. Re-
use is the best form of recycling and this is the focus of
The Carphone Warehouse Recycling Campaign. If a
phone cannot be re-used it will be recycled in
accordance with UK and European legislation.
Carbon emissions 
The last year saw the start of a major review of our
utilities consumption and CO
2
emissions, and the
findings of the review are being addressed over the
coming months. We will be working with recognised
bodies to offset our carbon emissions. As a result, we
expect to be the first UK retailer with a zero emission
distribution fleet (through offset) during the course of
the coming year.
Other specific measures we plan to put in place 
during the year include:
• Piloting a low carbon emission retail format;
• Reducing carbon emissions across our major 
sites; and
• Upgrading the distribution fleet and evaluating
alternative fuel sources.
Mobile phones and health
Despite new studies in the British Medical Journal
declaring that mobile phones are unlikely to damage
health we will continue to support research into the
effects of mobile phones on health. Additionally, 
The Carphone Warehouse continues to provide
customers with all of the information on mobile 
phones and health concerns to enable them to 
make informed decisions. An independent and
extensive health fact sheet is available in our 
stores and on our website. We also continue to 
list specific absorption rates for every handset in 
our buyers’ guide every month, and on our website.

The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 22
proposed at this year’s Annual General Meeting on 27 July 2006 (AGM).
Charles Dunstone is the Chief Executive Officer, John Gildersleeve is
Non-Executive Chairman, David Ross is Non-Executive Deputy
Chairman and Sir Brian Pitman is the Senior Independent Director. All
new Directors went through a formal process of induction principally
carried out by the Company Secretary.
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual
General Meeting following appointment and thereafter to re-election at
least every three years. Each Executive Director and David Ross has 
a service contract that can be terminated by either the Company or 
the Director on twelve-months’ notice or less.
The Non-Executive Directors, apart from David Ross, have three-year
periods of appointment, the terms of which are substantially in the same
format as suggested by the Code, with three-month notice periods and
no compensation for loss of office. Further details on each Director’s
remuneration, including the dates of their contracts with the Company,
are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 32.
Board meetings
The Board meets at least six times a year, with additional meetings 
as required. The Board met seven times formally during the period
(including a Strategy Day). All Directors formally attended these meetings
with the exception of Sir Brian Pitman, who was absent for the Board
meetings held on 26 May 2005, 27 July 2005 (Strategy Day) and 28 July
2005 and Steven Esom and Geoffroy Roux de Bezieux who were both
absent from the meeting held on 30 March 2006. These absences were
due to prior engagements that could not be changed. The Company
Secretary ensures that all Board papers are sent out to non-attending
Directors and that, where possible, any comments they have are
received beforehand so that they can be expressed at the meeting.
Operation of the Board
The wide range of experience and expertise of the Non-Executive
Directors, combined with the skill sets of the Executive Directors,
provides vast experience of retailing, mobile and fixed line
telecommunications and general business experience, strong 
personal skills and independence of thought and perspective. 
The overriding responsibility of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial
and responsible leadership to the Group within a framework of prudent
and effective controls. These allow for the key issues and risks
surrounding the business to be assessed and managed. The Board
determines the overall strategic direction for the Group, reviews
management performance and ensures that the necessary financial and
human resources are in place to enable the Group to meet its objectives.
The Board is comfortable that the necessary controls and resources
exist within the Group to enable these responsibilities to be met. 
The Board ensures that the Directors, and in particular the Non-
Executive Directors, develop an understanding of the views of major
shareholders about the Company. The Company regularly
communicates with major shareholders and has a dedicated internal
investor relations department. Briefings on market activity, together with
the views of shareholders and analysts on the Company, are also
regularly provided to the Board. 
Introduction
The Board of Directors recognises the importance of high standards of
corporate governance. This Report and the Remuneration Report set out
on pages 26 to 32 explain that the Company has complied during the
period with the principles contained in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (Code) except as stated to the contrary in this Report.
In accordance with the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Services
Authority, the relevant parts of this Report have been reviewed by the
auditors and their opinion is contained in the Independent Auditor’s
Report on page 35.
Board of Directors
Composition of the Board
There are currently five Executive Directors and seven Non-Executive
Directors (including the Non-Executive Chairman and the Non-Executive
Deputy Chairman). Biographies of each of the Directors, their responsibilities
and Board Committee memberships are set out on page 21.
The following changes to the Board took place during the period. 
On 28 July 2005 Hans Snook resigned as Non-Executive Chairman,
Martin Dawes resigned as Non-Executive Director, David Goldie was
appointed as an Executive Director, David Ross moved from an
Executive Director to become Non-Executive Deputy Chairman and
John Gildersleeve moved from a Non-Executive Director to become
Non-Executive Chairman. On this date the Company also announced
that with effect from 29 September 2005 David Mansfield would become
a new Non-Executive Director and that the Board was actively engaged
in attracting additional Non-Executive Directors and expected to make
further announcements in due course. Accordingly, on 29 September
2005 Steven Esom was appointed as a new Non-Executive Director 
and on 1 November 2005 Sally Morgan was appointed as a new 
Non-Executive Director. On 3 April 2006 Geoffroy Roux de Bezieux
resigned as an Executive Director and Andrew Harrison was appointed
as an Executive Director. 
Following such Board changes, half the Board, excluding the 
Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Deputy Chairman now
comprises independent Non-Executive Directors. The five Non-Executive
Directors considered to be independent are Sir Brian Pitman, Adrian
Martin, David Mansfield, Steven Esom and Sally Morgan. Consequently
between 29 July 2005 and 31 October 2005 half of the Board, excluding
the Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Deputy Chairman, 
were not independent Non-Executive Directors as required by the Code.
However the Board had taken all reasonable steps prior to and during
this short period to identify and recruit new Non-Executive Directors 
and it was only a question of appointment dates that led to the short
period of not having the requisite number of independent Non-Executive
Directors. The Board also believed that the experience of those
independent Non-Executive Directors who were on the Board during
that short period was such that no individual or small group of
individuals could dominate the Board’s decision taking. The appointment
of David Goldie as an Executive Director was approved at the Annual
General Meeting held on 28 July 2005. The appointments of David
Mansfield, Steven Esom and Sally Morgan as Non-Executive Directors
and the appointment of Andrew Harrison as Executive Director, will be areas of fixed line telephony and insurance. Further details will be given 
in next year’s Annual Report.
Audit Committee
Prior to the changes to the Board detailed earlier in this Report, the
Committee comprised the following independent Non-Executive Directors:
Adrian Martin (Chairman), John Gildersleeve, Sir Brian Pitman and Martin
Dawes. The Committee currently comprises the following independent
Non-Executive Directors: Adrian Martin (Chairman), Sir Brian Pitman,
David Mansfield, Steven Esom and Sally Morgan. Adrian Martin is deemed
by the Board to be the Committee member with recent and relevant
financial experience. All of the Committee members have extensive
commercial experience. The Committee met formally three times during
the period. All members, whilst being a Director, attended each meeting,
with the exception of Martin Dawes, who was absent from the meeting
held on 17 May 2005 because he had a prior engagement that could not
be changed. The Company Secretary ensured that he received all relevant
papers in advance and that any comments he had were communicated 
to the meeting. The Chairman of the Committee updates the Board on
any significant issues that may have arisen at the Board meeting following
each Committee meeting.
During the period, all the requirements of the Code in respect of the
Committee were met. The work undertaken by the Committee is
described within the following sections of this Report.
The Group’s Chief Financial Officer and other senior management attend
Committee meetings by invitation of the Committee. Representatives 
of the Company’s external auditors and the Group Director of Risk also
attend these meetings by invitation of the Committee. The external and
internal auditors have direct access to the Committee during formal
meetings and time is set aside for them to have private discussions 
with the Committee, in the absence of management.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which are available on request from
the Company Secretary and are published on the Company’s website,
comply with the Code. During the period, the formal calendar of items
considered at each Audit Committee meeting within each annual cycle
embraced the Code requirements to:
• monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, 
and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial
performance, including reviewing significant financial reporting
judgements contained in them; 
• review the Company’s internal financial controls and its internal 
control and risk management systems and to make recommendations
to the Board; 
• review the Company’s arrangements by which employees may raise
concerns in confidence;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function; 
• make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of external auditors and to approve 
their remuneration and terms of engagement; 
There is a clear and documented division of responsibilities between the
roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. There are also
documented schedules of matters reserved to the Board and matters
delegated to Committees of the Board. Such reserved matters include
decisions on strategic and policy issues, the approval of published
financial statements and major acquisitions and disposals, authority 
levels for expenditure, treasury and risk management policies. Strategic
and policy issues are reviewed annually at a combined Board and senior
executive strategy day.
Performance evaluation
During the period the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of 
the Directors was reviewed. The Board, and each individual Director, 
also undertook performance evaluations. Using the Higgs ‘Suggestions 
for Good Practice’ as guidance, the individual Directors initially completed
separate questionnaires. The results were collated and analysed by 
the Company Secretary, who prepared reports as appropriate to the
Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Board as a whole. The areas covered included the role of 
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, the Board and the Board
Committees, preparation for and performance at meetings, the
effectiveness of each Director, leadership, culture and corporate
governance. The results were then considered by the Board as a 
specific item of business. The Board proposes that these exercises 
or similar ones be carried out each year. 
Following such performance evaluation the Chairman confirms that all
those Non-Executive Directors seeking election or re-election at the AGM
continue to be effective and demonstrate a commitment to the role,
including having time to attend all necessary meetings and to carry out
other appropriate duties.
The Chairman meets regularly with all the independent Non-Executive
Directors usually in the evening prior to a Board meeting. This provides 
the opportunity to raise any questions regarding the performance of the
Executive Directors or in respect of any other matters.
The Senior Independent Director also met with the Non-Executive
Directors, in the absence of the Chairman, to assess the Chairman’s
effectiveness, having first reviewed the results of a performance evaluation
questionnaire completed by all the Directors apart from the Chairman. 
The Chairman had no other significant commitments during the period
that would have affected his performance in his role.
External appointments
The Board supports Executive Directors taking up Non-Executive
Directorships as part of their continued development, and the Board
believes that this will ultimately benefit the Company. Further details 
are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 32.
Board Committees
There are three key Board Committees: Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination. The Committees are provided with sufficient resources 
via the Company Secretary and, where necessary, have direct access 
to independent professional advisers to undertake their duties. The Board
has also recently proposed to create two new Committees dealing
specifically with certain compliance matters affecting the Group in the
Corporate Governance continued www.cpwplc.com 23 • review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and objectivity
and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration
relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements; and
• review the Company’s policy on the engagement of the external auditors
to supply non-audit services. In this context the Committee’s remit
requires it to report to the Board identifying any matters in respect of
which it considers that action or improvement is needed and to make
recommendations as to the steps to be taken. 
In the light of the assessments and review undertaken, the Committee
recommended to the Board that Deloitte & Touche LLP be retained 
as auditors of the Company. This recommendation was endorsed by 
the Board.
The policy relating to the provision of non-audit services by the external
auditors specifies the types of work from which the external auditors are
excluded; for which the external auditors can be engaged without referral
to the Committee; and for which a case-by-case decision is required. In
order to safeguard the auditors’ objectivity and independence, the ratio 
of non-audit fees to audit fees is monitored by the Committee within an
overall limit set by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
A statement of fees paid or accrued for services from the external auditors
during the period is set out below:
2006 2005
£’000 £’000
Audit services:
– statutory audit 1,115 836
– non-statutory audit 14 98
Further assurance services – 15
Tax services:
– compliance services 7 10
– advisory services 115 150
Other services 22 54
Total 1,273 1,163
Certain non-audit services are pre-approved by the Committee depending
upon the nature and size of the service. Non-statutory audit services during
the period primarily related to work undertaken in respect of International
Accounting Standards. Tax services comprise compliance services and
technical advice associated with relevant UK and international fiscal laws
and regulations and, in particular, assessment of the potential implications
of proposed corporate transactions or restructuring. 
Having undertaken a review of the non-audit related work the Committee
has satisfied itself that the services undertaken during the period did not
prejudice the external auditors’ independence.
At each of its meetings the Committee reviewed and considered reports
from the Group Director of Risk on the status of the Group’s risk
management systems, findings from the internal audit function concerning
internal controls, and reports on the status of any weaknesses in internal
controls identified by the internal or external auditors.
Remuneration Committee
Prior to the changes to the Board detailed earlier in this Report, the
Committee comprised the following independent Non-Executive Directors:
John Gildersleeve (Chairman), Sir Brian Pitman, Martin Dawes and Adrian
Martin. The Committee currently comprises the following independent
Non-Executive Directors: Sir Brian Pitman (Chairman), Adrian Martin,
David Mansfield, Steven Esom and Sally Morgan. 
The Committee met formally five times during the period and each member,
whilst being a Director, attended every meeting with the exception of Martin
Dawes who was absent on the 17 May 2005, Sir Brian Pitman who was
absent on the 26 May 2005 and Steven Esom who was absent from the
meeting on 30 March 2006. All absences were due to prior engagements
that could not be changed. Other Directors, the Company Secretary, the
Group Director of Human Resources, the Head of Compensation and
Benefits and advisers attended by invitation only. A detailed description 
of the Committee’s remit and work during the period is contained in the
Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 32. Its terms of reference comply with
the Code, are available on request from the Company Secretary and are
published on the Company’s website. The Chairman of the Committee
updates the Board following each Committee meeting.
Nomination Committee
Prior to the changes to the Board detailed earlier in this Report, the
Committee comprised three independent Non-Executive Directors: Sir
Brian Pitman (Chairman), John Gildersleeve, Martin Dawes and David
Ross. The Committee currently comprises the following Non-Executive
Directors: John Gildersleeve (Chairman), Sir Brian Pitman, Adrian Martin
and David Ross. The Committee meets as and when required and met
five times formally during the period. Every member, whilst being a Director,
attended these meetings with the exception of David Ross who was
absent on 29 March 2006 because he had a prior engagement that 
could not be changed. 
The Committee’s terms of reference comply with the Code and are
available from the Company Secretary on request and are published on
the Company’s website. The Committee is responsible for succession
planning at Board level, overseeing the selection and appointment of
Directors, regularly reviewing the structure, size and composition of 
the Board and making its recommendations to the Board. It assists in
evaluating the commitments of individual Directors and the balance of
skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. 
During the period, the work of the Committee reflected succession planning
and a consideration of appropriate appointments to the Board. Spencer
Stuart was used as an external search consultancy for the appointment 
of future independent Non-Executive Directors and their work was 
carried out in conjunction with potential candidates sourced by the 
Group directly. The Committee recommended that Sally Morgan, David
Mansfield and Steven Esom be appointed as independent Non-Executive
Directors. The work of the Committee in respect of the appointment of
John Gildersleeve as Non-Executive Chairman was noted in last year’s
Annual Report.
The Committee did not use an external search consultancy nor open
advertising in respect of the appointments of David Goldie and Andrew
Harrison, although the Committee did follow the other principles of the
Code in leading and making recommendations to the Board. David Goldie
and Andrew Harrison were both existing members of senior management

Company’s orderly succession plans so as to maintain the appropriate

All of the above recommendations were unanimously approved by the Board.
Risk management and internal control
The Company has established a risk management programme that assists
management throughout the Company to identify, assess and mitigate
business, financial, operational and compliance risks. The Board views
management of risk as integral to good business practice. The programme
is designed to support management’s decision-making and to improve 
the reliability of business performance.
The risk management programme is supported by a dedicated team of
risk specialists, including internal auditors, who comprise the Group Risk
and Assurance function. To ensure that all parts of the Company have a
good understanding of risk, members of this team have conducted risk
workshops and reviews within each of the main operating divisions in the
past year, culminating in an assessment of key business risks by the
Executive Directors and senior management. These risk assessments
have been wide-ranging, covering risks arising from the regulatory
environment, strategy, counter-parties and organisational change
associated both with major projects and with acquisitions. The risk
management process operates throughout the Company, being applied
equally to the main business divisions and corporate functions.
The output from each annual assessment is a list of key strategic, financial,
operational and compliance risks. Associated action plans and controls to
mitigate them are also put in place where this is possible and to the extent
considered appropriate by the Board taking account of costs and benefits.
Changes in the status of the key risks and changes to the risk matrix are
reported regularly to the Audit Committee and at each Board Meeting.
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal
control and for reviewing their effectiveness. The Board delegates to
executive management the responsibility for designing, operating and
monitoring these systems. The systems are based on a process of
identifying, evaluating and managing key risks and include the risk
management processes set out above. The systems of internal control
were in place throughout the period and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and financial statements. The effectiveness of these
systems is periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee in accordance
with the guidance in the Turnbull Report. These systems are also refined as
necessary to meet changes in the Group’s business and associated risks.
The systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material errors,
losses, fraud or breaches of laws and regulations.
The Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the
systems of risk management and internal control in operation during 
the year and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and
financial statements.

This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (Regulations) and the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (Code). The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee are in compliance with the Code. In framing 
its remuneration policy the Committee has given full consideration to the matters set out in Schedule A of the Code. As required by the Regulations, 
a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be held on 27 July 2006.
The Regulations require the Company’s auditors to report to the members on the “auditable part” of this Report (marked *) and to state, in their opinion,
that this part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).
Remuneration Committee
Responsibility for the establishment of overall remuneration policy for the Group lies with the full Board of Directors. The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Directors and senior managers. The terms of
reference of the Committee are available on the Group’s website (www.cpwplc.com) or on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee’s current composition is Sir Brian Pitman (Chairman), Adrian Martin, David Mansfield (who was appointed to the Committee on 
29 September 2005), Steven Esom (who was appointed to the Committee on 29 September 2005), and Sally Morgan (who was appointed to 
the Committee on 1 November 2005), all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors. None of the members of the Committee has any 
personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided by the Committee, no potential conflicts of interest arising from
cross-memberships and no day-to-day involvement in running the Group’s business.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC) are lead advisors to the Committee and have no other connection with the Group. Deloitte & Touche LLP
(Deloitte) provided advice to the Remuneration Committee on the administration of share option and SAYE schemes. Deloitte are the Group’s auditors
and provide other services to the Group as set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 22 to 25. The Deputy Chairman, the Group Director of
Human Resources and the Company Secretary also provided internal advice in respect of matters raised by the Committee. No Director nor any person
advising the Committee plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The primary aim of the Committee is to ensure that remuneration aligns the interests of management and shareholders and reinforces behaviour which
will lead to the continued long-term development of the business.
The Committee makes its recommendations to the Board by taking into account:
• The experience of Executive Directors and other senior managers;
• The Group’s competitiveness in the market place, assessed through independent external market comparisons;
• The growing international nature of the Group;
• The development of new business streams and the added complexity of the business;
• Pay and conditions throughout the Group as a whole;
• The performance and growth of the Group which is now comparable to companies in the lower end of the FTSE 100.
The overall remuneration policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, retain and motivate executives of the calibre required, 
and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific performance measures. 
In particular, the Committee has recognised that the complexity of the Group has increased significantly and that the remuneration policy should be
adjusted to reflect the calibre of executives needed to continue to develop and grow the business. 
The approach is to set fixed remuneration at median levels and to offer variable rewards which are linked to the performance of the Group, which can
provide significant overall levels of remuneration for exceptional performance and shareholder value creation. Before long-term incentive share awards 
are taken into account, approximately 65% of Executive Directors’ remuneration earned in the year was performance related. Charles Dunstone does 
not receive long-term incentive share awards. 
Components of remuneration
The main fixed and performance related elements of remuneration that can be awarded to Executive Directors are as follows:
• basic salary, benefits and pension contribution (fixed);
• annual performance bonus (variable); 
• share options (variable); and
• Performance Shares (variable).
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 26
Remuneration Report The Company operates a minimum shareholding policy, requiring Executive Directors to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company equal 
to at least 100% of their annual salaries.
Salaries and benefits
Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed annually and take into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individuals and
information obtained from published market data on the salary rates for similar positions in companies of a similar size. Salaries are reviewed on 1 July each year.
Following the most recent review, salaries from 1 July 2006 will be as follows:
Charles Dunstone £550,000, Roger Taylor £350,000, Jim Dale £185,000 (pro-rated for 4 days), David Goldie £275,000, Andrew Harrison £225,000. 
The increases over the year reflect very strong Group performance and a further increase in the size of the business and the complexity of the Directors’
roles. Executive Directors also receive benefits in respect of cars or car allowances, private medical cover and a defined contribution pension scheme.
In considering the base salary levels, it is recognised that pension contributions to most senior executives are, generally, significantly below market levels.
Annual Performance Bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme designed to reflect the performance of the Group. Bonuses are governed by performance conditions set by the
Remuneration Committee to ensure that maximum variable rewards are paid only for exceptional performance. The bonus scheme for the period ending
31 March 2007 will have targets based on improvements in Headline EPS (see note 10 to the financial statements) for 80% of the bonus and the
successful implementation of Free Broadband for the remaining 20%.
As with the Headline EPS range set for the period ended 1 April 2006, targets set for the forthcoming financial year will require exceptional performance
of the Group. The initial threshold for annual bonus will be significantly ahead of the actual Headline EPS achieved in 2006.
In view of the significant strategic challenges in rolling out Free Broadband, the Committee has determined that a significant proportion of all Executive
Directors’ bonuses should be subject to a range of quantifiable targets relating to the achievement of key operational milestones.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for the forthcoming financial year the annual bonus potential should be increased from 195% to
200% of base salary and that the threshold for compulsory deferral (into the Annual Deferred Bonus Plan) should only be enforced if Directors do not
have a shareholding equivalent to at least 100% of their salary. The gain on any share options vested in the period (net of tax) and the value of any
deferred and matching shares earned under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan will be taken into account for this purpose.
Annual Deferred Bonus Plan 
Executive Directors and senior managers have the option of taking some or all of their cash bonus in the form of a deferred share award. The rights 
to deferred shares cannot be exercised for 12 months. Matching shares may also be awarded if the deferred share award is not exercised for up to 
a further two years. The number of matching shares awarded equates to 12.5% of the deferred amount at the beginning of each year. The share
equivalent of dividends which would have been paid on the shares is added to the deferred share award each year. Given the challenging annual bonus
targets in order to earn a bonus in the first place, the modest level of potential match and the Committee’s aim of encouraging Executive Directors to
build up a significant shareholding, no additional performance criteria are attached to the matching shares. 
Share options
The Company has a performance related share option scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers both in the UK and overseas. No options
were granted to Executive Directors in the period ended 1 April 2006 and it is currently not envisaged that grants will be made to them in the
forthcoming year. A UK savings-related share option scheme is open to all eligible employees in the UK, including Executive Directors. David Goldie 
had 10,958 options available to buy shares in the company under the UK savings-related share option scheme at 1 April 2006. The options are
exercisable from 1 August 2006 at an excercise price of £0.73 per share. The options expire on 1 February 2007. No other Executive Director 
currently participates in the scheme.
Performance Share Plan
During the period ended 2 April 2005, senior managers, including Executive Directors, received awards of Performance Shares (as defined in the 
Annual General Meeting on 28 July 2004). These awards are subject to a mixture of Headline EPS and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance
targets measured over a three or four year performance period. Further Performance Shares were awarded to certain senior managers in the period
ended 1 April 2006. Details of the grants to Executive Directors and the performance targets are set out in the share tables later in the Report.
The Remuneration Committee is currently considering the terms of further grants to be made under the Performance Share Plan for the forthcoming 
year, which will vest in 2009 and 2010. Grant will be subject to performance and will be made within the limits agreed by shareholders when the Plan
was adopted in 2004. The performance conditions applying to awards to Executive Directors will continue to be a mixture of stretching Headline EPS
and TSR targets.
Details of the performance conditions for grants under the Performance Share Plan during the forthcoming financial year will be disclosed in next 
year’s Annual Report.

(i) The taxable benefits provided consist of a company car or car allowance, car insurance, fuel and private medical cover.
(ii) Annual bonuses for the period ended 1 April 2006 were accrued at the balance sheet date and will be paid in June 2006. For this period, the bonus
was based on a range of stretching Headline EPS targets. Headline EPS for the period was 12.38p (an increase of 33.8% over the previous year)
which resulted in the maximum bonus of 195% of salary being earned.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that this bonus has provided an excellent link between reward and operating performance, and the creation 
of further shareholder value.
Pension contributions*
The schedule below sets out payments to defined contribution pension schemes on behalf of Executive Directors. Geoffroy Roux de Bezieux and 
Roger Taylor were members of a UK stakeholder pension scheme. Roger Taylor opted to move to a Self Invested Pension Plan during the year. 
David Goldie has a fixed amount of salary paid into a defined contribution pension plan. Under the schemes a fixed proportion of salary is paid by 
the Company, together with a fixed proportion by the Executive Director. Both amounts are invested on behalf of the Executive Director. Pension 
benefits are then funded by the total investment. Jim Dale has a similar scheme in the Isle of Man. Levels are reviewed annually against published 
market data. None of the Directors was a member of a defined benefit pension scheme. Pension entitlements are based on basic salary only.

Performance graph
Graph 1 shows the Group’s performance compared to the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 Index over the last five financial years. A three month
rolling average has been applied.
The FTSE 250 index was selected as it is a broad market index of which the Group is a member. In addition, the Group uses that index as a comparator
for determining whether or not Performance Shares vest.
Graph 2 shows similar information as Graph 1 but measured from 1 April 2004, with TSR measured on a daily basis. This graph is relevant as it reflects
the TSR performance condition for the 2004 award of Performance Shares.

Company Secretary 
6 June 2006
The Directors have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report and financial
statements of The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC for the 52 weeks
ended 1 April 2006.
Principal activities and review of the business
The principal activity of the Group continues to be the provision of mobile
communication products and services and fixed line communication services.
For the purposes of segmental reporting, operations are classified into
three divisions, being Distribution, Telecoms Services and Dealer. The
subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the results or net assets of 
the Group in the period are listed in note 14 to the financial statements.
A detailed review of the business is contained in the Operating and
Financial Performance Review on pages 9 to 16 in accordance with
s234ZZB of the Companies Act 1985. Our responsibility under s234ZA 
of the Companies Act have been included in the statement of Directors’
Responsibilities set out on page 34.
Results
The profit before taxation for the financial period decreased from £91.9m
in the prior period to £81.0m. An interim dividend of 0.75p per share
(2005 – 0.55p) was paid in the period. The Directors recommend the
payment of a final dividend of 1.75p per share (2005 – 1.25p). Subject to
shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting, the final dividend
will be paid on 4 August 2006 to shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 7 July 2006. Details of significant events since the balance
sheet date are provided in note 32 to the financial statements. 
Directors
The names and brief biographical details of the Directors are shown on
page 21. Particulars of Directors’ remuneration, interests in the shares of 
the Company and its subsidiaries, and interests in share options are given
in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 32.
Employment of disabled people
It is the Group’s policy to encourage application for employment from
disabled people and to assist with their training and career development,
having regard to particular aptitudes and abilities. Every endeavour is made
to find suitable alternative employment and to re-train any employee who
becomes disabled while serving the Group.
Employee involvement
The Group places significant emphasis on its employees’ involvement 
in the business at all levels. Managers are remunerated according to
results wherever possible and all employees are kept informed of issues
affecting the Group through formal and informal meetings and through 
the Group’s internal publications. Members of the management team
regularly visit all Group locations and discuss matters of current interest
and concern with employees.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of transactions, including payment
terms, with suppliers and, provided that suppliers perform in accordance
with the agreed terms, it is the Group’s normal practice that payment is
made accordingly. Details of the average credit period taken on trade
payables are provided in note 18 to the financial statements.
www.cpwplc.com 33 United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and Group and of their profit or loss for that
period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and 
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also 
responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to
safeguard the assets of the Company and Group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this
Report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 34 We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statement on internal control covers all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information contained in 
the Annual Report for the above period as described in the contents
section including the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report and 
we consider the implications for our Report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group
financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report described as having been audited. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report described
as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in
the Group financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report
described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 1 April 2006 and of its profit for the 52 week period
then ended; and
• the Group financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report
described as having been audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
Group financial statements.

Remuneration Report and the Group financial statements in accordance

Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements and the 
part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited 
in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements
give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting
framework and whether the Group financial statements and the part of 
the Remuneration Report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to you whether in our opinion
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group
financial statements. We also report to you if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ transactions with the Company and
other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not complied

specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services

package and information on share options, details of long-term incentive
schemes, and money purchase and defined benefit schemes. We give

The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 38 Notes to the Financial Statements
provisions of the Companies Act 1985, and therefore comply with Article 4 
of the European Union International Accounting Standard regulation.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following
standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial
statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS7 ‘Financial Instruments Disclosures’, and the related amendment 
to IAS1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ on capital disclosures.
• IFRIC4 ‘Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease’.
• IFRIC8 ‘Scope of IFRS2’.
• IFRIC9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’.
• 2005 amendments to IAS21 ‘Net Investment in a Foreign Entity’.
• 2005 revisions to IAS39 for fair value options and guarantees.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations
will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis,
except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. The Group’s
principal accounting policies are set out below.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of the Group 
to 1 April 2006. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the period
are included from or to the date on which control passed. Intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the Group.
c) Foreign currency translation
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases
or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised in the financial statements
at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded 
at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are hedged, mainly using forward
foreign exchange contracts to create matching liabilities and assets and are
retranslated at each balance sheet date. Hedge accounting as defined by
IAS39 has not been applied in either period.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average foreign
exchange rates for the period, and their balance sheets are translated at the
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Goodwill is held in the currency 
of the operations to which it relates. Exchange differences arising on the
translation of opening net assets, goodwill and results of overseas operations
are dealt with through the translation reserve. All other exchange differences
are included in the income statement.
The principal exchange rates against Sterling used in these financial
statements are as follows:
Average Average
52 weeks 53 weeks 
ended ended Closing Closing
1 April 2006 2 April 2005 1 April 2006 2 April 2005
Euro 1.4644 1.4680 1.4333 1.4573
Swedish Krona 13.6833 13.3756 13.5185 13.3519
Swiss Franc 2.2737 2.2615 2.2668 2.2629
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal
recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the
cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
1 Accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC (the Company) is a company
incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of The Carphone Warehouse Group
PLC and all of its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These financial
statements are the first annual financial statements that the Group has
prepared in accordance with IFRS and consequently the Group has complied
with IFRS1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’.
The Company continues to apply UK GAAP in the preparation of its individual
financial statements, which are contained on pages 68 to 72.
The Group’s date of transition to IFRS is 28 March 2004 and comparative
information in the financial statements is restated to reflect the Group’s
adoption of IFRS except where otherwise required or permitted by IFRS1.
IFRS1 requires an entity to comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting
date for its first financial statements prepared under IFRS. As a general rule,
IFRS1 requires such standards to be applied retrospectively. However, the
standard allows several optional exemptions from full retrospective application.
The Group has elected to take advantage of the following exemptions:
• The Group has adopted IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’ to the extent that 
it applies to acquisitions post 28 March 2004. Acquisitions before that 
date are recorded as under previous accounting rules as the Group has
taken advantage of the exemption allowed in IFRS1 regarding business
combinations recognised before the date of transition to IFRS. All goodwill
and intangible assets will be tested for impairment, as required by IAS36
‘Impairment of Assets’, goodwill on an annual basis and other intangible
assets when there is an indicator of impairment. In addition, the Group has
taken advantage of the exemption allowed in IFRS1 not to apply IAS21
‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ retrospectively to 
fair value adjustments and goodwill arising in business combinations that
occurred before the date of transition to IFRS.
• The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemption allowed 
in IFRS1 regarding cumulative translation differences. Accordingly, the
cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed 
to be nil at the date of transition to IFRS.
• The Group has elected to apply the exemptions in IAS32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’ allowing the application of these standards
from 3 April 2005 only.
• The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemptions allowed 
in IFRS1 regarding IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payment’. The Group has 
applied the exemptions for share-based payments granted on or before 
7 November 2002.
• The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemptions allowed in
IFRS1 regarding IFRS4 ‘Insurance Contracts’, allowing the application 
of this standard from 3 April 2005 only.
The reconciliations required by IFRS1 are set out in note 29. Specifically, 
note 29 provides reconciliations of the Group’s net assets as prepared under
UK GAAP to those prepared in accordance with IFRS as at 28 March 2004
(the opening balance sheet as at the date of transition to IFRS) and 
2 April 2005 as well as a reconciliation of the Group’s profit prepared 
under UK GAAP to that prepared in accordance with IFRS for the period
ended 2 April 2005.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the
www.cpwplc.com 39 Notes to the Financial Statements continued
d) Revenue
Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The following
accounting policies are applied to each business segment:
Distribution:
Distribution revenue comprises revenue generated from the sale of mobile
communication products and services, commission receivable on sales less
provision for promotional offers and network operator performance penalties,
ongoing revenue (share of customer airtime spend, and customer revenue
and retention bonuses) and insurance premiums.
• Commission receivable on sales is recognised when the sales to which 
the commission relates are made.
• Volume bonuses are recognised when the conditions on which they are
earned have been met.
• Ongoing revenue is recognised as it is earned over the lives of the 
relevant customers.
• Insurance premiums are typically paid quarterly in advance. Initial
administration fees, which are specified in the contract, are recognised 
at the point of sale. Insurance premium income is recognised over the 
lives of the relevant policies.
• All other revenue is recognised when the relevant goods or services 
are provided.
Telecoms Services:
Telecoms Services revenue comprises revenue generated from facilities
management, revenue from mobile and fixed network services and ongoing
revenue. All such revenue is recognised as it is earned over the lives of the
relevant customers.
Dealer:
Dealer revenue comprises revenue generated from the sale of mobile
hardware and is recognised when sales are made.
e) Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of
grant, and expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate
of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for share-based payments
with internal performance criteria (such as Earnings Per Share targets) and 
a Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria (such as
Total Shareholder Return targets).
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of options
expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on
expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of options
expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
f) Pensions
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income
statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
g) Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received. Final dividend
distributions are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
period in which they are approved by the Group’s shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
h) Leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through the income
statement over the period of the lease.
i) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at
amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying
amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable
in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry-
forward of unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax is determined using
the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised
or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries,
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be
controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except where
it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is
recognised directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do
so in the relevant jurisdictions.
j) Intangible assets
Goodwill:
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses,
representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is recognised initially as
an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. At the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the
cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the combination and
held in the currency of the operations to which the goodwill relates. Goodwill 
is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently where there 
is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. Impairment is determined by
assessing the future cash flows of the CGUs to which the goodwill relates.
Where the future cash flows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an
impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included 
in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Subscriber acquisition costs:
Subscriber acquisition costs, being the direct third-party costs of recruiting
and retaining new customers, net of incentives from network operators and
provision for in-contract churn, are capitalised as an intangible asset, to the
extent that they are supported by expected future cash inflows, and
amortised on a straight-line basis through operating expenses in the income
statement over the minimum subscription period. Subscriber acquisition
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 40 n) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes 
all direct costs incurred in bringing stock to its present location and condition
and represents finished goods and goods for resale. Net realisable value is
based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred
to disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items
where appropriate.
o) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits and
short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash.
p) Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings represent bank overdrafts, uncommitted bank
loans, committed loans and loan notes issued by the Group.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing
are capitalised as prepayments and amortised over the term of the relevant
loan. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the
period in which they are incurred.
q) Financial instruments
The Group uses forward currency contracts to reduce its exposure to exchange
rate fluctuations. From 3 April 2005, such contracts are measured at their fair
value based on contracted exchange rates. Hedge accounting as defined by
IAS39 has not been applied to the financial statements in either period and
changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
r) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation
as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of
money is considered to be material.
Provisions are categorised as follows:
Insurance:
Full provision is made for the estimated cost of all claims notified but not
settled at the balance sheet date. Provision is also made for the estimated
cost of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date, based 
on historic experience of the value of such claims. 
Reorganisation:
Reorganisation provisions are only recognised where plans are demonstrably
committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been
undertaken at the balance sheet date. Provisions are not recognised in
respect of future operating losses.
Sales:
Sales provisions relate to “cash-back” and similar promotions, product
warranties, product returns, and network operator performance penalties.
The anticipated costs of these items are assessed by reference to historic
trends and any other information that is considered to be relevant.
Other:
Other provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and all
other provisions, principally being the anticipated costs of unresolved tax
issues and legal disputes, and costs associated with onerous contracts. 
All such provisions are assessed by reference to the best available
information at the balance sheet date.
s) Use of critical accounting estimates and assumptions
Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements
costs for customers with no minimum subscription commitment are reflected
in operating expenses as incurred.
Software and licenses:
Software and licenses include internal infrastructure and design costs
incurred in the development of software for internal use. Internally generated
software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately
identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits,
and the development cost can be measured reliably. Where these conditions
are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the
period in which it is incurred. Software and licenses are amortised on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to 8 years.
Key money:
Key money paid to enter a property is stated at cost, net of amortisation and
any provision for impairment. Amortisation is provided on key money at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, on a straight-
line basis over 10 years or the lease term if less.
Acquisition intangibles:
Acquired intangible assets (acquisition intangibles), such as customer bases
acquired through a business combination, are capitalised separately from
goodwill and amortised over their useful lives of up to 5 years on a straight-
line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based on the future
economic benefit that is expected to be derived from them.
k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any
provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and
equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual
value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life from
the date it is brought into use, as follows:
Freehold buildings 2-4% per annum
Short leasehold costs 10 years or the lease term if less
Computer hardware, network 
and office equipment 12.5-50% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 20-25% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
l) Recoverable amount of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that
an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group
makes a formal estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to
be impaired and is written down through an accelerated amortisation charge to
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or
CGU’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is determined for an
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
m) Investments
All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the
consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with 
the investment.
The Group adopted IAS32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’
and IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ from 
3 April 2005, as a result of which the Group’s investments are categorised 
as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value from this date.
Changes in fair value, together with any related deferred tax, are taken directly
to reserves, and recycled to the income statement when the investment is sold
or is determined to be impaired.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued www.cpwplc.com 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued
are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. While every effort is made
to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are reasonable, by their nature
they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may
have a material impact on the financial statements.
The principal balances in the financial statements where changes in estimates
and assumptions may have a material impact are as follows:
Subscriber acquisition costs:
Estimates made in relation to future cash inflows and to rates of in-contract
churn are based on the best information available at the balance sheet date,
but such estimates may differ from actual results.
Recoverable amount of non-current assets:
All non-current assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, are
reviewed for potential impairment using estimates of future economic benefits
attributable to them. Such estimates may differ from the benefits that ultimately
arise, and materially affect the recoverable value of the asset.
Trade and other receivables:
Provisions for irrecoverable receivables are based on extensive historic
evidence, and the best available information in relation to specific issues, 
but are nevertheless inherently uncertain.
Current taxation:
The complex nature of tax legislation across the tax jurisdictions in which the
Group operates necessitates the use of many estimates and assumptions,
where the outcome may differ from that assumed.
Deferred taxation:
The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to
which taxable profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions in the
foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such 
the value of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.
Provisions:
The Group’s reorganisation provisions are based on the best information
available to management at the balance sheet date. However, the future
costs assumed are inevitably only estimates, which may differ from those
ultimately incurred.
Sales provisions are based on historic patterns: of redemption for promotions,
product return rates for returns and warranties, and penalty rates from
network operators. The Group has extensive data in all areas; however, if 
the historic patterns on which the provisions are based change significantly 
in the future, the financial statements may be materially impacted.
Provisions relating to the disposal of excess property necessitate assumptions
in respect of period to disposal and exit costs, which may differ from the
ultimate cost of disposal.

a) As detailed in note 14, the Group acquired Onetel in December 2005. Since then, the Group has commenced a reorganisation programme to integrate Onetel
with the rest of the Group. The costs of this integration are estimated at £22.3m, comprising the following:
£’000
Redundancy and other employee costs 11,934
Contract termination costs 4,977
Network and customer migration costs 4,919
Other 458
22,288
b) The substantial customer growth achieved through the acquisition of Onetel and Tele2 UK, together with the Group’s major investment plans in respect of local
loop unbundling and billing platforms, prompted a review during the period of the Group’s systems and network infrastructure.
This review represented a consideration of the extent to which the carrying value of the Group’s assets should be reduced either because they have no further
use or because their useful economic lives have reduced significantly. The result of this review was an accelerated or one-off amortisation charge in respect of
the following assets:
£’000
Billing infrastructure and customer management systems 8,908
Other 4,049
12,957
Both these items are expected to attract tax relief at 30% and accordingly a tax credit of £10.6m has been recognised at 1 April 2006.

6 Share-based payments 
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees, through the following schemes:
a) Performance Share Plan:
During the period the Group made awards of nil cost options under a Performance Share Plan. These awards are subject to a mixture of Headline earnings per
share (see note 11) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance targets measured over a three or four year performance period. Details of the performance
targets are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 32. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the
options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of share options for the scheme:

c) Retail Share Option Scheme:
The Group has a Retail Share Option Scheme, which is open to senior employees in the UK Retail business. The scheme provides for a grant price equal to the
average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. Options granted are subject to performance criteria. The vesting period is generally
three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the

The savings-related share option scheme permits the grant to employees of options linked to a bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years
with contributions from employees of between £5 and £250 per month. Options may be exercised at the end of the three or five year period at a subscription price
not less than 80% of the middle market quotation on the date of grant.
In addition, options were granted to UK employees at the time of the Group’s admission to the London Stock Exchange.

The options outstanding at 1 April 2006 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.3 years (2005 – 2.6 years).
The summary above includes 1.5m (2005 – 2.6m) options that were granted before 7 November 2002. In accordance with IFRS2, no cost has been recognised in
respect of these options.
The options exercised during the period were exercised at a weighted average market price of £1.90 (2005 – £1.42).
e) Fair value models:
Nil cost options with internal performance targets are valued using the market price of a share at the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends to the
date of exercise. The fair values of other options with internal performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using a Binomial model. The inputs into the
Binomial model are as follows:
2006 2005
Expected volatility (%) 30.0 30.0
Risk free rate (%) 4.5 4.5
Dividend yield (%) 2.0 2.0
Expected volatility has been arrived at by using the historical volatility of the Group’s share price, and the volatility of the share price of similar companies whose
shares have been listed for longer than those of the Group, over a period comparable with the expected lives of the options. The assumptions made to incorporate
the effects of expected early exercise have been included by assuming an expected option life based on historical exercise patterns for each option scheme.
The fair values of options with external performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model. The model combines the market price 
of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the historical performance of the Group’s shares. A dividend yield of
2.0% has been assumed in the model.
f) Charge to income statement:
During the period the Group recognised a charge of £10.7m (2005 – £3.6m) in respect of equity settled share-based payments.

Deferred tax assets 34,938 4,570

34,938 470
At 1 April 2006 the Group has unused tax losses of £166.4m (2005 – £146.6m) available for offset against future taxable profits. A deferred tax asset of £6.4m
(2005 – £5.9m) has been recognised in respect of £20.3m (2005 – £15.7m) of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £146.1m (2005 – £130.9m) as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable
taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered. Included within unrecognised tax losses are amounts of £16.7m (2005 – £18.4m) that will expire
between 2014 and 2018 and £9.3m (2005 – £12.8m) that will expire between 2008 and 2013. Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 1 April 2006, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not
been recognised was £25.9m (2005 – £17.8m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the
timing of their reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs), which are generally based on geographical location. The carrying amount of goodwill by
geographical location is as follows:
2006 2005
£’000 £’000
UK 261,437 149,829
France 91,077 89,603
Germany 73,054 71,851
Spain 46,564 45,797
Other 96,498 94,943
568,630 452,023
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the
discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates
that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts
derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on
an estimated growth rate averaging 2.5%. The average pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10%.

Non-current asset investments at 2 April 2005 principally comprise the Group’s interest in Wireless Frontiers, an independently managed wireless investment fund.
Additions in the period represent investments in which the Group holds a minority shareholding of less than 20%.
The fair value of non-current asset investments has been determined using European Venture Capital Association (EVCA) guidelines. Movements in fair value are
recognised in reserves in accordance with IAS39.
a) Principal Group investments
The Group has investments in the following subsidiary undertakings, which principally affected the profits or losses or net assets of the Group. To avoid a statement
of excessive length, details of investments which are not significant have been omitted. All holdings are in equity share capital and give the Group an effective
holding of 100% on consolidation.

On 19 December 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Centrica Telecommunications Limited, Onetel Limited, Telco Holdings Limited,
Awardmodel Limited and their subsidiaries (Onetel), all of which are registered in England and Wales, for a gross cash consideration of £169.6m. Onetel is involved
in the provision of telecommunications services to both residential and business customers.

Fair value adjustments relate principally to:
• the recognition of acquisition intangibles, being customer bases with a value of £25.1m and a distribution agreement with British Gas with a value of £37.1m;
• the write-down of property, plant and equipment to its market value or value in use;
• the recognition of deferred tax assets, principally in respect of accelerated capital allowances;
• the recognition of unrecorded liabilities and provision for onerous contracts.
No value has been attributed to the Onetel brand.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Onetel is attributable primarily to the removal of a significant competitor to TalkTalk in the residential telecommunications
market and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from the combination.
The Group’s results for the period reflect revenue from Onetel of £87.3m and a loss before taxation of £26.0m, after reorganisation costs of £22.3m.

of up to £0.2m payable over the next two years. These acquisitions resulted in goodwill of £2.1m.
Included within other cash paid in the period is £3.0m in relation to deferred consideration for acquisitions made in previous periods.
In addition, goodwill was reduced by £4.5m during the period as a result of adjustments to contingent deferred consideration and increased by £1.6m as a result
of adjustments to fair value on previous acquisitions.

provisions for doubtful debts of £50.3m (2005 – £35.3m). The average credit period taken on trade receivables, calculated by reference to the amount owed 
at the period end as a proportion of total revenue in the period, adjusted to take account of the timing of acquisitions, was 53 days (2005 – 47 days).
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

this date current asset investments are stated at market value, which is provided by third-party fund managers. At 2 April 2005 the investments are shown at cost
and do not reflect the impact of these standards.
The reduction in current asset investments during the period is primarily due to the liquidation of insurance investments into cash and cash equivalents.

All borrowings are unsecured.
Bank overdrafts and other uncommitted bank loans:
The Group has a variety of overdraft facilities in Sterling, Euro and other European currencies, all of which are repayable on demand. These facilities are domiciled
in various countries and interest is charged at standard overdraft rates in the countries concerned. Some of the Group’s major banks make uncommitted facilities
available to assist with short-term liquidity management. These facilities bear interest based on the appropriate local interest rates. These facilities are repayable 
on demand.
Loan notes:
The Group has issued a number of interest-bearing loan notes. These loan notes are repayable on demand and expire between 2012 and 2015. Additional loan
notes of £2.4m were issued during the period and £6.6m were redeemed or cancelled.
£450m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF):
The £300m RCF, which was signed in September 2004, was increased to £450m during the period by inviting the existing members of the banking syndicate to
subscribe for additional commitments. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged, including the covenant package, and the facility remains repayable in full
in September 2009. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate
period. The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
£120m and £225m term loans:
A new five-year £225m term loan was signed in February 2006, part of the proceeds of which was used to repay and cancel the £120m term loan originally 
signed in 2003. The interest rate is calculated in a similar manner to the £450m RCF. The loan is repayable in full in February 2011. The term loan is drawn in 
Euro at 1 April 2006 and its value at that date of £230.1m reflects the exchange rate at the period end.
£50m term loan:
A new five-year bi-lateral £50m term loan was signed in December 2005, the proceeds of which were used in relation to the Onetel acquisition. The interest rate 
is calculated in a similar manner to the £450m RCF. The loan is repayable in full in December 2010.

Liquidity risk:
To ensure the continuity of Group funding whilst also minimising the interest cost, its borrowings are spread between long-term committed facilities, short-term
uncommitted bank loans and, to ensure flexibility, overdrafts whilst short-term cash surpluses are invested overnight.
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 60 20 Financial instruments
The Operating and Financial Performance Review on pages 9 to 16 provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have in managing the Group’s
currency and interest rate risk. 
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities:
The interest rates on floating rate financial assets and liabilities are linked to market interest rates, mainly on an overnight basis or for one, two or three month
periods. Future cashflows arising from these financial assets and liabilities depend on interest periods agreed at the time of rollover and, as such, all financial assets
and liabilities are classified as floating rate.
The weighted average interest rate for loans and overdrafts was 3.28% (2005 – 3.53%), reflecting a high proportion of Euro borrowings.

The fair value of available-for-sale investments has been provided by third-party fund managers. Other fair values have been arrived at by discounting future
cashflows, assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts to period-end market rates or rates as appropriate to the instrument.
Foreign exchange derivatives:
The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge transactional exposures. These are mainly denominated in Euros and US dollars and primarily cover stock
purchases. The Group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities and also for short-term liquidity management. 
The Group currently holds no currency option contracts.
At 1 April 2006, the total notional principal amount of outstanding forward currency contacts was £129.4m (2005 – £50.6m).
All currency derivatives are shown in the financial statements at fair value and no currency derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The amount transferred
to income in respect of these currency derivatives was £0.2m (2005 – £nil).
The Group does not hedge the balance sheet translation risk of its foreign operations.
Functional currency:
The functional currency of individual companies within the Group varies with the territory in which they operate and the four currencies in which subsidiary
companies prepare their accounts are: Sterling, Euro, Swiss franc and Swedish krona. Material financial assets and financial liabilities held by Group companies
which differ from their functional currency are as follows:
2006 2005
Sterling Euro Other Total Sterling Euro Other Total
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

Total – (213,664) 8,408 (205,256) 218 (103,892) 12,196 (91,478)
The financial assets are shown before the effect of hedging, which removes foreign exchange risk. The financial liabilities hedge net inter-company currency
exposures and, as such, do not create foreign exchange risk.
Embedded derivatives:
There are no contracts containing embedded derivatives that have been identified and accounted for separately as required by IAS39.

Provisions are categorised as follows:
Insurance:
Insurance provisions represent the anticipated costs of all policyholder claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet
date. Insurance provisions are expected to be utilised within one year.
Reorganisation:
Reorganisation provisions at the start of the period relate principally to a store closure programme launched in the period ended 30 March 2002, and the costs
associated with the ongoing implementation of shared service functions. As detailed in note 4, following the acquisition of Onetel, the Group commenced a
reorganisation programme to integrate Onetel with the rest of the Group. The costs of this integration are estimated at £22.3m, principally being redundancy and
other employee costs, contract termination costs, and network and customer migration costs. These costs are expected to be incurred substantially in the period
ending 31 March 2007.
Sales:
Sales provisions relate to “cash-back” and similar promotions, product warranties, product returns, and network operator performance penalties. Sales provisions
are expected to be used within the following 12 to 24 months.
Other:
Other provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and all other provisions, principally being the anticipated costs of unresolved tax issues and legal
disputes, and costs associated with onerous contracts.

27 Pension arrangements
The Group provides various pension schemes for the benefit of a significant number of its employees:
Defined contribution schemes:
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the cost for the period was £2.8m (2005 – £1.9m).
Defined benefit schemes:
On 5 April 2000 the Group commenced the winding up of a defined benefit pension scheme. Based on actuarial advice, the assets of the scheme are anticipated
to be sufficient to meet the levels required by the Government’s Minimum Funding Requirements calculations. On completion of the winding up of the scheme, the
Group will retain no obligations in relation to the funding of scheme benefits.
28 Contingent liabilities
European VAT authorities continue to investigate the recovery of VAT in the industry for trading activities conducted prior to April 2003. Having undertaken a
detailed internal investigation and taken advice, the Directors continue to believe that there is no financial exposure to this issue within the financial statements.
29 Reconciliation of profit and net assets under UK GAAP to IFRS
As explained in note 1, these financial statements are the first annual financial statements that the Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Details of the adjustments that affect statutory profit, Headline profit and net assets in the relevant comparative periods, together with full reconciliations between
UK GAAP and IFRS, were issued on 22 September 2005 and are available on the Group’s website, www.cpwplc.com.
The adjustments are summarised as follows:

The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 64 29 Reconciliation of profit and net assets under UK GAAP to IFRS continued
Explanation of adjustments:
a) Share-based payments
IFRS requires that the fair value of share options granted after the prescribed date of 7 November 2002 is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
The charge is based on the fair value, measured using a Binomial model for share-based payments with internal performance criteria and a Monte Carlo model for
share-based payments with external performance criteria, of the shares that are expected to vest (see note 6). Under UK GAAP , a charge was only made to the
income statement for share options granted at an exercise price below market value.
As a result, an additional charge of £1.2m arose in the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005, principally in respect of the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The cost of the options is accrued in reserves and therefore has no impact on shareholders’ equity.
The additional IFRS charge is partially offset in the income statement by a deferred tax credit of £0.3m in the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005.
b) Goodwill and other intangible assets
Under UK GAAP , capitalised goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life. Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for
impairment. Goodwill amortisation of £33.2m charged under UK GAAP in the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005 has therefore been reversed under IFRS.
IFRS also requires that, on acquisition, specific intangible assets are identified and recognised and then amortised over their useful economic lives. Such acquisition
intangibles include customer bases and customer lists, to which value is first attributed at the time of acquisition. In the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005, amortisation
on these acquisition intangibles is £7.5m. These assets were previously included in goodwill and amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
Under IFRS, deferred subscriber acquisition costs, software and licenses and key money are reclassified as intangible assets.
Under UK GAAP , the value of acquired tax losses was only recognised in determining goodwill to the extent that their utilisation could be foreseen at the time 
of acquisition, whereas under IFRS goodwill is adjusted for the value of acquired tax losses as they are utilised, even if this utilisation could not be foreseen at 
the time of acquisition.
A goodwill expense of £1.0m has been recognised in the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005 in relation to acquired tax losses.
c) Other adjustments
Other adjustments relate principally to property lease incentives and holiday pay.
Under IFRS, property lease incentives are recognised over the full length of the lease, rather than the period to the first rent review. This results in an additional
charge of £0.5m in the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005 and a reduction in net assets of £2.3m at 2 April 2005 and £1.7m at 28 March 2004.
An accrual for holiday pay has also been recognised under IFRS, the value of which is £2.5m at 2 April 2005 and 28 March 2004.
d) Deferred tax on IFRS adjustments
Deferred tax on these adjustments relates largely to share-based payments and acquisition intangibles.
Deferred tax on share-based payments results in a tax credit of £0.3m in the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005 and a cumulative tax credit of £7.1m and £4.9m 
in reserves at 2 April 2005 and 28 March 2004 respectively. Deferred tax on share-based payments is calculated on the difference between the market price at the 
date of the financial statements and the option exercise price; as a result the tax effect will not correlate exactly to the share-based payment charge.
IFRS also requires the creation of a deferred tax liability in respect of acquisition intangibles which have no tax base, resulting in a corresponding increase in
acquisition intangibles and goodwill. Deferred tax is credited to the income statement over the period as amortisation is charged, resulting in a credit to the 
tax charge of £1.4m in the 53 weeks ended 2 April 2005.
Other deferred tax adjustments relate principally to lease incentives.
e) Translation differences
IFRS requires goodwill to be held in the currency of the operations to which it relates; as a result, a translation difference to increase reserves by £4.9m was
recognised for the period ended 2 April 2005. In addition, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption allowed in IFRS1 not to apply IAS21 ‘The Effects 
of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before the 
date of transition to IFRS.
f) Proposed dividends
Under IFRS, dividends proposed but not yet authorised are not accrued in the financial statements.
Dividend accruals have therefore been reversed, resulting in an increase in total equity of £11.0m at 2 April 2005 and £7.9m at 28 March 2004.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued www.cpwplc.com 65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued
30 Adoption of IAS32 and IAS39
The Group has chosen to adopt IAS32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’
prospectively from 3 April 2005, in accordance with the transitional provisions. As a result, the relevant comparative information for the 53 weeks ended 
2 April 2005 does not reflect the impact of these standards.
The adoption of IAS39 causes a reduction in shareholders’ equity of £7.7m as at 3 April 2005, made up of the following amounts shown net of taxation:
Note £’000
Fair value of current asset investments and forward currency contracts a 1,760
Fair value of non-current asset investments b (2,294)
Financial liabilities c (7,207)
Reduction in shareholders’ equity (7,741)
a) Fair value of current asset investments and forward currency contracts
Under UK GAAP , current asset investments were recorded at the lower of cost and realisable value. Under IAS32 and IAS39, the Group’s current asset investments
are categorised as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, together with any related deferred tax, are taken directly to reserves and
recycled to the income statement when investments are sold or determined to be impaired. The impact of revaluing the Group’s current asset investments 
at 3 April 2005, net of deferred tax, is an increase in reserves of £1.9m.
In addition, under IAS32 and IAS39 the Group’s forward currency contracts are recognised in the financial statements at fair value, based on contracted exchange
rates. Under UK GAAP contracts were valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value, together with any related deferred tax,
are taken to the income statement. The impact of fair valuing forward currency contracts at 3 April 2005, net of deferred tax, is a reduction in reserves of £0.1m.
b) Fair value of non-current asset investments
Under UK GAAP , non-current asset investments were held at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value. Under IFRS, the Group’s non-current 
asset investments are categorised as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Fair value at 3 April 2005 has been determined using European Venture Capital
Association guidelines and results in a reduction in reserves of £2.3m. This diminution in value is not considered to be permanent. Changes in fair value, together
with any related deferred tax, are taken directly to reserves.
c) Financial liabilities
IAS39 requires financial liabilities to be maintained in the balance sheet until they are legally extinguished, unlike UK GAAP , which required a provision to the 
extent that it was considered probable that there would be an outflow of economic benefit. Liabilities of £7.2m have been reinstated to reflect this requirement 
at 3 April 2005.
31 Related party transactions
During the reporting period G Roux de Bezieux, a Director of the Company, held 5% of the issued share capital of Omer Telecom SAS, a subsidiary 
of the Group.
32 Post balance sheet events
On 3 April 2006, the Group signed a joint venture agreement with Virgin Group Investments Limited (Virgin) to operate a nationwide mobile virtual network operator
(MVNO) in France. The MVNO will operate under the Virgin Mobile brand, using the Orange network. The Group and Virgin will each own and fund 48.5% of the
joint venture, with management owning and funding 3.0%. The assets and customers of Omer Telecom SAS, the Group’s existing MVNO operations in France, will
be included within the joint venture.

and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the individual Company
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the individual
Company financial statements.
Opinion

The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 68 Notes to the Company Financial Statements
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS20 ‘Share-based
Payment’, which in accordance with the transitional provisions has been
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002.
Dividends
Dividends receivable from the Company’s subsidiaries are recognised only
when they are approved by shareholders.
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as
a liability in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved
by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised in the
period in which they are paid.
Foreign exchange
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases
or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised in the financial statements
at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded 
at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are hedged, mainly using forward
foreign exchange contracts to create matching liabilities and assets.
Financial instruments
The Company uses forward currency contracts to reduce its exposure to
exchange rate fluctuations. From 3 April 2005, such contracts are measured
at their fair value based on contracted exchange rates. Changes in fair value
are recognised in the income statement.
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom accounting standards under the historical cost convention,
as modified by FRS26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’ as detailed below.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently
throughout the period and the preceding period, except as required by
accounting standards that came into force in the current financial period,
which are as follows:
FRS20 ‘Share-based Payment’
Requires that the fair value of options granted, defined at the date of grant, 
is recognised in the profit and loss account over the vesting period 
(see Share-based payments below).
FRS21 ‘Events After The Balance Sheet Date’
Requires that dividends proposed but not yet authorised are not recognised
as assets or liabilities in the financial statements.
FRS26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’
Requires third-party investments to be recorded at fair value rather than cost.
During the period the Company also adopted FRS23 ‘The Effects of 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, FRS25 ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation’, and FRS28 ‘Corresponding Amounts’. 
The adoption of these standards has not had a significant impact 
on the Company’s financial statements.
Investments
All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the
consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with 
the investment.
The Company adopted FRS26 from 3 April 2005, as a result of which its
third-party investments are categorised as available-for-sale and recorded 
at fair value from this date.
Changes in fair value, together with any related deferred tax, are taken
directly to reserves, and recycled to the profit and loss account when the
investment is sold or is determined to be impaired.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain
employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value
at the date of grant, and expensed over the vesting period, based on the
Company’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for share-based payments
with internal performance criteria (such as Earnings Per Share targets) and 
a Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria (such as
Total Shareholder Return targets).
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of options expected
to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on expectations of
performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the profit
and loss account, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of options
expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet 
is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry 
in reserves.

The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2006 74 Explanatory Notes to the Resolutions
The amount represents 10% of the ordinary shares in issue as at 1 April
2006. The authority is limited to the stated upper and lower prices payable
for the shares which reflects the requirements of the UK Listing Authority. 
As at 6 June 2006 there were 77,135,884 outstanding options granted 
and unexercised under all share option schemes operated by the Company
which, if exercised, would represent 8.7% of the existing issued ordinary
share capital of the Company. If this authority to repurchase was exercised 
in full, such options would represent approximately 9.5% of the issued share
capital at such date.
The Directors would only propose to make share purchases where the
expected effect would be to increase earnings per share and having 
reviewed the overall financial position of the Company, such purchases 
were considered to be in the best interests of the shareholders generally.
General notes
1. Eligibility to attend
The Company specifies that only those shareholders on the register of
members as at 6pm on 25 July 2006 are entitled to attend and vote at the
meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that
time. Changes to entries on the register of members after 6pm on 25 July 2006
shall be disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend or vote
at the meeting.
2. Proxy voting
A shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to
appoint a proxy or proxies to attend and, on a poll, to vote on his/her behalf.
A proxy need not be a member of the Company. To be valid, a form of proxy,
a form of which is enclosed, and any power of attorney or the authority under
which it is signed or a duly certified copy thereof must be lodged with the
registrars of the Company, Lloyds TSB, whose details are found on page 21
of the Annual Report, before 11am on 25 July 2006. Shareholders who return
completed proxy voting forms may still attend the meeting instead of their
proxies and vote in person if they wish. In the event of a poll in which the
shareholder votes in person, his/her proxy votes lodged with the Company
will be excluded.
3
. Electronic voting
Instructions for registering your votes electronically are appended to the form
of proxy enclosed with this notice. 
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST
electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures
described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a
voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service
to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’)
must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described
in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as 
to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 7RA01) by the latest time(s) for
receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by
the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) 
from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated
to the appointee through other means.
Remuneration Report
Resolution 2
The Company is required under the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (“Regulations”) to produce a remuneration report for
shareholders which must comply with the Regulations, be approved by 
the Board and filed with the Registrar of Companies. The Report must 
also be approved by the shareholders.
Dividend
Resolution 3
Final dividends must be approved by shareholders but must not exceed 
the amount recommended by Directors. If the meeting approves the final
dividend it will be paid out in accordance with the Financial Calendar set 
out on page 77 of the Annual Report.
Directors 
Resolutions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 
David Ross is required to retire by rotation and to stand for re-election every
three years pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association adopted on
13th July 2000 (“Articles”). Steven Esom and David Mansfield were appointed
as Directors with effect from 29 September 2005. Sally Morgan was
appointed as a Director with effect from 1 November 2005 and Andrew
Harrison was appointed as a Director with effect from 3 April 2006. The
Articles require that all Directors appointed by the Board are elected by the
Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their
appointment. No director may vote in respect of his own appointment.
Biographical details of those Directors seeking election and re-election are
given on page 21 of the Annual Report and will be available at the meeting.
Auditors
Resolutions 9
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at
which accounts are presented, to hold office until the end of the next such
meeting. This resolution is recommended by the Audit Committee and
proposes the re-appointment of the Company’s existing auditors Deloitte &
Touche LLP , and follows good practice in giving authority to the Audit
Committee to determine their remuneration. 
Allotment of shares
Resolutions 10 and 11
These resolutions renew the Directors’ authority to issue relevant securities up
to an aggregate nominal amount of £295,834 being a sum equal to one third
of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company at 1 April 2006. 
The Directors will also be able to make issues for cash on a non pre-emptive
basis. The proposed limit of £44,375 represents 5% of the nominal amount 
of the issued ordinary share capital as at 1 April 2006.
The Company had 887,501,376 ordinary shares of 0.1p each in issue at 
1 April 2006 and the Company’s authorised share capital is 1,500,000,000
ordinary shares of 0.1p each.
The above limits are in line with the guidelines issued by the Investment
Committees of the Association of British Insurers and the National
Association of Pension Funds. 
Repurchase of shares 
Resolution 12 
This grants the Company authority to purchase its own shares up to a
maximum amount of 88,750,138 until the Annual General Meeting in 2007.
The Companies Act 1985 permits a company to purchase its own shares
provided that the purchase has been authorised by the Company in a general
meeting. It is common practice for listed companies to seek such authority
and the Directors consider that it is prudent to seek such authority at the
Annual General Meeting.
www.cpwplc.com 75 Explanatory Notes to the Resolutions continued
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available special
procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored
member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST
system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and,
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.

THE BUSINESS IN LEISURE
Sceptre Leisure Solutions
Rents	 coin-operated	 amusement	 equipment	 to	 pubs	 and	 other	 leisure	 venues	
throughout	 the	 UK,	 supplying	 many	 of	 the	 major	 players	 in	 the	 leisure	 industry.
Sceptre	 enjoys	a	 strong	 position	 as	 the	 only	 national	 amusement	 machine	
operator	 with	 fully-manned	 depots	 throughout	 the	 UK.	 It	 has	 an	 excellent	
reputation	 for	 quality	 and	 has	 seen	 consistent	 growth	 throughout	 the		
last	 twelve	 years.
Lotteryking
Founded	 in	 1993,	 Lotteryking	 is	 the	 market	 leader	 in	 vended	 lottery	 solutions	
to	 the	 registered	 members’	 club	 market.	 It	 provides	 pull-tab	 lottery	 tickets	 and	
lottery	 solutions	 to	 over	 3,000	 locations	 across	 the	 UK.	 The	 company	 continues	 to	
develop	 the	 product,	 introducing	 innovative	 new	 technology	 such	 as	 LCD	 screens	
for	 advertising	 use.	 The	 Lotteryking	 brand	 has	 been	 developed	 from	a	 purely	
social	 club	 market,	 and	 is	 now	 available	 in	 pubs		
and	 other	 public	 places.
Kelly’s Eye
Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 (formerly	 Gamingking)	 acquired	 Kelly’s	 Eye	 in	 May	 2005.	
As	 the	 leading	 supplier	 of	 fundraising	 products	 to	 the	 registered	 members’	 club	
market,	 Kelly’s	 Eye	 offers	a	 full	 range	 of	 fundraising	 and	 gameplay	 products.	
From	 bingo	 to	 darts,	 poker	 to	 skittles;	 Kelly’s	 Eye	 products	 provide	 entertainment	
for	 thousands	 every	 week.	 Kelly’s	 Eye	 is	 also	 able	 to	 produce	 bespoke	 raffle	
and	 draw	 tickets	 to	 order .	 Although	 historically	 being	a	 ‘club-focused’	 business,	
Kelly’s	 Eye	 is	 now	 taking	 advantage	 of	 Sceptre	 Leisure’s	 strong	 presence	 and	
relationships	 in	 the	 pub	 market.
Since formation in 1998 Sceptre has grown to be one of only two truly national 
suppliers of coin-operated leisure equipment to the licensed market. We provide 
excellence not only through products supplied but also through unrivalled 
customer service standards. Our service is now well recognised throughout 
the UK with all major regional and national brewers, pub companies, and leisure 
chains. Over the past 12 years, Sceptre has become much more than an 
operating company and now adds unique value to our customer partners 
through four trading brands:
Our trading brands
Party House
Party	 House	 has	 been	 operating	 since	 1977,	 supplying	a	 wide	 range	 of	 party	
supplies	 and	 display	 products	 to	 the	 trade,	 wholesale	 and	 direct	 to	 the	 public.	
Party	 House	 joined	 the	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 Group	 in	 June	 2010.	 Party	 House	 can	
source,	 design,	 pack	 and	 distribute	 all	 your	 party	 supply	 decorations	 and	 novelties	
direct	 from	 our	 warehouse	 in	 Preston. 		 Sceptre Leisure plc 03

Our strategy
Delivering sustainable returns
Sceptre’s goal is to continue to deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders. 
Our goal is to develop a market leadership position through organic and 
acquisitive growth, allowing us to create long-term shareholder value.
Implementing our strategy
Developing our organisation
Our	 growth	 over	 the	 past	 12	 years	 has	
been	 both	 organic	 and	 acquisitive.	
We	 seek	 to	 gain	 new	 business	 in	
geographical	 areas	 that	 complement	 our	
nationwide	 operational	 infrastructure.	
Acquisitions	 are	 integrated	 quickly	 and	
efficiently	 so	 that	 they	 can	 begin	 to	
contribute	 from	 day	 one.
Market focus 
We	 continue	 to	 win	 high-quality	 business	
in	 all	 areas	 of	 the	 UK.	 Our	 commitment		
to	 customer	 service	 has	 led	 us	 to	
be	 recognised	 as	a	 leading	 machine	
operator	 by	 the	 UK’s	 premium		
pub	 companies.
Improving our operations.  
The	 combination	 of	 our	 recent	
acquisition	 and	 contract	 wins	 gives		
us	a	 great	 platform	 from	 which	 to	 build	
the	 business.
We	 are	 the	 only	 national	 operator	 with	
fully-manned	 depots	 across	 the	 UK.	
We	 invest	 in	 high-quality	 machines	 and	
components;	 this	 reduces	 downtime	
through	 breakdown	 and	 ensures	 that	 our	
assets	 are	 operational	 more	 of	 the	 time.
Our	 target	 is	 to	 have	 95%	 of	 our	 assets	
on	 site	 at	 any	 one	 time.	 This	 high	 level	 of	
utilisation	 maximises	 returns	 from	 our	
machine	 estate.

Chairman’s Statement
Continued growth
We have once again seen an 
increase in turnover and profit, 
achieved against a backdrop 
of recession and economic 
uncertainty in the UK.
Welcome	 to	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc’s	 2010	
report	 and	 accounts.	 The	 Group	 has	 been	
active	 during	 the	 year,	 which	 included	
an	 acquisition,	a	 disposal	 and	 continued	
organic	 growth.	 We	 have	 once	 again	
seen	 an	 increase	 in	 turnover	 and	 profit,	
achieved	 against	a	 backdrop	 of	 recession	
and	 economic	 uncertainty	 in	 the	 UK.
During	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year	 the	 Group	
has	 achieved	a	 number	 of	 targets.
On	5	 July	 2009,	 the	 Company	 completed	
a	 £5.5m	 share	 placing	 with	 Hillroad	
Investments,	 equivalent	 to	 29.9%	 of		
the	 enlarged	 issued	 share	 capital.
On	1	 December	 2009,	 increased	 banking	
facilities	 were	 agreed	 with	 Lloyds	 Banking	
Group.	A	 new	 £6.0m	 revolving	 finance	
facility	 and	 £0.5m	 working	 capital	 facility	
replaced	 the	 £3m	 overdraft	 originally	
agreed	 with	 Bank	 of	 Scotland	 in	 2008.	
These	 new	 resources	 have	 been	 used	
to	 invest	 in	 new	 machines	 across	 the	
entire	 estate.
In	 spite	 of	a	 difficult	 financial	 climate,	
we	 have	 been	 successful	 in	 replacing	a	
number	 of	 the	 asset	 finance	 lines	 lost		
in	 the	 previous	 financial	 year	 due	 to		
the	 banking	 crisis.
We	 retain	 sufficient	 headroom	 within	 our	
facilities	 to	 continue	 our	 expansion	 into	
the	 new	 financial	 year.
On	 15	 December	 2009,	 we	 announced	 the	
acquisition	 of	 Australian	8	 Ball,	a	 single-
site	 operator	 based	 in	 Dorset.	 This	 new	
addition	 to	 the	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 Group	
was	a	 combined	 cash	 and	 shares	 deal	
with	a	 total	 value	 of	 £1.1m.	 The	 acquired	
business	 strengthened	 our	 position	 in	
the	 South	 and	 South-West	 of	 England,	
and	 has	 begun	 to	 offer	 both	 financial	 and	
operational	 benefits	 to	 the	 organisation.
On	 19	 April	 2010,	 we	 completed	 the	 sale		
of	 our	 Fixed	 Odds	 Betting	 Terminal	
(FOBT)	 estate	 to	 Global	 Draw	 Limited,		
a	 subsidiary	 of	 Scientific	 Games.	 This	
followed	 the	 end	 of	 our	 exclusivity	 deal	
with	 Videobet	 and	 Playtech	 plc,	 with	
whom	 we	 had	 pioneered	 the	 introduction	
and	 roll-out	 of	 market-leading	 technology	
in	 the	 licensed	 betting	 office	 (LBO)	
market.	 The	 sale,	 for	a	 cash	 consideration	
of	 £3.75m,	 generated	a	 profit	 of	 £0.8m	
for	 the	 Group.	 The	 deal	 was	 particularly	
timely	 given	 the	 increasing	 levels	 of	
uncertainty	 and	 regulatory	 restrictions	
surrounding	 the	 operation	 of	 FOBTs		
in	 the	 UK.
That	 we	 have	 achieved	 the	 above	
during	 the	 worst	 recession	 in	 50	 years	
is	 testament	 to	 the	 hard	 work	 and	
dedication	 of	 our	 employees	 across	 all	
of	 our	 trading	 divisions.	 We	 continue	
to	 differentiate	 ourselves	 from	 the	
competition	 by	 offering	 excellent	
customer	 service	 and	a	 ‘can-do’	
operational	 attitude.	I	 would	 like	 to	 place	
on	 record	 my	 thanks	 to	 all	 employees	 and	
Directors	 for	 their	 continued	 efforts	 over	
the	 course	 of	 the	 year.
The	 year	 also	 saw	a	 number	 of	 changes	
to	 the	 Board	 of	 Directors.	 In	 January	
2010,	 Lesley	 Humphrys	 stepped	 down	 as	
Finance	 Director	 in	 order	 to	 concentrate	
on	 the	 operations	 of	 Sceptre	 Leisure	
Solutions,	 our	 principal	 trading	 subsidiary.	
I	 would	 like	 to	 take	 the	 time	 on	 behalf		
of	 the	 Board	 to	 express	 our	 thanks	 for		
her	 hard	 work	 and	 diligence.
In	 May	 2010,	 the	 role	 of	 Finance	 Director	
was	 taken	 over	 by	 Mark	 White,	 previously	
FD	 of	 Gamingking	 plc,	 and	 who	 has	 been	
with	 the	 Group	 since	 2006.
Finally	 Brian	 Nichols,	a	 founder	 of	
Lotteryking	 Limited	 and	 main	 Board	
member	 since	 the	 Group’s	 flotation	 in	
1996,	 retired	 from	 the	 Board	 in	 May	 2010.	
Once	 again	I	 would	 like	 to	 thank	 Brian	 on	
behalf	 of	 the	 Board	 for	 his	 dedication	 and	
unstinting	 efforts	 over	 the	 past	 24	 years.	
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 report	 that	 Brian	 remains	
within	 the	 Group	 in	 an	 advisory	 capacity.
In	 closing,	I	 believe	 that	 we	 remain	 well-
placed	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	 consolidation	
within	 the	 market.	 We	 have	 funds	
available	 to	 grow	 either	 organically	
through	 contract	 wins,	 or	 by	 means		
of	 further	 acquisition	 opportunities.

Chief Executive’s Review
Building the business
Nationwide locations
Our	 nationwide	 network	 of	 service	 depots	
allows	 us	 to	 react	 quickly	 to	 our	 customers’	
needs.	 We	 aim	 to	 provide	 engineering	
response	 within	 two	 hours	 anywhere	 within	
the	 UK.
On call
We	 like	 to	 talk	 to	 our	 customers,	 to	 ensure		
that	 we	 understand	 their	 requirements.		
We	 provide	 telephone	 service	 cover	 364	 days	
a	 year.	
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 be	 able	 to	 report	
a	 strong	 set	 of	 results	 for	 the	 year	
ended	 30	 April	 2010.
We	 have	 continued	 the	 progress	 outlined	
in	 our	 interim	 results	 with	 growth	 in	 both	
revenue	 and	 earnings	 compared	 to	 the	
previous	 year,	 continuing	 our	 12-year	
unbroken	 run	 of	 profitable	 growth.
Performance overview
The	 period	 under	 review	 has	 provided	
much	 in	 the	 way	 of	 challenge,	 whether	
due	 to	 recession,	 pub	 closures	 or	
instability	 in	 the	 financial	 markets.	
However	 Sceptre	 has	 continued	 to	
grow	 and	 develop	 operations	 in	 all	
areas	 of	 the	 business.
We	 have	 maintained	 or	 increased	 our	
asset	 usage	 and	 staffing	 ratios,	 whilst	
continuing	 to	 offer	 unrivalled	 service	
to	 our	 customers	 in	 the	 licensed	 trade	
across	 the	 UK.
During	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year	 we	 undertook	
several	 important	 transactions;	a	 share	
placing,	 an	 acquisition	 and	a	 strategic	
disposal	 were	 all	 successfully	 completed.
I	 would	 like	 to	 take	 this	 opportunity	 to	
summarise	 the	 activities	 in	 each	 of	 our	
three	 trading	 divisions.
Sceptre Leisure Solutions
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions	 forms	 the	
backbone	 of	 our	 Group.	 It	 provides	 over	
90%	 of	 our	 revenues	 and	 continues		
to	 grow.
The	 division	 is	 the	 second-largest	
operator	 of	 amusement	 machines	 in	 the	
UK	 licensed	 market.	 Like-for-like	 revenues	
and	 machine	 numbers	 grew	 during	 the	
year,	 against	a	 backdrop	 of	 continuing	
pub	 closures.
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions’	 success	 is	
built	 on	 strict	 adherence	 to	 operational	
ratios	 and	 key	 performance	 indicators.	
Average	 weekly	 rental	 returns	 fell	
during	 the	 year	 due	 to	 two	 main	 factors.	
The	 first	 was	 the	 sale	 of	 our	 FOBT	 rental	
business,	 which	 achieved	 high	 income	
per	 machine	 but	 with	 correspondingly	
high	 maintenance	 cost.	 The	 second	 factor	
was	 the	 significant	 decline	 in	 SWP	 (skills	
with	 prizes,	 or	 quiz	 machine)	 income	
due	 to	 the	 withdrawal	 of	 certain	 games	
due	 to	 new	 regulations.	 Weekly	 machine	
rentals	 in	 this	 sector	 fell	 by	 17%	 over	 the	
course	 of	 the	 year.	 In	 the	 face	 of	 this,	 an	
8%	 overall	 decrease	 in	 machine	 week	
average	 represents	a	 good	 peformance	
in	 the	 current	 market.	 We	 maintained	
or	 improved	 all	 of	 our	 other	 measures,	
disclosed	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 Financial	
Review	 on	 page	 16.
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions	 continued	
to	 win	 new	 business	 during	 the	 year,	
with	 contract	 awards	 from	 high-quality	
operators	 such	 as	 Whitbread,	 and	
also	 contract	 renewals	 from	 existing	
customers	 such	 as	 SSP	 (which	 operates	
at	 train	 stations	 across	 the	 UK).

Our	 success	 in	 winning	 and	 retaining	
business	 is	 due	 to	a	 combination	 of	
market-leading	 customer	 service	 and	
the	 operational	 know-how	 provided	
by	 our	 experienced	 and	 dedicated	
operational	 staff.
The	 growth	 has	 continued	 into	 the		
new	 financial	 year,	 with	a	 significant	
contract	 award	 from	 Punch	 Pub	 Company.	
This	 new	 partnership	 will	 increase	 our	
machine	 estate	 by	 around	 1,000	 pieces	 in	
the	 second	 half	 of	 2010/11.
During	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2010,	
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions	 achieved	
revenue	 growth	 of	 6.6%,	 and	 machine	
number	 growth	 (excluding	 disposals)		
of	 3.7%.
Australian 8 Ball acquisition
On	 15	 December	 2009,	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	
announced	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Australian	
8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited,	 based	 in	 Dorset,	
which	 operated	 in	 410	 sites	 predominately	
across	 the	 South	 and	 South-West	 of	
England.
The	 acquisition	 of	 Australian	8	 Ball	
strengthened	 Sceptre’s	 position	 in	 the	
important	 southern	 marketplace	 and	
added	a	 strategically	 important	 depot	
in	 that	 area.
As	 is	 the	 Sceptre	 way,	 integration	 of	
Australian	8	 Ball	 into	 our	 business	 was	
effected	 quickly	 and	 efficiently,	 with	
full	 operational	 transition	 into	 Sceptre’s	
market-leading	 systems	 and	 processes	
being	 completed	 within	 four	 weeks.
The	 Group	 continues	 to	 look	 for	 similar ,	
earnings-enhancing	 acquisitions	 within	
the	 fragmented	 machine-operator	 market.	
I	 believe	 that	 there	 are	a	 number	 of	 such	
acquisitions	 that	 could	 be	 made,	 each	 of	
which	 would	 provide	 significant	 benefits	
both	 operationally	 and	 financially.	
We	 remain	 committed	 to	 our	 strategy	
of	 organic	 growth,	 coupled	 with	 selective	
acquisition.
Sale of Fixed Odds Betting Terminal 
rental assets 
On	 19	 April	 2010,	 the	 Group	 sold	 its	
Fixed	 Odds	 Betting	 Terminal	 (FOBT)	
rental	 assets	 to	 Global	 Draw	 Limited	 for	a	
total	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £3.75m.
Whilst	 we	 had	 worked	 hard	 in	 our	
partnership	 with	 Playtech	 and	 Video	 Bet	
to	 roll-out	 their	 software	 platform	 to	 the	
UK	 licensed	 betting	 office	 (LBO)	 market,	
we	 recognised	 two	 factors	 affecting	 our	
ability	 to	 grow	 further	 in	 this	 particular	
sector .	 The	 first	 was	 growing	 uncertainty	
over	 the	 future	 regulatory	 framework	
under	 which	 the	 FOBT	 machines	 would	
operate.	
Amusement with prizes
Amusement	 with	 prizes	 (AWP),	 commonly	
called	 fruit	 machines,	 provide	 an	 essential	
source	 of	 income	 for	 many	 of	 the	 UK’s	 pubs	
and	 clubs.	 Our	 long	 experience	 of	 operating	
in	 this	 sector	 allows	 us	 to	 help	 our	 customers	
maximise	 their	 profits	 from	 these	 machines.

On call
As	 part	 of	 our	 strategy	 for	 growth	 we		
commissioned	a	 new	 customer	 service	
centre,	 which	 opened	 in	 January	 2010.
The	 FOBT	 rental	 assets	 comprised	 751	
terminals	 and	 associated	 customer	
contracts,	 with	a	 net	 book	 value	 of	 £3.0m.	
The	 full	 amount	 of	 the	 consideration	
was	 paid	 in	 cash	 on	 completion,	 and	
generated	a	 one-off	 profit	 on	 disposal	
of	 £0.8m,	 which	 is	 recognised	 in	
these	 results.
This	 sale	 of	a	 non-core	 part	 of	 our	
business	 was	 at	a	 significant	 profit.	
Its	 disposal	 freed	 up	 capital	 and	 resources	
across	 the	 business	 to	 focus	 on	 the	
roll-out	 of	 machines	 to	 our	 traditional	
markets	 in	 pubs	 and	 other	 leisure	 outlets	
where	 we	 continue	 to	 see	 strong	 demand.
Share placing
On	5	 July	 2009,	 we	 completed	 the	
placing	 of	 16,603,400	 new	 Ordinary	
Shares	 with	 Hillroad	 Investments	 Limited	
at	a	 price	 of	 33.1p	 per	 share	 thereby	
raising	 gross	 proceeds	 of	 £5.5m.		
This	 represents	 29.9%	 of	 our	 enlarged	
share	 capital	 as	 at	 30	 April	 2010.
The	 lack	 of	 availability	 of	 asset	 finance	
had	 constrained	 us	 from	 continuing	 to	
grow	 the	 business	 in	 the	 early	 part	 of	 the	
financial	 year.	 In	 the	 same	 period	 there	
had	 been	 considerable	 consolidation	
in	 the	 gaming	 machine	 supply	 market.	
This	 consolidation	 opened	 up	 significant	
opportunities	 to	 win	 additional	 business	
with	 some	 of	 the	 major	 pub	 companies	
within	 the	 UK.	
I	 am	 delighted	 to	 welcome	 Hillroad	 as	a	
substantial	 shareholder .	 The	 additional	
capital	 has	 allowed	 us	 to	 drive	 our	
business	 forward	 and	 to	 take	 advantage	
of	 some	 of	 the	 significant	 opportunities	
that	 exist	 in	 our	 marketplace.	
Lotteryking
The	 registered	 members’	 club	 market	
endured	a	 difficult	 year.	 Footfall	 was	
down,	 with	 many	 sites	 finding	 income	
difficult	 to	 come	 by.	
During	 the	 year	 we	 reviewed		
Lotteryking’s	 operational	 structure,	 and	
relocated	 all	 telesales	 and	 administrative	
functions	 to	 our	 Preston	 head	 office.	
In	 doing	 so,	 we	 incurred	 one-off	 costs	
totalling	 £0.5m	 in	 redundancy	 and	
provision	 for	 future	 property	 costs	 at	 our	
Hainault	 facility.
In	 spite	 of	 this,	 Lotteryking	 has	 increased	
market	 share,	 with	 machine	 numbers	
increasing	 by	 15%	 over	 the	 course	 of	
the	 year.
Lotteries	 provide	a	 valuable,	 tax-free	
income	 stream	 for	 clubs,	 and	 Lotteryking	
has	 the	 largest	 range	 of	 tickets	 in	
the	 market	 to	 help	 them	 raise	 funds	
successfully.
Lotteryking’s	 customer	 base	 has	 also	
allowed	 Sceptre	 to	 begin	 penetrating	 the	
club	 market	 and	I	 would	 expect		
this	 steady	 growth	 to	 continue	 in	 the	
coming	 months.
Kelly’s Eye
In	 addition	 to	 private	 lotteries,	 registered	
members’	 clubs	 rely	 on	 the	 income	
generated	 from	 bingo	 and	 other	
fundraising	 activities.	 These	 indoor	 games	
also	 provide	a	 popular	 and	 enjoyable	
pastime	 for	 members	 of	 these	 clubs.

We	 are	 beginning	 to	 see	 these	 activities	
being	 replicated	 in	 the	 pub	 market.	
Bingo	 nights	 are	 becoming	 more	 popular	
as	 landlords	 look	 to	 gain	 additional	
midweek	 custom,	 and	 Sceptre’s	 sales	
and	 operational	 team	 is	 ideally-placed	
to	 deliver	 these	 fundraising	 items	 to	
pubs.	 Over	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year	 we	
introduced	 our	 ‘Collectors	 Deliver’	
programme,	 whereby	 pubs	 could	 order	
from	 their	 regular	 machine	 collector ,	
and	 have	 these	 goods	 personally	
delivered	 at	 the	 next	 collection.
This	 has	 proven	 to	 be	a	 popular	
service,	 and	 we	 are	 now	 working	 on	
the	 introduction	 of	a	 comprehensive	
catalogue	 containing	a	 complete	 range	
of	 products	 for	 the	 pub	 or	 club.
The	 catalogue	 will	 be	 sent	 to	 all	 12,000	
of	 our	 customers	 during	 the	 course	 of	
October ,	 and	 will	 be	 followed	 up	 by	a	
telesales	 marketing	 campaign	 to	 generate	
new	 sales	 from	 our	 existing	 client	 base.
This	 catalogue	 will	 be	 backed	 by	 our	
e-commerce	 websites	 also	 offering	 the	
full	 range	 of	 products	 to	 ensure	 that	
our	 customers	 can	 order	 goods	 at	a	 time	
and	 place	 that	 is	 convenient	 to	 them.
Outlook
I	 believe	 that	 the	 past	 year	 has	 left	
Sceptre	 well	 placed	 to	 take	 advantage	
of	 the	 many	 opportunities	 that	 exist	
in	 the	 pub	 and	 club	 markets.
We	 continue	 to	 win	 business	 from	 the	
competition	 through	 our	 offering	 of	
high-quality	 service	 and	 market-leading	
products.	 Our	 recent	 contract	 win	 with	
Punch	 Pub	 Company	 demonstrates	 that	
Sceptre	 is	 now	 seen	 as	a	 leading	 machine	
operator	 by	 the	 UK’s	 premium	 pub	
companies.
There	 are	a	 number	 of	 acquisition	
opportunities	 within	 the	 machine	 operating	
market	 which	 could	 be	 integrated	 into	
our	 existing	 depot	 infrastructure	 to	
deliver	 enhanced	 future	 earnings.	 We	 will	
continue	 to	 assess	 these	 opportunities,	
and	 pursue	 those	 that	 we	 feel	 offer	 the	
clearest	 benefits	 to	 our	 organisation.
We	 have	 demonstrated	 that	 Sceptre	 can	
continue	 to	 grow	 and	 prosper	 in	a	 difficult	
market,	 and	 we	 remain	 confident	 that	 we	
can	 continue	 to	 do	 so	 in	 the	 coming	 year.

Financial	Review
Strong	performance
Introduction
I	 would	 like	 to	 take	 the	 opportunity	 to	
review	 some	 key	 areas	 of	 our	 financial	
performance	 in	 the	 year	 under	 report.
Revenue
Group	 turnover	 increased	 by	 9%	 to	
£42.8m,	 due	 both	 to	 acquisitions	 and	
organic	 growth.
Rental	 income	 increased	 by	 7%	 to	
£38.8m	 with	 other	 streams	 amounting	
to	 £4.1m.
Profitability
Operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	
items	 increased	 by	 8%	 to	 £4.0m,	 whilst	
profit	 before	 tax	 increased	 by	 37%	 to	
£1.9m.	 The	 machine	 sales	 and	 rental	
division,	 representing	 91%	 of	 the	 Group	
revenues	 increased	 operating	 profit	
by	 20%	 to	 £5.1m.
Corporate	 overheads	 amounted	 to	
£0.9m	 (2009:	 £0.5m)	 and	 comprised	
the	 costs	 of	 the	 Board,	 legal,	 professional	
and	 other	 fees	 connected	 with	 running	
a	 public	 company.	 The	 comparative	 cost	
in	 2009	 in	 this	 area	 relates	 to	 the	 seven	
months	 following	 the	 reverse	 takeover	
of	 Gamingking	 plc	 in	 September	 2008.
Other	 divisions	 contributed	 an	 operating	
loss	 of	 £0.9m	 (2009:	 £0.2m)	 during	
the	 year.	 Much	 of	 this	 was	 due	 to	 the	
restructure	 of	 Lotteryking,	 with	 all	
administrative	 and	 distribution	 processes	
relocating	 to	 the	 Preston	 head	 office	
during	 the	 year.	 The	 exceptional	 costs	
relating	 to	 this	 are	 disclosed	 in	 note	4	
to	 the	 financial	 statements,	 and	 included	
a	 provision	 for	 onerous	 leases	 on	 our	
Hainault	 facility	 of	 £0.5m.	 The	 lease	 on	
this	 property	 was	 signed	 in	 1993	 with	
a	 25-year	 term	 and	 no	 break	 clauses.	
Given	 the	 current	 state	 of	 the	 commercial	
property	 market,	 we	 have	 therefore	
provided	 in	 full	 for	 the	 remaining	 term	
of	 the	 lease.
There	 was	 also	 an	 employee	 share-based	
payment	 charge	 recognised	 in	 the	 year	
of	 £0.1m	 (2009:	 £0.1m).
Finance	costs
The	 net	 finance	 costs	 charged	 to	 income	
were	 £1.4m	 (2009:	 £2.1m),	 of	 which	 £1.4m	
was	 cash	 interest.	 The	 balance	 related	 to	
a	 non-cash,	 interest	 rate	 swap	 movement	
of	 £0.1m	 gain	 (2009:	 £0.4m	 loss).	
This	 derivative	 contract	 was	a	 condition	
of	 the	 Group’s	 banking	 agreements	 with	
Bank	 of	 Scotland	 (now	 part	 of	 Lloyds	
Banking	 Group),	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 run	
alongside	 this	 facility	 until	 the	 end	 of	 the	
term	 loan	 in	 October	 2012.
Earnings	per	share
Basic	 earnings	 per	 share	 increased	 to	
3.0p	 (2009:	 2.6p).
Share	placing
On	5	 July	 2009	 the	 Company	 placed	
16,603,400	 Ordinary	 5p	 Shares	 with	
Hillroad	 Investments	 Limited	 at	a	 price	 of	
33.1p	 per	 share,	 thereby	 raising	 proceeds	
of	 £5.5m.	 These	 shares	 represent	 29.89%	
of	 the	 Company’s	 issued	 share	 capital	 as	
at	 the	 date	 of	 these	 accounts.
Acquisition
On	 15	 December	 2009,	 Sceptre	 Leisure	
plc	 announced	 the	 acquisition	 of	
Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited	
in	a	 combined	 cash	 and	 shares	 deal.	
The	 acquisition	 is	 disclosed	 in	 note	 15	
to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
Exceptional	costs
During	 the	 year	 the	 Group	 incurred	
certain	 one-off	 restructuring	 costs.	
These	 centred	 on	 provisions	 for	
redundancy	 and	 onerous	 leases	 for	
properties	 which	 are	 no	 longer	 required	
following	a	 restructure	 of	 Lotteryking.	
All	 onerous	 lease	 amounts	 payable	 have	
been	 fully	 provided	 for	 up	 to	 the	 first	
available	 term	 break.
In	 addition,	 the	 Directors	 considered	
that	 the	 brand	 names	 of	 Lotteryking	
and	 Kelly’s	 Eye	 had	 suffered	 impairment	
during	 the	 year,	 giving	 rise	 to	a	 cost	 of	
£0.2m	 (2009:	 nil).	 Finally,	 the	 fair	 value	
adjustment	 under	 IFRS3	 following	 the	
acquisition	 of	 Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	
led	 to	 the	 recognition	 of	 negative	
goodwill	 of	 £0.2m.	 These	 costs	 are	 set	
out	 in	 note	4	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	
statements.
Sale	of	Fixed	Odds	Betting	Terminal	
(FOBT)	assets
On	 19	 April	 2010	 the	 Group	 sold	 its	 FOBT	
rental	 assets	 to	 The	 Global	 Draw	 Limited	
for	a	 total	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £3.75m.	
The	 business	 comprised	 property,	 plant	
and	 equipment	 with	a	 net	 book	 value	 of	
£2.8m,	 and	 intangible	 assets	 (customer	
contracts)	 with	a	 net	 book	 value	 of	 £0.2m.
Key	performance	indicators
The	 Board	 of	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 monitors	
a	 range	 of	 financial	 and	 non-financial	
performance	 indicators,	 reported	 on	a	
periodic	 basis,	 to	 measure	 performance	
against	 expected	 targets.	 These	 include:

was	 proportionally	 higher	 in	 the	 first	 half	
of	 the	 year	 (£7 .4m)	 due	 to	 investment	 in	
new	 machines	 following	 the	 introduction	
of	 new	 stakes	 and	 prizes	 for	 AWPs	 in	
July	 2009.	 Capital	 expenditure	 remains	
focused	 on	 our	 machine	 estate,	 with	
£11.8m	 of	 expenditure	 (2009:	 £13.9m).	
The	 remaining	 expenditure	 was	 on	
improved	 warehousing	 facilities	 at	
our	 head	 office	 (£0.1m)	 and	 motor	
vehicles	 (£0.2m). 		 Sceptre	Leisure	plc	 17

Prior	year	adjustment
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Group	 revised	 its	
method	 of	 allocating	 interest	 over	 the	 life	
of	 the	 lease	 term	 in	 order	 to	 give	a	 better	
approximation	 of	a	 constant	 periodic	 rate	
of	 interest	 on	 the	 remaining	 balance	 of	
the	 liabiliy	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 17,	
leases.	 The	 effect	 of	 this	 restatement	 is		
to	 increase	 the	 2009	 finance	 cost	 by	
£190,000,	 reduce	 profit	 before	 taxation	
for	 2009	 by	 £190,000,	 increase	 interest	
bearing	 loans	 and	 borrowings	 as	 at	
30	 April	 2009	 by	 £248,000	 and	 reduce	
net	 assets	 as	 at	 30	 April	 2009	 by	
£248,000.	 An	 adjustment	 of	 £58,000		
has	 also	 been	 made	 to	 reduce	 retained	
earnings	 as	 at	1	 May	 2008	 to	 correct	 the	
impact	 on	 prior	 periods.	 This	 prior	 year	
adjustment	 is	 also	 disclosed	 in	 note	5	 to	
the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
Financing
Net	 debt	 decreased	 to	 £15.9m	 compared	 to	
£19.5m	 as	 at	 30	 April	 2009.	 This	 decrease	
is	 principally	 as	a	 result	 of	 the	 sale	 of	 the	
FOBT	 rental	 assets	 immediately	 prior	 to	
year	 end.	 At	 the	 end	 of	 April	 2010	 bank	
debt	 stood	 at	 £12.7m	 (April	 2009:	
£10.7m),	 made	 up	 of	a	 loan	 of	 £6.2m,	 an	
overdraft	 of	 £0.5m,	 and	a	 revolving	 credit	
facility	 of	 £6.0m	 (April	 2009:	 loan	 £8.3m,	
overdraft	 £2.4m).	 The	 loan	 is	 repayable	
over	a	 five-year	 term	 ending	 in	
September	 2012.
Total	 bank	 loan	 repayments	 during	 the	
year	 were	 £2.1m.	 In	 addition,	 £1.5m	 on	
a	 vendor	 loan	 (2009:	 £2.2m)	 remains	
outstanding.	 This	 loan	 was	 created	 on	 the	
acquisition	 of	 the	 Crown	 Leisure	 estate,	
and	 is	 repayable	 by	 2012,	 with	 capital	
repayments	 of	 £0.7m	 being	 made	 during	
the	 year.
The	 Group	 uses	 finance	 leasing	 to	 acquire	
certain	 of	 its	 plant	 and	 equipment.	
At	 the	 end	 of	 April	 2010,	 asset	 finance	
outstanding	 totalled	 £5.5m	 (2009:	
£7 .4m).	 The	 leases	 are	 held	 with	 various	
financial	 institutions	 under	 differing	
terms,	 but	 in	 general	 machine	 assets		
are	 financed	 over	a	 period	 of	 24	 months,	
with	 commercial	 vehicles	 financed	 over		
a	 period	 of	 up	 to	 48	 months.	
All	 key	 financing	 covenants	 have	 been	
met	 for	 the	 period.
Financial	risk	treasury	management
The	 majority	 of	 the	 Group’s	 borrowings	
are	 fixed	 through	a	 combination	 of	 fixed	
rate	 securitised	 debt	 and	 interest	 rate	
swaps.	 The	 banking	 and	 covenants	 are	
reviewed	 throughout	 the	 year	 as	 part		
of	 the	 internal	 reporting	 process	 with		
a	 focus	 on	 ensuring	 appropriate	
headroom	 is	 available.	
Interest	rate	risk
The	 Group	 uses	 an	 interest	 rate	 collar		
to	 manage	 its	 exposure	 to	 interest	 rate	
movements	 on	 its	 bank	 borrowings.	
Contracts	 covering	 notional	 amounts	
equivalent	 to	 the	 bank	 loan	 restrict	
interest	 payments	 at	 rates	 between		
4.7%	 and	 5.75%	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the		
loan.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 collar	 at	 the	
reporting	 date	 is	 reflected	 in	 the	 Group	
balance	 sheet	 under	 the	 derivative	
financial	 instrument	 heading.
Currency	rate	risk
The	 Group	 buys	 currency	 at	 spot	 rate.	
There	 are	 few	 transactions	 in	 foreign	
currencies	 and	 therefore	 the	 Group's	
exposure	 to	 foreign	 exchange	 risk	 is	
considered	 to	 be	 low.	 The	 Group	 would	
look	 to	 minimise	 any	 increased	 exposure	
to	 foreign	 exchange	 through	 the	 use	 of	
currency	 instruments,	 if	 appropriate.
Liquidity	risk
The	 Group’s	 approach	 to	 managing	
liquidity	 is	 to	 ensure,	 as	 far	 as	 possible,	
that	 it	 has	 sufficient	 liquidity	 to	 meet		
its	 liabilities	 as	 they	 fall	 due	 with	 surplus	
facilities	 to	 cope	 with	 any	 unexpected	
variances	 in	 timing	 of	 cash	 flows.		
At	 30	 April	 2010,	 the	 Group	 had	
undrawn	 borrowing	 facilities	 of	 £1.3m	
(2009:	 £3.1m),	 of	 which	 £1.3m	 (2009:	
£1.2m)	 were	 uncommitted.	 In	 addition	
to	 undrawn	 borrowing	 facilities,	 as	 at	
30	 April	 2010,	 the	 Group	 held	 on	 deposit	
cash	 of	 £4.2m.
Taxation
The	 effective	 tax	 rate	 for	 the	 year	 was	
15.3%	 (2009:	 30.3%).

Forward-looking	statements
Any	 forward-looking	 statements	 made	
in	 this	 document	 represent	 the	 Board’s	
best	 judgement	 as	 to	 what	 may	 occur	 in	
the	 future.	 However ,	 the	 Group’s	 actual	
fiscal	 results	 and	 corporate	 developments	
in	 the	 current	 and	 future	 periods	 will	
depend	 on	a	 number	 of	 economic,	
competitive	 and	 other	 factors	 some	 of	
which	 will	 be	 outside	 the	 Group’s	 control.	
Such	 factors	 could	 cause	 the	 Group’s	
actual	 results	 for	 future	 periods	 to	
differ	 materially	 from	 those	 expressed	
in	 any	 forward-looking	 statements	
in	 this	 document.
Board	composition
The	 Group	 is	 controlled	 through	 its	
Board	 of	 Directors.	 The	 Board	 comprises	
the	 Non-Executive	 Chairman	 and	 two	
other	 Non-Executive	 Directors,	 the	 Chief

other	 Executive	 Director .	 The	 Board’s	
main	 roles	 are	 to	 create	 value	 for	 the	
shareholders,	 to	 approve	 the	 Group’s

Remuneration	Committee
The	 Board	 has	a	 Remuneration	
Committee,	 the	 principal	 functions	 of	
which	 are	 to	 determine	 the	 Group’s	 policy	
on	 the	 remuneration	 of	 senior	 executives	
and	 the	 specific	 remuneration	 package	
of	 each	 Director .	 The	 Remuneration	
Committee	 also	 determines	 the	
allocation	 of	 share	 options	 to	 employees.	
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 consists	
of	 Victor	 Wardman	 (chairman),	 Douglas	
Yates	 and	 Guy	 van	 Zwanenberg,	 all	
of	 whom	 are	 Non-Executive	 Directors.		
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 meetings	
are	 also	 attended	 by	 invitation	 by	 the	
Chief	 Executive.
During	 the	 year	 the	 Committee	 met	 twice	
to	 review	 the	 share	 options	 schemes	
and	 the	 remuneration	 for	 the	 fiscal	
year	 2010/11.
Going	concern
The	 Group’s	 business	 activities,	 together	
with	 the	 factors	 likely	 to	 affect	 its	 future	
development,	 performance	 and	 position	
are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Chief	 Executive’s	
Review	 on	 pages	8	 to	 15.	 The	 financial	
position	 of	 the	 Group,	 its	 cash	 flows,	
liquidity	 position	 and	 borrowing	 facilities	
are	 described	 in	 the	 Financial	 Review	 on	
pages	 16	 and	 17.	 In	 addition,	 note	 29	 to	
the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	
includes	 the	 Group’s	 objectives,	 policies	
and	 processes	 for	 managing	 its	 capital;	
its	 financial	 risk	 management	 objectives;	
details	 of	 its	 financial	 instruments	 and	
hedging	 activities	 and	 its	 exposure	 to	
credit	 risk	 and	 liquidity	 risk.
As	 highlighted	 in	 note	1	 to	 the	 financial	
statements,	 the	 Group	 meets	 its	 day-
to-day	 working	 capital	 requirements	
from	a	 bank	 loan	 and	 overdraft	 facility	
together	 with	 revolving	 credit	 and	 asset	
finance	 facilities	 from	 various	 providers.	
The	 majority	 of	 the	 Group’s	 banking	
facilities	 remain	 available	 to	 it	 until	 2012.	
The	 current	 economic	 conditions	 create	
uncertainty	 particularly	 over	 (a)	 the	 level	
of	 demand	 for	 the	 Group’s	 products	 and	
services;	 and	 (b)	 the	 availability	 of	 bank	
and	 asset	 finance	 in	 the	 forseeable	 future.
The	 Directors	 have	 prepared	 trading	 and	
cash	 flow	 forecasts	 for	a	 period	 in	 excess	
of	 one	 year	 from	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	
these	 financial	 statements.	 The	 forecasts	
make	 assumptions	 in	 respect	 of	 future	
trading	 conditions	 and	 in	 particular	 the	
Directors’	 estimates	 of	 growth	 in	 the	
number	 of	 machines	 placed.	 The	 post-	
year	 end	 growth	 and	 the	 forecast	 growth	
in	 the	 number	 of	 machines	 can	 be	 fully	
funded	 from	 currently	 available	 finance	
facilities.	 However ,	 should	 certain	 lines	
be	 withdrawn,	 the	 Group	 has	 the	 ability	
to	 reduce	 the	 level	 of	 growth	 and	 hence	
capital	 required	 should	 funds	 not	 be	
available.	 However ,	 the	 prepared	 forecasts	
suggest	 that	 the	 Group	 retains	 sufficient	
headroom	 within	 facilities	 that	 are	
available	 to	 it	 for	a	 period	 in	 excess	 of	 one	
year	 from	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 these	
financial	 statements.
After	 making	 enquiries,	 and	 considering	
the	 uncertainties	 described	 above,	 the	
Directors	 have	a	 reasonable	 expectation	
that	 the	 Group	 and	 the	 Company	 have	
adequate	 resources	 to	 continue	 in	
operational	 existence	 for	 the	 foreseeable	
future.	 Accordingly,	 they	 continue	 to	
adopt	a	 going	 concern	 basis	 in	 preparing	
the	 annual	 report	 and	 accounts.
Disclosure	of	information	to	auditors
The	 Directors	 who	 held	 office	 at	 the	
date	 of	 approval	 of	 this	 Directors’	
Report	 confirm	 that,	 so	 far	 as	 they	 are	
each	 aware,	 there	 is	 no	 relevant	 audit	
information	 of	 which	 the	 Company’s	
auditors	 are	 unaware;	 and	 each	 Director	
has	 taken	 all	 the	 steps	 that	 he/she	 ought	
to	 have	 taken	 as	a	 Director	 to	 make	
himself/herself	 aware	 of	 any	 relevant	
audit	 information	 and	 to	 establish	 that	
the	 Company’s	 auditors	 are	 aware	 of	
that	 information.
Auditors
Following	 the	 year	 end,	 KPMG	 Audit	 Plc	
resigned	 as	 auditors	 of	 the	 Company	
and	 Grant	 Thornton	 UK	 LLP	 were	
appointed.
In	 accordance	 with	 section	 489	 of	 the	
Companies	 Act	 2006,	a	 resolution	 for	
the	 reappointment	 of	 Grant	 Thornton	
UK	 LLP	 as	 auditors	 of	 the	 Company	 is	 to	
be	 proposed	 at	 the	 forthcoming	 Annual	
General	 Meeting.

Statement	of	Directors’	responsibilities
The	 Directors	 are	 responsible	 for	
preparing	 the	 Directors’	 Report	 and	 the	
Group	 and	 parent	 company	 financial	
statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	
law	 and	 regulations.
Company	 law	 requires	 the	 Directors		
to	 prepare	 Group	 and	 parent	 company	
financial	 statements	 for	 each	 financial	
year.	 As	 required	 by	 the	 AIM	 Rules	 of	 the	
London	 Stock	 Exchange	 they	 are	 required	
to	 prepare	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements	
in	 accordance	 with	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted	
by	 the	 EU	 and	 applicable	 law	 and	 have	
elected	 to	 prepare	 the	 parent	 company	
financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	
with	 UK	 Accounting	 Standards	 and	
applicable	 law	 (UK	 Generally	 Accepted	
Accounting	 Practice).
Under	 company	 law	 the	 Directors	 must	
not	 approve	 the	 financial	 statements	
unless	 they	 are	 satisfied	 that	 they	 give		
a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 state	 of	 affairs	
of	 the	 Group	 and	 parent	 company	 and		
of	 their	 profit	 or	 loss	 for	 the	 Group	 for	
that	 period.
In	 preparing	 each	 of	 the	 Group	 and		
parent	 company	 financial	 statements,		
the	 Directors	 are	 required	 to:
•		 select	 suitable	 accounting	 policies	
and	 then	 apply	 them	 consistently;
•		 make	 judgements	 and	 estimates	 that		
are	 reasonable	 and	 prudent;
•		 for	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements,		
state	 whether	 they	 have	 been	 prepared	
in	 accordance	 with	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted	 by	
the	 EU;
•		 for	 the	 parent	 company	 financial	
statements,	 state	 whether	 applicable		
UK	 Accounting	 Standards	 have	 been	
followed,	 subject	 to	 any	 material	
departures	 disclosed	 and	 explained		
in	 the	 financial	 statements;	 and
•			 prepare	 the	 financial	 statements	 on		
the	 going	 concern	 basis	 unless	 it	 is	
inappropriate	 to	 presume	 that	 the	
Group	 and	 the	 parent	 company	 will	
continue	 in	 business.
The	 Directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 keeping	
adequate	 accounting	 records	 that	 are	
sufficient	 to	 show	 and	 explain	 the	 parent	
company’s	 transactions	 and	 disclose	
with	 reasonable	 accuracy	 at	 any	 time	
the	 financial	 position	 of	 the	 parent	
company	 and	 enable	 them	 to	 ensure	 that	
its	 financial	 statements	 comply	 with	 the	
Companies	 Act	 2006.	 They	 have	 general	
responsibility	 for	 taking	 such	 steps	 as	 are	
reasonably	 open	 to	 them	 to	 safeguard	 the	
assets	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 to	 prevent	 and	
detect	 fraud	 and	 other	 irregularities.
The	 Directors	 are	 responsible	 for	
the	 maintenance	 and	 integrity	 of	 the	
corporate	 and	 financial	 information	
included	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website.	
Legislation	 in	 the	 UK	 governing	 the	
preparation	 and	 dissemination	 of	 financial	
statements	 may	 differ	 from	 legislation	
in	 other	 jurisdictions.

Respective	responsibilities	of	Directors	
and	auditors
As	 explained	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 Statement	
of	 Directors’	 Responsibilities	 set	
out	 on	 page	 25,	 the	 Directors	 are	
responsible	 for	 the	 preparation	 of	 the	
financial	 statements	 and	 for	 being	
satisfied	 that	 they	 give	a	 true	 and	 fair	
view.	 Our	 responsibility	 is	 to	 audit	 the	
financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	
with	 applicable	 law	 and	 International	
Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland).	
Those	 standards	 require	 us	 to	 comply	
with	 the	 Auditing	 Practices	 Board’s	
(APB’s)	 Ethical	 Standards	 for	 Auditors.
Scope	of	the	audit	of	the		
financial	statements
A	 description	 of	 the	 scope	 of	 an	 audit	 of	
financial	 statements	 is	 provided	 on	 the	
APB’s	 website	 at	 www.frc.org.uk/apb/
scope/UKNP .
Opinion	on	financial	statements
In	 our	 opinion:
•	the	 financial	 statements	 give	a	 true	 and		
	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the	 Group’s	 and		
	 of 	 the	 parent	 company’s	 affairs	 as	 at		
	 30 	 April	 2010,	 and	 of	 the	 Group’s	 profit		
	 for 	 the	 year	 then	 ended;	
•	the	 Group	 financial	 statements	 have		
	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance		
	 with	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 the		
	 European	 Union;
•	the	 parent	 company	 financial	
	 	 statements	 have	 been	 properly	
	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 United	
	 Kingdom	 Generally	 Accepted	
	 Accounting	 Practice;	 and
•	the	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	
	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	
	 requirements	 of	 the	 Companies		
	 Act 	 2006.
Opinion	on	other	matter	prescribed		
by	the	Companies	Act	2006
In	 our	 opinion	 the	 information	 given	 in	
the	 Directors’	 Report	 for	 the	 financial	
year	 for	 which	 the	 financial	 statements	
are	 prepared	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	
financial	 statements.
Matters	on	which	we	are	required	
to	report	by	exception
We	 have	 nothing	 to	 report	 in	 respect	
of	 the	 following	 matters	 where	 the	
Companies	 Act	 2006	 requires	 us	 to	
report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion:
•	adequate	 accounting	 records	 have	 not		
	 been	 kept	 by	 the	 parent	 company,	 or		
	 returns	 adequate	 for	 our	 audit	 have	 not		
	 been 	 received	 from	 branches	 not	 visited		
	 by 	 us;	 or
•	the	 parent	 company	 financial	 		
	 statements	 are	 not	 in	 agreement	 with		
	 the	 accounting	 records	 and	 returns;	 or
•	certain	 disclosures	 of	 Directors’	 		
	 remuneration	 specified	 by	 law	 are	 not		
	 made;	 or
•	we 	 have	 not	 received	 all	 the	 information		
	 and	 explanations	 we	 require	 for	 our		
	 audit.

1	 Accounting	 policies
Basis	 of	 preparation
Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 is	a	 company	 registered	 and	 resident	 in	 England	 and	 Wales.
These	 financial	 statements	 were	 authorised	 for	 issue	 by	 the	 Board	 of	 Directors	 on	 29	 September	 2010.
The	 Group	 financial	 statements	 consolidate	 those	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 (together	 referred	 to	 as	 the	 ‘Group’).
The	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements	 present	 information	 about	 the	 Company	 as	a	 separate	 entity	 and	 not	 about	 its	 group.
The	 Group	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 and	 approved	 by	 the	 Directors	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Financial	
Reporting	 Standards	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 EU	 (‘ Adopted	 IFRSs’).	 The	 Company	 has	 elected	 to	 prepare	 its	 parent	 company	 financial	
statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 UK	 GAAP;	 these	 are	 presented	 on	 pages	 59	 to	 64.
The	 accounting	 policies	 set	 out	 below	 have,	 unless	 otherwise	 stated,	 been	 applied	 consistently	 to	 all	 periods	 presented	 in	 these	
Group	 financial	 statements.
Significant	 accounting	 estimates	 and	 judgements	 made	 by	 the	 Directors,	 in	 the	 application	 of	 these	 accounting	 policies	 that	 have	
significant	 effect	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 estimates	 with	a	 significant	 risk	 of	 material	 adjustment	 in	 the	 next	 year	 are	
discussed	 in	 note	 31.
Standards	 and	 interpretations	 effective	 in	 the	 current	 period	
Adoption	 of	 new	 accounting	 standards
The	 Group	 has	 adopted	 the	 following	 new	 interpretations,	 revisions	 and	 amendments	 to	 IFRS	 issued	 by	 the	 International	 Accounting	
Standards	 Board,	 which	 are	 relevant	 to	 and	 effective	 for	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 annual	 period	 beginning	1	 May	 2009:
•	 IAS	1	 Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements	 (Revised	 2007)
•	 IFRS	8	 Operating	 Segments
•	 Amendments	 to	 IFRS	7	 Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosures	–	 improving	 disclosures	 about	 financial	 instruments
Significant	 effects	 on	 current,	 prior	 or	 future	 periods	 arising	 from	 the	 first	 time	 application	 of	 these	 new	 requirements	 in	 respect	
of	 presentation,	 recognition	 and	 measurement	 are	 described	 below.	
Adoption	 of	 IAS	1	 Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements	 (Revised	 2007)
The	 Group	 has	 adopted	 IAS	1	 Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements	 (Revised	 2007)	 in	 its	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.	
This	 standard	 has	 been	 applied	 retrospectively.	 The	 adoption	 of	 the	 standard	 does	 not	 affect	 the	 financial	 position	 or	 profits	
of	 the	 Group,	 but	 gives	 rise	 to	 additional	 disclosures.
IAS	1	 (Revised	 2007)	 affects	 the	 presentation	 of	 owner	 changes	 in	 equity	 and	 introduces	 an	 option	 to	 present	a	 single	 ‘Statement	 of	
comprehensive	 income’	 or	 two	 statements	 the	 ‘statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income’	 and	a	 ‘Statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income’.	
The	 Group	 has	 elected	 to	 present	 the	 ‘Statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income’	 in	 one	 statement:	
The	 measurement	 and	 recognition	 of	 the	 Group's	 assets,	 liabilities,	 income	 and	 expenses	 is	 unchanged.	
Two	 comparative	 periods	 are	 presented	 for	 the	 balance	 sheet	 when	 the	 Group:
(i)	 applies	 an	 accounting	 policy	 retrospectively;	 or
(ii)	 makes	a	 retrospective	 restatement	 of	 items	 in	 its	 financial	 statements.
As	 the	 Group	 has	 recognised	a	 retrospective	 restatement	 of	 items	 within	 its	 financial	 statements,	 as	 explained	 in	 note	5	 to	 the	
financial	 statements,	 the	 Group	 has	 disclosed	 two	 comparative	 balance	 sheets	 and	 comparative	 restated	 notes	 where	 applicable.	
Other	 than	 this	 restatement,	 other	 comparative	 items	 remain	 unchanged	 from	 those	 previously	 reported.
Adoption	 of	 IFRS	8	 Operating	 Segments
The	 adoption	 of	 this	 standard	 has	 not	 affected	 the	 identified	 operating	 segments	 for	 the	 Group.	 However ,	 the	 accounting	 policy	 for	
identifying	 segments	 is	 now	 based	 on	 internal	 management	 reporting	 information	 that	 is	 regularly	 reviewed	 by	 the	 chief	 operating	
decision	 maker	 (The	 Board	 of	 Directors).

1	 Accounting	 policies	 (continued)
Standards	 and	 interpretations	 effective	 in	 the	 current	 period	 (continued)
Adoption	 of	 amendments	 to	 IFRS	7	 Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosures	–	 improving	 disclosures	 about	 financial	 instruments
The	 amendments	 require	 additional	 disclosures	 for	 financial	 instruments	 that	 are	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet.	 These	
fair	 value	 measurements	 are	 categorised	 into	a	 three-level	 fair	 value	 hierarchy,	 which	 reflects	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 they	 are	 based	 on	
observable	 market	 data.	 The	 fair	 value	 hierarchy	 has	 the	 following	 levels:
•	 Level	 1:	 quoted	 prices	 (unadjusted)	 in	 active	 markets	 for	 identical	 assets	 or	 liabilities;
•	 	 Level	 2:	 inputs	 other	 than	 quoted	 prices	 included	 within	 Level	1	 that	 are	 observable	 for	 the	 asset	 or	 liability,	 either	 directly	
(i.e.	 as	 prices)	 or	 indirectly	 (i.e.	 derived	 from	 prices);	 and
•	 Level	 3:	 inputs	 for	 the	 asset	 or	 liability	 that	 are	 not	 based	 on	 observable	 market	 data	 (unobservable	 inputs).
This	 hierarchy	 groups	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 into	 three	 levels	 based	 on	 the	 significance	 of	 inputs	 used	 in	 measuring	 the	 fair	
value	 of	 the	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities.	 The	 level	 within	 which	 the	 financial	 asset	 or	 liability	 is	 classified	 is	 determined	 based	 on	
the	 lowest	 level	 of	 significant	 input	 to	 the	 fair	 value	 measurement.
A	 separate	 quantitative	 maturity	 analysis	 must	 be	 presented	 for	 derivative	 financial	 liabilities	 that	 shows	 the	 remaining	 contractual	
maturities,	 where	 these	 are	 essential	 for	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 timing	 of	 cash	 flows.	 The	 Group	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	
transitional	 provisions	 in	 the	 amendments	 and	 has	 not	 provided	 comparative	 information	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 new	 requirements.
Going	 concern
The	 Group’s	 business	 activities,	 together	 with	 the	 factors	 likely	 to	 affect	 its	 future	 development,	 performance	 and	 position	 are	 set	
out	 in	 the	 Group	 Directors’	 Report	 on	 pages	 22	 to	 26.	 The	 financial	 position	 of	 the	 Group,	 its	 cash	 flows	 and	 liquidity	 position	 are	
described	 in	 the	 Financial	 Review	 on	 pages	 16	 and	 17.	 In	 addition,	 note	 29	 to	 the	 Financial	 Statements	 includes	 the	 Group’s	 objectives,	
policies	 and	 processes	 for	 managing	 its	 capital;	 its	 financial	 risk	 management	 objectives;	 details	 of	 its	 financial	 instruments	 and	
hedging	 activities;	 and	 its	 exposures	 to	 credit	 risk	 and	 liquidity	 risk.	
The	 Group	 meets	 its	 day-to-day	 working	 capital	 requirements	 from	a	 bank	 loan,	 revolving	 revolving	 credit	 and	 overdraft	 facilities,	
together	 with	 asset	 finance	 facilities	 (see	 notes	 20–21).	 The	 majority	 of	 these	 bank	 facilities	 remain	 available	 to	 the	 Group	 until	 2012.	
In	 addition,	 following	 the	 disposal	 of	 the	 Fixed	 Odds	 Betting	 Terminal	 (FOBT)	 assets,	 the	 Group	 held	 cash	 at	 bank	 totalling	 £4.2m	 at	
30	 April	 2010.
The	 asset	 finance	 facilities	 are	 available	 to	 part-finance	 the	 purchase	 of	 machines	 and	 the	 Group	 had	 utilised	 £5.9m	 at	 30	 April	 2010.	
New	 asset	 funding	 sources	 have	 been	 confirmed	 and	 added	 to	 the	 Group	 facility	 since	 the	 year	 end.	 In	 addition,	 the	 Group	 has	a	
£6m	 revolving	 bank	 credit	 facility,	 of	 which	 £5.99m	 was	 utilised	 at	 30	 April	 2010.	 Since	 that	 date,	 £2.2m	 has	 been	 paid	 down	 using	
part	 of	 the	 proceeds	 of	 the	 FOBT	 assets,	 and	 the	 £2.3m	 undrawn	 facilities	 remain	 available	 for	 use	 for	a	 period	 in	 excess	 of	 one	 year	
from	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 these	 financial	 statements.
The	 Directors	 have	 prepared	 trading	 and	 cash	 flow	 forecasts	 for	a	 period	 in	 excess	 of	 one	 year	 from	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 these	
financial	 statements.	 The	 forecasts	 make	 assumptions	 in	 respect	 of	 future	 trading	 conditions	 and	 in	 particular	 the	 Directors’	
estimates	 of	 growth	 in	 the	 number	 of	 machines	 placed.	 These	 forecasts	 have	 been	 sensitised	 to	 take	 into	 account	 current	 trading	
levels	 and	 known	 future	 machine	 number	 growth.	 Taking	 into	 account	a	 number	 of	 reasonably	 forseeable	 sensitivies,	 the	 forecast	
show	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 continue	 to	 meet	 its	 banking	 covenants	 and	 operate	 within	 currently	 available	 funding	 facilities	 for	a	 period	
in	 excess	 of	 one	 year	 from	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 these	 financial	 statements.
After	 making	 enquiries,	 the	 Directors	 have	a	 reasonable	 expectation	 that	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Group	 have	 adequate	 resources	
to	 continue	 in	 operational	 existence	 for	 the	 foreseeable	 future.	 Accordingly,	 they	 continue	 to	 adopt	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 in	
preparing	 the	 Group	 Financial	 Statements.
Measurement	 convention
The	 financial	 statements	 are	 prepared	 on	 the	 historical	 cost	 basis	 except	 that	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 are	 stated	 at	
their	 fair	 value. 34	 Sceptre 	 Leisure	 plc

Basis	 of	 consolidation
Reverse	 acquisition	 accounting
The	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Group	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2010	 comprise	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 (the	 ‘Company’)	 and	 its	
subsidiaries	 (together	 referred	 to	 as	 the	 ‘Group’).
On	 29	 September	 2008	 the	 Company,	 then	 named	 Gamingking	 plc,	 became	 the	 legal	 parent	 company	 of	 Orb	 Holdings	 Limited	
(parent	 company	 of	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions	 Limited)	 in	a	 share	 for	 share	 transaction.	 Due	 to	 the	 relative	 values	 of	 the	 companies,	
the	 former	 Orb	 Holdings	 Limited	 shareholders	 became	 the	 majority	 shareholders	 with	 85%	 of	 the	 enlarged	 share	 capital.	 Following	
the	 transaction	 the	 Company’s	 continuing	 operations	 and	 executive	 management	 were	 predominantly	 those	 of	 Orb	 Holdings	
Limited.	 Accordingly	 the	 substance	 of	 the	 combination	 was	 that	 Orb	 Holdings	 Limited	 acquired	 Gamingking	 plc	 in	a	 reverse	
acquisition.	 As	 part	 of	 the	 business	 combination	 Gamingking	 plc	 changed	 its	 name	 to	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc.	 As	a	 consequence	 of	
applying	 reverse	 acquisition	 accounting,	 the	 comparative	 results	 of	 the	 Group	 at	 30	 April	 2009,	 comprise	 the	 results	 of	 Orb	 Holdings	
Limited	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2009,	 plus	 those	 of	 Gamingking	 plc	 from	 29	 September	 2008.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries	 are	 entities	 controlled	 by	 the	 Group.	 Control	 exists	 when	 the	 Group	 has	 the	 power ,	 directly	 or	 indirectly,	 to	 govern	 the	
financial	 and	 operating	 policies	 of	 an	 entity	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	 benefits	 from	 its	 activities.	 In	 assessing	 control,	 potential	 voting	 rights	
that	 are	 currently	 exercisable	 or	 convertible	 are	 taken	 into	 account.	 The	 financial	 statements	 of	 subsidiaries	 are	 included	 in	 the	
consolidated	 financial	 statements	 from	 the	 date	 that	 control	 commences	 until	 the	 date	 that	 control	 ceases.	 Unrealised	 gains	 on	
transactions	 between	 the	 Group	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 are	 eliminated.	 Unrealised	 losses	 are	 also	 eliminated	 unless	 the	 transaction	
provides	 evidence	 of	 an	 impairment	 of	 the	 asset	 transferred.	 Amounts	 reported	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 subsidiaries	 have	
been	 adjusted	 where	 necessary	 to	 ensure	 consistency	 with	 accounting	 policies	 adopted	 by	 the	 group.
Functional	 currency
The	 presentational	 currency	 adopted	 by	 the	 Group	 is	 Sterling	 (£).	 The	 functional	 currency	 of	 all	 Group	 companies	 is	 Sterling	 (£).
Classification	 of	 financial	 instruments	 issued	 by	 the	 Group
Financial	 instruments	 issued	 by	 the	 Group	 are	 treated	 as	 equity	 only	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 they	 meet	 the	 following	 two	 conditions:
(a)	 	 they	 include	 no	 contractual	 obligations	 upon	 the	 Group	 to	 deliver	 cash	 or	 other	 financial	 assets	 or	 to	 exchange	 financial	 assets	
or	 financial	 liabilities	 with	 another	 party	 under	 conditions	 that	 are	 potentially	 unfavourable	 to	 the	 Group;	 and
(b)	 	 where	 the	 instrument	 will	 or	 may	 be	 settled	 in	 the	 Company’s	 own	 equity	 instruments,	 it	 is	 either	a	 non-derivative	 that	 includes	
no	 obligation	 to	 deliver	a	 variable	 number	 of	 the	 Company’s	 own	 equity	 instruments	 or	 is	a	 derivative	 that	 will	 be	 settled	 by	 the	
Company’s	 exchanging	a	 fixed	 amount	 of	 cash	 or	 other	 financial	 assets	 for	a	 fixed	 number	 of	 its	 own	 equity	 instruments.
Non-derivative	 financial	 instruments
Non-derivative	 financial	 instruments	 comprise	 loans	 and	 receivables,	 financial	 liabilities	 and	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents.
Loans	 and	 receivables
Loans	 and	 receivables	 are	 non-derivative	 financial	 assets	 with	 fixed	 or	 determinable	 payments	 that	 are	 not	 quoted	 on	 an	 active	
market	 and	 are	 recognised	 initially	 at	 fair	 value.	 Subsequent	 to	 initial	 recognition	 they	 are	 measured	 at	 amortised	 cost,	 less	 any	
impairment	 losses.	 An	 assessment	 of	 whether	a	 receivable	 is	 impaired	 is	 made	 at	 each	 reporting	 date.	 For	 receivables,	 this	 is	 based	
on	 the	 latest	 credit	 information	 available,	 i.e.	 recent	 counterparty	 defaults	 and	 external	 credit	 information.	 Financial	 assets	 that	 are	
substantially	 past	 due	 are	 also	 considered	 for	 impairment.
Financial	 liabilities
Financial	 liabilities	 are	 obligations	 to	 pay	 cash	 or	 other	 financial	 assets	 and	 are	 recognised	 when	 the	 Group	 becomes	a	 party	 to	 the	
contractual	 provisions	 of	 the	 instrument.	 Financial	 liabilities	 categorised	 as	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 are	 recorded	 initially	
at	 fair	 value,	 net	 of	 direct	 issue	 costs.
Financial	 liabilities	 categorised	 as	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 are	 re-measured	 at	 each	 reporting	 date	 at	 fair	 value,	 with	
changes	 in	 fair	 value	 being	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income.	 All	 other	 financial	 liabilities	 are	 recorded	 at	
amortised	 cost	 using	 the	 effective	 interest	 method	 with	 interest-related	 charges	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 in	 finance	 costs	 in	 the	
statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income.	 Finance	 charges	 including	 premiums	 payable	 on	 settlement	 or	 redemption	 and	 direct	 issue	
costs	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 on	 an	 accruals	 basis	 using	 the	 effective	 interest	 method	 and	 are	
added	 to	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 the	 instrument	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 they	 are	 not	 settled	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	 arise.
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 comprise	 cash	 balances	 and	 call	 deposits.	 Bank	 overdrafts	 that	 are	 repayable	 on	 demand	 and	 form	 an	
integral	 part	 of	 the	 Group’s	 cash	 management	 are	 included	 as	a	 component	 of	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 for	 the	 purpose	 only	 of	 the	
cash	 flow	 statement. 		 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 35

1	 Accounting	 policies	 (continued)
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 depreciation	 and	 accumulated	 impairment	 losses.
Where	 parts	 of	 an	 item	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 have	 different	 useful	 lives,	 they	 are	 accounted	 for	 as	 separate	 items	
of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment.
Leases	 in	 which	 the	 Group	 assumes	 substantially	 all	 the	 risks	 and	 rewards	 of	 ownership	 of	 the	 leased	 asset	 are	 classified	 as	 finance	
leases.	 Leased	 assets	 acquired	 by	 way	 of	 finance	 lease	 are	 stated	 at	 an	 amount	 equal	 to	 the	 lower	 of	 their	 fair	 value	 and	 the	 present	
value	 of	 the	 minimum	 lease	 payments	 at	 inception	 of	 the	 lease,	 less	 accumulated	 depreciation	 and	 less	 accumulated	 impairment	
losses.	 Lease	 payments	 are	 accounted	 for	 as	 described	 below.
Depreciation	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 on	a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 of	 each	
part	 of	 an	 item	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment.	 The	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 are	 as	 follows:
•	 Short	 leasehold	 property	 3-10	 years
•	 Plant	 and	 machinery	 2–10	 years
•	 Fixtures,	 fittings	 and	 equipment	 3-5	 years
•	 Motor	 vehicles	 3-4	 years
•	 Depreciation	 methods,	 useful	 lives	 and	 residual	 values	 are	 reviewed	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.
Intangible	 assets	 and	 goodwill
Goodwill
All	 business	 combinations	 are	 accounted	 for	 by	 applying	 the	 purchase	 method.	 Goodwill	 represents	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 cost	
of	 the	 acquisition	 and	 the	 net	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 identifiable	 assets,	 liabilities	 and	 contingent	 liabilities	 acquired.	 Identifiable	 intangibles	
are	 those	 which	 can	 be	 sold	 separately	 or	 which	 arise	 from	 legal	 rights	 regardless	 of	 whether	 those	 rights	 are	 separable.
Goodwill	 is	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 any	 accumulated	 impairment	 losses.	 Goodwill	 is	 allocated	 to	 cash-generating	 units	 and	 is	 not	 amortised	
but	 is	 tested	 annually	 for	 impairment.	 In	 respect	 of	 equity	 accounted	 investees,	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 is	 included	 in	 the	
carrying	 amount	 of	 the	 investment	 in	 the	 investee.
Negative	 goodwill	 arising	 on	 an	 acquisition	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 profit	 or	 loss.
Customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships
On	 business	 combinations	 where	 there	 are	 legally	 binding	 machine	 rental	 contracts	 with	 customers	 the	 Group	 initially	 recognises	
those	 contracts	 at	 fair	 value	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 incremental	 contribution	 inherent	 in	 those	 contracts.	 The	 incremental	 contribution	
is	 calculated	 by	 reference	 to	 incremental	 cash	 flows	 and	 is	 based	 on	 the	 fair	 value	 that	a	 market	 participant	 would	 expect	 to	 pay	 for	
an	 intangible	 asset.	 The	 Directors	 have	 reviewed	 each	 contractual	 relationship	 acquired	 and	 their	 assessment	 is	 summarised	 below.
Crown	 Leisure	 Limited
The	 contractual	 customer	 relationships	 acquired	 in	 the	 Crown	 Leisure	 Limited	 acquisition	 are	 being	 amortised	 over	 18	 years	
being	 the	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 life	 of	 the	 asset	 and	 was	 derived	 from	a	 review	 of	 the	 historical	 length	 of	 supply	 for	 all	 major	
customers.	 Non-contractual	 customer	 relationships	 were	 also	 acquired	 at	 the	 time	 of	 the	 Crown	 Leisure	 acquisition,	 and	 their	 useful	
economic	 life	 was	 estimated	 to	 be	 five	 years,	 on	 which	 basis	 they	 were	 included	 in	 the	 overall	 valuation	 of	 customer	 contracts	 and	
relationships	 acquired	 on	 the	 grounds	 of	 materiality.
Gamingking	 plc
The	 customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships	 acquired	 in	 the	 Gamingking	 plc	 reverse	 acquisition	 are	 being	 amortised	 over	 20	 years	
being	 the	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 life	 of	 the	 asset	 after	 assessing	 the	 stability	 of	 the	 Company’s	 customer	 relationships	 due	 to	
acquired	 company’s	 market	 leadership.
Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited
The	 customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships	 acquired	 in	 the	 Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited	 acquisition	 are	 being	 amortised	 over	
five	 years	 being	 the	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 life	 of	 the	 asset.	 This	 was	 derived	 from	a	 review	 of	 the	 historical	 length	 of	 supply	 for	
all	 major	 customers,	 adjusted	 to	 take	 into	 account	 those	 with	 whom	 the	 Group	 already	 had	a	 trading	 relationship.	 Where	a	 trading	
relationship	 with	a	 major	 customer	 of	 Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited	 was	 already	 in	 existence,	 the	 customer	 in	 question	 was	
assessed	 as	 being	 equivalent	 to	a	 non-contractual	 relationship.	 The	 overall	 value	 of	 customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships	 acquired	
created	a	 negative	 goodwill	 amount	 of	 £225,000,	 which	 was	 recognised	 immediately	 as	 profit	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Group’s	
accounting	 policies.	 The	 acquisition	 of	 Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	 is	 disclosed	 in	 note	 15	 to	 the	 financial	 statements. 36	 Sceptre 	 Leisure	 plc

Intangible	 assets	 and	 goodwill	 (continued)
Brands
The	 value	 of	 brands	 acquired	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Gamingking	 plc	 have	 been	 calculated	 as	a	 net	 present	 value	 on	a	
relief	 from	 royalty	 basis.	 These	 brands	 were	 tested	 for	 impairment	 at	 30	 April	 2010,	 and	 an	 impairment	 loss	 of	 £227 ,000	 has	 been	
recognised	 in	 the	 consolidated	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income.
Other	 intangible	 assets
Expenditure	 on	 internally	 generated	 goodwill	 and	 brands	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 as	 an	 expense	 as	
incurred.
Other	 intangible	 assets	 that	 are	 acquired	 by	 the	 Group	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 amortisation	 and	 accumulated	
impairment	 losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 on	a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 of	
intangible	 assets	 unless	 such	 lives	 are	 indefinite.	 Intangible	 assets	 with	 an	 indefinite	 useful	 life	 and	 goodwill	 are	 systematically	 tested	
for	 impairment	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Other	 intangible	 assets	 are	 amortised	 from	 the	 date	 they	 are	 available	 for	 use.	 The	
estimated	 useful	 lives	 are	 as	 follows:
•	 Customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships	 5–20	 years
•	 Brand	 names	 25	 years
Inventories
Inventories	 are	 stated	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 cost	 and	 net	 realisable	 value	 on	a	 first	 in,	 first	 out	 basis.	 For	 finished	 goods,	 cost	 is	 taken	 as	
cost	 incurred	 to	 date,	 which	 includes	 an	 appropriate	 proportion	 of	 directly	 attributable	 overheads.	 Net	 realisable	 value	 is	 determined	
as	 estimated	 selling	 price	 less	 all	 costs	 of	 completion.
Provision	 is	 made	 where	 necessary	 for	 obsolete,	 slow	 moving	 inventory	 where	 it	 is	 deemed	 that	 the	 costs	 incurred	 may	 not	
be	 recoverable.
Impairment	 of	 goodwill,	 other	 intangibles	 and	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment
The	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 the	 Group’s	 assets,	 are	 reviewed	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date	 to	 determine	 whether	 there	 is	 any	 indication	
of	 impairment;	a	 financial	 asset	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 impaired	 if	 objective	 evidence	 indicates	 that	 one	 or	 more	 events	 have	 had	
a	 negative	 effect	 on	 the	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 of	 that	 asset.	 If	 any	 such	 indication	 exists,	 the	 asset’s	 recoverable	 amount	
is	 estimated.
For	 goodwill,	 an	 impairment	 loss	 is	 recognised	 whenever	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 an	 asset	 or	 its	 cash-generating	 unit	 exceeds	 its	
recoverable	 amount.	 Impairment	 losses	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income.
Impairment	 losses	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 cash-generating	 units	 are	 allocated	 first	 to	 reduce	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 any	 goodwill	
allocated	 to	 cash-generating	 units	 and	 then	 to	 reduce	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 the	 other	 assets	 in	 the	 unit	 on	a	 pro	 rata	 basis.	
A	 cash-generating	 unit	 is	 the	 smallest	 identifiable	 group	 of	 assets	 that	 generates	 cash	 inflows	 that	 are	 largely	 independent	 of	 the	
cash	 inflows	 from	 other	 assets	 or	 groups	 of	 assets.
Goodwill	 is	 tested	 annually	 for	 impairment.
Calculation	 of	 recoverable	 amount
The	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 the	 Group’s	 receivables	 carried	 at	 amortised	 cost	 is	 calculated	 as	 the	 present	 value	 of	 estimated	 future	
cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 the	 original	 effective	 interest	 rate	 (i.e.	 the	 effective	 interest	 rate	 computed	 at	 initial	 recognition	 of	 these	
financial	 assets).	 Receivables	 with	a	 short	 duration	 are	 not	 discounted.
The	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 other	 assets	 is	 the	 greater	 of	 their	 fair	 values	 less	 costs	 to	 sell	 and	 value	 in	 use.	 In	 assessing	 value	 in	
use,	 the	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 are	 discounted	 to	 their	 present	 value	 using	a	 pre-tax	 discount	 rate	 that	 reflects	 current	 market	
assessments	 of	 the	 time	 value	 of	 money	 and	 the	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 asset.
For	 an	 asset	 that	 does	 not	 generate	 largely	 independent	 cash	 inflows,	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 is	 determined	 for	 the	 cash-generating	
unit	 to	 which	 the	 asset	 belongs. 		 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	37

Impairment	 of	 goodwill,	 other	 intangibles	 and	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 (continued)
Reversals	 of	 impairment
An	 impairment	 loss	 in	 respect	 of	a	 receivable	 carried	 at	 amortised	 cost	 is	 reversed	 if	 the	 subsequent	 increase	 in	 recoverable	 amount	
can	 be	 related	 objectively	 to	 an	 event	 occurring	 after	 the	 impairment	 loss	 was	 recognised.
An	 impairment	 loss	 in	 respect	 of	 goodwill	 is	 not	 reversed.
In	 respect	 of	 other	 assets,	 an	 impairment	 loss	 is	 reversed	 when	 there	 is	 an	 indication	 that	 the	 impairment	 loss	 may	 no	 longer	 exist	
and	 there	 has	 been	a	 change	 in	 the	 estimates	 used	 to	 determine	 the	 recoverable	 amount.
An	 impairment	 loss	 is	 reversed	 only	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 asset’s	 carrying	 amount	 does	 not	 exceed	 the	 carrying	 amount	 that	 would	
have	 been	 determined,	 net	 of	 depreciation	 or	 amortisation,	 if	 no	 impairment	 loss	 had	 been	 recognised.
Employee	 benefits
Defined	 contribution	 plans
A	 defined	 contribution	 plan	 is	a	 post-employment	 benefit	 plan	 under	 which	 the	 Company	 pays	 fixed	 contributions	 into	a	 separate	
entity	 and	 will	 have	 no	 legal	 or	 constructive	 obligation	 to	 pay	 further	 amounts.	 Obligations	 for	 contributions	 to	 defined	 contribution	
pension	 plans	 are	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 as	 incurred.
Short-term	 benefits
Short-term	 employee	 benefit	 obligations	 are	 measured	 on	 an	 undiscounted	 basis	 and	 are	 expensed	 as	 the	 related	 service	 is	 provided.	
A	 liability	 is	 recognised	 for	 the	 amount	 expected	 to	 be	 paid	 under	 short-term	 cash	 bonus	 or	 profit-sharing	 plans	 if	 the	 Group	 has	a	
present	 legal	 or	 constructive	 obligation	 to	 pay	 this	 amount	 as	a	 result	 of	 past	 service	 provided	 by	 the	 employee	 and	 the	 obligation	
can	 be	 estimated	 reliably.
Share-based	 payment	 transactions
The	 grant	 date	 fair	 value	 of	 options	 granted	 to	 employees	 is	 recognised	 as	 an	 employee	 expense,	 with	a	 corresponding	 increase	 in	
equity,	 over	 the	 period	 in	 which	 the	 employees	 become	 unconditionally	 entitled	 to	 the	 options.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 options	 granted	
is	 measured	 using	 an	 option	 valuation	 model	 (Black-Scholes),	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 upon	 which	 the	 options	
were	 granted.	 The	 amount	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 is	 adjusted	 to	 reflect	 the	 actual	 number	 of	 share	 options	 that	 vest	 except	
where	 forfeiture	 is	 due	 only	 to	 share	 prices	 not	 achieving	 the	 threshold	 for	 vesting.
Provisions
A	 provision	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 when	 the	 Group	 has	a	 present	 legal	 or	 constructive	 obligation	 as	a	 result	 of	a	 past	
event,	 that	 can	 be	 reliably	 measured	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 an	 outflow	 of	 economic	 benefits	 will	 be	 required	 to	 settle	 the	 obligation.	
Provisions	 are	 determined	 by	 discounting	 the	 expected	 future	 cash	 flows	 at	a	 pre-tax	 rate	 that	 reflects	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 liability.
Revenue
Revenue	 is	 measured	 at	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 consideration	 received	 or	 receivable	 and	 represents	 amounts	 for	 goods	 supplied	 and	
services	 provided	 by	 the	 Group	 excluding	 intra-group	 transactions	 and	 Value	 Added	 Tax.
Machine	 sales	 and	 rentals
Machine	 sales	 revenue	 is	 recognised	 when	 goods	 are	 delivered	 to	 customers.	 Machine	 rental	 revenue	 is	 recognised	 on	a	 weekly	
basis	 for	 machines	 placed	 at	 customers’	 premises.
Sale	 of	 lottery,	 indoor	 gaming	 and	 leisure	 products
Revenue	 from	 the	 sale	 of	 goods	 is	 recognised	 at	 the	 point	 of	 delivery	 to	 the	 customer	 and	 when	 customer	 obligations	 have	 been	
fulfilled.
Operation	 of	 lotteries	 on	 behalf	 of	 charities
Revenue	 from	 the	 operation	 of	 lotteries	 on	 behalf	 of	 charities	 is	 recognised	 on	a	 weekly	 basis	 for	 lottery	 ticket	 vending	 terminals	
placed	 at	 customers’	 premises.	 Where	 tickets	 are	 vended	 manually,	 revenue	 is	 recognised	 at	 the	 point	 of	 sale	 to	 the	 customer . 38	 Sceptre 	 Leisure	 plc

Expenses
Operating	 lease	 payments
Payments	 made	 under	 operating	 leases	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 on	a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	
term	 of	 the	 lease.	 Lease	 incentives	 received	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 as	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 the	
total	 lease	 expense.
Finance	 lease	 payments
Minimum	 lease	 payments	 are	 apportioned	 between	 the	 finance	 charge	 and	 the	 reduction	 of	 the	 outstanding	 liability.	 The	 finance	
charge	 is	 allocated	 to	 each	 period	 during	 the	 lease	 term	 so	 as	 to	 produce	a	 constant	 periodic	 rate	 of	 interest	 on	 the	 remaining	
balance	 of	 the	 liability.	 During	 the	 year,	 the	 Group	 revised	 its	 method	 of	 allocating	 interest	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 lease	 term	 in	 order	 to	
give	a	 better	 approximation	 of	a	 constant	 periodic	 rate	 of	 interest	 on	 the	 remaining	 balance	 of	 the	 liability	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 17,	
Leases.	 The	 impact	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 for	 both	 current	 and	 prior	 periods	 is	 set	 out	 in	 note	 5.
Finance	 income	 and	 cost
Finance	 expense	 comprises	 interest	 payable,	 finance	 charges	 on	 finance	 leases,	 and	 decreases	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 derivative		
financial	 instruments.	 Finance	 income	 comprises	 interest	 receivable	 on	 funds	 invested	 and	 increases	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of		
derivative	 financial	 instruments.
Interest	 income	 and	 interest	 payable	 is	 recognised	 in	 profit	 or	 loss	 as	 it	 accrues,	 using	 the	 effective	 interest	 method.	 Dividend	
income	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 on	 the	 date	 the	 entity’s	 right	 to	 receive	 payments	 is	 established.
Foreign	 currency	 translation
Foreign	 currency	 transactions	 are	 translated	 into	 the	 functional	 currency	 of	 the	 respective	 Group	 entity,	 using	 the	 exchange	 rates	
prevailing	 at	 the	 dates	 of	 the	 transactions	 (spot	 exchange	 rate).	 Foreign	 exchange	 gains	 and	 losses	 resulting	 from	 the	 settlement	 of	
such	 transactions	 and	 from	 the	 re-measurement	 of	 monetary	 items	 at	 year-end	 exchange	 rates	 are	 recognised	 in	 profit	 or	 loss.
Non-monetary	 items	 measured	 at	 historical	 cost	 are	 translated	 using	 the	 exchange	 rates	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction	 (not	
retranslated).	 Non-monetary	 items	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 are	 translated	 using	 the	 exchange	 rates	 at	 the	 date	 when	 fair	 value	 was	
determined.
Exceptional	 items
Exceptional	 items	 are	 those	 that	 in	 management’s	 view	 need	 to	 be	 disclosed	 by	 virtue	 of	 their	 size	 or	 incidence.	 Such	 items	 are	
included	 on	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 under	a	 caption	 to	 which	 they	 relate,	 and	 are	 separately	 disclosed	 in	 the	 notes	
to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
Taxation
Tax	 on	 the	 profit	 or	 loss	 for	 the	 year	 comprises	 current	 and	 deferred	 tax.	 Tax	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	
income	 except	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 relates	 to	 items	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity,	 in	 which	 case	 it	 is	 recognised	 in	 equity.
Current	 tax	 is	 the	 expected	 tax	 payable	 on	 the	 taxable	 income	 for	 the	 year,	 using	 tax	 rates	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 at	 the	
balance	 sheet	 date,	 and	 any	 adjustment	 to	 tax	 payable	 in	 respect	 of	 previous	 years.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 provided	 on	 temporary	 differences	 between	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 for	 financial	 reporting	
purposes	 and	 the	 amounts	 used	 for	 taxation	 purposes.	 The	 following	 temporary	 differences	 are	 not	 provided	 for:	 the	 initial	
recognition	 of	 goodwill;	 the	 initial	 recognition	 of	 assets	 or	 liabilities	 that	 affect	 neither	 accounting	 nor	 taxable	 profit	 other	 than	 in	
a	 business	 combination,	 and	 differences	 relating	 to	 investments	 in	 subsidiaries	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 they	 will	 probably	 not	 reverse	 in	
the	 foreseeable	 future.	 The	 amount	 of	 deferred	 tax	 provided	 is	 based	 on	 the	 expected	 manner	 of	 realisation	 or	 settlement	 of	 the	
carrying	 amount	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 using	 tax	 rates	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.
A	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 is	 recognised	 only	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 future	 taxable	 profits	 will	 be	 available	 against	 which	 the	
temporary	 difference	 can	 be	 utilised. 		 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 39

Standards	 and	 interpretations	 in	 issue	 not	 yet	 effective
At	 the	 date	 of	 authorisation	 of	 these	 consolidated	 financial	 statements,	 there	 were	a	 number	 of	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 that	
have	 not	 been	 applied	 in	 these	 consolidated	 financial	 statements,	 which	 were	 in	 issue	 but	 not	 yet	 effective:
IFRS	3	 Business	 Combinations	 (Revised	 2008)	 (effective	 from	1	 July	 2009)
The	 standard	 is	 applicable	 for	 business	 combinations	 occurring	 in	 reporting	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	1	 July	 2009	 and	 will		
be	 applied	 prospectively.	 The	 new	 standard	 introduces	 changes	 to	 the	 accounting	 requirements	 for	 business	 combinations,		
but	 still	 requires	 use	 of	 the	 purchase	 method,	 and	 will	 have	a	 significant	 effect	 on	 business	 combinations	 occurring	 in	 future		
reporting	 periods.
Revised	 IAS	 27	–	 Consolidated	 and	 Separate	 Financial	 Statements	 (effective	 from	1	 July	 2009)	
The	 revised	 standard	 introduces	 changes	 to	 the	 accounting	 requirements	 for	 the	 loss	 of	 control	 of	a	 subsidiary	 and	 for	 changes	 in	
the	 Group's	 interest	 in	 subsidiaries.	 These	 changes	 will	 be	 applied	 prospectively	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 transitional	 provisions	 and	 so	
do	 not	 have	 an	 immediate	 effect	 on	 the	 Group's	 financial	 statements.	
Annual	 Improvements	 2009	 (effective	 from	1	 July	 2009	 and	 later).	
The	 IASB	 has	 issued	 Improvements	 for	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 2009.	 Most	 of	 these	 amendments	 become	
effective	 in	 annual	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	1	 July	 2009	 or	1	 January	 2010.	 Preliminary	 assessments	 indicate	 that	 the	 effect	 on	
the	 Group's	 financial	 statements	 will	 not	 be	 significant.	
Revised	 IAS	 24	 Related	 Party	 Transactions	 (effective	 from	1	 January	 2011)	
The	 revised	 standard	 introduces	 exemptions	 from	 IAS	 24's	 disclosure	 requirements	 for	 transactions	 with	a	 government	 that	 has	
control,	 joint	 control	 or	 significant	 influence	 over	 the	 reporting	 entity	 and	 government-related	 entities.	 The	 revised	 standard	 also	
broadens	 the	 definition	 of	 related	 parties.	 Based	 on	 transactions	 currently	 undertaken	 by	 the	 Group,	 the	 revised	 standard	 is	 not	
expected	 to	 have	a	 significant	 effect	 on	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
IFRS	9	 Financial	 Instruments	 (effective	 from	1	 January	 2013)	
The	 IASB	 aims	 to	 replace	 IAS	 39	 Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement	 in	 its	 entirety	 by	 the	 end	 of	 2010,	 with	 the	
replacement	 standard	 to	 be	 effective	 for	 annual	 periods	 beginning	1	 January	 2013.	 IFRS	9	 is	 the	 first	 part	 of	 Phase	1	 of	 this	 project.	
The	 main	 phases	 are:
Phase	 1:	 Classification	 and	 Measurement
Phase	 2:	 Impairment	 methodology
Phase	 3:	 Hedge	 accounting
In	 addition,	a	 separate	 project	 is	 dealing	 with	 de-recognition.	
Management	 have	 yet	 to	 assess	 the	 impact	 that	 this	 new	 standard	 is	 likely	 to	 have	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Group.	
However ,	 they	 do	 not	 expect	 to	 implement	 the	 standard	 until	 all	 chapters	 of	 the	 IAS	 39	 replacement	 have	 been	 published	 and	 they	
can	 comprehensively	 assess	 the	 impact	 of	 all	 changes.	
The	 Group	 has	 not	 yet	 determined	 all	 the	 potential	 effect	 of	 the	 new	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 not	 yet	 effective.	 40	 Sceptre 	 Leisure	 plc

3	 Segmental	 report
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Group	 adopted	 IFRS	8	 Operating	 Segments,	 which	 replaces	 IAS	 14	 Segment	 Reporting.	 The	 standard	 is	 applied	
restrospectively.	 The	 accounting	 policy	 for	 identifying	 segments	 is	 now	 based	 on	 internal	 management	 reporting	 information	 that	
is	 regularly	 reviewed	 by	 the	 chief	 operating	 decision	 maker	 (The	 Board	 of	 Directors).	 The	 Board	 of	 Directors	 manages	 the	 Group	 in	
three	 business	 segments:
•	 machine	 sales	 and	 rental	 (Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions);	
•	 the	 sale	 of	 lottery,	 indoor	 gaming	 and	 other	 products	 (Lotteryking	 and	 Kelly’s	 Eye);	 and	
•	 the	 operation	 of	 lotteries	 on	 behalf	 of	 charities	 (Creative	 Lotteries).
During	 the	 periods	 under	 review,	 over	 90%	 of	 the	 Group’s	 activities	 related	 to	 machine	 sales	 and	 rental,	 and	 therefore	 the	 remaining	
segments	 have	 been	 consolidated	 due	 to	 materiality	 and	 classified	 as	 ‘all	 other	 segments’.
All	 revenue	 reported	 in	 the	 period	 under	 review	 arose	 within	 the	 United	 Kingdom.
The	 accounting	 policies	 applied	 to	 inter-segment	 transactions	 are	 consistent	 with	 those	 disclosed	 in	 note	1	 to	 the		
financial	 statements.
The	 measurement	 policies	 the	 Group	 uses	 for	 segment	 reporting	 under	 IFRS	8	 are	 the	 same	 as	 those	 used	 in	 the	 financial	
statements	 apart	 from	 the	 recognition	 of	 the	 prior	 year	 adjustment	 as	 explained	 within	 note	5	 to	 the	 financial	 statements.
Segment	 performance	 is	 monitored	 monthly	 as	 part	 of	 the	 management	 reporting	 process.	 The	 financial	 performance	 for	 each	
segment	 is	 analysed	 and	 consolidation	 adjustments	 to	 reach	 the	 Group	 results	 are	 shown	 separately.

5	 Prior	 year	 adjustment
During	 the	 year	 the	 Group	 revised	 its	 method	 of	 allocating	 interest	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 lease	 term	 in	 order	 to	 give	a	 better	
approximation	 of	a	 constant	 periodic	 rate	 of	 interest	 on	 the	 remaining	 balance	 of	 the	 liability	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 17,	 Leases.		
The	 effect	 of	 this	 change	 in	 accounting	 policy	 is	 to	 increase	 the	 2009	 finance	 cost	 by	 £190,000,	 reduce	 profit	 before	 taxation	 for	
2009	 by	 £190,000,	 increase	 interest	 bearing	 loans	 and	 borrowings	 as	 at	 30	 April	 2009	 by	 £248,000	 and	 reduce	 net	 assets	 as	 at		
30	 April	 2009	 by	 £248,000.	 In	 addition,	 an	 adjustment	 of	 £58,000	 has	 also	 been	 made	 to	 reduce	 retained	 earnings	 as	 at	1	 May	
2008,	 to	 correct	 the	 impact	 on	 earlier	 periods.	 The	 prior	 year	 adjustment	 reduces	 previously	 reported	 2009	 EPS	 from	 3.1p	 to	 2.6p,	
and	 diluted	 EPS	 from	 3.0p	 to	 2.5p.

Goodwill	 and	 intangible	 asset	 impairment
Goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets	 acquired	 in	a	 business	 combination	 are	 allocated	 to	 the	 cash-generating	 units	 that	 are	 expected	 to	
benefit	 from	 that	 business	 combination.
Goodwill	 is	 not	 amortised	 but	 is	 tested	 annually	 for	 impairment.	 To	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 the	 cash-generating	 unit	
exceeds	 the	 value	 in	 use,	 determined	 from	 estimated	 discounted	 future	 net	 cash	 flows,	 goodwill	 is	 written	 down	 to	 the	 value	 in	 use	
and	 an	 impairment	 charge	 is	 recognised.
During	 the	 year,	 goodwill	 was	 tested	 for	 impairment	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 36	 ‘Impairment	 of	 assets’.	 The	 recoverable	 amount	 for	
the	 cash-generating	 unit	 exceeded	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 recorded.	 The	 recoverable	 amount	 for	 the	 cash-generating	 unit	
has	 been	 measured	 on	a	 value	 in	 use	 calculation.	 Goodwill	 is	 allocated	 to	 the	 machine	 sales	 and	 rental	 cash-generating	 unit.
The	 key	 assumptions	 for	 the	 value	 in	 use	 calculation	 using	 projected	 cash	 flows	 based	 on	 forecasts	 approved	 by	 management,	
performed	 for	a	 five-year	 period,	 are	 those	 regarding	 the	 discount	 rates,	 growth	 rates,	 and	 expected	 changes	 to	 selling	 price	 and	
direct	 costs	 during	 the	 period.	A	 growth	 rate	 of	 1%	 (2009:	 1%)	 was	 used	 in	 the	 calculation	 over	 the	 five-year	 period.	A	 pre-tax	
discount	 rate	 of	 8.75%	 (2009:	 11%)	 was	 used	 in	 the	 value	 in	 use	 calculation.	 Changes	 in	 selling	 prices	 and	 direct	 costs	 are	 based	 on	
management’s	 expectations	 of	 future	 changes	 in	 the	 market.	 The	 assumptions,	 used	 in	 these	 calculations,	 have	 historically	 proved	
to	 be	 materially	 accurate.
During	 the	 year,	 intangible	 assets	 were	 tested	 for	 impairment.	 The	 review	 suggested	 that	 the	 Lotteryking	 and	 Kelly’s	 Eye	 brand	
names	 acquired	 in	 the	 Gamingking	 reverse	 acquisition	 had	 suffered	 impairment	 on	a	 value	 in	 use	 basis,	 and	 an	 impairment	 charge	
of	 £227 ,000	 was	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income	 within	 exceptional	 administrative	 expenses.	 Amortisation	 of	
intangible	 assets	 is	 included	 within	 normal	 adminitrative	 expenses	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income. 46	 Sceptre 	 Leisure	 plc

(Negative)	 goodwill	 on	 acquisition	–	 recognised	 in	 exceptional	 items	 within	 profit	 or	 loss (225)
Owing	 to	 the	 immediate	 and	 successful	 integration	 of	 the	 Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited	 into	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions,	 it	 is	 not	
possible	 to	 determine	 the	 profit	 attributable	 to	 the	 acquistion	 in	 the	 financial	 year,	 nor	 is	 it	 possible	 to	 calculate	 the	 profit	 that	 would	
have	 been	 generated	 had	 the	 acquisition	 been	 made	 on	1	 May	 2009.
Fair	 value	 adjustment
Under	 IFRS	3	 at	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition	a	 value	 has	 been	 applied	 to	 identifiable	 intangible	 assets	 that	 would	 otherwise	 have	 been	
consumed	 within	 goodwill.	 The	 fair	 value	 adjustment	 to	 intangible	 assets	 relates	 to	 the	 value	 of	 acquired	 customer	 contracts	 and	
related	 relationships	 and	 is	 being	 amortised	 over	 five	 years	 as	 management	 consider	 that	 the	 customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships	
acquired	 in	 the	 Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited	 acquisition	 have	 an	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 life	 of	 that	 length.	 This	 was	
derived	 from	a	 review	 of	 the	 historical	 length	 of	 supply	 for	 all	 major	 customers,	 adjusted	 to	 take	 into	 account	 those	 with	 whom	
the	 Group	 already	 had	a	 trading	 relationship.	 Where	a	 trading	 relationship	 with	a	 major	 customer	 of	 Australian	8	 Ball	 Company	
Limited	 was	 already	 in	 existence,	 the	 customer	 in	 question	 was	 assessed	 as	 being	 equivalent	 to	a	 non-contractual	 relationship.	
The	 overall	 value	 of	 customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships	 acquired	 created	a	 negative	 goodwill	 amount	 of	 £225,000,	 which	 was	
recognised	 immediately	 as	 profit	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Group’s	 accounting	 policies.	 Negative	 goodwill	 is	 included	 in	 exceptional	
administrative	 expenses	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income.	 The	 fair	 value	 adjustment	 to	 deferred	 taxation	 relates	 to	 the	
recognition	 of	 the	 customer	 contracts	 and	 related	 relationships	 asset. 48	 Sceptre 	 Leisure	 plc

The	 Emergency	 Budget	 on	 22	 June	 2010	 announced	 that	 the	 UK	 corporation	 tax	 rate	 will	 reduce	 from	 28%	 to	 24%	 over	a	 period	
of	 four	 years	 from	 2011.	 The	 first	 reduction	 in	 the	 UK	 corporation	 tax	 rate	 from	 28%	 to	 27%	 was	 substantively	 enacted	 on	 20	 July

assets	 at	 that	 date	 by	 £3,000.	 It	 has	 not	 yet	 been	 possible	 to	 quantify	 the	 full	 anticipated	 effect	 of	 the	 announced	 further	 3%	 rate	
reduction,	 although	 this	 will	 further	 reduce	 the	 Group's	 future	 current	 tax	 charge	 and	 reduce	 the	 Group’s	 deferred	 tax	 liabilities/

Interest	 rate	 collars
The	 Group	 uses	 interest	 rate	 collars	 to	 manage	 its	 exposure	 to	 interest	 rate	 movements	 on	 its	 bank	 borrowings.	 Contracts	
covering	 notional	 amounts	 of	 £6.2m	 (2009:	 £8.3m)	 restrict	 interest	 payments	 at	 rates	 between	 4.70%	 and	 5.75%	 for	 periods	
up	 to	 28	 September	 2012.
The	 fair	 value	 of	 collars	 is	 estimated	 at	 £2,000	 (2009:	 £10,000)	 for	 the	 CAP	 and	a	 liability	 of	 £292,000	 (2009:	 £424,000)	 for	
the	 FLOOR.
Fair	 value	 is	 calculated	 by	 discounting	 future	 receipts	 and	 payments	 to	 present	 value	 using	 current	 interest	 rates.	 The	 main	
assumption	 impacting	 on	 the	 future	 profile	 of	 receipts	 and	 payments	 under	 the	 collar	 is	 that	 relating	 to	 future	 movements	 in	 LIBOR. 		 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	51

(a)	 Liquidity	 risk
Financial	 risk	 management
Liquidity	 risk	 is	 the	 risk	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 meet	 its	 financial	 obligations	 as	 they	 fall	 due.	 The	 Group’s	 approach	 to	
managing	 liquidity	 is	 to	 ensure,	 as	 far	 as	 possible,	 that	 it	 has	 sufficient	 liquidity	 to	 meet	 its	 liabilities	 as	 they	 fall	 due	 with	 surplus	
facilities	 to	 cope	 with	 any	 unexpected	 variances	 in	 timing	 of	 cash	 flows.
The	 Group	 believes	 it	 has	 sufficient	 cash	 and	 borrowing	 facilities	 to	 meet	 its	 operational	 commitments.	 At	 the	 year	 end	 the	 Group	
had	 the	 following	 un-drawn	 facilities	 in	 respect	 of	 which	 all	 conditions	 precedent	 had	 been	 met:

(b)	 Foreign	 exchange	 risk
The	 Group	 does	 not	 trade	 in	 overseas	 countries.	 There	 are	 few	 transactions	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 and	 therefore	 the	 Group’s	
exposure	 to	 foreign	 exchange	 risk	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 low.
(c)	 Interest	 rate	 risk
The	 Group	 is	 subject	 to	 fluctuations	 in	 interest	 rates	 on	 its	 borrowings	 and	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents.	 The	 Group	 is	 aware	 of	 the	
financial	 products	 available	 to	 ensure	 against	 adverse	 movements	 in	 interest	 rates.	 Formal	 reviews	 are	 undertaken	 to	 determine	
whether	 such	 instruments	 are	 appropriate	 for	 the	 Group.	 At	 30	 April	 2010,	 the	 Group	 held	 contracts	 covering	 £6.2m	 (2009:	 £8.3m)	
of	 interest	 rate	 collars	 which	 restrict	 the	 Company	 borrowing	 rate	 between	 4.70%	 and	 5.75%.	 (The	 relevant	 floating	 interest	 rate	 is

risk	 exposures	 existing	 at	 that	 date.
This	 analysis	 assumes	 that	 all	 other	 variables	 remain	 constant.	 The	 Group	 has	 calculated	 the	 following	 sensitivities	 based	 on	
available	 data	 from	 forward	 markets	 for	 fixed	 and	 floating	 interest	 rates.	 Management	 believe	 that	 these	 reflect	 the	 most	 probable

(d)	 Credit	 risk
Financial	 risk	 management
Credit	 risk	 is	 the	 risk	 of	 financial	 loss	 to	 the	 Group	 if	a	 customer	 or	 counterparty	 to	a	 financial	 instrument	 fails	 to	 meet	 its	
contractual	 obligations,	 and	 arises	 principally	 from	 the	 Group’s	 receivables	 from	 customers	 and	 investment	 securities.
The	 credit	 risk	 on	 liquid	 funds	 is	 limited	 because	 the	 counterparties	 are	 banks	 with	 high	 credit	 ratings	 assigned	 by	 international	
credit	 rating	 agencies.
The	 Group’s	 credit	 risk	 is	 primarily	 attributable	 to	 its	 trade	 receivables.	 Management	 has	a	 credit	 policy	 in	 place	 and	 exposure		
to	 credit	 risk	 is	 monitored	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis.	 Management	 believe	 the	 Group	 has	a	 wide	 trade	 receivable	 profile	 and	 therefore		
does	 not	 have	 any	 significant	 concentration	 of	 risk.	 The	 credit	 quality	 of	 trade	 receivables	 that	 are	 neither	 past	 due	 not	 impaired		
is	 considered	 to	 be	 good.
Exposure	 to	 credit	 risk
The	 carrying	 amount	 of	 financial	 assets	 represents	 the	 maximum	 credit	 exposure.	 Therefore,	 the	 maximum	 exposure	 to	 credit	 risk	
at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 was	 £6,097 ,000	 (2009:	 £2,848,000)	 being	 the	 total	 of	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 financial	 assets,	 excluding

(e)	 Capital	 management
The	 Group’s	 main	 objective	 when	 managing	 capital	 is	 to	 safeguard	 the	 Group’s	 ability	 to	 continue	 as	a	 going	 concern	 in	 order	
to	 provide	 returns	 to	 shareholders.	 The	 Group	 aims	 to	 maintain	a	 strong	 credit	 rating	 and	 headroom	 whilst	 optimising	 return	 to	
shareholders	 through	 an	 appropriate	 balance	 of	 debt	 and	 equity	 funding.	 The	 Group	 manages	 its	 capital	 structure	 and	 makes	
adjustments	 to	 it	 with	 regard	 to	 the	 risks	 inherent	 in	 the	 business	 and	 in	 light	 of	 changes	 to	 economic	 conditions.
Capital	 is	 managed	 by	 maximising	 retained	 profits	 after	 dividend	 distributions.	 Working	 capital	 is	 managed	 in	 order	 to	 generate	
maximum	 conversion	 of	 these	 profits	 into	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 and	 dividends	 are	 paid	 from	 current	 year	 profits,	 thereby	
maintaining	 capital.
The	 policy	 for	 managing	 debt	 is	 to	 create	a	 smooth	 debt	 maturity	 profile	 with	 the	 objective	 of	 ensuring	 continuity	 of	 funding	 to	 meet	
the	 Group’s	 future	 liquidity	 requirements.
Capital	 includes	 share	 capital,	 share	 premium,	 reverse	 acquisition	 reserve,	 net	 debt	 and	 retained	 earnings	 reserve.	 Net	 debt	 includes	
short-	 and	 long-term	 borrowings	 (including	 overdrafts	 and	 lease	 obligations)	 net	 of	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents.
(f)	 Fair	 values	 of	 financial	 instruments
The	 fair	 values	 of	 the	 financial	 instruments	 held	 by	 the	 Group	 have	 been	 calculated	 as	 follows:
Trade	 and	 other	 receivables
The	 fair	 value	 of	 trade	 and	 other	 receivables	 is	 estimated	 as	 the	 present	 value	 of	 future	 cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 the	 market	 rate	 of	
interest	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 if	 the	 effect	 is	 material.
Trade	 and	 other	 payables
The	 fair	 value	 of	 trade	 and	 other	 payables	 is	 estimated	 as	 the	 present	 value	 of	 future	 cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 the	 market	 rate	 of	
interest	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 if	 the	 effect	 is	 material.
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents
The	 fair	 value	 of	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 is	 estimated	 as	 its	 carrying	 amount	 where	 the	 cash	 is	 repayable	 on	 demand.	 Where	 it	 is	
not	 repayable	 on	 demand	 then	 the	 fair	 value	 is	 estimated	 at	 the	 present	 value	 of	 future	 cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 the	 market	 rate	 of	
interest	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.
Interest-bearing	 borrowings
Fair	 value,	 which	 after	 initial	 recognition	 is	 determined	 for	 disclosure	 purposes	 only,	 is	 calculated	 based	 on	 the	 present	 value	 of	
future	 principal	 and	 interest	 cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 the	 market	 rate	 of	 interest	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 In	 respect	 of	 the	 liability	
component	 of	 convertible	 notes,	 the	 market	 rate	 of	 interest	 is	 determined	 by	 reference	 to	 similar	 liabilities	 that	 do	 not	 have	a	
conversion	 option.	 For	 finance	 leases	 the	 market	 rate	 of	 interest	 is	 determined	 by	 reference	 to	 similar	 lease	 agreements.
Derivative	 financial	 instruments
The	 fair	 value	 of	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 is	 based	 on	 broker	 quotes.	 Those	 quotes	 are	 tested	 for	 reasonableness	 by	 discounting	 estimated	
future	 cash	 flows	 based	 on	 the	 terms	 and	 maturity	 of	 each	 contract	 and	 using	 market	 interest	 rates	 for	a	 similar	 instrument	 at	 the	
measurement	 date.
The	 interest	 rates	 used	 to	 discount	 estimated	 cash	 flows	 were	 as	 follows:

Financial	 instruments	 measured	 at	 fair	 value
The	 Group	 has	 adopted	 the	 amendments	 to	 IFRS	7	 Improving	 Disclosures	 about	 Financial	 Instruments	 effective	 from	1	 April	 2009.	
These	 amendments	 require	 the	 Group	 to	 present	 certain	 information	 about	 financial	 instruments	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 in	 the	
balance	 sheet.	 In	 the	 first	 year	 of	 application	 comparative	 information	 need	 not	 be	 presented	 for	 the	 disclosures	 required	 by	 the	
amendment.	 Accordingly,	 the	 disclosure	 for	 the	 fair	 value	 hierarchy	 is	 only	 presented	 for	 the	 30	 April	 2010	 year	 end.	
The	 following	 table	 presents	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 fair	
value	 hierarchy.	 This	 hierarchy	 groups	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 into	 three	 levels	 based	 on	 the	 significance	 of	 inputs	 used	 in	
measuring	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities.	 The	 fair	 value	 hierarchy	 has	 the	 following	 levels:	
•	 Level	 1:	 quoted	 prices	 (unadjusted)	 in	 active	 markets	 for	 identical	 assets	 or	 liabilities;	
•	 	 Level	 2:	 inputs	 other	 than	 quoted	 prices	 included	 within	 Level	1	 that	 are	 observable	 for	 the	 asset	 or	 liability,	 either	 directly		
(i.e.	 as	 prices)	 or	 indirectly	 (i.e.	 derived	 from	 prices);	 and
•	 Level	 3:	 inputs	 for	 the	 asset	 or	 liability	 that	 are	 not	 based	 on	 observable	 market	 data	 (unobservable	 inputs).
The	 level	 within	 which	 the	 financial	 asset	 or	 liability	 is	 classified	 is	 determined	 based	 on	 the	 lowest	 level	 of	 significant	 input	 to	 the	
fair	 value	 measurement.	 The	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 are	 grouped	 into	 the	 fair	
value	 hierarchy	 as	 follows:

Operating	 lease	 payments	 represent	 rentals	 payable	 by	 the	 Group	 for	 certain	 of	 its	 properties	 and	 equipment.	 Leases	 have	 varying	
terms	 and	 renewal	 rights.	 The	 above	 leasing	 arrangements	 do	 not	 contain	 any	 restrictive	 covenants,	 contingent	 rents	 or		
purchase	 options.
31	 Accounting	 estimates	 and	 judgements
Some	 asset	 and	 liability	 amounts	 reported	 in	 the	 historical	 financial	 information	 are	 based	 on	 management	 estimates	 and	 assumptions.	
There	 is	 therefore	a	 risk	 of	 significant	 changes	 to	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 for	 these	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 within	 the	 next	 financial	 year.	
The	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 are	 made	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 information	 and	 conditions	 that	 exist	 at	 the	 time	 of	 the	 valuation.
Classification	 of	 leases
The	 Group	 utilises	 assets	 subject	 to	 operating	 and	 finance	 leases.	 The	 classification	 of	 these	 leases	 is	 based	 on	a	 number	 of	 factors	
such	 as	 risk	 and	 reward,	 length	 of	 use	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 minimum	 lease	 payments.	 Lease	 classification	 is	 made	 at	 the	 inception	
of	 the	 lease.
Impairment	 provisions
No	 impairment	 provisions	 have	 been	 made	 against	 goodwill	 as	 management	 have	 calculated	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 in	 each	 case	
to	 be	 in	 excess	 of	 the	 carrying	 values.	 The	 carrying	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 in	 the	 Group	 accounts	 is	 £61,000,	 and	 this	 amount	 was	
tested	 for	 impairment	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 using	a	 discount	 rate	 of	 8.75%	 as	 set	 out	 in	 note	 13.	 Using	 this	 discount	 rate,	 the	 net	
present	 value	 of	 the	 future	 cash	 flows	 associated	 with	 the	 goodwill	 relationships	 was	 significantly	 in	 excess	 of	 the	 carrying	 amount.	
The	 impairment	 tests	 require	a	 number	 of	 assumptions	 and	 judgements	 to	 be	 made.	 An	 explanation	 of	 these	 judgements	 and	
estimations	 are	 detailed	 in	 the	 impairment	 test	 accounting	 policies.
Customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships
The	 Group	 recognises	 customer	 contracts	 and	 relationships	 as	 intangible	 assets	 on	 business	 combinations,	 with	a	 net	 book	 value	 at	
the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 of	 £5.4m	 (2009:	 £4.4m).	 These	 assets	 are	 subsequently	 amortised	 over	 the	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 life	
to	 the	 Group,	 which	 is	 estimated	 to	 be	 between	 5–20	 years.	 The	 initial	 valuation	 of	 these	 assets	 is	 based	 on	 an	 incremental	 income	
method	 valuation	 which	 requires	 the	 use	 of	 assumptions	 relating	 to	 future	 revenue,	 profitability	 and	 relationship	 life	 with	 each	
customer .	 Changes	 in	 the	 assumptions	 for	 useful	 economic	 life	 or	 incremental	 profits	 will	 have	 an	 impact	 on	 the	 annual	 amortisation	
charge	 recognised	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.	 The	 loss	 of	a	 major	 customer	 may	 result	 in	 the	 recognition	 of	 an	 impairment	 loss.	
The	 Directors	 revisit	 these	 assumptions	 on	a	 regular	 basis.
Inventory	 impairment	 provisions
The	 Group	 makes	 provision	 for	 inventories	 deemed	 to	 be	 obsolete.	 This	 provision	 is	 established	 on	a	 specific	 item	 by	 item	 basis	
based	 on	 management’s	 prior	 experience	 and	 their	 assessment	 of	 the	 present	 value	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows.	 At	 the	 balance	
sheet	 date	a	 provision	 of	 £nil	 (2009:	 £5,000)	 has	 been	 made.	 During	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year,	 provisions	 totalling	 £5,000	 (2009:	
£9,000)	 were	 reversed,	 and	a	 corresponding	 credit	 to	 cost	 of	 sales	 was	 recognised.	 Any	 future	 increase	 to	 the	 provision	 would	 lead	
to	a	 corresponding	 reduction	 in	 reported	 profits	 and	 total	 assets.
Receivables	 impairment	 provisions
The	 amounts	 presented	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 are	 net	 of	 allowances	 for	 doubtful	 receivables,	 estimated	 by	 the	 Group’s	 management	
based	 on	 prior	 experience	 and	 their	 assessment	 of	 the	 present	 value	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows.	 At	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	a	
provision	 of	 £29,000	 (2009:	 £9,000)	 has	 been	 made.	 This	 amount	 is	 based	 on	 specific	 over	 due	 account	 criteria,	 and	 management’s	
judgement	 as	 to	 future	 recoverability.	 Any	 future	 increase	 to	 the	 provision	 would	 lead	 to	a	 corresponding	 reduction	 in	 reported	
profits	 and	 total	 assets. 60	 Sceptre 	 Leisure	 plc

Notes
(forming	 part	 of	 the	 Company	 financial	 statements)
1	 Accounting	 policies
The	 following	 accounting	 policies	 have	 been	 applied	 consistently	 in	 dealing	 with	 items	 which	 are	 considered	 material	 in	 relation	 to	
the	 financial	 statements,	 except	 as	 noted	 below.	 The	 Directors	 have	 reviewed	 the	 principal	 accounting	 policies	 and	 consider	 they	
remain	 the	 most	 appropriate	 for	 the	 Company.	 The	 principal	 accounting	 policies	 of	 the	 Company	 have	 remained	 unchanged	 from	
previous	 years.
Basis	 of	 preparation
The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 UK	 GAAP	 accounting	 standards	 and	 under	 the	 historical	 cost	
accounting	 rules.
Under	 section	 408	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 the	 Company	 is	 exempt	 from	 the	 requirement	 to	 present	 its	 own	 profit	 and	
loss	 account.
Investments
Investments	 in	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 amounts	 written	 off.
Taxation
The	 charge	 for	 taxation	 is	 based	 on	 the	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 and	 takes	 into	 account	 taxation	 deferred	 because	 of	 timing	 differences	
between	 the	 treatment	 of	 certain	 items	 for	 taxation	 and	 accounting	 purposes.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 recognised,	 without	 discounting,	 in	 respect	 of	 all	 timing	 differences	 between	 the	 treatment	 of	 certain	 items	 for	
taxation	 and	 accounting	 purposes	 which	 have	 arisen	 but	 not	 reversed	 by	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 except	 as	 otherwise	 required	
by	 FRS	 19.
Bank	 borrowings
Interest	 bearing	 bank	 loans	 and	 overdrafts	 are	 initially	 recorded	 at	 fair	 value.	 Finance	 charges,	 including	 premiums	 payable	 on	
settlement	 or	 redemption	 and	 direct	 issue	 costs,	 are	 accounted	 for	 on	 an	 accruals	 basis	 to	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 using	 the	
effective	 interest	 method	 and	 are	 added	 to	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 the	 instrument	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 they	 are	 not	 settled	 in	 the	 period	
in	 which	 they	 arise.
Share-based	 payments
For	 all	 employee	 share	 options	 granted	 after	7	 November	 2002	 and	 vesting	 on	 or	 after	1	 May	 2005,	 an	 expense	 is	 recognised	 in	
the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 with	a	 corresponding	 credit	 to	 equity.	 The	 equity	 share-based	 payment	 is	 measured	 at	 the	 grant	 date	
using	a	 Black-Scholes	 model,	 the	 details	 of	 which	 are	 set	 out	 in	 note	 25	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
Where	 the	 Company	 grants	 options	 over	 its	 own	 shares	 to	 the	 employees	 of	 its	 subsidiaries	 it	 recognises,	 in	 its	 individual	 financial	
statements,	 an	 increase	 in	 the	 cost	 of	 investment	 in	 its	 subsidiaries	 equivalent	 to	 the	 equity-settled	 share-based	 payment	 charge	
recognised	 in	 its	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 with	 the	 corresponding	 credit	 being	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity.
Pensions
The	 Company	 makes	 contributions	 to	 certain	 Directors’	 pension	 plans	 and	 the	 pension	 costs	 charged	 against	 profits	 represent	
the	 amount	 of	 the	 contributions	 payable	 to	 the	 schemes	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 accounting	 period.
2	 Profit	 attributable	 to	 members	 of	 the	 parent	 company
As	 permitted	 by	 section	 408	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006,	 the	 parent	 company	 has	 not	 presented	 its	 own	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.
The	 Company’s	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 amounts	 to	 £30,000	 (2009:	 loss	 of	 £14,000). 		 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	 63

Notes:
(a)	 	 Any	 member	 of	 the	 Company	 entitled	 to	 attend	 and	 vote	 at	 the	 meeting	 may	 appoint	 one	 or	 more	 proxies	 to	 attend	 and,	 on	a	
poll,	 to	 vote	 on	 his/her	 behalf.	A	 proxy	 need	 not	 be	a	 member .	 Forms	 of	 proxy	 should	 be	 lodged	 with	 the	 Company’s	 Registrar ,	
Proxy	 Department,	 Capita	 Registrars	 Limited,	 PXS,	 34	 Beckenham	 Road,	 Beckenham,	 Kent	 BR3	 4TU	 not	 later	 than	 48	 hours	
before	 the	 time	 for	 which	 the	 meeting	 is	 convened	 to	 be	 effective.	 Completion	 of	 the	 appropriate	 form	 of	 proxy	 does	 not	 prevent	
a	 member	 from	 attending	 and	 voting	 in	 person	 if	 he/she	 is	 entitled	 to	 do	 so	 and	 so	 wishes.
(b)	 	 Members	 are	 informed	 that	a	 register	 of	 all	 interests	 of	 each	 Director	 and	 his	 family	 in	 each	 class	 of	 share	 capital	 of	 the	
Company	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 and	 copies	 of	 all	 contracts	 of	 service	 of	 more	 than	 one	 year’s	 duration	 of	 any	 Director	 with	 the	
Company	 or	 any	 of	 its	 subsidiaries	 are	 available	 for	 inspection	 at	 the	 Registered	 Office	 of	 the	 Company	 during	 normal	 business	
hours	 on	 any	 weekday	 (Saturdays	 and	 public	 holidays	 excepted)	 from	 the	 date	 of	 this	 Notice	 until	 the	 close	 of	 the	 meeting	 and,	
on	 the	 day	 of	 the	 meeting,	 at	 the	 place	 of	 the	 meeting	 from	 at	 least	 15	 minutes	 prior	 to	 the	 meeting	 until	 its	 conclusion.
(c)	 	 In	 accordance	 with	 Regulation	 41	 of	 the	 Uncertificated	 Securities	 Regulations	 2001,	 the	 Company	 gives	 notice	 that	 only	 those	
shareholders	 entered	 on	 the	 relevant	 register	 of	 members	 (the	 ‘Register’)	 for	 certificated	 or	 uncertificated	 shares	 of	 the	
Company	 (as	 the	 case	 may	 be)	 at	 6pm	 on	 19	 October	 2010	 (the	 ‘Specified	 Time’)	 will	 be	 entitled	 to	 attend	 or	 vote	 at	 the	 meeting	
in	 respect	 of	 the	 number	 of	 shares	 registered	 in	 their	 name	 at	 the	 time.	 Changes	 to	 entries	 on	 the	 Register	 after	 the	 Specified	
Time	 will	 be	 disregarded	 in	 determining	 the	 rights	 of	 any	 person	 to	 attend	 or	 vote	 at	 that	 meeting.	 Should	 the	 meeting	 be	
adjourned	 to	a	 time	 not	 more	 than	 48	 hours	 after	 the	 Specified	 Time,	 that	 time	 will	 also	 apply	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 determining	
the	 entitlement	 of	 members	 to	 attend	 and	 vote	 (and	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 determining	 the	 number	 of	 votes	 they	 may	 cast)	 at	 the	
adjourned	 meeting.	 Should	 the	 meeting	 be	 adjourned	 for	a	 longer	 period,	 then	 to	 be	 so	 entitled,	 members	 must	 be	 entered	
on	 the	 Register	 at	 the	 time	 which	 is	 48	 hours	 before	 the	 time	 fixed	 for	 the	 adjourned	 meeting	 or,	 if	 the	 Company	 gives	 notice	
of	 the	 adjourned	 meeting,	 at	 the	 time	 specified	 in	 the	 Notice.
(d)	 	 To	 appoint	a	 proxy	 or	 to	 give	 or	 amend	 an	 instruction	 to	a	 previously	 appointed	 proxy	 via	 the	 CREST	 system,	 the	 CREST	 message	
must	 be	 received	 by	 the	 issuer’s	 agent	 RA10	 by	 11am	 on	 19	 October	 2010.	 For	 this	 purpose,	 the	 time	 of	 receipt	 will	 be	 taken	 to	
be	 the	 time	 (as	 determined	 by	 the	 timestamp	 applied	 to	 the	 message	 by	 the	 CREST	 applications	 Host)	 from	 which	 the	 issuer’s	
agent	 is	 able	 to	 retrieve	 the	 message.	 After	 this	 time	 any	 change	 of	 instructions	 to	a	 proxy	 appointed	 through	 CREST	 should	 be	
communicated	 to	 the	 proxy	 by	 other	 means.	 CREST	 personal	 members	 or	 other	 CREST	 sponsored	 members,	 and	 those	 CREST	
members	 who	 have	 appointed	 voting	 service	 providers(s)	 should	 contact	 their	 CREST	 sponsor	 or	 voting	 service	 provider(s)	 for	
assistance	 with	 appointing	 proxies	 via	 CREST.	 For	 further	 information	 on	 CREST	 procedures,	 limitations	 and	 system	 timings	 please	
refer	 to	 the	 CREST	 manual.	 We	 may	 treat	 as	 invalid	a	 proxy	 appointment	 sent	 by	 CREST	 in	 the	 circumstances	 set	 out	 in	 Regulation	
35(5)(a)	 of	 the	 Uncertificated	 Securities	 Regulations	 2001.	 In	 any	 case	 your	 proxy	 form	 must	 be	 received	 by	 the	 Company’s	
registrars	 no	 later	 than	 11am	 on	 19	 October	 2010.

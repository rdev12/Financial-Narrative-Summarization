UK Housing
In the UK, George Wimpey is committed to building upon our long
track record of successful development by continuing to create new
and sustainable communities through our 28 regional businesses
and two satellite offices.
We market our homes through three brands. ‘George Wimpey’ is our
core brand and ‘Laing Homes’ our premium brand. They provide a
range of products from one bedroom apartments and starter homes
to large detached family homes. In 2006 we launched ‘G2’ our value
brand, specifically targeted at first time buyers and key workers. G2
provides affordable, quality one and two bedroom apartments at
highly competitive prices.
The UK housing market was broadly stable throughout 2006,
recovering well from the slow market conditions experienced in
2005. Strong demand, weak supply and a healthy economic situation
continue to underpin the market and provide George Wimpey UK
with considerable scope for future growth.

US Housing
Morrison Homes, our US business, continues to build on its strong
reputation for excellence by delivering high quality homes with
industry leading levels of customer service. Spanning five states, the
business operates within 13 markets, all of which have strong long
term demographic prospects. We traditionally build a wide range of
single family homes and in response to changing demand within the
market, we have introduced more compact townhomes to our
product range.
Over the last few years Morrison Homes has benefited from the strong
market conditions in the US. 2006 proved to be more challenging as
the housing market slowed considerably. The competitive market
conditions look set to continue in the short term until the current
oversupply in the housing market returns to normal levels.
Despite its short term weakening, we feel confident about the long
term outlook for the US housing market with strong demographic
trends likely to drive demand for housing. As the market stabilises
Morrison Homes is well placed to strengthen its regional positions
to deliver long term growth.

WP100_IFC-p05_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:19  Page 5 2006 Performance
I am delighted with the progress George Wimpey made during 2006. As a result of the strong advances
made by our UK business, total Group completions for the year reached 17,963, the highest level the
Group has achieved for 25 years. In addition our total Group short term landbank has risen to 76,736 plots
(2005: 74,499 plots) as the UK landbank increased by 14%; the strongest year end position we have had
during that period, not just in scale but also in its underlying value.
We started 2006 with a strong forward order book position and throughout the year we have continued
to build on this by focusing on the actions that will secure the long term success of our business. I have
been greatly encouraged by the progress made by our UK businesses this year. The action plans put in
place at the end of 2005 have delivered improvements as planned. The structured focus on costs and
improved land buying are already benefiting the financial performance of the business with margins
showing strong growth in the second half.
In the US, as market conditions weakened we temporarily stood back from our strategy of growth.
The action taken to build our forward order position at the end of 2005 was key in ensuring our
businesses delivered a strong performance in the first half. Morrison Homes has taken action to ensure
it is well positioned to deal with the current market whilst retaining its ability to return to growth as
conditions stabilise. We still believe in the long term fundamentals of the US housing market and are
confident that our businesses are positioned in markets with strong long term demographic trends.
Group results have benefited from the steady improvements made in the UK business, total revenues
for the Group have risen by 5% to £3,147.4 million (2005: £3,003.2 million). As market conditions
weakened in the US, we reviewed our land values and have recorded a one-off exceptional charge of
£60.7 million pre-tax or £38.0 million post-tax on the write-down of our US land inventory and options.
Pre-exceptional Group profit before tax rose by 1% to £370.9 million, with post-exceptional profit before
tax of £310.2 million (2005: £366.5 million).
Creating value for our shareholders
The Board of George Wimpey Plc is committed to ensuring we create long term value for our
shareholders. We have a clear strategy in place to ensure that our businesses are strong and well
positioned for the long term. Our confidence in the ongoing earnings growth of the Group has been
reflected in the strong increase in dividends since 2003. During this period the percentage of profits
returned to shareholders has almost doubled, rising from 18% in 2002 to 35% in 2006. Going forward
the Board is committed to a progressive dividend policy and intends to grow dividends in line with
earnings over the medium term whilst maintaining prudent levels of profit and cash cover.

our Annual General Meeting would bring the total dividend to 19.4 pence per share. This follows a 10.5%
increase in our interim dividend and represents a rise of 10% on 2005.
Corporate Governance
I have welcomed the many changes that have been made in recent years to raise the profile of
governance on the corporate agenda. As a Board we remain committed to ensuring that we achieve
the highest standards of corporate governance and take our duty to behave as a responsible company
very seriously. During the year we were pleased to adopt and implement early the 2006 Combined Code
on Corporate Governance. A full report on our corporate governance activities is set out on pages 41 to 43.
The Board
In February last year we announced that Peter Johnson would stand down as Chief Executive of George
Wimpey at the end of June and that he would be succeeded by Peter Redfern, formerly Chief Executive
of our UK business. I am pleased to report that the transition has been seamless and the Board has been
delighted by the strategy Peter has implemented to ensure the long term success of our business.
In November we welcomed Ian Sutcliffe to the Board. Ian joined George Wimpey UK in February as
Managing Director and has proved to be an able successor to Peter Redfern. Ian joined us from Shell and
the wealth of experience that he brought with him in cost management, marketing and procurement is
already bearing fruit within our business.
Thanks
Our business succeeds because of the dedication of our employees. It is their determination and hard
work that creates value for you, our shareholders. Once again, on behalf of the Board, I am proud to be
able to offer my sincerest thanks to our employees in both the UK and US, for all they have done this year
to contribute to the on going success of George Wimpey Plc.
Outlook
In the UK the housing market has remained healthy during early 2007. We are confident that the business
plans established across our UK business will continue to deliver benefits throughout the year. With a
strong land position, an established cost reduction programme and a strong order book position we are
confident that based on current market conditions, operating margins in the UK will exceed 14% in 2007.
In the US there have been signs that market conditions have stabilised in the first few weeks of 2007
with cancellation rates reducing dramatically and sales rates increasing. Given our low order book we
expect volumes and margins in 2007 to be significantly below 2006. However if current trends continue,
the market will improve during the year leading to a strong 2008. Our deliberately cautious approach to
land acquisition and valuation, the firm actions we have taken to address costs and overheads along with
our position in markets with strong long term demographic trends give us confidence that Morrison
Homes is well placed to return to growth as conditions improve.

Group Overview
Long term
growth
We started 2006 in a strong position
and throughout the year we have
continued to build on this.
Our business plans have focused
on the actions that will enable us to
deliver consistent long term growth.
WP100_p06-p11_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:18  Page 7 I am very proud to have been appointed Chief Executive of George Wimpey. This is a huge opportunity
for me and it gives me great pleasure to use my first Chief Executive’s Statement to set out how I intend
to take this business forward.
Being appointed from within the business has been a considerable advantage. I was part of the UK
management team responsible for merging Wimpey Homes and McLean Homes and for acquiring and
integrating McAlpine Homes and Laing Homes. I was a member of the Executive Committee that set the
growth plans for Morrison Homes. I understand the strengths and weaknesses of our businesses as well
as their history.
During the four months after it was announced that Peter Johnson would be standing down, I was able
to step back from the business and think very openly about what was right for the Company’s future.
Our goal is to ensure George Wimpey becomes the leading national housebuilder in the UK and in the
regional markets we choose in the US. Our strategy must, therefore, focus on the key areas of business
performance that will achieve the growth to deliver maximum value for our shareholders, for our
customers and for our other stakeholders – not just in the short term but consistently for many years to
come, regardless of market conditions.
There are already many things that we do extremely well. In both the UK and the US, the quality of
the homes we build is very high and we strive to deliver excellent levels of service for all our customers.
In the UK we were the only volume housebuilder to be awarded 4 stars in the two key categories of the
HBF Customer Satisfaction Survey. We also take our duty to behave as a responsible company very
seriously, seeking to meet the challenges of sustainable development and limit the impact of our
developments on the environment. George Wimpey was amongst the Global Top 100 Companies listed
by Innovest Strategic Value Advisors and Corporate Knights as a role model for the effectiveness of our
environmental, social and governance risk management.
However, there are areas of our business that we have to take forward to achieve our goal. We need to
deliver consistent and industry leading results so investors have confidence in George Wimpey as a long
term secure investment.
We need to create sustainable competitive advantage through the effectiveness and efficiency of:
• Our landbank
• Our cost base
• Our sales expertise
• Our people
Our businesses need to look further forward, to make decisions based not on what the outcome will
be tomorrow but what the impact will be for the long term.

WP100_p06-p11_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:18  Page 8 In financial terms we will deliver steady and consistent growth across our businesses. We will continue
to grow our total Group volumes, building on the record performance this year to retain our position as
one of the three largest UK listed housebuilders. Our businesses will strive to achieve the highest level of
operating profit in our sector as well as above average margins and return on capital. We will generate
cash and reuse our capital efficiently to deliver the steady and consistent growth of our business.
How will we measure our success? Throughout this report we have highlighted those measures, both
financial and non-financial, that we consider to be the Key Performance Indicators for the success of
our strategy.
To achieve our goal of delivering sustainable competitive advantage and superior returns for our
shareholders we have to run a highly efficient and effective business. We cannot afford to give away any
advantage in the way we buy land, manage costs or sell our products and we need to employ the best
people in our industry.
Our landbank
Land is our raw material and the aspect of our business that I feel most passionate about. Since 2001
we have been steadily increasing the number of plots in our short term landbank, particularly in the US
where we have achieved significant growth over the past five years. In the UK we have made a step
change in our land strategy, increasing our focus on buying land where we can add value, to reduce
the real cost of land going forward.
In the UK we are establishing a balanced landbank which will give each business a portfolio of land at
different stages in the planning system to allow them greater security and allow them to plan business
activity in advance. Ideally our landbank will comprise around 40% short term land and 30% of both
medium and long term land.
Since the end of 2003 we have increased focus on buying more medium term land, generally larger
pieces of land that will be developed within three to five years, where we can add value by taking the site
through the planning system ourselves. We are already seeing some of the benefits of these types of
acquisitions coming through as the plot cost in the landbank starts to reduce. At the end of 2006 the
average plot cost in the landbank was £47,300 compared with that on completions of £49,100.
During 2006 we made a significant shift in the delivery of strategic land into the landbank and were
successful in bringing 4,837 plots into the short term landbank. These plots will come through at a
significantly lower cost per plot, adding considerable value to the landbank.
In the US we have been reviewing our landbank in light of the change in market conditions. As our
average selling prices fell by over 10% during the year, and the short term outcome for the US housing
market remained uncertain, we took a very cautious approach to land purchases. During the second half
of the year we temporarily withdrew from land purchases in all markets except Texas, where conditions are
more stable. We have deliberately reduced our US landbank by 20% to 18,737 plots. However we

Reducing the
real cost of land
During 2006 we brought 4,837 plots
into our UK short term landbank
from our strategic landbank. We have
owned or held options on many of
these sites for more than ten years
as we have worked to bring them
through the planning system.
WP100_p06-p11_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:18  Page 9 still retain a strong land position with all the land required for 2007’s anticipated completions and the
majority of that required for 2008. This land is all held at values consistent with current market conditions.
We expect some further weakening of land prices and believe we will be able to secure land at lower cost
in the future.
Our cost base
We seek to leverage maximum benefit from our scale to become the lowest cost producer in our industry
and ensure we deliver maximum value from our developments. A thorough review of our supply chain
and a detailed benchmarking of costs in every area of our business in both the UK and the US will ensure
we achieve our goals. We have already targeted input cost
savings of £25 million in the UK and $20 million in the US in
2007. This puts us in a strong position from which to create
significant competitive advantage.
Our sales expertise
We are developing a structured and consistent sales process
to achieve maximum effectiveness and deliver maximum
value from our brands. We build high quality homes and our
strategy will ensure we have show areas that create maximum
impact and desirability for our products. Our sales executives
will be highly trained to sell the benefits of our homes and
efficient sales processes and procedures will ensure our
customers consistently receive the highest levels of
customer service.
Our people
Without the right people taking our business forward we
cannot achieve our goals and build the quality of business we
seek. Therefore we need to be able to attract and retain the
very best people in our industry. We must ensure we give the
people who work for us the right tools to allow them to
achieve the very best they can. We have to invest in training
and development and ensure we create the opportunities for
people to grow and succeed.
It is important for the ongoing success of our business that
we have clear succession plans. We want our future leaders
to come from within our business. We have established clear
training and development schemes across all areas of our
business so we can effectively manage and develop the many
talented people we employ.
Delivering our objectives
I am delighted to have the support of an experienced and
committed excecutive team. In the UK, Ian Sutcliffe is driving
through the improvement plans with great determination
and in the US, Steve Parker is ensuring Morrison Homes is well
positioned for growth when the market stabilises.
We have clear plans in place to strengthen and improve all
the key areas of our business and I am confident this puts us
in a strong position from which to deliver our strategic
objectives. I believe George Wimpey will become the leading
national housebuilder in the UK and in the regional markets
we choose in the US and I am proud to be leading the
Company to achieve this goal.

Great Western Park, Didcot, Oxfordshire
A strategic site dating back to 1995, Great Western
Park, Didcot is made up of a ‘jigsaw’ of land interests
controlled by option agreements. George Wimpey
successfully overcame the challenges of the
planning system in 2006 to achieve outline planning
permission. The development is set to provide a
maximum of 3,300 homes (30% affordable) as well
as schools, shops, health care facilities and
community and neighbourhood centres.
City Vizion, Rodney Parade, Newport
George Wimpey is working with the National Assembly
for Wales to provide 480 homes (72 affordable) on this
mixed use urban development. We exchanged
contracts in October and submitted a detailed
planning application in November 2006 hoping to
start on site in mid 2007 with first legal completions
due in September 2008. Land costs, including flood
defence works to the Riverside Walk, are expected to
be 12% of expected average selling prices.
Land
The foundations for our future success
We are seeking to build a balanced landbank across the Group reflecting
the conditions of the markets in which we operate.
Land is our raw material. The mix of land we hold
in our landbank is vital to the future success of
our business.
In the UK, as part of our commitment to delivering
consistent growth in financial returns we made
a step change in our land strategy at the end of
2005. We have increased our focus on buying
land where we can add extra value and so reduce
the real cost of land for the future. Building and
maintaining a balanced landbank is key to
our strategy.
We are focusing on acquiring more long term and
medium term sites which we can promote through
the planning system. We will also seek to maintain
strong relationships with major land developers to
become preferred partners on large developments.
As part of our commitment to strengthen our
landbank we have established a new Land
Development Division responsible for the total UK
landbank and for managing the medium and long
term portfolio to deliver the agreed number of
plots into the short term landbank. We entered
2007 in a strong position with detailed planning
permission secured for 100% of our anticipated
volume for the year.
In the US, although we have temporarily stepped
back from land acquisition in all our weakening
markets, we have all the land required for our
anticipated volumes in 2007 and a significant
proportion for 2008 completions. We continue to
hold an appropriate landbank at realistic values
for current market conditions.

Renegotiating supplier contracts
In the US, all Divisions are actively seeking to reduce costs
by inviting suppliers to rebid for contracts on every development.
We are holding a combination of group and individual supplier
meetings to communicate this initiative and are renegotiating all
contracts as bids are received. Our initial focus has been on the
top eight to ten suppliers in each Division which account for 70%
of our costs. We are targeting savings of up to 5% for this initiative.

Costs
Putting the spotlight on costs
We are seeking to reduce costs to more than offset the impact of
inflation and regulation changes.
We have a clear strategy to develop a sustainable
cost conscious culture so we continually challenge
all our processes, seeking to improve the
cost-value balance.
In the UK our highly structured approach to cost
management has resulted in over 70 locally staffed
initiatives branching from a central management
and control process. This structure allows regional
best practice processes to be used as national
benchmarks. We have identified priority areas, most
significantly direct selling expenses. Rapid progress is
coming through supplier consolidation and stronger
procurement and tendering methods. Early gains
have already helped to identify further opportunities
to make savings.
In the US a number of cost reduction initiatives are
underway to help offset the market impact. We are
renegotiating all supplier contracts, establishing
cost guideline principles for outside legal consultants
and evaluating and aggressively managing our first
year warranty claims to drive down costs. We will also
re-evaluate all housetypes to dramatically reduce the
total number offered across the company. A detailed
benchmarking process will measure the progress of
these initiatives so we can remain on track to meet
our targets.
2006 saw the appointment of a Head of Procurement
for George Wimpey UK, Peter Williams and a Director
of Purchasing for Morrison Homes, Jeff Allgood, who
will focus on developing a unified approach to all
purchasing across all business units. In the UK Andy
Graham was appointed Cost Controller to ensure we
actively drive down costs and to co-ordinate the cost
reduction programme.

in an approximate cost reduction of 40%.

Maximising the selling process
Across all our brands we are setting industry leading standards providing
excellence in sales presentation and management and customer service.
Our key sales strategy focuses on delivering
greater value from our core brands. Using sharper
brand positioning, we aim to build on the excellent
reputations we have in our markets to create
a consistent sense of desire for our homes.
The internet is increasingly recognised as a key
selling tool and we will continue to take full
advantage of this medium to promote our brands.
In 2006 we piloted mymorrisonhomes.com in
the US and a new and improved UK website was
introduced early in 2007. In addition we will make
greater use of popular industry websites to
promote our homes.
In the UK a full review of the effectiveness of
marketing spend was carried out in 2006 leading
to a number of new initiatives to create a
unified brand image. A standard sales office
and showhome will ensure we create maximum
impact for every customer and heighten the
desirability of our products.
Across our business we strive to provide excellent
levels of customer service and are committed to
improving levels of customer satisfaction. We aim
to build upon the innovative training carried out
throughout 2006 to further develop the customer
care and selling skills of all our sales staff to ensure
they are the best trained in the industry.
Innovative solutions
During 2006, our Houston Division
piloted mymorrisonhomes.com.
This new and interactive part of the
Morrison Homes’ website is designed
to guide customers through the
homebuying process and serve as
a communication tool once they
have moved into their new home.
Top class sales staff
A fresh new sales training experience was
introduced across the UK during 2006 to
build upon the success of our ‘Growing Wiser’
customer service campaign. The innovative
training sessions provided sales executives
with new tools and techniques to enhance
the effectiveness of their selling skills ensuring
we have the best sales teams in the industry.

the best blend of service, creative flair and ability to deliver national
campaigns. Creative templates will be available for all businesses
to use maximising the value from the George Wimpey brand,
creating better quality advertising as well as reducing costs by
approximately 50%.

Developing the skills for success
Morrison Academy was introduced in late 2006 as a programme focused
on management and leadership development. Under this umbrella, two
key initiatives are already underway. The Morrison Business Academy
targets members of senior management and aims to enhance higher
order business skills as well as improve overall leadership capability and
effectiveness. The Leadership Summit focuses on high potential talent
within the business and provides them with the skills required to move
into top operational leadership roles within 24 to 36 months.

People
Developing our future leaders
We aim to attract, develop and retain the very best people in the UK
and US housing industry.
Talent management is the key focus of our people
strategy. Throughout 2006 we have improved existing
practices and introduced new ones to support
leadership and skills development at all levels of
our organisation.
Our development programmes include the Henley
Leadership Programme, New Directors’ Programme,
Oxford MBA, Management Trainee Scheme and
Apprenticeships in the UK and the Morrison Business
Academy and Leadership Summit in the US. In the UK
George Wimpey’s Graduate Programme continues to
be a success and we are committed to doubling the
intake in 2007. Three of those recruited have already
achieved director status. A similar scheme entitled
‘Leadership in the Making’ is being set up in the US
with the first intake of graduates from the University
of Florida starting with Morrison Homes in September
this year.
Reduction of employee turnover is a business
priority and to assist in achieving this all managers are
completing recruitment skills training with performance
management and coaching skills being developed
across the businesses.
In order to facilitate succession planning and to assist
with training need analysis we have completed a
competency framework for all roles along with the
launch of an improved Performance Appraisal process.
The responses we receive from our Employee Surveys
in both the UK and US help us to formulate action plans
to support employee development at all levels of the
business ensuring our companies are great places
to work.

Our Goals
Our goal is to become the leading national housebuilder
in the UK and in the markets in which we operate in the
US. We seek to deliver maximum value for our shareholders,
not just in the short term but for many years to come.
The Company will deliver shareholder value by growing
profit before tax, increasing earnings per share and
providing an attractive progressive dividend which is
secure and sensibly covered by cash flows and earnings.
In the UK our strategy is to grow completions and
operating profit and, through improved effectiveness and
efficiency, increase our operating margin. The delivery of
an improved operating margin will be supported by our
strategy of acquiring value added land and continuously
improving our cost effectiveness.
In the US, our long term strategy is to grow completions,
operating profit and operating margin. In the short term,
our strategy is to manage current market conditions by
focusing on costs and efficiencies to establish a platform for
rapid volume growth, as market conditions return
to normal.
The success of our growth strategy will be influenced by
our ability to grow completions across the Group, which
can be positively impacted by achieving high customer
satisfaction levels. We believe that if we can become the
‘housebuilder of choice’ for our customers we will gain
competitive advantage.
People are one of our greatest assets. We strive to
be a company that people want to work for. We take
our moral responsibility to provide a safe working
environment for our employees seriously and encourage
our employees to consider their safety as well as that
of others at all times.
Key Performance Indicators
To implement our strategy successfully we need to be

We take our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) duties
very seriously and have developed a number of measures
to track our progress in this area. Within our CSR report

to governance, health and safety, the environment,
employees and customer care. A summary of the CSR

UK Housing
22 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
UK housing market
The UK housing market was broadly stable throughout 2006, recovering well from the slow market
conditions experienced in the previous year. According to the Land Registry, total housing market
transactions increased by 22% compared with 2005.
Although affordability remained an issue, particularly amongst first time buyers, demand was supported
by rising employment and income levels which helped the market absorb the negative impact of rising
interest rates.
The long term outlook for the new homes market remains positive, driven primarily by the continued
imbalance between supply and demand. According to The Department for Communities and Local
Government the number of UK households is predicted to rise by 2.3 million over the next ten years.
A large rise in single person households, an increasingly ageing population and high levels of immigration
from Eastern Europe will boost demand for new homes to an estimated 209,000 homes per year. In
contrast, the supply of new homes remains limited to around 160,000 a year as a result of the current
regulatory environment and severe planning restrictions.
The Barker Review of Land Use Planning, published in December 2006 targeted this issue of planning in
particular. The purpose of the review was to consider how, in the context of globalisation, and building on
the reforms already put in place, planning policy and procedures can better deliver economic growth and
prosperity alongside other sustainable development goals. The review made several recommendations to
the Government all of which will, if implemented, revolutionise the current planning process. The introduction
of a more transparent, streamlined policy and a reduction in delays will help speed up the current process
for developers facilitating the higher levels of production required going forward. George Wimpey and the
wider industry are well placed to step up to the challenge of delivering high quality housing in the quantities
required to satisfy demand and are keen to ensure steps are taken to make these proposals a reality.
George Wimpey market conditions
During 2006 market conditions were stable for all our businesses. We saw the first signs of markets
stabilising around London and the South at the end of 2005, after the difficult market conditions
experienced earlier in the year. Buyer confidence has returned across our markets, with the Midlands
market being the slowest to respond to the changing sentiment.
As a result of the housing shortage in the UK there has been good demand for our homes. However as
prices have risen steeply in recent years affordability remains an issue for many customers, particularly in
the Midlands. Prices across all markets have remained competitive.

Delivering on promises
At the end of 2005 we put a series of actions in place to address the issues of underperformance in our
business. These actions have enabled us to deliver the planned growth in volumes, profits and margins
this year.
At that time, a number of changes were made to senior management roles within our business.
Arriving new to George Wimpey and the industry I was delighted to be welcomed by such a wealth
of housebuilding experience on the UK Board. All four of my Divisional Managing Directors have been
promoted through the business and have over 82 years of George Wimpey experience between them.
In addition, 20 of our 28 regional business heads have been promoted from within the business.
Throughout the year we have added further expertise to key areas of the business. To ensure we deliver
maximum benefit from our scale, Peter Williams joined us from BPB as Head of Procurement to co-ordinate
all supply chain and purchasing initiatives. Adding further value to our landbank and strengthening our
position for the future remains a priority. We have established two new senior land and planning positions,
Paul Churchouse has been promoted to Head of Land Development and a Head of Planning will be
appointed shortly.
I am confident that we now have a strong team in place to drive through our strategy putting us in
an excellent position from which to deliver our primary objective of margin growth going forward.
Financial review
In 2006 the revenue for the UK business increased by 11% to £2,391.2 million (2005: £2,157.6 millon)
benefiting from a 13% growth in completions. Operating profit including joint ventures increased by
14% to £317.6 million (2005: £278.0 million). Profit from joint ventures was £7.6 million. For the full year
gross margins were 20.6% (2005: 21.5%) and operating margins, excluding joint ventures, were 13.0% (2005:
12.9%). Margins have shown strong growth through the year with gross margins increasing from 19.3% in
the first half to 21.5% in the second half and operating margins increasing from 11 .2% in the first half to
14.3% in the second half. This steady improvement has come through as planned as we see the benefit of
a strong cost management programme across all areas of the business. Gross margins on sales in the
second half show further progress on those achieved on completions during the same period as the
benefit of an improving landbank and sales revenue comes through.
Outlets and completions
The average number of outlets open during the year was 275, 10% below last year (2005: 307). This is in part
the result of strong sales rates throughout the year, however the planning environment still remains difficult
and a number of planned site openings for the second half have been delayed. We continue to work closely
with local planning authorities to try and improve the time taken for planning approvals to be gained.
Average visitor levels to sites were below last year as customers made greater use of the internet in the
initial stages of selecting a new home. As a result we had a higher quality of customers visiting our sites
resulting in good conversion rates. Average sales rates for the year were 20% ahead of 2005.
The total number of completions was 13,616, a 13% increase on the prior year (2005: 12,100). In the latter
part of 2005 we took deliberate action to increase our forward order book. As well as allowing us to
manage sales rates and build programmes more effectively we were able to achieve significant volume
growth. Volumes in the first half increased by 28% to 5,854 (2005: 4,576).
During the year we have retained our position as a national housebuilder, with an even geographic
spread across the UK. George Wimpey currently operates through 28 regional business units, with two
satellite operations in Peterborough and Aberdeen providing maximum coverage for our East Midlands
and East Scotland businesses respectively.

Prices and costs
Average selling prices for the year at £175,400 were slightly lower than last year (2005: £178,000). Private
average selling prices at £186,400 also showed little change on a year ago (2005: £188,600) mainly as a
result of a change in mix. The selling prices for affordable homes reduced by 4% to £94,900 (2005: £98,600).
Underlying private average selling prices on a per square foot basis have risen by 3%.
Throughout the year the market has remained price sensitive and although the use of incentives has
reduced they have continued to be an important selling tool.
We estimate that underlying cost inflation for the industry has been running between 3% and 4%. Against
this backdrop, as a result of our extensive cost reduction programme introduced at the beginning of 2006,
we have been able to offset more than the impact of inflation. Build costs per plot have reduced by 3%
over the year. We have targeted input cost savings of £25 million in 2007 and are confident that the
established cost reduction programmes and detailed benchmarking of all aspects of our business will
enable us to identify further opportunities as the year progresses.
A key element of our business improvement initiatives and cost reduction programme has been the
introduction of a preferred house type range. This range of PPG3 compliant designs and floorplans has
helped to reduce the number of ‘bespoke’ house types required. Throughout the year an increasing
number of planning applications have been made using these house types. As the number of these build
and cost efficient schemes coming to the development stage increases, we will see further improvements
in our cost base whilst continuing to deliver the same high standards of build quality for our customers.
Product range
George Wimpey build a range of products that meet the needs and requirements of our customers and
satisfy a broad section of the volume market. With the average price of a house in the United Kingdom
exceeding £185,000 by December 2006, 66% of our homes are priced at £200,000 or below and 84% are
below £250,000, the level at which higher rate stamp duty is required.
The proportion of sales accounted for by four and five bedroom homes fell slightly during the year to 30%
(2005: 32%) with the proportion of apartments rising to 41% (2005: 36%). The increase in the number of
apartments has reduced the average square footage of our homes to 954 sq ft (2005: 994 sq ft).
In recent years, as rapid price inflation has affected the housing market, affordability has become an issue
for customers of our smaller products. During 2006 we established a new value brand, G2, with a product
and price range specifically targeted at first time buyers. After initial trials the first G2 development came
onto the market in Grantham in August. With one bedroom apartments priced at £59,995 and two
bedroom apartments at £85,000 all 60 apartments were sold on the first day. G2 is a totally new concept
for George Wimpey. These developments are marketed solely via the internet and on site hoardings as
there is no sales presence on site. The sites are much smaller than standard George Wimpey sites and tend
to be inner-city, infill brownfield sites. The G2 business currently holds eight sites and is establishing its
own landbank of typically stand alone sites.
Providing local authorities with affordable housing as part of our private developments continues to be
a requirement. In 2006 the number of affordable homes we built increased by 15% to 1,634 but continued
to be approximately 12% of our total completions. In April we were awarded £31.7 million by the Housing
Corporation, which represents the largest funding award to a national housebuilder under the
Corporation’s national investment programme. This grant not only recognises the commitment of the

company to provide high quality affordable housing, it also gives us greater control over the financing of
these homes.
Quality and customers
We continue to deliver industry leading levels of customer service and build on the fact that we were
the only volume housebuilder in 2006 to be awarded 4 stars in the two key categories of the HBF
Customer Satisfaction Survey. In our independently monitored customer satisfaction survey, measured as
‘would you recommend George Wimpey to your friends or family?’ 88% of our customers said they would.
In this year’s NHBC Pride in the Job awards, 49 George Wimpey site managers received Quality Awards,
14 of whom received Seals of Excellence and two became Regional Winners.
Landbank
We have committed to improving not only the length of our landbank but also the underlying value of
the plots we hold. By improving the value of the land we hold we can be certain of delivering steady
growth in margins over the next few years.
Since the end of 2005 we have achieved a 14% increase in the number of plots in the landbank which
stood at 57,999 plots at the end of 2006 (2005: 50,985 plots). The average number of plots per site
acquired during the year was 126, an increase on 94 plots per site in 2005 as we start to increase
the number of larger medium and long term added value sites we acquire.
As we entered 2007 we had planning permission on 100% of the plots required for anticipated
completions for the year and 40% of those required for 2008 completions. We currently hold 22,236 plots
with planning, a significantly stronger position than in recent years (2005: 21,353 plots).
The average cost per plot in the landbank is £47,300 (2005: £46,500), below that of completions in the
period of £49,100. The average plot cost as a percentage of average selling price on completions during
the year was 28.0% (2005: 26.5%) and the plot cost as a percentage of the average selling price in the
owned landbank is 25.3%, slightly below last year (2005: 26.0%). This is an excellent position from which to
deliver further margin growth during 2007.
We changed the way we managed our strategic landbank a few years ago and during the year saw the
benefit of those changes starting to come through. In 2006 we were successful in bringing 4,837 plots
into the short term landbank from the strategic landbank with 4,397 coming through in the second half.
Of particular note were 1,486 plots from Great Western Park in Didcot and 1,450 plots from Berryfields in
Aylesbury, both of which we have been progressing through the planning system since the mid 1990s.
Following selective additions during the year, the strategic landbank now stands at 15,846 acres
(2005: 14,169 acres).
Adding value to our landbank
For our businesses to deliver consistent returns they need to hold a portfolio of land at different stages
in the planning and value chain. Historically we have held a strong short term landbank however schemes
have become more complex and the time spent with planning authorities has been extending. We
therefore need to hold a range of land at different stages in the planning system and we need to look
at ways of using our capital more effectively.
Over the next few years we will be seeking to grow our landbank, increasing the mix of medium and long
term sites that we hold in our owned and controlled landbank. The optimum mix we aim to achieve is
40% short term land to be developed within one to two years, 30% medium term land to be developed
within two to five years and 30% long term land to be developed within five to ten years. In addition we
will continue to increase our strategic landbank.
Going forward
In the UK the housing market has remained healthy during early 2007. We are confident that the business
plans established across our UK business will continue to deliver benefits throughout the year. With a
strong land position, an established cost reduction programme, a record order book position and a stable
and experienced management team, we are confident that based on current market conditions, operating
margins in George Wimpey UK will exceed 14% in 2007.

WP100_p22-25_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  15:05  Page 25 US housing market
The US economy expanded at a moderate rate during 2006 with an average growth in GDP of 3.4%
for the year (2005: 3.5%). Despite the widely reported slow down in activity the labour market remained
favourable as the unemployment rate reduced further throughout 2006 to an average of 4.6% (2005:
5.1%), its lowest rate since 2001. During the year 1.9 million new jobs were created and personal income
increased by 5.9%. Consumer confidence ended the year at 109.0 with interest rates on a 30 year
mortgage averaging 6.41% for the year, well below the long term average.
2006 proved to be the most challenging housing market in the US for a number of years as affordability,
driven by rising interest rates and house prices, became stretched in several markets. Market conditions
in California, Florida and Arizona experienced a downturn in activity whilst Texas remained solid due to the
continued affordability of housing in that state. Although demand softened, the number of homes for sale
continued to rise, as investors ‘dumped’ properties back on the market leading to an oversupply of both
new and second-hand homes. As a result, housing starts decreased and by the end of the year inventory
levels had started to show signs of reducing. The long term forecast published by the National Association
of Home Builders (NAHB) predicts that average starts over the next ten years will exceed those of the
previous ten. Single family starts are predicted to total 1.26 million in 2007 compared with 1.48 million in
2006 and 1.72 million in 2005.
The long term outlook for the US housing market remains positive. An upward trend in housing is
expected for the next ten years which will be largely driven by strong demographic trends. The Joint
Center for Housing Studies predicts household growth will accelerate from around 12.6 million for the
past ten years to 14.6 million over the next ten, an increase of 1.3 million from previous 2005 to 2015
projections. Much of this is attributable to immigration, with net immigration averaging 1.18 million

home ownership is likely to drive demand for housing going forward.
Morrison Homes market conditions
Despite the challenging conditions experienced in the US housing market in 2006, we remain confident
about our prospects of long term growth. Today we have focused our operations in 13 markets which are
supported by strong long term demographic trends. Our satellite operations in Reno, Nevada and Fort
Myers, Florida have now achieved stand alone status and have operated independently since the end of
2006. In 2006 Texas, Florida, California and Arizona experienced the highest levels of employment growth
in the US, with the growth in Texas at twice the national average. Although market conditions weakened
in California, Florida and Arizona throughout last year, conditions in Texas remained stable, where
inventory levels did not experience such rapid growth.
Financial overview
Following a 64% growth in profits during 2005, weakening market conditions impacted Morrison Homes’
performance in the second half of 2006. Revenue for the year was $1,389.1 million (2005: $1,538.8 million)
and pre-exceptional operating profit was $214.7 million (2005: $308.3 million). We recorded an exceptional
charge of $118.7 million on the write-down of land inventories and options which reduced post-

exceptional profits to $96.0 million. The impact of reducing sales prices and increased incentives had a
knock-on effect on operating margins which fell to 15.5% (2005: 20.0%).
To offset some of the market impact we have renewed our focus on costs and are seeking to actively
manage our cost base across all areas of the business with $20 million of input cost savings targeted in
2007. Detailed benchmarking will measure costs across all operations and we continue to renegotiate
contracts with all suppliers, targeting cost savings of around 5%. A number of other cost reduction
initiatives are also underway which will seek to reduce costs in sales, legal and administrative functions.
As part of this programme by January 2007 we reduced employee numbers by 145, reducing full time
staffing levels by around 20% across the business. This enables us to operate at appropriate staffing levels
without affecting our ability to grow as market conditions improve.
The net impact of changes in the exchange rate was limited. The weakening Dollar resulted in an
average exchange rate for 2006 of $1.84:£1 compared with $1.82:£1 used in 2005. In Sterling terms
revenue was £756.2 million (2005: £845.5 million), pre-exceptional operating profits reduced to £116.9
million and post-exceptional operating profits were £56.2 million (2005: £169.4 million).
Sales, product and prices
Benefiting from a strong order book at the beginning of 2006, we were able to deliver a record
performance in the first half of the year which supported the full year results. Total completions for the
year were 4,347, 12% below last year (2005: 4,921). Excluding Atlanta completions were 4,341, 10% below
last year (2005: 4,797). As was predicted, total average outlets for the year increased to 107 (2005: 95) with
the actual number open at the year end increasing to 114.
In line with the industry and compared to a very strong market for most of 2005 average visitor levels
per site for 2006 decreased by 28%. The weak market conditions had a significant effect on average sales
rates as sales per outlet per week reduced to 0.56 (2005: 1.05). We took action to combat this by raising
the bar on our sales processes and people and by using increased incentives to gain competitive
advantage. Cancellation rates averaged 38% as investors responded to the high inventory levels by
cancelling contracts very late in the purchasing process. This is more than double our average
cancellation rate for the previous four years of 18%.
Average selling prices for the full year were $319,600 (2005: $312,700) benefiting from strong price
appreciation on sales in the second half of 2005 completed in the first half of 2006. During the second
half of 2006 average selling prices, particularly in the Florida, Phoenix and Northern California businesses

WP100_p26-29_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:12  Page 28 were impacted by the highly competitive, price led market affecting all US homebuilders. Prices in the
order book are currently at similar levels to those achieved in the first half of 2005.
In response to market conditions we have introduced ranges of townhomes and other higher density
products in several markets. This type of product has enabled us to maintain our position in the volume
market with the attached townhome representing 23% of the Florida Division’s completions in 2006.
The growth in sales from the townhome product range, has led the average size of our homes to fall
slightly to 2,274 sq ft (2005: 2,299 sq ft).
Land
The challenges of the market in 2006 led us to make a change in our land strategy. The strong landbank
built up over the past five years allowed us to temporarily stand back from land purchases during the
second half of the year in all our weakening markets. We carried out a detailed review of all optioned and
pipeline land and renegotiated or exited all contracts not expected to deliver economic returns. As a result
of these actions the owned and controlled landbank was reduced by 20% to 18,737 plots (2005: 23,514
plots). Just over one third of the landbank is currently held under option which provides opportunities
to renegotiate terms and conditions to ensure maximum value is delivered from our landbank.
Our current landbank places us in a strong position for the future, with land carrying values having been
reduced to reflect the current market conditions. We either own or have options on all the plots required
for 2007’s expected volumes and a significant proportion of those required for 2008.
Customer service
Morrison Homes has built its brand on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction. During the
year our ‘would you recommend’ customer satisfaction score averaged 86% (2005: 85%), with 30% of
customers who bought a Morrison home in 2006 coming from referrals from satisfied customers
(2005: 27%). Centralised Signature Selection Centers continue to add value for our customers. On average
our customers spent $31,000 per sale customising their new homes (2005: $28,000), which represents
9.8% of the total revenue. Morrison Financial and Morrison Title have continued to contribute to our
financial performance with an income of $4.9 million and $1.4 million respectively. 65% of customers
arranged their mortgages through us and in Texas and Florida approximately 90% of customers used
our title service. We have focused on improving the efficiency of our mortgage business and from April
2007 our Florida joint venture mortgage partner will operate across our business under the new name
Morrison Home Funding. We believe this will improve profitability as well as customer satisfaction with
our customers receiving priority service.
www.morrisonhomes.com continues to be an extremely valuable marketing tool. During 2006
www.morrisonhomes.com received 2.4 million visitor sessions. The average visitor session was over
nine minutes long with each visitor viewing on average 15.8 pages. As part of our continued focus on
customer care ‘mymorrisonhomes.com’ was trialled in our Austin Division. This proposed extension of
the Morrison Homes website will provide customers with a communication aid before and after the
purchase of their home.
Going forward
In the US there have been signs that market conditions have stabilised in the first few weeks of 2007 with
cancellation rates reducing dramatically and sales rates increasing. Given our low order books we expect
volumes and margins in 2007 to be signficantly below 2006. However if current trends continue, the
market will improve during the year leading to a strong 2008.
Our deliberately cautious approach to land acquisition and valuation, the firm actions we have taken to
address costs and overheads along with our position in markets with strong long term demographic
trends, give us confidence that Morrison Homes is well placed to return to growth as conditions improve.

commitment we have continued to enhance our CSR practices and processes during the year. We
constantly appraise new challenges in the market place and recognise the challenges of building
sustainable communities as well as responding to the increasing threat of climate change. As a member
of the CBI’s new Climate Change Task Force, we will be helping to set the agenda for businesses to tackle
this issue. We are committed to working towards meeting the UK Government’s targets for all new homes
in the UK to be zero carbon rated by 2016. Our priority will be to respond to CSR challenges in a way
that makes sound business sense for our Company.
CSR management
Responsibility for CSR within our Group rests with the CSR Committee and the Board. The CSR Committee
is chaired by Non Executive Director Christine Cross and includes our UK Managing Director and the
President of Morrison Homes and is tasked with ensuring that CSR strategy and activity is adequately
resourced, has appropriate standing within the Group and is aligned to the needs of our business.
Ethics and governance underpin everything we do and determine our approach to CSR. We acknowledge
the vital importance of identifying financial and non-financial risks and opportunities for our business and
have set out our financial and non-financial KPIs on pages 20 and 21 and our 2006 CSR report includes
26 KPIs that measure our annual CSR progress.
2006 CSR highlights
We made strong progress in each of our six key areas of focus for CSR and George Wimpey Plc was
included by Innovest Strategic Value Advisors and Corporate Knights in the 2007 list of the Global 100
Most Sustainable Corporations.
Health and Safety
We take the health and safety of our employees and sub-contractors extremely seriously and have
extensive procedures in place to minimise the risk to those working on or visiting our sites.
• We reduced total UK accidents by 21% and major UK accidents by 54%. Falls from height reduced to
3% of UK accidents compared with an industry average of 28%. This is a crucial area of focus as falls from
height are the most significant cause of workplace injuries and fatalities in the construction industry.
• In the US the Tampa Bay Safety Alliance, started and facilitated by Morrison Homes, helped to improve
housebuilder and trade partner safety standards in the region. By the end of 2006, the Alliance had nearly
30 members including trade partners and seven of the ten largest housebuilders in the area.

Supply Chain Management
Our approach to managing the supply chain takes into account the importance of environmental issues
and our commitment to building long term relationships with sub-contractors and suppliers, treating
them fairly and paying them promptly.
• During 2006, we recruited Peter Williams as Head of Procurement for George Wimpey UK and Jeff
Allgood as Director of Purchasing for Morrison Homes. George Wimpey UK now has a major five year
supply chain management strategy.
• Environmental and sustainability objectives are a key part of the new UK supply chain management
strategy. In 2007, we will review our existing Green Procurement Policy and how we deliver this through
the supply chain.
Building Sustainable Communities
We remain committed to building sustainable communities. They play a major role in reducing the
negative effects and increasing the positive impacts of housebuilding. Our developments can help to

The Group has continued to focus on delivering shareholder value. Group profit before tax totalled
£310.2 million after providing an exceptional item of £60.7 million for land option write-offs and land
write-downs in the US. This item has been separately disclosed on the face of the income statement.
Pre-exceptional profit before tax totalled £370.9 million slightly ahead of last year (2005: £366.5 million).
Shareholders’ funds rose by £162.7 million, despite the land provisions, and after a further increase in
dividends paid out during the year. A 10% increase in the final dividend is proposed, which if approved,
would bring the full year dividend to 19.4 pence (2005: 17.6 pence). Even after significant investment to
improve both the quality and size of the UK landbank, the balance sheet was further strengthened with
gearing reduced to 23% (2005: 34%). Pre-exceptional return on average capital employed for the year
was 20.3% (2005: 22.3%), substantially above our cost of capital.
Group results
The 2006 accounts have been prepared in line with International Financial Reporting Standards and it is
pleasing to note a high degree of stability in the final reporting environment in the past year. As a result
there are no material changes to any accounting policies to report.
This year, for the first time we have identified a number of Key Performance Indicators to enable investors
to measure our performance. The Group’s results as measured by these KPIs are reflected in the following
narrative. The definition and, where appropriate, the calculations of these measures along with the other
KPIs we have chosen to give a fuller picture of our performance, are set out on pages 20 and 21.

WP100_p32-35_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:11  Page 32 Group revenue rose by 5% to £3,147.4 million (2005: £3,003.2 million). Group completions grew by 6% to
17,963 (2005: 17,021), with strong growth in the UK more than offsetting the effect of market weakness in
the US. Pre-exceptional profit before tax rose by 1% to £370.9 million with post-exceptional profit before
tax reduced by 15% to £310.2 million (2005: £366.5 million). Year end net debt reduced from £521.9 million
at the end of 2005 to £387.1 million at 31 December 2006. It is pleasing to note the steady reduction in
gearing at the same time as the Company has strengthened its land position for the future.
The Group is clearly in a strong financial position which provides a solid platform as well as flexibility when
considering future investment opportunities.
UK Housing: In the UK, revenue increased by 11% to £2,391.2 million (2005: £2,157.6 million). This strong
performance was driven by the 13% increase in completions to 13,616 (2005: 12,100). Average selling
prices were slightly down, with positive like for like price momentum more than offset by the lower
average size of homes and an increasing proportion of affordable homes. UK operating margins were
13.0% (2005: 12.9%). Given the very weak margins in our order book coming into 2006, this was a sound
result. The business continues to focus on improving the operating margin with margins in the second
half and in the order book at the end of 2006 continuing to show an improving trend. This has been
achieved by the benefits of stable market conditions and importantly, progress in executing our land
strategy and improving cost effectiveness. With improving profits and a modest increase in assets
employed, return on average capital employed increased to 19.1% (2005: 17.2%).
US Housing: In contrast to the UK, US revenue fell by 9.7% to $1,389.1 million (2005: $1,538.8 million).
The sharp fall in the Californian market that we noted at the end of 2005 was the forerunner of generally
weaker housing market conditions across most of the US during 2006. Weak market conditions resulted in
reducing sales rates and increasing cancellation rates as the year progressed. Despite entering 2006 with
strong order books, overall completions fell by 12% to 4,347 (2005: 4,921). Average selling prices were up
2% to $319,600 (2005: $312,700). However this masks the trend of net prices rising through most of 2005
and declining as 2006 progressed. Given this decline, it was felt prudent to recognise a land write-down
of $118.7 million pre-tax, $74.3 million post-tax in December 2006. This has been calculated in accordance
with IAS 2 and is based upon management’s assessment of net selling prices needed to achieve a normal
sales rate. This is shown as an exceptional item in the income statement.
Following the 64% increase in US profit in 2005, pre-exceptional operating profit fell by 30% to $214.7
(2005: $308.3 million). Even so, this represents the second best result ever achieved by the US Housing
Division. The pre-exceptional operating margin was 15.5% (2005: 20.0%). Although we have seen early
signs of stability returning to the US market, we would expect US margins to fall further in the short term.
However, given the positive demographic trends and growth of the US economy, we believe that a
recovery to mid-teen margins is achievable in the medium term. Return on average capital employed in
the US continued at satisfactory levels, pre-exceptional 24.6% (2005: 44.2%) and post-exceptional 11.0%.
Interest: Reported net interest costs for 2006 reduced by £19.1 million to £51.9 million (2005: £71.0
million), within this, net interest on borrowings from financial institutions totalled £43.9 million
(2005: £50.0 million). Average debt levels for 2006 were £833 million (2005: £965 million). Other items
charged to the interest line include a pension charge of £6.8 million (2005: £8.5 million), a net £4.0 million
(2005: £3.8 million) charged for imputed interest on long term land creditors and a mark to market gain
on interest rate derivatives of £5.6 million compared with a £5.3 million charge in 2005.
Tax: The tax charge for underlying operations was £114.9 million, reduced by a credit to deferred tax of
£22.7 million relating to the US land provision. The net tax charge was therefore £92.2 million, at an
effective rate on profit before tax of 30%.
Earnings per share and dividend: With modestly higher profits but also slightly higher average shares
in issue, pre-exceptional earnings per share stayed fairly constant at 64.4 pence (2005: 64.3 pence). Post-
exceptional earnings per share were 54.8 pence. The Board sees the delivery of shareholder value as core
to our purpose and regards the achievement of growth in EPS over the cycle and the maintenance of a
progressive dividend policy as key measures of this.
Balance sheet and cash flow
Shareholders’ funds made further progress increasing by 11% to £1,707.1 million (2005: £1,544.4 million).
Expressed on a per share basis, shareholders’ funds totalled 426 pence (2005: 389 pence), an increase of
37 pence after allowing for dividends paid out during the calendar year and the US land write-down.
The Group delivered strong cash inflow from operations totalling £305.1 million (2005: £286.9 million). Year
end net debt levels fell from £521 .9 million in 2005 to £387.1 million in 2006, a reduction of £134.8 million.
Retained shareholders’ funds continued to be the principal source of finance to support the increased
investment in the Group’s future. Net assets employed totalled £2,094 million, an increase of only £28 million.

WP100_p32-35_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:11  Page 33 Second half results
In the six months ending 31 December 2006, revenue fell by 5% to £1,750.8 million (2005: £1,834.2 million).
This reflects the difficult market conditions in the US, together with the effect of the weakening Dollar.
UK revenue rose by 4% in the second half despite the impact of our policy to increase the balance of
sales in the first half. First half UK revenue rose by 22%. Group completions at 10,141 were 3% below
2005 (10,452), the combined effect of 3% growth in the UK and a 19% decline in the US.
In the UK, operating profit grew by 19% to £203.2 million (2005: £171.3 million). Operating margins
showed good progress rising to 14.3% in the second half compared with 13.1% in the second half of
2005 and 11.2% in the first half of 2006. Of the 3.1% improvement compared to the first half, 0.4% is
attributable to better overhead efficiency given the bias of volumes towards the second half. The ratio
of completions first half to second half was 43% to 57%. The remaining 2.7% is attributable to underlying
improvement in performance.
In the US, pre-exceptional operating profit fell to $89.4 million (2005: $206.4 million). Operating
margins for the second half were 12.0% compared to 22.0% in the second half of 2005. Going forward,
considerable action is being taken to focus on the cost base to ameliorate the market impact on
financial performance.
Pre-exceptional Group profit before tax for the second half reduced by 10% to £218.6 million
(H2 2005: £244.2 million).
Financial and Treasury Policies
The Group has financed its growth in recent years through a combination of retained profits, bank loans
and long term loans in the form of US Dollar private placements with a group of US insurance companies.
All loans and banking relationships are managed centrally through the Group Treasury Department.
We continue to use derivatives to generate the appropriate balance between fixed, capped and floating
interest rate profiles. It is not our policy to trade actively in derivatives or to use more complex derivatives.
The Group’s Treasury Committee is responsible for developing and recommending policy to the Board
and for monitoring our finance risks. The main financial risks are liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange
currency risk and credit risk.
Liquidity Risk: The Group maintains adequate committed borrowing facilities to ensure that seasonal
borrowing can be accommodated whilst maintaining prudent headroom and that a range of development
plans can be financed. The Group has committed bank facilities of £1,110 million at the end of 2006. It also
has long term debt raised in the US private placement market of £291 million with maturities ranging up
to 12 years.
Interest Rate Risk: We aim to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the cash interest cost of servicing our
debt by using fixed interest rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and options. The most adverse scenario
for the Group is a significant increase in interest rates which would weaken the housing market at the
same time as increasing borrowing costs.
In order to mitigate this economic risk most effectively, we manage with regard to average forecast
level of borrowings in each currency rather than forecast year end borrowings. This resulted in fixed rate
borrowings slightly above year end borrowings, particularly in Sterling, which is the currency with the
greatest seasonal movement in the amount of borrowing.
We continue to hedge interest rate exposure to reduce the economic impact on the business of interest
rate movements, even if such hedges do not meet the strict prescriptive conditions to adopt hedge
accounting under accounting standard IAS 39. During 2006 the Group’s interest rate derivatives reduced

result of an expected less favourable interest rate environment in the future.
Currency Risk: Our principal currency risk is the translation exposure of our investment in Morrison Homes.
Our policy is to match, as far as practicable, our Dollar denominated assets with Dollar denominated debt.
Consequently movement in the Sterling/Dollar exchange rate has had little effect on the Group’s
shareholders’ funds, though it did affect the Sterling value of year end debt as well as reported revenue
and profit before tax.
Credit Risk: We have no significant concentration of credit risk. Financial counterparties are subject to
pre-approval by the Treasury Committee. The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is
subject to a limit which is reassessed annually.
The Group continues to manage its exposure to the risk related to major inner-city developments by
arranging joint ventures and financing the schemes with non-recourse project risk facilities. All four such
joint ventures are performing satisfactorily and they contributed a total of £7.6 million after tax to Group
profit in 2006.
Pensions
The pension deficit in the 2006 accounts is reported in accordance with IAS 19. The deficit net of deferred
tax at the end of 2006 was £117 million compared to £129 million at the end of 2005. Actuarial
computations under IFRS are designed to satisfy accounting requirements. Full actuarial valuations of the
George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme to determine the adequacy of funding for the Scheme are
undertaken on a triennial basis. The latest full valuation, prepared as at 31 March 2005 showed a gross
deficit of £148 million.
As agreed following the last full valuation, additional contributions totalling £15 million have been made
during the year to help fund the deficit.
Details relating to the Pension Scheme, as presented in the 2006 accounts and the most recent actuarial
valuation, are shown in note 20.
Accounting Standards
The 2006 Annual Report has been produced in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as endorsed and adopted for use in the EU. There have been no new standards issued
during 2006 which materially affect these accounts. The accounts have been prepared on a basis which is
consistent with the accounting policies adopted for 2005.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not effective for 2006 and
therefore have not been applied in preparing these accounts:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial
Statements: Capital Disclosures require extensive disclosures about the significance of financial instruments
for an entity’s financial position and performance, and qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the nature
and extent of risks. IFRS 7 and amended IAS 1 which will be adopted for the Group’s 2007 accounts, will
require additional disclosures with respect to the Group’s financial instruments and share capital.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments addresses the accounting for share-based payment
transactions in which some or all of the goods or services received cannot be specifically identified. IFRIC 8
will become mandatory for the Group’s 2007 accounts, with retrospective application required. The Group
has not yet determined the potential effect of the interpretation.
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment prohibits the reversal of an impairment loss
recognised in a previous interim period in respect of goodwill, an investment in an equity instrument or
a financial asset carried at cost. IFRIC 10 will become mandatory for the Group’s 2007 accounts, and will
apply to goodwill, investments in equity instruments and financial assets carried at cost prospectively
from the date that the Group first applied the measurement criteria of IAS 36 and IAS 39 respectively
(i.e. 1 January 2005). IFRIC 10 is not expected to have any significant impact on the consolidated accounts.
The Group does not consider that any other standards or interpretations issued by the IASB, not yet
applicable, will have any significant impact on the consolidated accounts.

Directors’ Report
The Directors submit to the members their Report and Accounts of the
Company for the year ended 31 December 2006. The Business Review, the
report on Corporate Governance and the Remuneration Report from pages
20, 41 and 44 respectively, form part of this Directors’ Report.
Principal activities and business review
George Wimpey Plc is the holding company of the George Wimpey group
of companies (the “Group”). During 2006 the Group’s principal activities were
in housing and land development which were undertaken mainly under the
George Wimpey and Laing Homes brand names in the UK and under the
Morrison Homes brand in the US. A summary of the results of these activities
is set out in note 1 of the Accounts.
Further details of the Group’s activities and the main factors which could
affect the future development and performance of the Group are set out in
the Chairman’s Statement on pages 6 and 7, the Chief Executive’s Statement
on pages 8 to 10 and the Business Review on pages 20 to 35.
Profit and dividends
The profit for the financial year of £218 million is reported in the Income
Statement on page 52. An interim dividend of 6.3 pence per share, amounting
to £25 million, was paid on 30 October 2006 and the Directors recommend a
final dividend at the rate of 13.1 pence per share amounting to £52.5 million.
As disclosed in note 5, the dividends paid during 2006 include the interim
dividend detailed above and the 2005 final dividend of 11.9 pence per share.
This made a total of 18.2 pence per share or £72.2 million in aggregate.
The Company introduced a scrip dividend scheme in 2002 and this will continue
to operate until the Board determines otherwise. Should shareholders wish to
elect to participate in the scheme, further information is set out on page 84.
Directors
Biographical details of the Board of Directors are shown on page 36 and
further information on the Board is set out on page 41 of the report on
Corporate Governance.
The Articles of Association require one third of the Directors who are subject
to retirement by rotation to retire at each Annual General Meeting with the
Directors due to retire by rotation being those who have been longest in
office since their last appointment or reappointment. In line with the
Combined Code each Director also seeks reappointment every three years.
Accordingly, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting three Directors
will be required to retire by way of rotation: Andrew Carr-Locke, Christine
Cross and Brenda Dean being the longest standing Directors since their
appointment or reappointment will therefore retire and offer themselves
for reappointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. When
proposing the reappointment of the Non Executive Directors, consideration is
given to each Director’s performance and effectiveness. The Company is
pleased to confirm that the two Non Executive Directors seeking reappointment
continue to be effective members of the Board and it has no hesitation in
recommending their reappointment.
Any new directors appointed by the Board since the last Annual General Meeting
must, in accordance with the Articles, seek reappointment at the next Annual
General Meeting and shall not be taken into account in determining the Directors
or the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation as outlined above.
Accordingly, Ian Sutcliffe who was appointed on 11 October 2006 will be
seeking reappointment at the Annual General Meeting.

On appointment/resignation
Interests of the Directors in options over the shares of the Company are
shown on page 49.
There has been no change in the interests of the Directors between
31 December 2006 and the date of signing of the accounts, 21 February 2007.
Share capital
At the 2006 Annual General Meeting authority was given to the Company
to purchase up to a maximum of 10% of its own shares. This authority expires
at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, at which a
special resolution will be proposed to renew the authority for a further year.
The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority but will,
as is its practice, keep the matter under review. Purchases will only be made
if the Directors consider that they are in the best interests of shareholders
generally and if the purchase(s) could be expected to result in an increase
in earnings per share after taking into account other available investment
opportunities. In exercising this authority, the Board may cancel the shares
that have been bought back or hold them in treasury (or a combination of
both). Holding bought back shares in treasury provides the Company with
the ability to sell or transfer them quickly and cost effectively and also
provides flexibility in using such shares for employee schemes. If any such
shares are used, the Company will, so long as required under the guidelines
of the Association of British Insurers Investment Committee, count them
towards the limits in the schemes as if they were newly issued shares.
Options were outstanding as at 9 February 2007 to subscribe for a total
number of 6,720,918 ordinary shares, or 1.68% of the issued share capital.
If the authority to purchase shares is ever used in full (and the purchased
shares cancelled), the proportion of issued share capital represented by
this figure would be 1.86%.
An ordinary resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to
authorise the Directors, in accordance with section 80 of the Companies Act
1985, to allot shares in the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount of
£33,411,497 for a further one year to the 2008 Annual General Meeting. Prior
to 2006, this authority was renewed annually for successive periods of five
years (as is permitted by the Act) and this change in practice followed the
Company’s consultation with RREV (Research, Recommendations and
Electronic Voting).

WP100_p38-40_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:08  Page 38 A special resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to
enable the Directors to allot shares for cash by way of rights issue, scrip
dividend or in an amount equal to, but not more than £5,011,724, in
aggregate of the nominal value of the Company’s issued share capital,
without regard to the pre-emption rights of the Companies Act.
Employee share schemes
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme for all of its
UK employees who have been employed by the Group for a minimum of
six months and an Executive Share Option Scheme for all UK regional board
directors and certain designated senior management. The limit that may be
issued under each scheme is the lower of 20,000,000 or 5% of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company.
Options were granted during the year over 1,002,233 shares at 385.4 pence
under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
Options were granted during the year over 543,822 shares at 537.67 pence
and 580,763 shares at 505.5 pence under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The number of options outstanding at 31 December 2006 under the Savings
Related Share Option Scheme was 3,497,192, exercisable between now and
2012 at between 156 pence and 385.4 pence per share and, for the Executive
Share Option Scheme, 3,785,293, exercisable between now and 2016 at
246.25 pence to 537.67 pence per share. The number of options outstanding
under both schemes was 7,282,485 of which 0.13% are in relation to the
Executive Directors.
Until 2000, the George Wimpey Plc Executive Incentive Scheme required
participants to invest part of their annual cash bonus in shares of the
Company to be held in trust. As at 31 December 2006, the Trust held a
total of 2,392 shares with a market value of approximately £13,359. Under
the Scheme shares were to be retained for three or five years and were
then matched by 50% and 75% respectively. This Scheme will close during
2007 when all outstanding obligations will be met. No Directors participate
in the Scheme.

As at 20 January 2007 the Company’s register of substantial shareholdings as
notified under section 198 of the Companies Act 1985 showed the following
interests in 3% or more of the Company’s shares.

Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy and practice, for itself and its businesses, is to agree in
advance the terms and conditions for business transactions with suppliers
and sub-contractors. Payment is generally made on this basis, subject to terms
and conditions being met by the suppliers and sub-contractors. The number
of creditor days as at 31 December 2006 was 23 days (2005: 26 days).
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 December 2006.
Research and development
George Wimpey continues to employ both traditional and innovative
approaches to construction, taking into account the needs for safe working
practices, customer satisfaction, good design and build efficiency.
During 2006 the Company further strengthened its commitment to advancing
its construction methods by continuous improvement and trialling of new
methods and products. These consisted of both incremental changes to our
current practices and wider changes to build methodology. They included
masonry products, flooring systems and scaffoldless building techniques which
improved safety and reduced costs.
However, the Company continues to be cautious about making wholesale
changes to construction methods until new technologies are tried and tested.
The Board formally reviews production technology initiatives taking place
in both the UK and the US on an annual basis and receives presentations
made by the Managing Director of George Wimpey UK and the President
of Morrison Homes.
Employee involvement and communication
As in previous years, the Company is committed to ensuring open and
regular communication throughout the Group on both business related
issues and issues of general interest. The intranet is continually updated
thereby providing a valuable communication tool across the Group and an
important facility for providing all employees with access to a wide range
of information. We continue to cascade information widely throughout
the business supported by management presentations. In 2005 Employee
Consultative Committees were introduced in all of our UK businesses and
elected representatives ensure that employee suggestions and business
changes are well communicated.
During the year the Board continued its practice of visiting local businesses
in both the UK and US, meeting staff on site and in regional offices. The
Board spent time with staff at all levels and discussed a range of topics
related to their businesses. In addition, Directors carry out regular visits
to all parts of the business and hold informal discussions with employees,
helping them to better understand the Company’s objectives, and listen
to feedback from employees on any issues and concerns they may have.
The Company produces an internal quarterly magazine for all employees
across the Group called ‘In House’ . The magazine, edited independently,
receives contributions from all businesses and aims to keep staff informed
of new developments and initiatives, employee and business issues as well
as social events and employee achievements, including charity related work
and fundraising. A magazine is also produced twice a year for company
pensioners called ‘In Touch’ .
The Company’s Savings Related Share Option Scheme was again made
available to all employees with over six months’ service and was taken up by
1,114 employees. The Company encourages participation in the Scheme and
it intends to make a further issue in 2007. Under this Scheme, employees
may acquire shares, at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of the
grant of options, in three or five years’ time depending upon the election
made at the commencement of the savings contract.

Directors’ Report continued
Equal opportunities
The Company continues to be committed to equality of opportunity in
all its employment practices, policies and procedures across the Group.
To this end, within the framework of the law, we are committed, wherever
practicable, to achieving and maintaining a workforce which broadly reflects
that of the local catchment area within which we operate. No employee or
potential employee will receive less favourable treatment due to their race,
creed, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, political or other opinion,
affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, family connections, age,
membership or non membership of a trade union, or disability unless
justifiable, for example due to health and safety considerations.
Employment of disabled persons
Our policy is that people with disabilities should have fair consideration
for all vacancies within the Group. The Company is therefore committed,
where possible, to ensuring that people with disabilities are supported and
encouraged to apply for employment and to achieve progress once employed.
They will be treated so that they have an equal opportunity, so far as it is
justifiable, to be selected, trained and promoted. Every reasonable effort is
made to enable disabled persons to be retained in the employment of the
Company by investigating the possibility of making reasonable adjustments
to the job, workplace or equipment.
Charitable contributions
Contributions for charitable purposes were made during the year amounting
to £469,661 (2005: £546,532). The Charitable Contributions Committee is an
executive committee chaired by Andrew Carr-Locke and consists of Corporate,
UK and US personnel. It considers the charitable activity of the Company in
general and also monitors both UK and US charitable contributions on a
quarterly basis. Donations are made in accordance with the policy laid down
by the Board and the guidelines adopted by the Committee.
The Company operates a National Charity Scheme in which charities are
proposed by employees. The chosen charities benefit from numerous
fundraising events organised within the Company including the annual national
five-a-side football tournament. Since April 2006 the benefiting charities have
been the Children’s Heart Federation and Macmillan Cancer Support. The
Company intends to continue these partnerships until 31 December 2007.
The Company has a policy of making no political donations.
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The Directors prepare the Annual Report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union. The Directors are responsible
for preparing financial statements for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the
profit or loss of the Group for that year. The Directors are also responsible for
preparing the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. In preparing the financial statements, appropriate
accounting policies have been used and applied consistently, and reasonable
and prudent judgements and estimates have been made. The financial
statements are prepared in accordance with relevant applicable accounting
standards. The Directors are responsible for maintaining adequate
accounting records, for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for
preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities.
A copy of the financial statements of the Company is placed on the George
Wimpey Plc website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk). Executive management
is responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website.
Information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with
different legal requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions and third parties in such jurisdictions should
take their own legal or professional advice as appropriate.
Indemnities
The Company maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers. At the
2006 Annual General Meeting a resolution was passed to amend the Articles
of Association to reflect current law on directors’ indemnities as set out in
the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004
which allows the Company to fund directors’ expenditure in defending legal
proceedings by way of a loan, which is repayable if the proceedings are not
ultimately decided in the Director’s favour.
Audit information
The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the auditors are unaware and that each Director has
taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution
for the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and to authorise
the Audit Committee to determine their remuneration, will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance
Introduction
The Board is fully committed to high standards of corporate governance
and corporate responsibility throughout the Group. The Board supports the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“Combined Code”) as published
in July 2003 and updated in June 2006. The Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority require the Company to include a statement to allow
shareholders to evaluate how it has applied the principles and provisions of
good governance as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code. This Report,
together with the information set out in the Remuneration Report on pages
44 to 50, is published pursuant to the Combined Code which deals with
directors, directors’ remuneration, relations with and accountability to
shareholders and the audit of the company. Together, the two Reports are
intended to explain how the Company has applied the principles in Section 1
of the Combined Code and provide an insight into how the Board and
management run the business for the benefit of shareholders.
Statement of compliance
As a result of the Company adopting early one of the principal changes
of the 2006 Combined Code, which lifted the restriction on a company
chairman serving on the remuneration committee, John Robinson, who was
considered independent on his appointment as Chairman, was appointed
to the Remuneration Committee on 18 October 2006. This was ahead of
the date on which the Financial Reporting Council recommended that
companies should voluntarily adopt the the 2006 Combined Code, namely
1 November 2006. Otherwise, the Board considers that it has complied with
the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year.
The principal changes of the 2006 Combined Code are as set out below:
– to amend the existing restriction on the company chairman serving on the
remuneration committee to enable him or her to do so where considered
independent on appointment as chairman;
– to provide a ‘vote withheld’ option on proxy appointment forms to enable
shareholders to indicate if they have reservations on a resolution but do not
wish to vote against; and
– to recommend that companies publish on their website the details of proxies
lodged at a general meeting where votes are taken on a show of hands.
As a matter of best practice, for a number of years, the Company had already
complied with the second and third changes set out above.
During the year a formal whistleblowing procedure was put in place across
the Morrison Homes business. Whistleblowing is a standing item on the
agenda of each meeting of the Audit Committee, at which time the
Committee reviews the whistleblowing procedures in place across the
Group in line with the Combined Code.
The Board of Directors
On 1 January 2007, the Board consisted of the Chairman (John Robinson),
the Group Chief Executive (Peter Redfern), three other Executive Directors
and five independent Non Executive Directors.
As announced on 21 February 2006, Peter Johnson stood down from the
Board as Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2006 and was succeeded by Peter
Redfern with effect from 1 July 2006. Peter Redfern was a director of the
Company throughout the year and held the post of Deputy Group Chief
Executive with effect from 21 February 2006 to 30 June 2006 and prior to
that had been Chief Executive of the George Wimpey UK business.
Andrew Carr-Locke is the Group Finance Director and held that position
throughout the year. Steve Parker is the President of Morrison Homes and
was appointed to the Board on 1 January 2006. Ian Sutcliffe joined the
Company in February 2006 as Managing Director of George Wimpey UK
and was appointed to the Board on 11 October 2006.
Throughout the year, in line with the Combined Code, excluding the Chairman,
at least half of the Board comprised independent Non Executive Directors.
A list of Directors and details of their biographies is set out on page 36. David
Williams, Christine Cross, Brenda Dean, Anthony Reading and Robert Sharpe
were independent Non Executive Directors throughout the year.
The business and management of the Company is the collective responsibility
of the whole Board. At each meeting the Board reviews the performance of
each of its trading businesses in detail and during each year it undertakes a
comprehensive strategic review. There is a formal written schedule of matters
reserved for consideration and approval by the Board and these include the
annual budget, major land purchases and investment proposals, the approval
of annual and interim results and a review of the overall system of internal
control and risk management. The Board has formal clearly defined terms of
reference which take into account the requirements of the Combined Code
and which can be found on the George Wimpey Plc website
(www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk).
There are four standing Board Committees: Nomination, Audit, Corporate
Social Responsibility and Remuneration. Each Board Committee operates
within its clearly defined terms of reference and reports back to the Board
at the next Board Meeting. Membership of these Committees is reviewed
regularly with a view to ensuring that the expertise and background of each
Director is used to the best advantage of the Company and the need to
refresh Committee membership as appropriate.
During 2006 the Board met formally, as a whole, ten times. Twice yearly the
Board spends time with a business unit in the UK and the US which consists
of site visits, presentations from local management and also provides the
opportunity for the Board to meet employees both on site and in the host
regional office.
During the year, there were no absences from any Board meetings by
any Director.
In line with the Combined Code, the Board considers that an independent
Director is one who is independent in character and judgement and where
there are no relationships or circumstances which could affect the Director’s
judgement. Based on this criteria the Board is fully satisfied that each of its
Non Executive Directors is independent and has acted accordingly throughout
the year. In line with the Combined Code, there will be a rigorous review of
any Non Executive Director wishing to hold office for more than six years
with such review also taking into account the need for progressive refreshing
of the Board. The Board is of the view that the Non Executive Directors play
an important role in upholding corporate governance and in ensuring that
no individual or group dominates the Board’s decision making process. In
achieving this, the independence of Non Executive Directors is vital.
The Chairman, at the time of his appointment, met the indepence criteria
set out in paragraph A.3.1 of the Combined Code.
The roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive are separately
held and have been throughout the year. There is a clear division of
responsibilities between each position which is documented. In brief,
the Chairman is responsible for the working of the Board and all matters
relating to it including its balance and composition (subject to Board
and shareholder approval) and for effective shareholder communications.
The Group Chief Executive is responsible for the management of the
Group and its businesses. He develops the strategy for Board approval
and is then responsible for its implementation.
David Williams is the Senior Independent Director appointed in line with
the Combined Code and has held that position throughout the year. In line
with the Combined Code, the Senior Independent Director provides an
additional contact point for shareholders if they have reason for concern
for which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Group Chief
Executive or Group Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which
contact is inappropriate.
The Articles of Association require one third of the Directors who are subject
to retirement by rotation to retire at each Annual General Meeting with the
Directors due to retire by rotation being those who have been longest
in office since their last appointment or reappointment. In line with the
Combined Code each Director also seeks reappointment every three years.
Accordingly, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting three Directors will
be required to retire by way of rotation: Andrew Carr-Locke, Christine Cross and
Brenda Dean being the longest standing Directors since their appointment
or reappointment, will therefore retire and offer themselves for
reappointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Any new Directors appointed by the Board since the last Annual General
Meeting must, in accordance with the Articles, seek reappointment at
the next Annual General Meeting and shall not be taken into account
in determining the Directors or the number of Directors who are to retire by
rotation as outlined above. Accordingly, Ian Sutcliffe who was appointed
on 11 October 2006 will be seeking reappointment at the Annual General
Meeting. Steve Parker was appointed by the Board during the year and
was reappointed by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
An induction programme is provided for new directors which includes
the provision of a comprehensive set of background information on
the Group including its corporate governance policies and procedures.
Where appropriate, newly appointed directors are also provided with the
opportunity of attending a training course on the role and responsibilities
of being a director in a public limited company.

Corporate Governance continued
Formal agendas and reports for Board and Committee meetings are
provided to Directors one week prior to the meeting, thus allowing
sufficient time for detailed review and consideration of the documents
beforehand. The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive maintain regular
contact with all Directors. James Jordan is the Group Company Secretary
and General Counsel (“Secretary”) and he attends all Board and Board
Committee meetings (Nomination, Remuneration, Corporate Social
Responsibility and Audit). All Directors have direct access to the Secretary
for advice and services. The Secretary is responsible for ensuring that the
correct procedures are followed at all Board and Committee meetings.
He reports directly to the Chairman and also to the Group Chief Executive.
The Board has adopted a procedure whereby any Director may seek,
through the office of the Secretary, independent professional advice,
at the Company’s expense, in furtherance of his or her duties.
The collective performance of the Board and its Committees has been
reviewed annually for a number of years. This year, the process was enhanced
by the use of a non attributable questionnaire designed to ensure open and
constructive feedback. As part of this Board evaluation, each individual
Director’s performance was also reviewed.
In line with the Combined Code, the Chairman holds meetings with the
Non Executive Directors without any Executive Director present. In addition,
the Non Executive Directors meet at least once a year without the Chairman
present to discuss his performance.
Board Committees
Nomination Committee
Current Members: John Robinson (Committee Chair), Peter Redfern, David
Williams, Christine Cross, Brenda Dean, Anthony Reading and Robert Sharpe.
Peter Johnson was a member of this Committee until 30 June 2006 when
he stood down as a Director. Peter Redfern became a member of this
Committee on 1 July 2006.
Throughout the year and in line with the Combined Code, the Committee
has been made up of a majority of independent Non Executive Directors.
The Committee meets as and when necessary to consider the appointment
of new Executive and Non Executive Directors. The Committee adopts a
rigorous process for the appointment of new directors, involving the use
of external recruitment consultants followed by meetings with both the
Committee and subsequently with the Board as a whole and the Secretary.
This ensures that the selection process is formal, objective and based on merit.
The Committee has formal terms of reference. It meets as and when required,
for example with regard to proposed appointments to the Board and at least
once a year to comprehensively review succession planning at both Board
and senior management level across the Group.
In line with the Combined Code, it also reviews the Board structure, size,
composition and time commitments required from each Non Executive
Director and through this keeps under review the balance of membership
and the blend of skills, knowledge and experience that is required.
During the year, the Committee formally met on two occasions principally
to consider Board changes and also to review succession planning. There
were no absences.
Audit Committee
Current Members: Anthony Reading (Committee Chair), David Williams,
Brenda Dean and Robert Sharpe.
All of the above were members of the Committee throughout the year.
The Committee consists of four independent Non Executive Directors
including Anthony Reading and David Williams both of whom the Board
is satisfied have recent and relevant financial experience, in line with
the Combined Code: Anthony Reading is a Chartered Accountant and has
substantial operational experience in the UK and the US; David Williams has
substantial corporate and financial experience and was until 31 January 2006,
Group Finance Director of Bunzl plc. The Chairman, Group Chief Executive,
Group Finance Director and senior management attend Committee
meetings for specific items at the invitation of the Committee Chair.
The Committee routinely meets with PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”),
the Company’s auditors, without any operational management present.
The Committee has formal terms of reference which are available on
our website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk). It receives reports from PwC,
the Internal Audit Department and also from senior management at
each meeting.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the external audit process
and for monitoring the effectiveness of internal controls. It also considers
major accounting issues. The Committee supports the Board in reviewing
information which is sent to shareholders to ensure that it presents a
balanced assessment of the Company’s position. In addition, the Committee
reviews the performance and objectivity of PwC, the scope of its work and
that of the Company’s Internal Audit Department. It also reviews the fees to
be paid to PwC for both audit and non audit related work.
During the year the Committee formally met on four occasions and there
were no absences.
Corporate Social Responsibility Committee
Current Members: Christine Cross (Committee Chair), Brenda Dean and Steve
Parker (who were members throughout the year) and Ian Sutcliffe (who
became a member with effect from 1 July 2006 in place of Peter Redfern).
The Committee has formal terms of reference which can be found on
the George Wimpey Plc website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk) and is
responsible for setting the Company’s CSR strategy and policies and for
performance monitoring and reporting against identified Key Performance
Indicators, including those relating to Health and Safety, Environment,
Customer Care, Supply Chain Management, Employees and the Community.
The Committee also highlights and reports on environmental, social and
governance issues and opportunities for the attention of the Board. The
2006 CSR Report entitled ‘Building a Sustainable Future’ has been sent to
all shareholders and many of our stakeholders, including suppliers, local
authorities, Governmental departments and regulatory bodies. The report
is also made available to all employees of the Group via the intranet or in
hard copy if preferred. In addition, the Report can be found on the George
Wimpey Plc website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk). The Company’s
approach to CSR is also summarised on pages 30 to 31 of this Annual Report.
During the year the Committee met on four occasions and there was only
one absence when Ian Sutcliffe was unable to attend a meeting in December
due to being engaged on other Company business.
Remuneration Committee
Current Members: David Williams (Committee Chair), John Robinson
Christine Cross, Anthony Reading and Robert Sharpe.
John Robinson was appointed to the Committee on 18 October 2006.
Details of the Remuneration Committee and its policies are set out in the
Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 50. The Committee has formal terms
of reference which can be found on the George Wimpey Plc website
(www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk).
During the year the Committee met on six occasions. There were no
absences by any member who was a member of the Committee as at the
time of each meeting.
Relations with shareholders and investors
During the year, the Company has continued to maintain an active investor
relations programme, encouraging constructive two-way communication
with investors, fund managers and analysts. Presentations are given at the
time of both preliminary and interim results and at the Annual General
Meeting. The Company has a well established cycle of communication
based on the Group’s financial reporting calendar. Video webcasts of results
presentations along with the full question and answer sessions and audio
webcasts of trading statement conference calls are made publicly available
on the George Wimpey Plc website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk).
During 2006, Non Executive Directors were present at both the Company’s
preliminary and interim results presentations where, in line with the
Combined Code, they were available to meet with shareholders. The Company
makes full use of its website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk) to provide
information for shareholders and others interested in George Wimpey as an
investment opportunity. Our registrars (LloydsTSB) have also developed
www.shareview.co.uk; an electronic service where shareholders can review
their shareholding, vote on resolutions and update their personal details.
During the year, the Group Chief Executive and other Executive Directors
carried out an extensive programme of meetings with institutional
shareholders and investors throughout the year following guidance issued by
the Financial Services Authority. Meetings were held in London, Edinburgh,
Dublin, Paris, New York and Boston and the Company will consider other
visits as appropriate or requested. The Company also hosted analyst events
during the year.

the announcement of the Company’s preliminary and interim results.
The Company’s joint brokers, JP Morgan Cazenove and ABN Amro Hoare
Govett, attend Board meetings to provide feedback on the shareholder
surveys that they each carry out following the publication of the Company’s
results and subsequent meetings with shareholders.
The Company is pleased to welcome private and institutional shareholders
to its Annual General Meeting which it regards as an important forum for the
Board to engage with shareholders. The Chairman and the Group Chief
Executive use the Meeting as an opportunity to make presentations on the
business. The Board will be present at the Meeting to answer questions and
will be available both prior to and after the Meeting for discussions with
shareholders. The result of the voting on each resolution will be declared at
the Meeting and will also be announced publicly afterwards in line with
best practice and the recent changes made to the Combined Code.
Accountability and audit
The Board believes that the financial statements and reviews contained
within this document present a balanced and understandable assessment
of the Company’s performance and prospects. The sound system of internal
control within the Company enables the Board to make this statement.
The Audit Committee has a firm policy of not using the Company’s auditor
for non audit work if this could jeopardise the ability of the auditor to provide
an independent and objective audit opinion. However, in certain cases the
use of PwC for non audit work may make it more timely and cost effective
due to the firm’s knowledge of the Group. Following a competitive tender
process, which is designed to ensure the best provider is selected, PwC
currently carries out routine tax compliance work. PwC also assists the
Company with International Financial Reporting Standards. The Committee
takes the view that carrying out this non audit work does not affect
PwC’s objectivity or independence. In addition, PwC is subject to its own
professional standards which safeguards the integrity of the auditing role
performed on behalf of shareholders. Details of the fees paid to PwC in
2006 are set out in note 2.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The implementation and maintenance
of the risk management and internal control systems are the responsibility
of the Executive Directors and senior management. It is recognised that the
system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. Consequently, it can only provide
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The system has been in place throughout the period and is reviewed within
the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control on an annual basis.
The Board has reviewed in detail the areas of major risk that the Group
faces in its business and operations and the key risks that are identified are
documented in the Group Risk Register. The review includes a review of
significant environmental, social and governance matters relevant to the
business and operations of the Group. The Group Risk Register is also
monitored throughout the year for ongoing relevance by the Executive
Committee. Specific key operational risks and the procedures and policies
that are in place around them that are reviewed include: land purchase,
health and safety, environmental matters, financial and data control, IT
systems, succession planning, corporate governance, national and local
governmental matters and product quality. The Board, following its review,
is satisfied with the process in place for risk identification, evaluation and
management. It is satisfied with current control mechanisms and reporting
lines that have been in place throughout the year and the programme of
continuous improvement initiatives that has been implemented.
The Group seeks to maintain high standards of business conduct and
operates under an established internal control framework which is
described below.
Organisational structure
The Group operates through a number of operating businesses, each with its
own management board. Clear reporting lines and delegated authorities are
in place. The management and monitoring of risk and performance occurs
at multiple levels throughout the Group and the use of interactive review
processes provides successive assurance through the levels of management
up to the Board.
Land purchase and investment appraisal
There are clearly defined policies and procedures for the purchase of land
and for capital expenditure. These include detailed appraisal and review
requirements and due diligence procedures which incorporate a detailed
environmental appraisal of land prior to acquisition. These procedures are
subject to rigorous review and authorisation.
Development activity
There is an established framework for managing and controlling all site
related activity. This includes extensive health and safety procedures, regular
performance monitoring and clear accountability on customer satisfaction.
Operational and financial reporting
There is a developed budgeting system with an annual budget approved by
the Board. Profit and cash forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a monthly
basis. The performance of each business is reviewed monthly by Divisional
and Group management and subsequently reported to the Board against
both budget and forecast. Particular emphasis is placed on cash flow and
forecasting, as well as income statement and balance sheet reporting, and
on key operating issues including health and safety and environmental matters.
Treasury
The principal treasury related risks, decisions and control processes are
documented. The Treasury Committee, consisting of Andrew Carr-Locke
(Committee Chair) and the Group Chief Executive, Group Treasurer and Head
of Tax, meets quarterly to consider treasury related issues, decisions and
control processes. The Committee has terms of reference.
All of the above internal controls have been in place during the year and
are subject to ongoing review. Internal Audit supports the Audit Committee,
the Executive Directors and senior management by independently and
objectively reviewing the effectiveness of risk management and the control
environment. The Internal Audit methodology is aligned to the key elements
of the Group’s internal control framework. All reviews are formally followed up
to ensure agreed actions have been implemented. The results of all Internal
Audit reviews are categorised according to the outcome of the review and
are presented and discussed in detail at the Audit Committee. Internal Audit
reviews are also discussed at Executive Committee meetings which take
place generally on a weekly basis in addition to regular monthly meetings.
The Executive Committee consists of Peter Redfern (Committee Chair),
Andrew Carr-Locke, Steve Parker, Ian Sutcliffe and James Jordan. Internal
Audit reviews are also discussed at Divisional executive meetings of George
Wimpey UK and Morrison Homes.
Going concern
The Directors are required under the Financial Services Authority’s Listing
Rules and the Combined Code to have satisfied themselves as to the Group’s
ability to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. A review has been
carried out and the Directors have concluded that the Group has adequate
resources and is justified in using the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.

Remuneration Report
Introduction and compliance
In preparing this Remuneration Report to shareholders, the Remuneration
Committee has followed the requirements of Section 1 of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (“Combined Code”). This Report complies
with the Companies Act 1985, as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (“Regulations”) and the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority. Pursuant to the Regulations, this Report is being put
to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held
on 26 April 2007. Part I of the Report consists of unaudited information.
Part II consists of audited information.
PART I: UNAUDITED INFORMATION
The Remuneration Committee
Current members: David Williams (Committee Chair), Christine Cross,
Anthony Reading and Robert Sharpe were all members of the Remuneration
Committee throughout the year. The Chairman of the Board, John Robinson,
was appointed to the Committee on 18 October 2006. The Committee met
on six occasions during the year and there were no absences by any member
who was a member of the Committee as at the date of the relevant meeting.
The Committee recommends to the Board the remuneration framework
to attract and retain its Executive Directors. In line with the Combined Code,
it also monitors and makes recommendations on remuneration for the level
of senior management below the Board in both the UK and the US.
The Committee, having taken independent advice, also reviews the Chairman’s
fees on an annual basis before making a recommendation to the Board for
approval all of which is considered in his absence.
Consultants
The Remuneration Committee keeps itself fully informed of developments
and best practice in the field of remuneration and it seeks advice from external
advisers when it considers it appropriate to do so. Mercer Human Resource
Consulting (“Mercer”) were appointed by the Committee in July 2005 and
has advised the Committee on Directors’ remuneration matters throughout
the year. Mercer also provides advice to the Trustees of the George Wimpey
Staff Pension Scheme. Independent legal advice is sought by the Committee
as and when required.
During the year, the people listed below provided material advice or services
to assist the Committee in its decision making except in relation to their own
individual remuneration:
John Robinson – Chairman (became a member on 18 October 2006)
Peter Redfern – in his role as Group Chief Executive from 1 July 2006
Peter Johnson – as Group Chief Executive to 30 June 2006
James Jordan – Group Company Secretary and General Counsel
Anna Edgeworth – Group Human Resources Director
Maria Pilfold – UK Human Resources Director (Group Human Resources
Director with effect from 1 January 2007).
Policy and philosophy
During the year, the Committee has operated in accordance with the following
remuneration philosophy which was implemented with effect from the start of
the year:
• George Wimpey’s global compensation and benefits programmes must
help attract, retain and motivate the people needed to achieve the
Company’s strategic objectives.
• George Wimpey is committed to fostering a performance culture to
increase shareholder value and to establish George Wimpey as the
leading housebuilder in the markets in which it operates.
• A significant portion of each Executive Director’s total compensation
should be delivered through performance related pay.
• Incentives should only be capable of providing upper quartile pay
if outstanding performance is achieved.
• Alternative compensation programme designs and pay levels will be
considered for UK and US employees so as to remain competitive with
the local market (subject to shareholder approval or consultation as
appropriate).
The Committee continually reviews its remuneration strategy to ensure that
the Company is in the best possible position to attract and retain highly
skilled and motivated people who will be key to ensuring the long term
success of George Wimpey.
Last year we reported that Steve Parker would no longer participate in the
George Wimpey Long Term Incentive Plan (“George Wimpey LTIP”). During
the year the Committee reviewed this policy further and it is proposed that
Steve Parker should participate in the George Wimpey LTIP for 2007 and
for future years as it is felt appropriate that as a Director he should have
a substantial part of his remuneration closely aligned with the interests
of shareholders.
Accordingly, it is proposed that for 2007, Steve Parker is conditionally
awarded shares under the George Wimpey LTIP equivalent to up to 2x his
base salary with the balance of his multiple (1.5x) awarded under a new
Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive Plan (“New Three Year Morrison Homes
LTIP”). Following consultation with our major shareholders and shareholder
bodies, it is proposed that the New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP will be
based on a three year performance period compared to the one year
peformance period which applies under the current Morrison Homes Long
Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in 2003. Approval will therefore
be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for the New Three
Year Morrison Homes LTIP which will apply to the President of Morrison
Homes based on three year performance periods and revised perfomance
conditions. Further details relating to the proposed New Three Year Morrison
Homes LTIP are set out on page 46 and also in the Notice of Meeting section
and the Appendix thereto on pages 79 to 82.
For 2007, the Company is making a change to the Group incentive scheme
through the introduction of challenging personal targets of up to 25% of the
incentive opportunity for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
The targets will be set annually by the Remuneration Committee and will be
clearly defined and measureable. Further details are set out on page 45.
The chart above shows the proportion of fixed to performance based
remuneration for 2006 and 2007. Fixed remuneration comprises the annual
salary and pension allowance which are shown separately. Performance
based remuneration comprises an annual cash bonus and a long term
incentive plan. The chart illustrates the mix of remuneration assuming
target levels of annual bonuses are met and the annualised expected
value of long term incentive provision. It is the policy of the Remuneration
Committee that a significant portion of each Director’s total compensation
is delivered through performance related pay in order to align their risks
and rewards with those of the Company’s shareholders.
Non Executive Director positions
The Company encourages and facilitates its Executive Directors to take on
Non Executive positions with other listed public limited companies, provided
that such positions are held within the requirements of the Combined Code
and have been approved in advance by the Company. Executive Directors
are permitted by the Company to retain their earnings from such positions.
During the year, Andrew Carr-Locke was an independent Non Executive
Director of AWG Plc and received fees amounting to £35,000 of which £3,438
was paid by way of shares in that company. During the year Peter Johnson,
who resigned as a Director of the Company on 30 June 2006, was an
independent Non Executive Director of DS Smith Plc and received fees
from that company of £20,000 to that date.

The salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration
Committee and changes are normally effective from 1 January. The Company
obtains independent advice from Mercer in respect of each review. Peter
Redfern’s salary was also reviewed by the Committee as at 21 February 2006
and 1 July 2006 to reflect his appointment to the posts of Deputy Chief
Executive and Group Chief Executive respectively. Base salaries are targeted
to be generally at the median of identified compensation peer groups as
described below which is considered by the Committee to be at an
appropriate level to attract and retain high calibre executives in a
competitive market place. When setting and reviewing base salaries,
the Committee also takes into consideration a number of other factors
including breadth of experience, responsibility and overall performance.
The compensation pay groups for the year consisted of other large listed
housebuilders as well as other FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies with similar
market capitalisation and revenues to that of the Company. For the position
of President of Morrison Homes the factors that were taken into account
during the year were as set out above except that the Committee takes into
account the level of salaries in other US housebuilders.
For 2007, following a review carried out by the Committee in conjuction
with Mercer, revised compensation peer groups for both UK and US based
Directors will be introduced to benchmark salaries against a group of
peers with a closer alignment to the Company in terms of sales, assets and
market capitalisation. The Committee will also take into account levels of
remuneration in place within the housebuilding sector. With regard to the
US, the review has identifed a group of housebuilders which are as closely
aligned to Morrison Homes as possible and benchmarking will take place
with Steve Parker at the appropriate level within such organisations. The
Committee will also continue to have regard to breadth of experience,
responsibility and performance as appropriate when considering the
salaries of Executive Directors.
Bonus schemes
Group
Peter Redfern and Andrew Carr-Locke participated in the Group annual
incentive scheme which is based upon achieving stretching Group profit
before tax (“PBT”) targets which are set by the Remuneration Committee each
year having regard to the applicable budget for the Group as approved by
the Board.
Under the scheme, 60% of base salary is payable for achieving target
performance with a maximum bonus payable for exceptional performance
of 150% of base salary, which the Remuneration Committee considers will
be very demanding to achieve.
With regard to Peter Redfern, the Committee decided to divide the
performance period to reflect the fact that during the first half of the year
he managed the George Wimpey UK business prior to his appointment as
Group Chief Executive on 1 July 2006. Therefore his bonus will be made up
of 50% of his overall bonus opportunity for each period and has been
calculated as set out below:
1 Jan to 30 June 1 Jul to 31 Dec
Relevant Performance The performance The performance of
of the George Wimpey George Wimpey Plc
UK business for the year for the year as a
as whole (UK scheme) whole (Group scheme)
Salary Definition Actual salary for Actual salary for the
the first 6 months second 6 months
of the year of the year
For the 2006 Group annual incentive scheme, the Remuneration Committee
required the 2006 PBT outcome to show growth over the 2005 PBT before
any bonus could become payable. Based on the 2006 pre-exceptional PBT
outcome of £370.9 million a bonus of 10.5% of his overall bonus opportunity
became payable to Peter Redfern. This element of his bonus will be applied
to Peter Redfern’s base salary for the second half of the year only.
Similarly the Remuneration Committee required the UK business’s 2006 PBIT
outcome to show growth over the 2005 UK PBIT. Based on the 2006 PBIT and
on targets relating to volume of houses sold, the number of plots achieved
with planning permission and customer care, a bonus of 130% of his overall
bonus opportunity became payable to Peter Redfern which will be applied to
his base salary for the first half of the year only.
Peter Redfern’s total bonus for the year amounted to 70.25% of his bonus
opportunity. In line with the bonus deferral plan introduced last year and
described below, half of Peter Redfern’s total bonus will be deferred into
shares for three years.
The arrangements described above with regard to Peter Redfern were
discussed with major shareholders and shareholder bodies and received
favourable feedback.
With regard to Andrew Carr-Locke, based on the 2006 Group PBT outcome
as set out above, a bonus of 10.5% of his overall bonus opportunity became
payable, half of which has been deferred into shares for three years.
For 2007, the Company is proposing to make a change to the Group
incentive scheme through the introduction of personal targets of up to 25% of
the incentive opportunity for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director. Whilst the key measure going forward will continue to be meeting
stretching Group PBT targets, the Committee feels that in order to achieve
the highest possible performance in designated key areas, including those that
may not have an immediate financial impact on the business, specific and
challenging personal targets will be set annually by the Committee for
each Director. The targets will be clearly defined and measurable.
Retrospective disclosure on the personal bonus element in respect of each
relevant Director will be included in the next Remuneration Report.
UK
As Managing Director of the George Wimpey UK business, Ian Sutcliffe
participated in an annual incentive scheme based on stretching targets
which are established each year by the Remuneration Committee. These
targets specifically relate to the UK business and consist of: profit before tax
and interest, volume of houses sold, the number of plots achieved with
planning permission and customer care. The maximum bonus opportunity
under this scheme for Ian Sutcliffe was 150%. As a result of the performance
of the UK business against the above targets during 2006, a bonus of 130%
of base salary became payable to Ian Sutcliffe. The deferral requirement
(as described below), which was not in place at the time of his recruitment,
will apply to Ian Sutcliffe with respect to future bonus payments.
The incentive payments made in respect of Peter Redfern, Andrew Carr-Locke
and Ian Sutcliffe are set out in the table on page 48.
UK based Executive Directors are required to defer 50% of any bonus paid
into shares in the Company which will be held in trust for three years. There
is no share matching of the deferred shares but the shares will accrue any
dividends earned during the the retention period and these will be paid
upon release of the shares to the Director. Subject to the rules that apply
to the deferral, shares will not normally be receivable should the Director
leave the employment of the Company during the deferral period.
US
Steve Parker participated in an annual incentive scheme which is specifically
tailored and linked to the performance and growth of Morrison Homes. The
scheme is based on a number of stretching targets which are set each year
by the Remuneration Committee. The bonus is capped at 350% and is based
on stretching targets relating to return on capital employed, operating
margin, growth in operating profit and customer care.
The target bonus of the Morrison Homes incentive scheme is 175% and the
maximum bonus payable for exceptional performance is 350% of salary.
50% of any bonus over 100% of salary is deferred and paid over a two year
period in cash in two equal amounts. The deferred element of the bonus
will attract interest at the rate of 6%.
Based on the performance of Morrison Homes during the year against its
targets in very challenging market conditions, Steve Parker received a bonus
of $33,000 (£17,935) which was based on meeting customer service targets.
Bonus payments are cash based (save for the deferral requirement into
shares in respect of the UK based Directors) and are not pensionable for any
participant; in addition, they do not count towards the calculation of any
other benefits.

Remuneration Report continued
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible
Investment Disclosure the Remuneration Committee will ensure that the
incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will
not raise environmental, social or governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently
motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to the overall
remuneration structure there is no restriction on the Committee which
prevents it from taking into account ESG matters.
Long term incentives
The George Wimpey Long Term Incentive Plan
The Remuneration Committee believes that the George Wimpey Long
Term Incentive Plan (“George Wimpey LTIP”), approved by shareholders at
the 2002 Annual General Meeting, continues to effectively align both the
Company’s business strategy and the long term interest of management
with those of the Company’s shareholders. The George Wimpey LTIP is
designed to lock in key executives and motivate them through the
opportunity to earn significant financial rewards, on the achievement
of demanding and stretching performance targets, compared to its
comparator group (set out below). Awards under the George Wimpey LTIP
are made by the Committee to a limited number of key executives
consisting of Executive Directors and the tier of management below that
level. Neither the Chairman nor any Non Executive Director participates
in the George Wimpey LTIP .
Awards will not vest unless the predetermined performance conditions
are satisfied over a three year period (“performance period”). The key
performance condition measures the Company’s total shareholder return
(“TSR”) over the performance period commencing on 1 January, against a
specific comparator group of public limited companies. The group consists of
housebuilding and building materials related companies. The Remuneration
Committee believes that TSR is the most appropriate performance measure
because it ensures that executives do not receive rewards under the George
Wimpey LTIP unless the Company has outperformed relative to the
designated comparator group companies. The comparator group for the
George Wimpey LTIP during 2006 is set out below:
Baggeridge Brick Gleeson (MJ) SIG
Barratt Heywood Williams Taylor Woodrow
Bellway Kier Travis Perkins
Berkeley Marshalls Bovis
McCarthy & Stone* Wilson Bowden
Persimmon Wolseley
Crest Nicholson Pilkington*
Galliford Try Redrow
* McCarthy & Stone and Pilkington have now been removed from the
comparator group due to their recent change of status.
Since the introduction of the George Wimpey LTIP in 2002 a number of
companies have fallen away from the comparator group largely due to
consolidation. It is therefore intended that the peer group will be reviewed
by the Remuneration Committee prior to any conditional awards for 2007
being made to participants, with any resultant changes to the group relating
to that year and awards made in future years only.
For all current awards to vest in full, the Company’s TSR performance
over the relevant performance period must equal or exceed the 75th
percentile performance of the comparator group. No portion of the award
will vest if the Company’s TSR performance is less than the 50th percentile.
Partial vesting will take place if the Company’s TSR performance is at least
equal to the 50th percentile. At that level of performance, awards will vest
at a level equivalent to 25%, with straight line vesting for levels of
performance between the 50th and 75th percentiles. The Committee has
reviewed the level of vesting at median and believes that it remains
appropriate when taking into account the level of remuneration in place
for its Directors as a whole.
In addition to the TSR condition, there is a requirement that the Company’s
underlying financial performance must be satisfactory before vesting takes
place and it is proposed that this performance should be defined. As
confirmed last year, the Committee has decided that this will be done by
reference to the Company’s earnings per share, which will be measured
against the comparator group and considered by the Committee when
determining whether vesting should take place.
Awards made under the George Wimpey LTIP are not pensionable. Details
of awards to Executive Directors are set out in the table on page 50.
During the year, the Company was pleased to recruit Ian Sutcliffe from Shell as
Managing Director of the UK business and he was subsequently appointed
to the Board on 11 October 2006. In order to secure Ian Sutcliffe’s services
and compensate him for benefits given up at Shell, at the time of his
recruitment, the Company conditionally awarded him shares under the
George Wimpey LTIP , equivalent to 3x his starting base salary. Apart from the
first year of operation of the George Wimpey LTIP , when shares equivalent to
3x base salary were awarded, the normal policy of the Committee has been
to conditionally award shares to participants based on 2x the appropriate
salary. Consistent with all other participants in the George Wimpey LTIP , no
shares will vest to Ian Sutcliffe unless the Company’s total shareholder return
over the relevant three year period (2006 to 2008) is at or exceeds median
against the peer group.
For 2007, in common with other participating Directors in the George
Wimpey LTIP , Ian Sutcliffe will be conditionally awarded shares equivalent
to up to 2x base salary as at 1 January 2007.
The three year plan cycle in respect of the 2004 George Wimpey LTIP expired
on 31 December 2006. Against its comparator group, the Company’s TSR
position placed it below median and accordingly, no part of the award
vested in favour of any participant and all awards issued in 2004 have lapsed.
Following the introduction of the George Wimpey LTIP in 2002, it is Company
policy that Executive Directors are no longer granted options under the
Executive Share Option Scheme and there are no outstanding interests
under the Scheme.
Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive Plan
During the year, Steve Parker participated in the Morrison Homes Long
Term Incentive Plan (“Morrison Homes LTIP”) which was approved by
shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting. The Morrison Homes
LTIP is a cash based scheme pursuant to which units are awarded to each
participant following the end of a financial year. The value of each unit, and
therefore the amount of cash that an individual receives, will depend on
growth in profit before interest and tax (“PBIT”) of Morrison Homes over that
financial year. The maximum value is achieved if PBIT grows by more than 30%
per annum. The amount payable is, however, reduced progressively if
Morrison Homes’ return on assets (“RoA”) is less than 20%, such that no
amount is payable if RoA is less than 15% in the relevant year. The size of
award is determined by the Remuneration Committee which recognises the
need to link awards and the rewarding of ongoing performance with the
creation of additional shareholder value.
The Committee regards the Morrison Homes LTIP as a key part of the
remuneration for the President of Morrison Homes in terms of both
motivation and retention; the growth targets are demanding and any cash
is then paid out over a four year period commencing one year after the end
of the relevant financial year. The payments are back-end loaded, with 20%
of the cash award being paid in each of the first three years of that period
and the remaining 40% in the final year. Interest is accrued on the unpaid
part of the award at a current rate of 6%.
In 2006 we reported that Steve Parker would participate solely in the
Morrison Homes LTIP with the overall multiple of salary unchanged at
3.5x base salary as at 1 January. 2.5x of his conditional award was based
on performance hurdles relating to 2006 with any award being paid
out over the four year period as outlined above with 1x of the award based
on a three year performance period using the same performance hurdles
but rolled over for the longer period with any award being paid out
following the three year period. In order to align his position closer to that
of the shareholders, Steve Parker was required to purchase and retain for at
least 12 months an amount of shares in the Company equal to 150/350
of any cash that is paid to him.
As reported on page 44, for 2007, it is proposed to restructure the long
term incentive arrangements with respect to Steve Parker such that he will
participate in the George Wimpey LTIP for up to 2x his base salary as at
1 January 2007 and participate in the New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP
for up to 1.5x his base salary. A resolution will be put forward at the Annual
General Meeting for shareholder approval in respect of the New Three Year
Morrison Homes LTIP . The New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP will be
based on achieving an improvement on the average return on Morrison
Homes’ net assets. With 2007 as the base year, it is proposed that the
growth on the average return on net assets must be above 13% over the
three year performance period for there to be any vesting of units and
reach a minimum of 20% in order to achieve a maximum payout at the
end of the period. In addition, Morrison Homes must generate a profit
before interest and tax growth of at least 10% per annum for there to be any
payout. Further information on the terms of the New Three Year Morrison
Homes LTIP are set out in the Notice of Meeting and the Appendix thereto
on pages 79 to 82.

WP100_p44-50_vAW1 tp.qxp:Layout 1  6/3/07  13:06  Page 46 Sharesave Scheme
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme which all
UK staff (including UK based Executive Directors) with over six months’
service are eligible to join. This Scheme enables participants to acquire shares
at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant, in three or five
years’ time according to their election during the offer period. Details of
any participation is included in the table on page 49.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme in which
designated employees, mainly UK based regional board directors, are invited
to participate. No Executive Directors currently participate in this Scheme.
Option grants over shares in the Company are made twice yearly each equal
to 25% of base salary as at 1 January. The performance condition attached
to the vesting of grants is the attainment of median total shareholder return
(“TSR”) performance within a comparator group. This comparator group is the
same as that listed for the George Wimpey LTIP . Assuming the TSR criteria is
met, options can be exercised at the election of the participant between
three and ten years after the grant.
Share retention and target Director shareholdings
There is in place a share retention policy with regard to shares that vest under
the George Wimpey LTIP , which took into account the requirements of the
Association of British Insurers – Principles and Guidelines on Remuneration.
The policy requires Executive Directors to retain, for at least 12 months from
the date of receipt of shares pursuant to the George Wimpey LTIP , not less
than 50% of the after tax/NI amount of shares that vest in any year. Other
participants in the George Wimpey LTIP are expected to retain at least 25%
of the shares received on the same basis.
There is also in place a policy which requires Executive Directors to
accumulate, within a five year period from the later of the date that each
joined the Board or the date of the introduction of the policy, a shareholding
in the Company broadly equal to their base salary.
The above policies are intended to promote as close an alignment as
possible for Executive Directors and senior management with the risks and
rewards that are faced by shareholders. Having these policies in place also
provides a clear framework within which Executive Directors may sell shares
received, for example under the George Wimpey LTIP and in relation to other
dealings, subject to meeting their target shareholding as set out above.
There is also a policy pursuant to which the Chairman and the Non Executive
Directors are required to accumulate within a five year period from the date
that each joined the Board, a shareholding in the Company of broadly equal
to 50% of each Director’s annual fees.
Performance graph
Set out below is a graph which shows the total shareholder return of the
Company during the period December 2001 to December 2006 as against
the FTSE 250 based on 30 trading day average values. The Group believes
that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate comparator index against which to plot
its total shareholder return performance as the Company is a member of the
index together with all but one of its key competitors plus a broad cross
section of leading companies. The graph shows the theoretical growth in
the value of a £100 shareholding over the specified period, assuming that
dividends are re-invested to purchase additional units of equity.
Pensions
Peter Redfern and Andrew Carr-Locke are members of the Executive section
of the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme (“Scheme”). The Scheme (now
closed to new members) is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary
occupational pension scheme. Members contribute between 5% and 10% of
salary. Executive members of the Scheme cease to contribute once they have
achieved 30 years’ pensionable service. Pensions in payment are guaranteed
to increase in line with the Retail Price Index to a maximum of 5% per annum.

Governance
Following the introduction of the Finance Act 2004, this guarantee has been
reduced for all service earned after 6 April 2006, to a maximum of 2.5%.
The Scheme provides executive members with a pension of up to two
thirds of pensionable salary (this is capped for members who joined after
April 1989) on retirement at age 65, subject to the member having
completed 30 years’ pensionable service.
Life assurance of up to four times basic salary and a pension of two thirds
of the member’s entitlement for spouses on their death in service, or in
retirement, are provided, together with a children’s allowance of up to 100%
of the dependant’s pension for three or more children.
Pensionable salary excludes all bonuses, benefits in kind and incentive
related remuneration. For early retirement, after age 50 but prior to
age 65, pensions will be reduced by an appropriate actuarial factor.
As reported last year, from 1 January 2006, the Company has provided
Peter Redfern with a pension allowance through additional payments to
him, amounting to 25% of the difference between his basic salary and the
pension scheme ‘s earnings cap – during the year a total of £77,502 was paid.
Also as reported last year, a payment of £99,300 (gross) was made to Peter
Redfern in February 2006, representing pension allowance arrears due for the
period from 1 January 2004 (when he became the Managing Director of the
UK business) to 31 December 2005.
Andrew Carr-Locke received a pension allowance amounting to 35%
(£117,249) of his basic salary during the year.
Ian Sutcliffe is not a member of the Scheme and instead, the Company pays
29% of his salary into the Company’s designated stakeholder scheme. Payments
of £18,764 were paid into the stakeholder scheme on his behalf for the period
from when he was appointed to the Board on 11 October 2006 to the end of
the year (the total amount paid into the scheme for the year was £77,092).
The Remuneration Committee has a policy that any changes required
following the introduction of the pensions simplification legislation in 2006
(pensions A day) will be implemented on a cost neutral basis to the Company.
During 2006, the sum of $27,670 (£15,038) was paid into a US cash plan for
Steve Parker.
Pension allowances do not count towards the calculation of any bonus
awards which are based only on base salary.
The Directors’ accrued pensions in 2006 are shown on page 49.
Service contracts
Executive Directors
All Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which can be
terminated by either party by giving not less than 12 months’ notice.
The Company has the right to terminate the contract of any Director on
the payment of a sum equivalent to the contractual notice entitlement
of 12 months’ salary and benefits.
The UK based Directors, like all employees, are employed under service
contracts by George Wimpey UK Limited. The US based Director is employed
by Morrison Homes Inc. under service contracts similar to those in place
in the UK.
The Company’s normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 60 and the
service contracts terminate automatically when this age is attained, unless
extended by mutual consent.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Director may, within
six months of the event, elect to terminate the service contract on three
months’ notice to the Company. In such a case the Director will be entitled to
receive a payment equal to 12 months’ salary and benefits. Treatment of any
awards that have been made under the George Wimpey LTIP and Morrison
Homes LTIP will be dealt with by the Remuneration Committee in
accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
The date of the service contracts of Peter Redfern, Andrew Carr-Locke, Steve
Parker and Ian Sutcliffe are 13 October 2004, 27 March 2002, 10 February
2006 and 23 January 2006 respectively.
The Chairman/Non Executive Directors
The procedure for reviewing the Chairman’s fees by the Remuneration
Committee is set out on page 44.
The remuneration of the Non Executive Directors is determined by the
Chairman and the Executive Directors on an annual basis in the absence of
the Non Executive Directors. Independent advice is obtained including the
provision of data on remuneration paid to non executive directors of FTSE
100 and 250 companies with similar turnover and/or market capitalisation.

February 2006 and Group Chief Executive on 1 July 2006 to £450,000 pa.
2 In line with the Group annual incentive scheme, half of the performance bonus issued to Peter Redfern and Andrew Carr-Locke (£137,312 and £17,587 respectively) will be deferred
into shares in the Company which will be held in Trust for three years. Also in line with the Group annual incentive scheme, Peter Johnson has been paid a bonus of £30,975,
based on his salary for six months of the year and the Group pre-exceptional profit before tax outcome for the year.
3 Other benefits consist of the provision of a company car (or car allowance in lieu of a car), private health/life insurance and in the case of Peter Redfern and Andrew Carr-Locke
an annual pension allowance of £77,502 and £117,249 respectively based on 25% and 35% of their base salaries. A payment of £118,000 was paid to Peter Johnson by way of a
pension allowance up to his resignation date of 30 June 2006. A payment of £18,764 was paid into a stakeholder scheme for the benefit of Ian Sutcliffe for the period from when he
was appointed to the Board on 11 October 2006 to the end of the year (the total amount paid into the scheme for the year was £77,092). A payment of $27,670 (£15,038) was paid
into the US Cash Plan in respect of Steve Parker and these payments are included in the above total.
4 In addition to the above, other benefits for Peter Johnson include a payment upon leaving of £413,000 which represents six months payment of his basic salary and pension
allowance of £295,000 and £118,000 respectively to 31 December 2006.
5 This represents the payments made to Steve Parker in 2007 with regard to units that vested and became payable as at 31 December 2006 under both the Morrison Homes
Long Term Compensation Plan (“MHLTCP”) and its replacement, the Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive Plan (“MHLTIP”). Steve Parker also received the sum of $400,258
(£217,532) in January 2006 in respect of units that vested and became payable as at 31 December 2005 under these Schemes and before Steve Parker was appointed as a Director.
Steve Parker’s interest in the MHLTIP as at 31 December 2006 was $1,997,030 or £1,085,342 ($428,260 or £232,750 of which was paid in January 2007). Steve Parker holds no further
interest in the MHLTCP . In both the MHLTCP and the MHLTIP , units were granted annually at the beginning of the year and then valued at the end of the first year depending upon
performance and then paid out to participants over a four year period commencing after the performance period. No equity is involved in either scheme.
During the year units were issued equivalent to 3.5x base salary under the MHLTIP with 1x linked to a three year performance period. Due to the performance conditions of the
MHLTIP not being met, no units which were awarded in 2006 (2.5x base salary) vested in favour of Steve Parker.
6 These payments represent an amount equivalent to employer’s national insurance contributions paid by the Company pursuant to the service contract with each Director.
7 Ian Sutcliffe’s annual salary is £290,000.
8 The conversion rate used for converting Steve Parker’s remuneration from Dollars to Sterling was $1.84/£1.
48 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Remuneration is paid in the form of fixed fees. Non Executive Directors are
invited, but not obliged, to use any increase in their remuneration to
purchase shares in the Company.
The remuneration of the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors is
reviewed annually and any change is effective from 1 July. The basic fee paid
to Non Executive Directors increased from £42,000 per annum to £45,000 per
annum. An additional fee is paid to Non Executive Directors who chair a
Board Committee and this fee remained at £8,000 per annum. The Senior
Independent Director also receives an additional fee of £10,000 per annum
to reflect the additional responsibilities of the role.
The fees of the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are not
performance related or pensionable.
The Chairman and Non Executive Directors do not participate in any
Company incentive or share schemes. Neither the Chairman nor the Non
Executive Directors have service contracts. The services of John Robinson
and Christine Cross are contracted to the Company under agreements which
provide that each Director will be appointed for an initial three year term
and are terminable on six months’ notice by either party. However, in the
event that a Director is not reappointed as a Director by the Company’s
shareholders, or is removed from office by them in accordance with the
Company’s Articles of Association, then the relevant agreement will
terminate with no provision for compensation.
David Williams, Brenda Dean, Anthony Reading and Robert Sharpe have
letters of appointment from the Company. These engagements also continue
for an initial three year term and are terminable on six months’ notice by
either party or otherwise in accordance with the Company’s Articles of
Association as described above. The letters of appointment of the Non
Executive Directors and the agreements for the services of John Robinson

NOTES:
1 Based on a conditional award equivalent to 3x salary – see page 46 for the background to this award.
2 Peter Johnson retained an interest in a total of 349,602 shares in the George Wimpey LTIP upon his resignation which reflects a pro rata reduction based on his leaving date of
30 June 2006 such that his 2004 allocation was effectively reduced to 220,965 shares from 265,158 shares in order to reflect 30 months service by Peter Johnson during the 36 month
plan cycle ending on 31 December 2006. The 2005 allocation was reduced to 128,637 shares out of his original allocation of 257,275 shares reflecting 18 months service by Peter
Johnson during the 36 month plan cycle ending on 31 December 2007. No amount of these shares will vest unless the performance conditions are met for the entirety of the
relevant plan cycle.
Awards made pursuant to the George Wimpey LTIP are conditional and do not vest in whole or in part unless predetermined performance conditions are satisfied over a three year
period. The performance conditions are explained in detail on page 46. The number of awards made to each participant is calculated with reference to a formula based on a maximum
of 2x salary as at 1 January in each year (3x salary in 2002) and the average closing share price for each dealing day within a 90 day period ending on the day before the award is
made. For 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the relevant share prices were 251.21p, 403.9p, 437.10p and 544.1p. For Steve Parker, the awards were calculated by reference to a formula
based on 1x his salary as at 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2004. The 2003 George Wimpey LTIP awarded to Steve Parker was made on 9 May when the market value on award was 250.5p.
The TSR performance in respect of those shares conditionally awarded under the 2004 George Wimpey LTIP was not met. No vesting has taken place and the award has now lapsed
for all Directors and participants including Peter Johnson. These shares are however included in the final column above.

Auditors’ Report
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders of
George Wimpey Plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company ﬁnancial statements
(the ‘ﬁnancial statements’) of George Wimpey Plc for the year ended
31 December 2006 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group
and Parent Company Statements of Recognised Income and Expense, the
Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company
Cash Flow Statements and the related notes. These ﬁnancial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also
audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is
described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give
a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the
Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report
is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the
Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the
Business Review that is cross referred from the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code
(2003) speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s Corporate
Governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. The other
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s
Statement, Business Review including Corporate Social Responsibility,
Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Report and the unaudited part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year
then ended;
• the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state
of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and cash ﬂows for
the year then ended;
• the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial
statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS
As explained in the Accounting Policies to the ﬁnancial statements, the
Group and Parent Company in addition to complying with its legal obligation
to comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, has also complied
with the IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the Group and Parent Company’s ﬁnancial statements give a
true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS, of the state of the Group’s and
Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of their cash ﬂows for
the year then ended and the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended.

Cash Flow Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2006
WP100_p51-56_vAW1 tp.qxp:WP100  6/3/07  13:05  Page 54 Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRIC interpretations
and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of ﬁnancial
assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through
the proﬁt and loss. A summary of the more important accounting policies
is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
Balance Sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or action, actual
results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated results incorporate the financial statements of the
Company and entities controlled by the Company (‘subsidiaries’) up
to the Balance Sheet date.
Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties
(‘joint ventures’) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during
a year are included in the Group Income Statement from the effective date
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Goodwill arising on consolidation
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable
net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment is charged immediately to the Income Statement
and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS
on 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
following impairment tests.
Revenue
Revenue from housing sales is recognised as the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable on legal completion, net of incentives.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are deﬁned as items of income and expenditure which
are material and unusual in nature and of such signiﬁcance that they require
separate disclosure on the face of the income statement in accordance with
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.
Share-based payments
In accordance with its transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested
as of 1 January 2005.
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments to the
amounts expensed are only made in respect of non market related factors.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement in equal
amounts over the lease term.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than
freehold land at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset to its
residual value evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
• Freehold buildings – over 50 years
• Short leaseholds – over the period of the lease
• Plant and equipment – 20% to 33% per annum on a straight line basis
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if
appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank deposits and borrowings is credited
or charged to finance costs as incurred.
Notional interest payable, representing the unwinding of the discount
on long term liabilities, is charged to finance costs.
Infrequently a long term land creditor is for a parcel, or parcels, of land
where the Group has exchanged unconditional contracts, and so recognised
the creditor and the land inventory, but in practice does not have title or
access to the land. In those few cases the notional interest payable already
charged to finance costs is then credited to finance costs and added to the
cost of inventory in accordance with IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ and IAS 2
‘Inventories’ . In no circumstances will the cost of such land inventory
exceed the contracted sum payable.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charges.
The current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit
differs from profit before taxation recorded in the Income Statement because
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
other years or that are never taxable or deductible. The liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively
enacted, by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the Income Statement,
except when they relate to items charged or credited through the Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense when they are charged or credited there.
Segmental reporting
The Group is divided into three components for management reporting
and control:
• UK housing (George Wimpey and Laing Homes brands)
• US housing (Morrison Homes brand)
• Corporate
These components make up the primary segmental analysis in the financial
statements. No secondary segmental analysis is provided as the primary
segmental analysis follows the geographical split.
Intangible assets
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and
unique software controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic
benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Computer
software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight
line basis over three to five years from the time of going live.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less any
provision for impairment.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those overheads
which have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present
location and condition. Cost in certain circumstances also includes
notional interest as explained in the accounting policy for finance income
and costs. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less
all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing
and selling.
Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised – generally
after exchange of unconditional contracts.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their initial value
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives utilised by the Group are primarily interest rate swaps. Derivatives
are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date of the
derivative contract and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Gains
or losses on interest rate swaps are taken direct to finance costs in the
Income Statement.

Accounting Policies
WP100_p51-56_vAW1 tp.qxp:WP100  6/3/07  13:05  Page 55 Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated
at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in
respect of land purchases, are recorded at their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Cash Flow Statements includes cash in hand,
deposits held at call with banks, other highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
included within financial liabilities in current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Pensions
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under the amended
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ . For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured
at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in
the Income Statement; service costs are spread systematically over the lives
of the employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which
they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the Income
Statement as they become due.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outﬂow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has
been reliably estimated.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity share capital.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are charged to the share premium account.
Where any Group company purchases ordinary shares of the Company
(Treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any incremental costs,
is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity shareholders.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at closing rates of exchange. On consolidation,
the Income Statements of overseas subsidiary entities are translated at an
appropriate average rate for the year and the Balance Sheets at the closing
rate. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of opening Balance
Sheets, together with the difference between Income Statements translated
at average rates and closing rates, are dealt with through reserves.
The Group designates its US$ borrowings as a hedge of the investments
in the US Housing business. Gains and losses on the retranslation of foreign
currency borrowings to £ Sterling are taken direct to reserves.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations
are not effective for 2006 and therefore have not been applied in preparing
these accounts:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the Amendments to IAS 1
Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures require extensive
disclosures about the significance of financial instruments for an entity’s
financial position and performance, and qualitative and quantitative
disclosures on the nature and extent of risks. IFRS 7 and amended IAS 1
which will be adopted for the Group’s 2007 accounts, will require additional
disclosures with respect to the Group’s financial instruments and share capital.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments addresses the accounting
for share-based payment transactions in which some or all of the goods
or services received cannot be specifically identified. IFRIC 8 will become
mandatory for the Group’s 2007 accounts, with retrospective application
required. The Group has not yet determined the potential effect of
the interpretation.
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment prohibits the reversal
of an impairment loss recognised in a previous interim period in respect of
goodwill, an investment in an equity instrument or a financial asset carried
at cost. IFRIC 10 will become mandatory for the Group’s 2007 accounts and
will apply to goodwill, investments in equity instruments and financial
assets carried at cost prospectively from the date that the Group first applied
the measurement criteria of IAS 36 and IAS 39 respectively (i.e. 1 January
2005). IFRIC 10 is not expected to have any significant impact on the
consolidated accounts.
The Group does not consider that any other standard or interpretations
issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have any significant impact
on the consolidated accounts.

In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of 2006 of 13.1 pence per share which will absorb an estimated £52.5 million of shareholders’
funds. If approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting it will be paid on 11 May 2007 to shareholders who are on the register of members on
2 March 2007. Dividends from the year’s earnings of 54.8 pence per share (2005: 64.3 pence per share) are, therefore, 19.4 pence per share (2005: 17.6 pence
per share) in total, representing dividend cover of 2.8 times (2005: 3.7 times).
6 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is 54.8 pence (2005: 64.3 pence). The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary
shareholders of £218.0 million (2005: £252.8 million) divided by the average number of shares in issue during the year of 397.7 million (2005: 393.1 million).
Diluted earnings per share is 54.6 pence (2005: 64.0 pence). The calculation is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average
number of shares in issue plus the dilutive potential ordinary shares amounting to 1.8 million (2005: 1.8 million) shares. The dilutive potential ordinary shares
relate to shares provisionally allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between earnings per share before exceptional items and basic earnings per share. Earnings per share before
exceptional items, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.

The Directors consider all inventory to be current in nature. The operational cycle is such that the majority of inventory will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised, as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand
and planning permission delays. The value of land expensed in 2006 was £896.6 million (2005: £737.4 million). At this level of activity and ignoring the effect
of other factors such as inﬂation and exchange rate volatility, approximately 62% (2005: 66%) of inventory is estimated to be realised in excess of 12 months.
In accordance with the accounting policies on finance income and costs as set out on page 55 the Group adds to the cost of inventory certain notional
interest, representing the unwinding discount on long term creditors for land to which the Group does not have title or access. Interest included within land
held for development has moved as follows:

and overdrafts are £25.0 million and US$446.6 million (2005: £65.0 million and US$274.7 million).
Floating rate debt is at margins over £ or US$ LIBOR.
Before the effect of swaps £260.5 million (£30.0 million and $451 million) (2005: £297.8 million (£30.0 million and $460.6 million)) of borrowings are ﬁxed at a
weighted average rate of 6.19% (2005: 6.23%) for a weighted average term of 6.3 years (2005: 7.2 years).
The US$35.0 million private placement is repayable between two and three years.
The US$320.0 million and £30.0 million private placement is repayable as US$110.0 million between two and three years, US$70.0 million and £30.0 million is
repayable between ﬁve and six years, US$110.0 million is repayable between seven and eight years and US$30.0 million is repayable between 10 and 11 years.
The US$96.0 million private placement is repayable as US$28.0 million between six and seven years, US$38.0 million between eight and nine years and US$30.0
million between 11 and 12 years.

fall due for renewal between two and ﬁve years and none (2005: £240 million) fall due for renewal in over ﬁve years.
Gearing is calculated as net debt of £387.1 million (2005: £521.9 million) as a percentage of shareholders’ equity of £1,707.1 million (2005: £1,544.4 million)
and equals 22.7% (2005: 33.8%).

Interest rate swaps (1 .8) (6.9)
Interest rate swaps are used by the Group to establish an appropriate proportion of fixed rate borrowing. Some of the instruments used by the Group, whilst
appropriately managing the economic exposure of the Group, do not meet the conditions required to be classified as hedge instruments. As a result gains
and/or losses on interest rate swaps are taken to finance costs in the Income Statement which creates a degree of volatility in finance costs.

Floating rate debt is at margins over £ Sterling or US$ LIBOR. Sterling fixed rate financial liabilities are at average rates of 5.41% (2005: 5.42%) with an average
term to maturity of 3.8 years (2005: 4.8 years). US$ fixed rate financial liabilities are at average rates of 5.93% (2005: 5.72%) with an average term to maturity of
7.1 years (2005: 6.9 years).
The average interest rate in 2006, calculated by dividing the net interest payable in the year on net debt by the average daily net debt, was 5.1% (2005: 5.2%).
The fair values of non derivative ﬁnancial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ﬂows at prevailing interest rates and
by applying year end exchange rates. Non-current land creditors are reported in the accounts at fair value. The carrying amounts of current ﬁnancial assets

Deferred taxation is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using tax rates anticipated to apply when the liability is settled or the
asset realised.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will
be recovered.

The remedial work provision covers various obligations across the Group, including aftercare at Springfield Environmental Limited which has a legal
responsibility of a long term nature for the management of old, completed sites, provisions for losses on construction contracts for which responsibility was
retained by the Group following the asset swap with Tarmac PLC in 1996 and housing maintenance provisions which should be utilised over the next two years.
The rental guarantees provision covers shortfalls anticipated under leasehold commitments. An estimate has been made of the level of income and expenditure
anticipated for each property and the timing of the utilisation of the provision directly covers the next two years. Net outgoings have been discounted on a
pre-tax basis using the short term cost of borrowing.

20 Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined benefit UK scheme, a UK stakeholder scheme and two overseas defined contribution schemes. The assets of the schemes are held in
separate Trustee administered funds. The largest, which is in the UK, is the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme (the Scheme), and is of the funded, defined benefit type.
It is closed to new entrants. The Trustees are George Wimpey Pension Trustees Limited and the Law Debenture Trust Corporation Plc. The Scheme is subject to triennial
valuation by independent actuaries, the last such valuation being carried out as at 31 March 2005, using the projected unit method. Details of this valuation are given
below. For new employees in the UK , George Wimpey pays contributions into stakeholder pension arrangements.
The actuarial assumptions which have the most significant effect are those relating to return on investment, the rate of increase in salaries and the assumed rate of
pension increases. In the 31 March 2005 valuation it was assumed that the investment return prior to retirement would exceed long dated gilt yields by 2.25% per annum
and post retirement by 0.25% per annum. Salary increases were assumed to exceed price inﬂation by 2.0% per annum. Pension increases were assumed to be in line with
inﬂation. The market value of assets was £591 million and the present value of liabilities accrued to members after allowing for the expected future increase in earnings
was £739 million. This equated to a gross deficit of £148 million and £104 million net of deferred tax. The Company has agreed to continue contributions equivalent to
£15 million per annum to fund the deficit. This is in addition to the ongoing costs of providing future service benefits.
The Group has paid contributions of £20.5 million (2005: £21.1 million) to the Scheme during the year.
Two material beneﬁt changes occurred during 2006. Firstly, pension increases for pension earned in respect of service post 5 April 2006 was limited to the lower of the
increase in the Retail Prices Index or 2.5% each year. Secondly, members were permitted to increase the amount of tax free cash exchanged for pension in line with‘tax
simpliﬁcation’changes introduced by the Government on 6 April 2006.
Contributions were paid at a rate of 13.2% of Scheme salary up to 31 March 2006 and 15.7% thereafter plus £15 million (2005:13.5% plus £15 million) during 2006.
A qualified, independent actuary updated the 31 March 2005 valuation to 31 December 2006, as required by IAS 19. The principal assumptions made at
31 December 2006 were as follows:
2006 2005 2004
Discount rate 5.0% 4.9% 5.4%
Rate of increase in salaries 4.3% 4.6% 4.6%
Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.8% 2.6% 2.6%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment
– pre April 2006 pension 2.8% 2.6% 2.6%
– post April 2006 pension 2.0% n/a n/a
Inﬂation 2.8% 2.6% 2.6%
At the time of the 31 March 2005 actuarial valuation of the Scheme, a study was undertaken into the recent Scheme mortality experience. The tables adopted
reﬂect the results of this study and represent current expectations of mortality experience within the Scheme. In particular an appropriate allowance has been
made within the assumptions for future mortality improvements. The tables adopted are as follows:
Non pensioners: PM/FA92 (YOB = 1950)
Current pensioners: PM/FA92 (YOB = 1925)
Life expectancy at age 65 Male Female
Member age 65 (current pensioner) 18.4 21.5

Resolutions 3/4/5: To Reappoint Andrew Carr-Locke, Christine Cross and

The Articles of Association require one third of the Directors who are subject
to retirement by rotation to retire at each Annual General Meeting. However,
if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not
exceeding one third shall retire from office. In line with the Combined Code
each Director also seeks reappointment every three years. The Directors to
retire by rotation shall be those who have been longest in office since their
last appointment or reappointment. Any new directors appointed during the
year by the Board must, in accordance with the Articles of Association, seek
reappointment at the next Annual General Meeting and shall not be taken
into account in determining the Directors or the number of Directors who
are to retire by rotation.
Notice is hereby given that the twenty ninth Annual General Meeting
of George Wimpey Plc will be held on 26 April 2007 at 11.00 am at
The Royal College of Physicians, 11 St Andrews Place, Regent’s Park,
London NW1 4LE, for the following purposes:
Ordinary Business
1 To receive and consider the Report of the Directors and Accounts for
the year ended 31 December 2006.
2 That a final dividend of 13.1 pence per share in respect of the year
ended 31 December 2006 be and is hereby declared due and payable
on 11 May 2007 to shareholders on the register at close of business on
2 March 2007, such final dividend to be payable only in respect of such
of the shares which the relevant holder of the shares has not exercised
any entitlement to receive new shares instead of a dividend in cash
pursuant to the scrip dividend scheme.
To reappoint the following Directors who are retiring by rotation:
3 Andrew Carr-Locke
4 Christine Cross
5 Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde.

to authorise the Audit Committee to fix their remuneration on behalf
of the Board.
Directors’ authority to allot shares
8 To resolve as an ordinary resolution:
That the Directors be and they are hereby generally and unconditionally
authorised in substitution for all previous authorities conferred upon them
to exercise all powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (within
the meaning of section 80(2) of the Companies Act 1985) up to an
aggregate nominal value of £33,411,497, provided that this authority
shall expire, unless previously revoked or varied, at the conclusion of the
next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing of this
resolution, save that the Company may before such expiry make an offer
or agreement which would or might require relevant securities to be
allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot relevant securities
in pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if the authority conferred
hereby had not expired.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
9 To resolve as a special resolution:
That the Directors be and they are hereby empowered pursuant to
section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot equity securities (within
the meaning of section 94(2) of the Companies Act 1985) for cash
pursuant to the authority conferred by the resolution numbered 8
above and to sell treasury shares wholly for cash pursuant to section
94(3A) of the Companies Act 1985, as if sub-section (1) of section 89
of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to any such allotment,
provided that this power shall be limited:
ato the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights issue,
open offer or any other pre-emptive offer or a scrip dividend alternative
in each case in favour of ordinary shareholders (excluding any
shareholder holding shares as treasury shares) where the equity
securities respectively attributable to the interests of all ordinary
shareholders are proportionate as nearly as may be to the respective
number of ordinary shares held or deemed to be held by them, and
subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may
deem necessary or expedient to deal with fractional entitlements, legal
or practical problems arising in any overseas territory, the requirements
of any regulatory body or stock exchange or any other matter
whatsoever; and
b to the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph a above)
of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £5,011,724;
and shall expire, unless previously revoked or varied, at the conclusion
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing of
this resolution, save that the Company may before such expiry make an

Notice of Meeting
WP100_p79-83_vAW1 tp.qxp:WP088  6/3/07  13:02  Page 79 Accordingly, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting three Directors will be
required to retire by way of rotation. Andrew Carr-Locke, Christine Cross and
Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde being the longest standing Directors
since their appointment or reappointment, will therefore retire
and offer themselves for reappointment.
Resolution 6: To Reappoint Ian Sutcliffe
The Articles of Association permit the Board to appoint a person to the Board
during the year, subject to them being reappointed at the subsequent
Annual General Meeting.
Ian Sutcliffe was appointed to the Board on 11 October 2006 and offers
himself for reappointment in accordance with the Articles of Association.
Directors’ biographical details, including those seeking reappointment, are
shown on page 36 of the Annual Report. These include dates of appointment,
ages, career histories, current directorships and other significant appointments.
The Board recommends to the Company's shareholders the reappointment
of each of the above Directors.
Resolution 7: To Reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Auditors
This resolution proposes that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be reappointed
as auditors, and authorises the Audit Committee to fix their remuneration
on behalf of the Board.
Resolutions 8/9: To Allot Shares and Disapply Pre-Emption Rights
Under section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, the Directors cannot generally
allot unissued shares in the Company unless they are authorised to do so by
the Company in general meeting. Resolution 8 will authorise the Directors to
issue new shares up to the lower of one third of the amount of the nominal
value of the issued share capital of the Company (calculated excluding any
treasury shares) as at the date of this Notice – i.e. up to a value of £33,411,497
or the amount of the nominal value of the authorised but unissued share
capital of the Company. The authority will expire at the conclusion of the
next Annual General Meeting. As at the date of this Notice, the Company
does not hold any treasury shares. The Directors have no present intention
of issuing shares, except as needed to satisfy the exercise of options under
the Company’s Employee Share Schemes and the allotment of shares
pursuant to such elections made by shareholders of the Company.
Under Resolution 9, the Directors will remain subject to constraints on the
issue of shares for cash (unless the issue takes place pro rata to existing
shareholders). They will be able to issue such shares for cash only:
• in connection with a rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer
or a scrip dividend alternative, or
• up to 5% of the nominal value of the Company’s issued share capital
as at the date of the Notice, i.e. £5,011,724.
Resolution 10: To Empower the Company to Make Market Purchases
of its Shares
This resolution is intended to renew the authority of the Directors, granted
at the Annual General Meeting in 2006, to make market purchases of shares
within a 10% limit, in accordance with Article 53 of the Company’s Articles of
Association. The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority.
Moreover, purchases will only be made if they would result in an expected
increase in earnings per share, taking into account other available investment
opportunities, and will be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Any shares purchased in accordance with this authority will subsequently
be cancelled or they may be held in treasury pursuant to the Companies
(Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003. These
regulations allow the Company to hold its own shares in treasury following
a buy back as an alternative to cancelling them. Holding bought back shares
in treasury provides the Company with the ability to sell or transfer them
quickly and effectively and also provides flexibility in using such shares for
employees’ schemes. If any such shares are used, the Company will, so long
as required under the guidelines of the Association of British Insurers
Investment Committee, count them towards the limits in the schemes as
if they were newly issued shares.

Shareholder Information
Notice of Meeting continued
All rights attaching to the shares, including voting rights and the right
to receive dividends, will be suspended whilst they are held in treasury.
Options were outstanding as at 9 February 2007 to subscribe for a total
number of 6,720,918 ordinary shares, or 1.68% of the Company’s issued
share capital. If the authority to purchase shares is ever used in full (and
the purchased shares cancelled), the proportion of issued share capital
represented by this figure would be 1.86%.
Special Business
Resolution 11: To Approve the New Three Year Morrison Homes Long
Term Incentive Plan for the President of Morrison Homes
This resolution seeks shareholder approval for the introduction of a new
three year long term incentive plan for the President of the Company’s US
subsidiary, Morrison Homes, Inc. (“New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP”).
The New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP replaces the Morrison Homes
Long Term Incentive Plan (“MHLTIP”) which was established in 2003 following
shareholder approval. The Remuneration Committee (which consists of four
independent Non Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board) has
conducted a review of the long term incentive plan arrangements for the
President of Morrison Homes with the assistance of its adviser Mercer Human
Resource Consulting. A consequence of that review is that the Remuneration
Committee has recommended to the Board that the New Three Year
Morrison Homes LTIP should replace the MHLTIP and that the President
should also participate in the George Wimpey Long Term Incentive Plan
(“George Wimpey LTIP”) for up to 2x base salary out of the maximum
annual multiple of 3.5x base salary.
Like the George Wimpey LTIP , the New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP
incorporates a three year performance period. The MHLTIP was based on a
one year performance period. The Remuneration Committee believes that
it is appropriate that the President participates in the George Wimpey LTIP
which is a share based long term incentive plan and that the New Three Year
Morrison Homes LTIP should be based on three year performance periods in
order to help drive the long term growth of the business.
The New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP provides for the President of
Morrison Homes to be granted an award in each financial year of Morrison
Homes. Whilst the President participates in the George Wimpey LTIP the
maximum value of the annual award under the New Three Year Morrison
Homes LTIP will be 1.5x base salary.
Awards under the New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP will be paid out
in cash at the end of the three year period based on Morrison Homes’
average return on adjusted net assets over that period and will also be
subject to the growth in pre-tax and pre-interest earnings of Morrison Homes.
A more detailed summary of the main features and terms of the New Three
Year Morrison Homes LTIP are set out in the Appendix to this Notice.
Resolution 12: To Approve the Remuneration Report of the Company
In accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
the Board is required to present the Remuneration Report to shareholders
for approval at the Meeting. The Remuneration Report is set out on pages 44
to 50 of the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December
2006. The Board considers that appropriate executive remuneration plays a
vital part in helping to achieve the Company’s overall objectives. The vote
will have advisory status in respect of the remuneration policy and overall
remuneration packages and is not specific to individual levels of remuneration.
Resolution 13: To Authorise the Company to use E-Communications
The Companies Act 2006 provisions relating to electronic communications
(sections 308, 309, 333, 1143 to 1148 and schedules 4 and 5) came into
force on 20 January 2007; and for listed companies these provisions are
supplemented by the rules on electronic communications contained in the
Financial Services Authority’s sourcebook, Disclosure and Transparency Rules
(Chapter 6) which came into force on the same date. For flexibility, should it
elect to do so, the Company wishes to take advantage of the new provisions
so that it can circulate documents and information to shareholders by
electronic communications (i.e. email or fax) or by making the documents
and information available on the Company’s website. In order to do so, the
Company must obtain the consent of shareholders in general meeting.
WP100_p79-83_vAW1 tp.qxp:WP088  6/3/07  13:02  Page 80 For performance between these figures, the percentage paid out will
be calculated on a pro rata basis. However, no payment will be paid at all
unless the growth in profit before interest and tax achieved by Morrison
Homes over the period 2007 to 2009 is at least 10% in each year.
The Committee may vary these targets for future performance periods
provided that they are no less demanding than those set out above.
Payments to the participant
Payments to the participant will be made as soon as practicable after the
financial results for the last financial year of the performance period have
been approved by the Board.
Cessation of employment
If the participant ceases to be employed by Morrison Homes, the participant
will normally lose the right to any payment under the New Three Year
Morrison Homes LTIP , even if the cessation is between the end of the
performance period and the payment date.
If the reason for the cessation is disability, retirement at normal retirement
age, early retirement (with the employing company’s consent) or other
special circumstances approved by the Committee, the participant will be
entitled to a payment at the end of the financial year of cessation, based
on the ROANA achieved by Morrison Homes during the financial years
completed up to the payment date, but reduced pro rata to the proportion
of the performance period which has elapsed before the cessation.
If the participant dies, the participant’s personal representatives will be entitled
to a payment at the end of the financial year in which the death occurred
without any pro rata deduction, based on the ROANA achieved by Morrison
Homes during the financial years completed up to the payment date.
Corporate events
If Morrison Homes ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company, the participant
will be entitled to payments without any pro rata deduction, based on the
ROANA achieved by Morrison Homes up to the cessation date.
Adjustments to awards
If there is a significant change in the structure of Morrison Homes or a
significant injection or withdrawal of capital by the Company (excluding
normal dividends), the Committee may make adjustments to awards which
it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, with the intention
that broadly similar cash payments will be earned for comparable levels
of performance to those which would have been earned if the change
had not occurred.
Participant’s rights
Awards granted under the New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP are not
transferable.
Awards are made at the discretion of the Committee and the participant
has no contractual right to be granted an award.
The participant has no right to compensation for the loss of any benefit or
prospective benefit under the New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP if he
ceases to be employed by Morrison Homes for any reason.
Termination of the Plan
The New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP will terminate on the tenth
anniversary of its adoption by the Company’s shareholders or earlier at the
discretion of the Board. No new awards may be granted after the termination,
but the rights of the participant over existing awards will not be affected.
Amendments to the Plan
The New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP may be amended by the Committee
at any time provided that amendments which are to the advantage of the
participant may only be made by or with the prior approval of the Company’s
shareholders in general meeting unless they are minor amendments which
the Committee considers necessary or desirable in order to benefit
administration or they are necessary to obtain or maintain favourable tax,
exchange control or other regulatory treatment for the participant, the
Company, Morrison Homes or any subsidiary.
Resolution 13 will authorise the Company to serve any notice or send
or supply any other document or information to a member by making
the notice, document or information available on a website or by other
electronic means. In addition to this notice, the Company will send a letter
to each shareholder which describes the issue more fully and, assuming
the resolution is passed, sets out what further action a shareholder should
take if he or she would like to receive electronic communications from the
Company. Individuals will retain the right to receive information in paper
if they wish.

under the New Three Year Morrison Homes LTIP will be an amount
equivalent to 1.5x his annual rate of base salary at the grant date.
If the participant also participates in the George Wimpey Long Term
Incentive Plan, the value of awards made to the participant under both
plans in any financial year will not exceed 3.5x his annual rate of base salary
at the grant date.
Calculation of cash payments
The value of the cash payment to be made under each award will be
determined by the financial performance of Morrison Homes over
performance periods of three financial years, beginning no earlier than 2007.
For the performance period 2007 to 2009, the proportion of the award paid
out will depend on the average return on adjusted net assets (“ROANA”)
achieved by Morrison Homes over the performance period, according to
the following table.
Average ROANA % of award paid out
13% or less 0
14% 25
16% 50
20% or more 100

WP100_p79-83_vAW1 tp.qxp:WP088  6/3/07  13:02  Page 81 Action to be taken
Whether or not you intend to attend the Annual General Meeting, you
are requested to complete the enclosed Form of Proxy and return it to the
Company’s Registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West
Sussex BN99 6AU as soon as possible and in any event so as to be received
no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the Annual General
Meeting, that is no later than 11:00 am on 24 April 2007. The completion
and submission of a Form of Proxy will not prevent you from attending
and voting in person if you so wish.
In conjunction with its Registrars, the Company has again provided the
facility to allow each shareholder to register proxy votes electronically.
Detailed information of how to do this is set out on the Form of
Proxy/Admission Card. You can register your proxy votes electronically
by either logging on to our Registrars’ website, www.sharevote.co.uk and
following the instructions, or, if your shareholding is uncertificated, by
registering your proxy votes using the service launched by CRESTCo,
principally to streamline the process for institutional investors.
Recommendation
Your Directors are of the opinion that the resolutions to be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of shareholders as a whole
and recommend you to vote in favour of them. Each Director will be doing
so in respect of his or her own beneficial shareholdings.
Attendance and voting
As a shareholder of George Wimpey Plc, you have the right to attend and
vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Please bring with you the accompanying Form of Proxy/Admission Card and
retain it until the end of the Meeting. It will authenticate your right to attend,
speak and vote, and will help us to register your attendance without delay.
Registration will be available from 9:30 am. For the safety and comfort of
those attending the Meeting, large bags, cameras, recording equipment
and similar items will not be allowed into the building.
The Meeting will commence at 11:00 am and light refreshments will be
available from 10:30 am and also after the conclusion of the Meeting.
You are advised to bring your Annual Report with you to the Meeting
so that you can refer to it as necessary.
If you do not wish, or are unable, to attend, you may appoint either the
Chairman of the Meeting or someone else of your choice to act on your
behalf and to vote in the event of a poll. That person is known as a ‘proxy’ .
You are advised to use the enclosed Form of Proxy to appoint a proxy or
to vote electronically as outlined above and in more detail on the
enclosed Form of Proxy.
A proxy need not be a shareholder and may attend and vote on behalf
of the shareholder who appointed him or her.
At the Meeting, the proxy can act for the member he or she represents.
This includes the right to join in or demand a poll, but it does not include the
right to vote on a show of hands. The proxy is also valid for any adjournment
of the Meeting.
Please tick the appropriate box alongside each resolution on the Form
of Proxy to indicate whether you wish your votes to be cast ‘for’ , or ‘against’ ,
or whether you wish to withhold your vote from, that resolution. Unless
you give specific instructions on how to vote on a particular resolution,
your proxy will be able, at his or her discretion, either to vote ‘for’ or
‘against’ that resolution or to withhold your vote.
Before posting the form to the Registrar, please check that you have signed
it. In the case of joint holders, either or any one of you may sign it.
As stated above, the Forms of Proxy must be received in the offices of the
Company’s Registrars no later than 11:00 am on 24 April 2007. Any Form
of Proxy received after this time will be void.
NOTES:
i. A member entitled to attend and vote at this Meeting may appoint a proxy
to attend and vote instead of him or her. The proxy need not be a member
of the Company.
ii. Instruments appointing proxies must be received by the Company’s Registrars
not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for the Meeting.
iii. Contracts of Service with Directors and the Register of Directors’ Interests will
be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual
business hours between the date of this Notice and the Annual General Meeting
and at the venue of the Annual General Meeting for 15 minutes prior to the
commencement of the meeting and until its conclusion.
iv. A copy of the full Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December
2006, including the Remuneration Report referred to in Resolution 12, is also
available on our website, www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk.
v. As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001,
only those shareholders who are registered on the Company’s share register at
6:00 pm on 24 April 2007 shall be entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting
and to vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that
time. Changes to entries on the share register after 6:00 pm on 24 April 2007
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote
at the Meeting.

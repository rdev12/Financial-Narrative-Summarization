Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 01   
Operational highlights 
Oil production in 2014 averaged 3,523 barrels per day (bpd), a 14% decrease 
compared with 2013. In January 2014, suspended production of gas and condensate 
in the Palyanovo field primarily to conserve gas while we engage in discussions to 
commercialise these gas reserves.
The production performance of the Group’s first two horizontal wells was 
encouraging (10-day flow tests averaged 1,350 and 900 bpd for wells 214 and 251, 
respectively) 
• Spudded our first multiple fractured horizontal well (214) (MFHW) in April 2014. 
• In our second well (251), introduced for the first time in Russia innovative 
completion technology customised to our geological environment.
Successful focus on safety in our operations including implementation of the EMEX 
system to manage HSE performance. One minor lost-time injury in 2014.
Extended the subsoil licence for the Vostochno-Inginsky (“VI”) block until 2034.
 
Financial highlights 
Successful completion of financial restructuring in December 2014 (“the 
Restructuring”). As a result, US$52.3 million of new equity was raised, US$358.1 
million of existing debt and put option obligations were refinanced through a 
US$150 million loan with Bank Otkritie Financial Corporation (“Otkritie”), with the 
remaining US$208.1 million converted into a 25% equity position held by Mastin 
Holdings Limited (“Mastin”).
Revenues of US$55.1 million (down 31% Y-o-Y) due primarily to a 26% decline in 
liquids production, and a 9% decline in the realized oil price Y-o-Y.
Full year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)  
of US$9.5 million vs. US$13.0 million in 2013, driven mostly by the decline in 
production, and oil price, partially offset by Mineral extraction tax (“MET”)  
relief from September 2013. EBITDA per barrel of liquids was US$7.4 in both 2013 
and 2014.
Strengthened our partnership with Glencore by extending our export prepayment 
facility in March 2014 and entering into two domestic facilities in May 2014 and 
October 2014.
Net debt decreased by US$152.3 million from US$387.4 million at the beginning of 
the year to US$235.1 million at the end of 2014.
Net loss of US$262.9 million vs. net loss of US$74.2 million in 2013, driven mostly by 
the foreign exchange loss on US dollar denominated loans to the Group’s Russian 
subsidiaries (US$202.4 million).

SUSTAINABILITY
The seeds of Ruspetro’s failure in 2012-13 lay in the false 
perception that the key to unlocking the potential of the 
“hard to recover” oil in the Company’s licence areas was 
“simply” a production technology issue that could be 
solved by a combination of denser well spacing and  
larger hydraulic fractures in vertically-drilled wells.
While the introduction in 2014 of horizontal wells as a 
development concept has been important for the future 
prospects of Ruspetro, that in itself would have achieved 
little without a much more fundamental shift in thinking 
within the company.

We recognise that there are proven and applicable 
industry technologies that have not been deployed in 
Russia, perhaps for good reason: technology does not 
always jump continents easily. However, given the 
underperformance of the vertical wells to date, we do not

Chairman’s Statement
In the middle of the year, ambiguity about the impact of 
sanctions on the business forced Ruspetro into both 
cla r i fi c a t i o n s 	 a n d 	 c o n t i n g e n c y 	 a r ra n g e m e n t s 	 t o 	 e n su re 	
that operations were not hampered. In due course, that 
u n c e r t a i n t y 	 wa s 	 cla r i fi e d 	 a n d 	 o u r 	 te ch n o l og y 	 ha s 	 be e n 	
cleared for use.
Thereafter, what started as a modest decline in the oil 
price to below US$100 per barrel in the third quarter 
became a headlong plunge, coupled with a slump in the 
value of the ruble. While some stability has emerged in 
recent months in both the oil price and ruble/dollar 
exchange rate, the credibility of forecasters has gone, and 
we expect to live with both volatility and uncertainty for 
the medium term.
This macro-economic business context makes the 
transformational restructuring transaction that we 
completed in December all the more remarkable. Our 
l ia b i l i t i e s 	 ( i n cl u d i n g 	 d ebt 	 a n d 	 p u t 	 o pt i o n 	 o b l i g a t i o n s ) 	 w e re	
reduced by US$218.8 million, while we raised US$52.3 
million of new equity, and arranged loan facilities of up to 
US$144.7 million, in aggregate, for development and 
working capital. 
More important perhaps than the numbers is the 
relationship now established between Ruspetro and 
Otkritie, currently the largest private bank in Russia by 
assets. Otkritie and Sergey Gordeev are now our main 
lender and largest shareholder, respectively, and we are 
delighted that Sergey has joined our Board.
Successfully raising substantial development funds is a 
major milestone for the Company, and while the fall in oil 
prices impacted our revenues, the weakening of the ruble 
has driven down our dollar cost base such that we can drill 
economically attractive production wells at current oil 
prices. Nevertheless, given the extended period of low and 
volatile oil prices, the Board has decided that a cautious 
capital expenditure programme and a cautious use of loan 
facilities in 2015 is in the best interests of the Company, 
and that the capital invested should focus on maturing 
development opportunities for the medium term. This 
philosophy is outlined in the CEO’s review. 
It remains unclear how the oil and gas industry in Russia 
will respond in the medium term. A material reduction in 
activity seems unlikely given the dollar-equivalent cost 
reduction that all operators will experience. However, we 
can expect some opportunities to drive costs down further 
a s 	 se r v i c e 	 p ro v i d e r s 	 ma nag e 	 c a s h 	 fl ow . 	
In 2014, for a small 
exploration and 
production company 
operating with a 
technically-challenging 
portfolio, the business 
environment in Russia 
could hardly have been 
more difficult. Strategic Report

Our focus is on positioning Ruspetro for the medium 
term: understanding our reservoirs, managing risk, 
applying the right mix of technologies, enhancing our 
reputation as an innovative company and creating value 
from every well that we drill. In the medium term, this is 
expected to build substantial shareholder value. 
When 2014 started, there was a strong sense of optimism 
in Russia, particularly given the Winter Olympics in 
February. The dramatic events since, including ruble 
devaluation and unexpected crash in oil prices, have 
caused anxiety, and their consequences remain to be seen. 
However, within Ruspetro, we have made substantial 
progress in the way that we operate and think. We have 
rebuilt our technical core and our technical credibility. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our staff for

Chief Executive’s Statement
Since joining Ruspetro, it has been one of my top priorities 
to build upon and enhance our health, safety and 
e n v i ro n m e n t a l 	 ( ‘ H S E’ ) 	 a wa re n e s s 	 a n d 	 pe r fo r ma n c e.
In 2014, we appointed a HSE director to oversee our HSE 
practices, improve policies and ensure that we approach 
HSE issues in the most direct and effective manner. In 
addition, we successfully implemented the EMEX platform 
as a tool to log, monitor and action HSE improvements 
across all operational areas. I am pleased to report only 
one minor lost-time incident in 2014 relating to a slip and 
fall. Our aim is to continue our positive HSE momentum in 
the coming year.
Achievements in 2014
In April 2014, we introduced multiple-fractured 
horizontal wells into our operations. Initially this was 
rather simplistically conceived as a way of connecting the 
discontinuous sands that, with hindsight, had contributed 
to the poor outcome of the vertical well development 
programme in 2012-13.
However, by the second well, we had introduced a radical 
change in fraccing and completion thinking, abandoning 
the standard Western Siberian approach of a small number 
of large fracs, and moving to a concept based on a larger 
number of smaller fracs tuned to the sand distribution seen 
in the well. This required us to source technology proven in 
North America but hitherto unused in Russia
Similarly, we have introduced a number of other 
internationally established technologies to ensure that we 
maximise the insight from these early wells. These include 
geo-steering in the horizontal sections to assess sand 
continuity, and the use of tracers to assess the 
effectiveness of the fracs in each well. This knowledge  
has been embodied in the design of the wells that are to  
be drilled and completed by the second quarter of 2015. 
While I am impressed by the progress that we have made 
w i t h 	 o ur 	 first 	 t w o 	 h o r izo n ta l 	 w e lls 	 an d 	 t h e 	 fo ll ow - u p 	 in 	
early 2015, the reality is that we are still developing our 
understanding of the geology and in particular the possible 
play types in our acreage. Our efforts at geological 
characterisation in the last year have been hampered by a 
chronic geological data shortage resulting from missed data 
co ll ecti o n 	 o p po r t uni ti es 	 in 	 t h e 	 first 	 f ran ti c 	 d eve l o p m e n t 	
campaign in 2012-13. Furthermore, we are only just 
beginning to capitalise on the seismic contribution to 
unlocking our reserves. The bottom line is that that we have 
an immature resource base outside the core area.
Given this blunt assessment, the Board has endorsed a 
strategy starting in the second half of 2015 of an appraisal 
campaign designed to mature between 25 and 75 
development wells. This programme, which includes both 
vertical and horizontal wells, will underpin a resumption 
of our development well campaign in 2016, when we 
believe oil prices may have partly rebounded. 
The working environment 
in which Ruspetro staff 
and our contractors 
operate is particularly 
challenging. Strategic Report

• With an inventory of de-risked development wells, we 
will be able to plan and deliver a sustainable 
improvement in drilling and completion performance by 
driving learning, leveraging the market for services, and 
improving our operating practices.
• It will provide a sound basis for the generation of a 
coherent facilities plan based on a more realistic view of 
our future production levels and precisely where in our 
acreage they are being generated.

we are taking the opportunity of the suspension of 
production to collect key sub-surface data with a view to

Drilling Horizontal Wells 
With Multistage Fracs
• Drilling long horizontal wells  
is critical to increase the odds

reservoir bodies.
• Conducting multi-stage 
fracture stimulation will then 
ensure the reservoir volumes 
are effectively drained. 10 Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Microseismic Monitoring  
of Frac Stimulation
• Microseismic monitoring 
helps to understand fracture 
dimension and orientation so 
frac parameters and design can 
be tuned. 
• It is critical to understand 
whether frac grow in unwanted 
formation or fault zones.
• As a consequence horizontal 
wells can be placed in optimal

Costs and cash management
The restructuring transaction, while transformational for 
the longer term, was highly complex and inevitably 
time-consuming. Nevertheless, we were able to make a 
start with our horizontal well programme, using oil 
pre-payment facilities and an additional loan from 
L i m o l i n e s 	 T ra n spo r t 	 L i m i te d 	 ( ‘ L i m o l i n e s ’ ) , 	 o n e 	 o f	 
our main shareholders.
These early wells represent the evolution of our 
development thinking and technology application. 
Perhaps as importantly, they have driven a fundamental 
rebuild in our drilling services contracting strategy and 
allowed us to deliver a highly competitive benchmark well 
cost for the future. 
Despite the availability of new funds, a lower oil price is 
our reality. We will continue with a highly disciplined 
approach to managing our cash. As we have successfully 
done with our drilling costs, we will continue our drive to 
reduce to the greatest extent possible dollar-denominated 
services, and perhaps capitalise on the assumed  
slowdown in Russia to look for keen bids for any  
new capital expenditure.

oil-bearing sands. Three large fractures were placed in the

The Group’s second horizontal well, number 251, was 
spudded in June and a pilot well was drilled as planned. 
This well encountered eight metres of net oil sand, which 
was at the low end of expectations. Two sidetracks were 
thereafter required to overcome challenging hole 
conditions prior to entering the horizontal section. In this

crude oil price, though averaging almost US$100 per

dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2014. Having peaked 
in June 2014 at US$115, the Brent crude oil price had 
dropped to US$57 by the year-end, due to slower growth 
in major oil-consuming countries, soaring production of 
hard-to-extract crude oil in the US and Canada, and 
OPEC’s decision to maintain production levels.

exported 448 thousand boe and sold 854 thousand boe  
of crude oil and 7 thousand boe of condensate on the

saving from reduced MET following changes in tax 
legislation in relation to tight oil reservoirs available to  
the Group since September 2013.
Cost of sales
The cost of sales, including depreciation and production-
related taxes was US$51.7 million in 2014, compared  
with US$65.9 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily 
driven by a US$20 million reduction in MET due to a full

from the ruble depreciation towards the end of 2014,  
and savings of US$1 million in production services. These 
savings, however, were offset by a US$6.2 million increase 
in depletion expenses in 2014 due to temporary suspension 
of operations at Palyanovo, along with a US$1.1 million 
increase in repair and maintenance expenses and

Selling and administrative expenses (S&A)
S&A expenses include oil transportation costs, payroll

Comprehensive loss for the year and  
foreign exchange
The Group recorded a loss of US$262.9 million for 2014, 
compared with US$74.2 million in 2013. The 2014 result 
includes a foreign-exchange loss of US$202.4 million, 
compared with US$25.6 million in the previous year. The 
Group’s operating companies, whose functional currency 
is the Russian ruble, have borrowings in US dollars. As a 
result of the ruble devaluation, those borrowings in ruble 
terms have substantially increased, resulting in the 
accounting recognition of US$202.4 million in foreign-
exchange losses. After deducting the foreign-exchange 
losses from both years, the Group’s loss would have been 
US$60.5 million in 2014, compared with US$48.6 million 
in 2013.

Introduction
The Company holds licences for three blocks on the 
Krasnoleninsky arch near Khanty-Mansiysk in Western 
Siberia. There are two communities based within these 
blocks: Talinka, with a population of around 4,000, and 
Palyanovo with a population approaching 200. The 
Company recognises that it has a duty to safeguard the 
environment in its area of operations and preserve the 
way of life of those who live there.
To meet our sustainability obligations, we seek to:
• In crea se 	 o pe ra t i o na l 	 a n d 	 cost 	 ef fi ci e n ci es 	 in 	 p rod u c t i o n
• Recycle waste and minimise environmental harm
• Have open and positive communication with the 
communities in which we operate
• Work closely with local governmental agencies in 
meeting our obligations
• Ensure the safety of our assets and employees
• Create a high quality working environment for  
our employees
The year 2014 was one of reorganisation and continued 
consolidation for the Company. Drilling operations have 
improved greatly and new technologies were introduced, 
such as horizontal drilling and multiple fracturing. The

In addition, we successfully implemented the EMEX 
platform as a tool to log, monitor and action HSE 
improvements across all operational areas. The new 
system is a step change in the way we manage our HSE 
management system within the Company, enabling more 
comprehensive incident reporting, closed-loop incident 
investigation and follow-up.
2014 has been a year  
of reorganisation and 
continued consolidation 
for the Company. Strategic Report

Health, safety and the environment
In all our operations, be they drilling, production or 
construction, health and safety is an absolute priority,  
as is the environment. Not forgetting ethical standards, 
employee and community satisfaction are also a priority 
for the Company and are carefully considered throughout 
our daily operations. When tendering a contract, we try to 
encourage local contractors to behave similarly, and we 
have clear and transparent tendering procedures. All of 
our employees and contractors are held accountable for 
adhering to local health, safety and environmental 
standards and our ethical expectations. As a company,  
we pride ourselves on developing local resources in a 
responsible and ethical manner, while continually 
respecting all key stakeholders. 
Safety performance
Operating safely in all areas of our operations is a strict 
priority for the Ruspetro team. We believe that all 
accidents leading to any injuries, environmental impact or 
damage to our or contractors’ assets are preventable. This 
is 	 esse n t ia l 	 fo r 	 t h e 	 c a re 	 o f 	 o ur 	 e m p l o y ees 	 a n d 	 fo r 	 t h e 	 be n efi t 	
of our stakeholders and the communities and environment 
in which we operate. 
Ruspetro bases its internal management of safety on the 
following four key performance indicators for safety.
Lost-time injury (‘LTI’)
A lost-time injury is calculated as the sum of fatalities  
and lost-time accidents. An LTI is one that results in an 
employee or contractor being absent from work for three 
days or work shifts. During 2014, Ruspetro incurred one 
minor LTI. 
Accident frequency rate (‘AFR’)
The accident frequency rate measures the number  
of lost-time accidents per 200,000 work hours. 
Total recordable incident frequency (‘TRIF’)
Total recordable incident frequency is a broad metric 
d efi n e d 	 a s 	 t h e 	 t ot a l 	 n u m be r 	 o f 	 re c o rd a b l e 	 i n c i d e n t s 	 pe r 	
million working hours. It aims to capture all incidents 
during the year that required treatment by a medical 
professional, including fatalities, lost-time injuries and 
a n y 	 i n c i d e n t s 	 t re a te d 	 a s 	 a 	 fi r st 	 a i d 	 c a se. 	
Motor vehicle incident frequency (‘MVIF’)
MVIF refers to the total number of vehicle incidents per 
million kilometres. 
Internal safety standards
In 2012, Ruspetro introduced internal safety standards 
and procedures to improve its approach to safety. They  
are based on international guidelines recognised within 
the industry as best practice and have been developed to 
address the main risks faced by the industry. In 2013,  
they were implemented by supervisors and employees, 
who have continued training to ensure employees can 
identify risks correctly and act to mitigate them. At the 
end of 2014, procedures and processes used by our 
employees and contractors included:
• An occupational health and safety and industrial safety 
management system
• Occupational health and safety initial orientation 
programmes and initial toolbox talks
• Explicit HSE instructions and HSE requirements
• M a i n te na n c e 	 o f 	 spe c i fi c 	 j o b 	 d e scr i pt i o n s 	 fo r 	 a l l

Security
In 2014, Ruspetro’s main security goals continued to  
be the protection of employees, assets and technology.  
In 2013, the Company strengthened processes and 
p ro c e d u re s 	 fo r 	 i t s 	 o pe ra t i o n s, 	 fi na n c e s 	 a n d 	 p ro c u re m e n t 	 
of goods and services. In 2014, Ruspetro improved their 
security further by employing a security adviser. 
Environmental performance
The Company’s duty of care to the environment is of key 
importance. During 2012, the Company adopted an 
environmental protection programme via its main 
production subsidiaries INGA and Trans-oil, and  
this programme continued through 2013 and 2014.  
The production of oil causes four possible routes  
of contamination:
• At m osp h e r i c 	 e m i s si o n s 	 – 	 p r i n c i pa l ly 	 t h ro ug h 	 fla r i n g 	 o r 	
venting of associated gas
• Water emissions – mainly from associated produced 
water that is re-injected into the reservoir to maintain 
reservoir pressure; other water emissions are treated 
before being released into the environment
• Solid waste – mainly drilling cuttings, which are 
treated in the waste cuttings pit to neutralise and the 
pits are then re-cultivated; household waste is gathered 
a n d 	 t a k e n 	 t o 	 t re a t m e n t / la n d fi l l 	 fa c i l i t i e s 	 c o n t ra c te d 	
through third parties 
• Oil spillages and leaks – these are dealt with 
immediately, the source isolated, the area cleaned up 
and any contaminated soils are treated at offsite 
treatment facilities contracted through third parties  Strategic Report
Directors’ Report
Financial Statements
Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 2 3   
The programme aims to: 
• Reduce waste at source through design and operation
• Re-inject produced water
• Protect the natural water bodies and soil from 
contamination or damage from operations
• Optimise the use of existing land for pipeline and 
transportation routes and operational sites, while 
minimising land use in sensitive natural, community 
or historical areas
• Monitor the impact of operations on the environment
• Clean up any waste materials or oil spills using 
recognised reclamation procedures to allow the 
environment to recover

industry, the Russian federal government adopted a

Human rights
Our performance as a corporate entity is dependent on  
the performance of our employees as individuals. We 
therefore aim to achieve maximum employee satisfaction 
and ultimate standards of performance. To that end, we 
commit to:
• Respect and promote employees’ human rights, 
including freedom of association and the right to 
collective bargaining
• Provide a safe and healthy working environment
• Realise each employee’s individual potential through 
training and job promotion
• Respect the cultural diversity of our employees  
and support employment of local professionals from  
small communities
• Ensure equal opportunity without discrimination  
on the basis of age, culture, disability, gender, race  
and religion

Health, safety, and environment
Health and safety 
The Group conducts its business in a regulated 
industry and may be subject to claims and liabilities 
under environmental, health, safety and other laws 
and regulations, which could be material.
Ensuring that best HSE practices are in place is a 
focal point in all our activities. The Company adopted 
a set of HSE policies, appointed a HSE Director, and 
implemented a system to collect, process, and  
report HSE information. A renewed and updated 
programme of HSE training for our staff is currently 
being developed.
Operations, production and sales
Reserves and 
production 
forecasts
Reserves estimates and production forecasts are 
inherently uncertain; the Group’s total reserves  
may decline in the future and the Group may not 
achieve estimated production levels.
Internationally proven appraisal and development 
techniques are utilised to maximise the economically 
recoverable hydrocarbons for our reservoirs and 
rigorous probabilistic methodologies are in place 
for reserves assessment. In addition, appropriately 
risked production forecasting methodology is in 
place for forecasting and modelling purposes. 
Competent persons reports are prepared and released 
periodically, with the next one planned for the end  
of 2015.
Operational 
execution
Well and facility construction, and production 
operations involve numerous operational 
risks. These may result in losses or additional 
expenditures and lead to the Group not achieving

in operational execution. In addition, Ruspetro has 
a rigorous procedure of selecting contractors and 
prefers to use services of well known international 
companies. Importantly, insurance of drilling and 
operational risks is also in place.
Licence rights
The Group has the right to explore and extract 
o i l	a n d	g a s	w i t h i n	p a r t	o f	t h e	K r a s n o l e n i n s k	fi e l d	
in Western Siberia. If the Group’s appraisal and 
production licences are suspended, restricted, 
terminated or not extended prior to expiry, this 
would have a material adverse effect on the Group.
Renewal of mineral right licences is regulated by 
Russian legislation. A plan for the renewal of licences 
is in place, and a dedicated team for managing licence 
obligations has been established. Matters related to 
licence obligations are routinely reviewed at Audit 
Committee meetings.
Transportation 
route
The Group relies on the Transneft pipeline for 
transportation of its crude oil and does not  
have control over its functionality or the cost  
of its service.
R u s p e t r o ’ s	fi e l d s	a r e	s t r a te g i c a l l y	l o c a te d ,	w i t h	a c c e s s	
to various transportation routes. Delivery through 
the Transneft pipeline system is the most widely used 
option for Ruspetro, while rail and truck deliveries are 
available as an alternative to pipeline sales. The cost 
of Transneft services is regulated by the government 
and is predictable. The relative attractiveness of 
alternative sales routes is evaluated on a monthly 
basis and appropriate decisions to use a certain route 
are made accordingly.

Ruspetro has put in place insurance arrangements 
in accordance with the regulations in the markets in 
which it operates and given current business needs. 
Decisions to increase insurance coverage  
are evaluated on an ad hoc basis.
Reliance on third-
party contractors
The Group relies on the services of third parties, the 
availability and quality of which cannot be assured. 
The oil industry is intensely competitive and the 
Group may not be able to compete effectively with 
much larger competitors.
The Company has implemented rigorous procedures 
for selecting contractors. Engineering, subsurface, 
and drilling and completion teams ensure that the 
performance of contractors is properly monitored  
and managed.
Procurement

Business integrity
The Company is subject to the United Kingdom 
Bribery Act 2010. Its failure to comply with the laws 
and regulations thereunder could result in penalties 
that harm its reputation and have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business.
Internal policies based on the United Kingdom 
Bribery Act 2010 are in place and the Company is 
focused on ensuring their implementation.
Our approach is to actively understand and monitor the 
risks we are exposed to, and then to manage those risks  
b y 	 u si n g 	 a 	 p ra c t i c a l 	 a n d 	 flex ib l e 	 f ra m ew o rk 	 wh i ch 	 p ro v i d e s	
a consistent and sustained approach to risk assessment,  
so that their potential adverse effects are mitigated,  
where possible. 26 Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Financial
Oil prices
The Group may be adversely affected by a 
substantial or extended decline in prices  
for crude oil.
Thanks to its relatively small size, the Company 
can quickly evaluate changes in macroeconomic 
environment and adjust its operations if necessary. 
Although Ruspetro does not currently hedge its 
oil price exposure, hedging options are evaluated 
quarterly based on production forecast, pricing and 
other business needs. In addition, the Company’s oil is 
of comparatively better quality than the Urals blend, 
which allows Ruspetro to receive a premium for sales 
via rail or truck. When we make investment decisions, 
we strive to do so after careful consideration of 
various oil price scenarios.
Currency 
fluctuations

The majority of Company’s revenues are denominated 
in US$ or linked to international US$-based oil prices. 
On the other hand, all material service contracts 
are denominated in RUR or have caps on the RUR/
US$ exchange rate. Therefore, the Company’s 
costs expressed in US dollars decrease as the ruble 
depreciates, and vice versa. The Company currently 
manages its foreign exchange exposure without 
engaging in long-term currency hedging contracts, 
and this practice is reconsidered periodically as 
circumstances change.
Debt facility 
covenants
If the Group’s development plan does not succeed, 
the Group will be unable to comply with its 
current debt facility covenants or with their other 
requirements.
The Group’s medium-term planning is being done 
with careful consideration of debt facility covenants, 
and performance against covenants is evaluated on a 
monthly basis with the necessary adjustments made 
in a timely manner. In addition, covenants are based 
on cumulative four quarterly periods, which may

and skilled core workforce.
Long-term incentive programmes are in place for key 
personnel to attract and retain key management and 
staff. All new employees are interviewed by executives 
to ensure that interests are aligned and the right 
candidates are selected. Evaluations of management 
and staff are performed twice a year, with relevant 
actions taken thereafter.

with those of the other shareholders, and such 
concentrated ownership of the Company could affect 
the market price and liquidity of its shares.
The Company treats its shareholders equally

shareholders. Relationship agreements are in place

expansion of the Group’s dealings with any parties

Group’s business.
Most of the materials, machinery and equipment

key contractors are sourced locally or from non-

existing and new contractors are evaluated taking into 
consideration existing sanctions and advice from an 
external legal counsel.
Regional political 
instability
Political and governmental instability in Russia and 
the region could adversely affect the value of the 
Group’s investments in Russia.
The Company’s assets are located in Western Siberia, 
which limits the risks of operational distractions due 
to political instability. In addition, export sales are 
carried out without the use of export pipelines.
Regional 
economic 
instability
Economic instability in Russia and the region  
could adversely affect the value of the Group’s 
investments in Russia.
Our domestic sales netback is linked to the prevailing 
international oil price and is not impacted by regional 
economic stability. In addition, Ruspetro carefully 
monitors the prevailing economic environment  
to ensure that necessary operational adjustments  
are implemented.
Russian legal 
framework
The Russian legal system and Russian legislation 
continue to develope and this may create an  
uncertain environment for investment and  
for business activity.
The Legal framework in Russia was actively developed 
throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and recently became 
more stable. Licences and key contracts with 
g o ve rnm e n tal 	 o rg anis a ti o ns 	 ( e . g . 	 l an d 	 l eas es ) 	 ar e	
generally long-term and renewed in advance to the  
extent possible. In addition, our main contractors are 
internationally recognised companies capable of 
adapting if the legal environment changes. Some contacts 
are signed subject to English law to avoid ambiguity.
Russian taxation
The Russian taxation system is still in the process  
of developing and is subject to frequent changes  
that could have an adverse effect on the Group.
Ruspetro engages in ongoing dialogue on the current 
and future tax regime with the relevant ministries of 
the Russian government. In addition, Ruspetro enjoys 
c e r t a i n	t a x	b r e a k s	m a n d a te d	fo r	fi x e d	p e r i o d s	o f	1 0 - 1 5

Significant agreements – change of control 
There are no arrangements the operation of which may, at a later date, result in a change of control of the Company.
Employees
The Group employed an average of 205 staff during 2014. Most employees are based in the Russian Federation with only 11 employees at year 
end, including the Directors, employed in the UK. Since the Group has fewer than 250 employees in the UK, the Company is not required to 
disclose its policies in connection with employee involvement or the employment of disabled persons. However, full and fair consideration is 
always given to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their particular skills and abilities, or to the continuing 
employment of colleagues who become disabled during their career. 
Diversity
The Board continues to be supportive of providing equal opportunities in recruitment and succession planning at all levels of the business. 
The Company seeks to identify applicants from a wide experience and backgrounds and operates equal opportunity policies in all areas of its 
activities with the aim of creating a diverse pool of talent from which to recruit future senior positions.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
As for the prior year, the Company commissioned Trucost to assess the Group’s environmental data for 2014, including energy use,

Senior Management Team
Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain of its responsibilities to three standing committees; the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and 
the Remuneration Committee. Each Committee has adopted formal terms of reference which have been approved by the Board and the 
composition of each Committee is reviewed annually. The Committee Chairmen report to the Board following each Committee meeting  
and, where appropriate, make recommendations to the Board within their terms of reference. 
The reports of the standing Committees can be found on pages 38 to 45.
Balance and independence of Board members 
The Board comprises a balance of expertise, experience, independence and depth of knowledge of the Company, its business and its 
environment which enables its members to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. The mix of Executive and 
Non-executive Directors, including independent Non-executives, ensure that the Board encompasses a range of perspectives, thereby 
ensuring that no individual Director or group of Directors dominates the decision making process.
Board roles
Chairman 
Alexander Chistyakov was Chairman throughout 2014. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board and for ensuring that the 
Board and its Committees operate in a way that conforms to expected high standards of corporate governance. He sets the style and tone of

dissemination of the views of the Company’s stakeholders.
Chief Executive

supervises the Group’s strategy and overall commercial objectives and ensures that Board decisions are implemented. The Chief Executive is 
also responsible for promoting the Group’s values, culture and standards of conduct and behaviour throughout the business, which underpin

Internal control
The Group’s internal control systems are designed to manage, rather than to eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.

Any system of internal controls can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are correctly 
authorised and recorded and that any material errors and irregularities are detected within a reasonable timeframe and mitigated. Under the 
direction of the Audit Committee, the Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. This exercise included

Budgetary process
Each year, an annual budget is considered and approved by the Board. Actual results are reviewed at each Board meeting and reported 
against budget with revised forecasts being prepared where necessary. Separate approval processes and authority limits are in place for 
expenditure items.

High quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment. The ethical standards expected of employees. Corporate 
policies and behaviour are presented and addressed during the monthly staff meetings and by regular internal updates on the intranet.

focus on developing the Group’s internal management capability and resources to implement its business plan. During 2015 therefore, an Internal 
Audit Charter will be developed, outlining the internal audit function’s objectives, authority, scope and responsibilities and an Internal Audit 
Manager appointed.
External auditor
PwC was appointed as external auditor of the Company in December 2011. The Committee maintains an arms-length relationship with  
PwC and meets with the lead audit partner and other members of the senior external audit team at least once a year without management 
being present.
Independence and the provision of non-audit services
In order to ensure that the independence and objectivity of the external auditor is maintained, the Company has adopted a policy on the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor. The policy clearly sets out the services which may and may not be provided by the 
external auditor and the authorisation and pre-approval process which must be followed.

Audit effectiveness and tender of audit services
At its meeting in April 2015, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process. This review included an assessment of 
the quality of the external auditor’s reports to the Committee, the lead audit partner’s interaction with Committee members and members  
of the Company’s management team and the knowledge and experience of the external audit team members.

In the meantime, PwC has expressed its willingness to continue as the Company’s external auditor and the Committee has recommended 
that a resolution be put to the forthcoming AGM for the re-appointment of PwC as external auditor.

To review the structure of the Board As the Company continued to enhance its horizontal drilling 
strategy, the Committee reviewed the balance of skills and 
experience required on the Board. As a result, the Committee, 
through its Chairman, approached Dr Mark Pearson, an experienced 
upstream oil and gas entrepreneur with outstanding success in the 
application of multiple fractured horizontal wells in the USA and  
oil and gas experience in Russia, with a view to his appointment  
as an independent Non-executive Director. Each of the remaining 
Committee members together with the Chief Executive met with or 
spoke to Dr Pearson regarding his experience and his commitment 
to Russia prior to the Nomination Committee recommending his 
appointment to the Board.
To review Committee composition In light of Mr McBurney’s resignation and Dr Pearson’s appointment 
to the Board, the Committee reviewed the membership of the

and will apply until 2 June 2017 unless otherwise amended.
Awards under the Performance Share Plan The Committee considered management’s proposals in relation to 
the quantum, nominees and performance conditions of awards 
under the Performance Share Plan. A number of performance 
conditions were proposed by management and, after consideration, 
the Committee believed that the most appropriate performance 
condition for any award granted in 2014 was absolute share price 
performance. Further information is provided on page 50 of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Bonus payments In January 2014, the Committee considered the extent to which the 
corporate KPI for 2013 had been met and any bonus payable to the 
Executive Directors. While the Committee noted that the 2013 
corporate KPI had been partially met, it was agreed that the overall 
Company performance did not merit payment of a corporate bonus. 
Nevertheless, in order to retain the services of the Executive

relation to his UK salary. In addition, following year end, the 
Committee reviewed and approved the settlement agreements

business as well as for departing Executives.

Committee membership 
The Committee membership has been stable this year following my appointment to the Committee, and then as Chairman, in January 2014. 
Since year end, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board has also appointed Mark Pearson as an additional member 
of the Committee. His knowledge and experience of the oil and gas exploration industry has been greatly appreciated by the Board and we 
look forward to his contributions to Committee discussions in 2015.
Changes to the Executive remuneration structure for 2015
As disclosed in last year’s annual report, with effect from 1 April 2014, the Chief Executive’s annual salary was temporarily reduced from 
US$1,050,000 to US$970,000. This temporary reduction has ended and effective from 1 December 2014, John Conlin’s salary reverted to 
the sum agreed on his appointment. No other changes to the salary of the Executive Directors have been proposed for 2015 and the

year ended 31 December 2014 and details are set out in the Implementation Report which follows.
Alignment with shareholders
As detailed in last year’s annual report, the Board resolved to pay a portion of Executive and Non-executive Directors’ salaries for the period 
from 1 April 2013–31 March 2014 in shares. As well as providing the Company with cash savings during the year, this proposal strengthened 
the link between the interests of the Directors as whole and those of our shareholders. The relevant proportion of each Director’s salary or fees 
was converted into shares at the 2012 IPO price of 134 pence per share.
These shares were issued to Directors on 19 December 2014 following the conclusion of the Restructuring. Strategic Report

At the AGM held on 2 June 2014, our shareholders passed a resolution to adopt the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for 2014 and future years. 
For ease of reference, a summary of that Policy has been included on pages 54 to 60.

Vesting will be on a straight-line basis and is dependent on the Company’s performance against a share price target as set out in the table below:

The Committee believes that share price growth is the most appropriate measure of performance for the year ending 31 December 2015 given 
the current market price of the Company’s shares. By setting this as the performance measure for the Performance Share Plan, Executive 
Directors will be encouraged to deliver strong share price growth as a priority. The share price used to assess performance will be the 
average for the 90 days ending on 31 December 2015. However, in order to fully align the interests of Executive Directors with those of our

Non-executive Director fees
The basic annual fee payable to the Non-executive Directors remains at US$120,000. With effect from February 2015, the Non-executive 
Directors appointed under the terms of the Relationship Agreements with Limolines and Mastin respectively, agreed to waive their fees. 
Therefore, with effect from February 2015 inclusive, neither Mr Kirill Androsov nor Mr Sergey Gordeev will receive a fee in relation to their 
appointment as Non-executive Directors. 
The 2015 fees for the remaining Non-executive Directors are as set out below:

experience to deliver the 
Company’s strategic objectives.
– Executives currently have two elements to their 
salary: a UK element and a Russian element.
– Executive Director salaries may be paid in cash, 
Company shares, or a mixture of both.
– The Committee takes a number of factors into 
account when setting Executive Directors’ 
salaries, including:
 •  The individual’s skills, experience and  
recent performance
 •  The scope of the role
 •  Business performance and affordability
 •  Typical salary levels at comparable companies
 •  Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company 
–   Salaries are typically reviewed annually, with 
any change taking effect from 1 January. 
However, the Committee may determine  
salary changes at any other time as it  
considers appropriate.
–  Whilst there is no absolute maximum, salary 
increases for Executive Directors will generally 
be in line with the average increase awarded in 
the wider employee population within the 
relevant geographic area.
–  Higher increases may be awarded in certain 
circumstances, at the Committee’s discretion. 
For example, this may include:
  •  An increase in the scope and/or responsibility 
of the individual’s role; 
  •  A new Executive Director being moved to 
market positioning over time; or
  •  Where the Committee considers that there is a 
genuine commercial need to do so.
– None. 
– However, the performance of the individual in 
the role is one of the considerations taken into 
account by the Committee in setting the level of 
salary and any future changes.

are assessed following the year end.
– Bonuses may be paid either in cash or in shares 
in the Company at the Committee’s discretion 
following the Committee’s determination of

– Where the Committee decides to make awards 
in shares, these may be deferred to such later 
date as the Committee determines. In such 
circumstances, share awards may incorporate 
the right to receive the value of dividends, 
which may assume reinvestment of those 
awards in the Company’s shares. 
– The Committee may take such action as it 
considers appropriate to clawback any bonus 
paid or payable if events happen which may 
have an effect on bonus awards

measures at the start of each year, ensuring that 
these are aligned to the Company’s key strategic 
objectives for the year.
– These will usually include production 
me a s u r e s , 	 fi n a nc i a l 	 me a s u r e s 	 a nd 	 ke y 	 s t r a te g ic 	
and operational milestones. The award based

– Financial measures will be based on a sliding 
scale from threshold to maximum performance. 
– All payments are subject to the Committee’s 
discretion.
– Where the Committee reasonably determines 
that any performance condition is no longer a 
fair measure of performance the Committee 
m ay 	 ( a ) 	 w a i ve 	 t h a t 	 c ond it ion 	 or 	 ( b ) 	 a mend 	 it	
provided that the amended performance 
condition is, in the opinion of the Committee, a 
fairer measure. 
– The Committee, in its sole discretion, may also 
determine that no performance condition will 
apply to all or some of the award. 56 Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Performance Share Plan
To link a substantial 
proportion of reward to the 
achievement of long-term 
shareholder value creation as 
Ruspetro moves into the next 
stage of its development.
– Eligible employees may receive awards, the 
vesting of which is usually based on 
performance over a reasonable period, as 
determined by the Committee. Awards may be 
s e t t le d 	 i n 	 c a sh 	 or 	 sh a r e s 	 ( i n 	 t he 	 for m 	 of	
conditional share awards or nil-cost or market 
v a l ue 	 o pt ion s ) .	
– The Committee sets performance targets which 
are assessed by it following the end of the 
relevant performance period.
– The Committee may determine that any awards 
vesting under the plan must be held by the 
Company for an additional period following 
vesting before being released to Directors.
– Share awards may be reduced or cancelled at 
any time prior to vesting, at the discretion of the 
Committee, in certain circumstances such as a 
m a ter i a l 	 m i s s t a temen t 	 of 	 a ud ite d 	 fi n a nc i a l

Notes to the Policy table
Performance measures 
Annual bonus plan: The actual bonus measures and targets are set by the Committee at the start of each year, to ensure that Executive 
Directors are appropriately focused on the Company’s short-term and medium-term objectives. The aim is to provide an appropriate balance 
bet w e e n 	 i n c e n t iv i si n g 	 t h e 	 a ch i e ve m e n t 	 o f 	 a n n ua l 	 p rod u c t i o n 	 a n d 	 fi na n c ia l 	 t a r g et s 	 a n d 	 t o 	 d e l ive r 	 k e y 	 st ra teg i c 	 a n d 	 o pe ra t i o na l 	 m i l e st o n e s. 	
This balance allows the Committee to effectively reward performance against the key elements of our strategy.

conditions. Such circumstances will include situations where retention of management is considered to be a key priority for the year, and 
where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders.

performance and on value delivered to shareholders would be appropriate for the PSP. The exact measures are chosen to be aligned with the 
long-term strategy of the Company, however the Committee considers that strong performance under these measures should result in 
sustainable value creation for both shareholders and Executive Directors.
Provisions for the recovery of sums paid and the withholding of payments apply to payments in the manner explained in this report. There 
are no other such provisions relating to Directors.

Recruitment policy
The Committee’s policy on recruitment is to offer remuneration packages which facilitate the employment of individuals with the requisite 
knowledge, expertise and experience to deliver Company’s strategic objectives. When appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee 
seeks to ensure that remuneration arrangements are appropriate and in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders. Strategic Report
Directors’ Report
Financial Statements
Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 5 7   
Generally, pay on recruitment will be consistent with the usual policy for Executive Directors as set out in the policy table above. However, 
the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, include remuneration components or awards which are not set out in the policy table where 
this would facilitate the recruitment of candidates of an exceptional calibre and skill-set, including market competitive pension 
arrangements, where necessary. The Committee will ensure that this is only done where there is a genuine commercial need and where  
this is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The absolute maximum level of variable pay set on recruitment will be  
in accordance with the policy table. The Committee does not propose to make any non-performance related payments on recruitment. 
In certain circumstances, the Committee may need to buy-out long-term incentive arrangements relinquished on leaving a previous 
employer. When doing so, the Committee will take a number of relevant factors into account, including but not limited to performance 
conditions attached to these awards and the time and likelihood of vesting. Any payments or awards made under these circumstances are 
excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above.
The Committee may, in a recruitment scenario, rely upon the Listing Rules exemption from shareholder approval to implement 
arrangements to facilitate the recruitment of a Director.
Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors has a UK plc and a Russian service contract, details of which are shown below:
UK plc contracts
Name Commencement of appointment Date of service contract Notice period by either party
John Conlin 17 December 2013 31 January 2014 Six months
Tom Reed 1 December 2011 16 December 2011 Six months

Tom Reed 1 June 2011 1 January 2012 Six months
Alexander Chistyakov 12 June 2012 12 June 2012 Six months
Both Alexander Chistyakov and Tom Reed agreed that, with effect from 1 April 2014, the notice periods under their UK contract be reduced 
from twelve months’ to six months’ notice by either party. As detailed earlier in this report, Tom Reed resigned from the Board on 2 February 
2015. The Company may terminate employment under the UK contracts by making a payment in lieu of the individual’s notice period plus

A Director’s contract can be brought to an immediate end in limited circumstances, provided the reasons for such termination comply  
with Russian law. In addition, contracts may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties on payment of six months’ base salary.
 
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are available from the Company Secretary.
Policy on payment to Executive Directors for loss of office
The Committee takes a number of factors into account when determining leaving arrangements for Executive Directors:
• The Committee will give due consideration to the circumstances under which a Director left. 
• The Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations agreed with the Executive Director. This is dependent on the contractual 
o b l i g a t i o n s 	 ( i ) 	 n ot 	 be i n g 	 i n 	 c o n t ra d i c t i o n 	 w i t h 	 t h e 	 po l i c y 	 set 	 o u t 	 i n 	 t h i s 	 re po r t, 	 o r 	 ( i i ) 	 i f 	 so , 	 n ot 	 ha v i n g 	 be e n 	 e n te re d 	 i n t o 	 o r 	 a m e n d e d

In such circumstances the Committee may use its discretion to determine that an Executive Director may be eligible to receive an 
appropriate bonus amount for the year in which he left, which would be subject to performance up to the date of termination and pro-rated 
for time, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee may also approve a contribution towards a departing executive’s legal 
or other professional costs, where appropriate.

Change of control
Bonus
In the event of a takeover or merger the Committee may make bonus awards early having made such adjustments to the size of awards and 
any relevant performance targets as it considers appropriate. Where bonus awards are made in shares, in the event of any variation of the 
Company’s share capital, demerger, special distribution, change of control, delisting or other transaction which would in the opinion of the 
Committee affect the current or future value of shares, the Committee may allow awards to vest early or amend the terms of any  
such awards. 
PSP
In the event of a takeover of the Company, outstanding awards under the PSP will vest on the date on which the change of control occurs;

these circumstances, at the Committee’s discretion. Alternatively, awards may be exchanged for shares in the acquiring company. 
In the event of a demerger, special distribution or other transaction or arrangement that in the opinion of the Committee would affect the 
current future value of the awards, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a takeover.

Director fees 
To enable the Company to attract and  
retain high calibre Non-executive Directors with  
substantial experience of leading and advising large 
international companies within the Company’s sector  
and with Russian and UK experience.
Fees may be paid in cash, in shares in the Company or a 
mixture of both, taking account of the typical time 
commitment and the level of involvement required, as well  
as the challenging sector and geography within which the 
Company operates insofar as this impacts the demands 
placed on the role. The Company’s Articles do not set a 
maximum level of fees payable.
In addition to the basic Non-executive Director fee, 
additional fees may be paid for the performance of special 
services, including but not limited to the election of one of 
their number as Chairman of the Board, as Senior 
Independent Director or to the chairmanship of  
any Committee.

Non-executive Director letters of appointment
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts and their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Each appointment is for an 
initial term of three years, subject to re-election at each AGM and may be terminated by either party on one month’s notice. Non-executive 
Directors are not entitled to any compensation beyond their notice period, where appropriate, on leaving the Board. Copies of the letters of 
appointment for Non-executive Directors are available from the Company Secretary.
 
Consideration of pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company
When considering the remuneration arrangements for the Company’s Executive Directors, the Committee gives due regard to the pay and 
conditions of employees throughout the Company. The Committee recognises that the roles and responsibilities of Executive Directors are 
such that the structure of remuneration will be different from that of the wider employee population, with a greater proportion of Executive

the Company when considering Executive Directors’ salaries and while due regard is given to employee views, the Committee does not 
directly consult with employees on executive remuneration matters.
Remuneration arrangements across the Company
The remuneration policy for our Executive Directors has been designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that 
underpin remuneration for the wider Group. While the structure may differ, all reward arrangements are built around the common 
objectives and principles outlined below:
• Reward should be driven by performance – 	 rewa rd s 	 p ro v i d e d 	 t h ro ug h 	 t h e 	 re m u n e ra t i o n 	 po l i c y 	 a re 	 fa i r ly 	 e a r n e d 	 a n d 	 j u st i fi e d 	 b y 	
performance. To that effect, a proportion of remuneration should be performance-related and linked to both individual and corporate 
performance. The intention is to ensure that individuals are rewarded based on their contribution to the Group and on the success of  
the Group.
• Pay should be competitive in the relevant market – rewards are intended to be competitive in the market without paying more than is 
necessary to recruit and retain individuals. Within this framework, reward packages may differ based on the location, seniority and level 
of responsibility of each individual.
Consideration of the views of our shareholders
The Committee is committed to ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and welcomes feedback on our remuneration policy and its

estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in 
these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in 
t h e 	 fi na n c ia l 	 st a te m e n t s.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas

compliance over the projected period. Our conclusion on going 
concern is below.
Accounting for the Debt Restructure
The Group completed the transfer and simultaneous restructuring 
of its existing debt and put option obligations with Sberbank and 
with a debt and equity obligation with a new provider Bank Otkritie 
and Mastin Holdings Limited respectively.
We obtained legal and other supporting documentation completed in 
connection with the transfer of the debt and put option, along with 
appropriate approvals from the Board of Directors. The accounting of 
restructure was tested to ensure it complied with the applicable

Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
Auditing standards require that we consider the risk of fraud in 
revenue recognition. 
We have focused on the potential manipulation of revenue by the 
manual posting of journal entries on top of the day-to-day recording 
of transactions. We have also tested the amount and timing of revenue 
recognition, taking into account the key revenue streams, contractual 
obligations and validity of manual journal entries.
Risk of management override of internal controls
Auditing standards require that we consider the risk that 
management may override controls within the organisation.

performance measures and as a result, fraud risk, due to over-ride 
of controls and/or manipulation of results may be increased.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including 
the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions, 
and interviewed senior management and those responsible for Group’s

to fraud. In particular, we tested key reconciliations and manual

On 14 November 2014 an extension of existing shareholder loans was agreed until October 2016 and February 2020.
As further discussed in Note 20, the credit facility obtained from Otkritie contains certain covenants which the Group needs to meet to avoid 
acceleration of the debt repayment schedule. The two sensitive covenants are EBITDA and production volumes.

its EBITDA covenant for the year ending 31 December 2015 and four consecutive quarters ending 31 March 2016. The main reason for this  
is a substantial decline of the oil price, which is beyond the control of the Group. To mitigate this risk, management has commenced 
negotiations with Otkritie to revise the covenants to a level that is within the current forecasts. The Group has also received, in April 2015,

3. Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights, or otherwise has power to 
exercise control over their operations. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no 
longer consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses 
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary accounting policies 
for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Oil and natural gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditure 
Oil and gas exploration activities are accounted for in a manner similar to the successful efforts method. Costs of successful development 
and exploratory wells are capitalised.
Development costs
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of 
development wells, including unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalised within oil and gas properties.
Property, plant and equipment, Mineral rights and other intangibles
Oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment, including mineral rights are stated at cost, less accumulated depletion, 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into 
operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation, and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The purchase price or 
construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.

separately considered as a component, the replacement value is used to estimate the carrying amount of the replaced assets which is 
immediately written off. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programs are capitalised and amortised over the period to  
the next inspection. All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at the amount initially recognised, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets include computer software.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, except for 
mineral rights that are depleted on the unit-of-production basis as explained above.
Impairment of assets
The Group monitors internal and external indicators of impairment relating to its tangible and intangible assets.

A provision for impairment is recognised when there is an objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due

4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period  
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Subsoil licences
The Group conducts operations under exploration and production licences which require minimum levels of capital expenditure and mineral 
production, timely payment of taxes, provision of geological data to authorities and other such requirements. The current periods of the 
Group’s licences expire between December 2015 and June 2034. 
The Russian regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in issuing and renewing licences and in monitoring licensees’ compliance 
with licence terms. The loss of licence would be considered a material adverse event for the Group.

considers that the licence held by Trans-oil, which was extended for three years to December 2015, will be further extended. This further 
extension will be dependent on management demonstrating to the licensing authorities that associated petroleum gas produced in the course 
of oil production is being utilised.

Estimation of oil and gas reserves
Unit-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are principally measured based on Group’s estimates of proved 
developed and proved and probable oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved and probable reserves are also used in determination of 
impairment charges and reversals. Proved and probable reserves are estimated by an independent international reservoir engineers,  
by reference to available geological and engineering data, and only include volumes for which access to market is assured with  
reasonable certainty.
Information about the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties and the depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged is provided in 
Notes 13 and 14.
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgements and are subject to regular revision,  
either upward or downward, based on new information such as from the drilling of additional wells, observation of long-term reservoir 
performance under producing conditions and changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms or development plans. 
Changes to Group’s estimates of proved and probable reserves affect prospectively the amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortisation 
charged and, consequently, the carrying amounts of mineral rights and oil and gas properties.

revenues from external customers in 2014 and 2013 were derived from sales of crude oil and gas condensate. These sales are made to 
domestic and international oil traders. Although there are a limited number of these traders, the Group is not dependent on any one of them 
as crude oil is widely traded and there are a number of other potential buyers of this commodity. The Group’s operations are entirely located 
in Russia.
The Company’s Board of Directors evaluates performance of the entity on the basis of different measures, including total expenses, capital 
expenditures, operating expenses per barrel and others.

Sberbank credit facility On 10 December 2014 an assignment and transfer agreement was entered into between Ruspetro Russia, 
Ruspetro Holding Limited and Mastin. In accordance with the agreement, the creditor rights in relation to the total debt in the amount of 
US$337,894 thousand being due to Sberbank as at 10 December 2014 were transferred to Mastin. Part of the loan in the amount of 
US$150,000 thousand was repaid through the corresponding credit facility provided by Otkritie in December 2014. The remaining part of 
the loan in the amount of US$187,894 thousand was settled by the issuance to Mastin of new ordinary shares in the Company.

14 November 2014, the Group rescheduled the maturity of the main Shareholders’ loans until October 2016 and February 2020 with 
US$5,000 thousand payable in accrued interest on 31 May 2015. These amendments did not substantially alter the terms of these original 
loans, and were therefore were not treated as extinguishment of an existing liability and recognition of a new liability. The present value 
difference arising from the renegotiation was recognised over the remaining life of these loans by adjusting the effective interest rate.
Foreign exchange losses The Group recognised a net foreign exchange loss amounting to US$202,410 thousand and US$25,586 
thousand during the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 respectively, out of which US$196,084 thousand and US$24,694 thousand 
relate to the US$ denominated credit facilities and outstanding accrued interest for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 respectively.

Glencore. The US$10,000 thousand outstanding under the Original Facility was paid down in full as part of the new facility, resulting in net 
proceeds of US$20,000 thousand to the Group.

Liquidity of subsidiary undertakings
In accordance with the legal framework in the Russian Federation, creditors and tax authorities may initiate bankruptcy proceedings against 
an entity with negative net assets. As at 31 December 2014, Ruspetro Russia reported net liabilities under Russian GAAP. However, no such 
bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated either by the creditors or the tax authorities against them. The Directors consider such net 
liability position to be not abnormal given that the Group is still at a development stage.
Operating lease commitments – Group as Lessee
The Group has entered into leases for land plots, woodlots and motor vehicles. The land in the Russian Federation on which the Group’s 
production facilities are located is owned by the State. The Group leases land through operating lease agreements, which expire in various 
years through 2034. These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee at lease payments based on market prices at the time of 
renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

Taxation contingencies
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. Management’s 
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant regional and 
federal authorities in the Russian Federation. 
Recent events within the Russian Federation indicate that the Russian tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their 
interpretation of the prevailing legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and activities which have not been challenged 
in the past may be challenged in the future. The Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation has issued guidance to lower courts on

Amended Russian transfer pricing legislation took effect from 1 January 2012. The new transfer pricing rules appear to be more technically 
elaborate and, to a certain extent, better aligned with the international transfer pricing principles developed by the Organisation for

Management believes that its pricing policy is arm’s length and it has implemented internal controls to be in compliance with the new 
transfer pricing legislation. 
Given that the practice of implementation of the new Russian transfer pricing rules has not yet developed, the impact of any challenge of the

will be sustained. Where management believes it is probable that a position cannot be sustained, an appropriate amount is accrued for in

Operating environment of the Group 
The Russian Federation displays certain characteristics of an emerging market. Its economy is particularly sensitive to oil and gas prices.  
The legal, tax and regulatory frameworks continue to develop and are subject to varying interpretations.
Political and economic turmoil witnessed in the region, including the developments in Ukraine have had and may continue to have a negative

Environmental matters
The enforcement of environmental regulation in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture of government authorities 
is continually being reconsidered. The Group periodically evaluates its obligations under environmental regulations. As obligations are 
determined, they are recognised immediately. Potential liabilities, which might arise as a result of changes in existing regulations, civil 
litigation or legislation, cannot be estimated but could be material. In the current enforcement climate under existing legislation,

Capital risk management
The Group considers capital to comprise both debt and equity. Total debt comprises long-term and short-term loans and borrowings, as

and retained earnings. Equity of the Group was equal to US$75,740 thousand and US$95,261 thousand as at 31 December 2014 and  
2013 respectively.
Total debt of the Group was equal to US$247,104 thousand and US$403,199 thousand as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 
respectively.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide

existing capital and raise additional amounts as needed.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the period. As at 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group was

Commodity price risk
The Group sells crude oil and gas condensate under spot contracts on a monthly basis. Sales are centrally managed and during the reporting

Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from borrowing in currencies other than the functional currency. 
The Group limits foreign currency risk by monitoring changes in exchange rates in the currencies in which its cash and borrowings  
are denominated.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk at the end of the reporting period was mainly concentrated in the Otkritie  
credit facility. Strategic Report

credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The credit 
risk on cash is limited because the counterparties are either highly rated banks or banks approved by the management of the Group. 
Approval is made after certain procedures are performed to assess the reliability and creditworthiness of banks.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. 
The Company has incurred a loss from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2014 and the effect of considering the exercise 
of the options on the Company’s shares would be anti-dilutive, that is, it would reduce the loss per share.

Reserve quantity information
The Company used the oil, condensate and gas reserve information prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton to evaluate reserves as at 
31 December 2013 and 30 June 2014. The reserves estimate as at 31 December 2014 was made by the Company by adjusting reserves  
numbers as at 30 June 2014 for actual oil production in the second half of 2014. No third party was involved in estimating reserves as at

Probable reserves are those additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered 
than proved reserves but more certain to be recovered than possible reserves. It is equally likely that actual remaining quantities recovered

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the necessarily limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are inherently imprecise, require 
the application of judgement and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.

At 31 December 2014, the Company had net current assets of $14,308 thousand, which included cash in hand of $8,121 thousand. 
Management considers that the continued operational existence of the Company is dependent upon the ability to make further investment in

The development loan agreement obtained contains certain covenants which the subsidiary needs to meet to avoid acceleration of the debt 
repayment schedule. The two sensitive covenants are EBITDA and production volumes.

Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of non-financial assets

the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher 
of the asset’s net realisable value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.

After initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any 
provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is recognised when there is an objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the loans and receivables. The amount of provision is the difference between the assets’ carrying value and

Rights and obligations attaching to ordinary shares
The rights and obligations of shareholders are set out in the Company’s Articles. A summary of the rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s shares are as follows:
Voting
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to:
• receive all shareholder documents, including notice of any general meetings of the Company;
• attend, speak and exercise voting rights at any general meetings of the Company either in person or by proxy; and
• subject to applicable law and the Company’s Articles every shareholder shall have one vote for every share of which they are the holder if 
they are present in person, by proxy or, if a corporate shareholder, by a duly authorised representative. A shareholder, entitled to attend 
and vote at a general meeting, may appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote instead of him. If a shareholder appoints more than one 
proxy the shareholder must specify the number of shares over which each proxy is entitled to exercise rights. 
No shareholder holds securities carrying special rights as to the control of the Company. There are no agreements between holders of 
securities that are known to the Company which may result in restrictions on the transfer of voting rights.

may approve. An instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and, unless the share is fully paid, by or on behalf of 
the transferee. An instrument of transfer need not be under seal. The transferor shall remain the holder of the shares concerned until the

dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may also pay interim dividends. No dividend may be paid other

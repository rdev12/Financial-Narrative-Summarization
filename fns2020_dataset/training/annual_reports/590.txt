Strategic Report
At a Glance
Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc (‘Al Noor’ or the ‘Company’) 
is the largest private healthcare company in Abu Dhabi, 
capturing 30% of all private in-patient admissions and 
29% of all private out-patient hospital visits. Our Company 
currently operates within three hospitals and 17 medical 
centres and clinics which are primarily located in the Emirate 
of Abu Dhabi with one further clinic in Muscat, Oman. 
Al Noor employs more than 4,000 staff and approximately 
5,400 patients entrust us with their health care needs every day.
Al Noor offers a wide spectrum of healthcare services within the 
primary, secondary, and tertiary care sectors and is the only 
private healthcare organisation in Abu Dhabi that has a full 
network, or ‘continuum’ of health services. Our broad range of 
diverse services provides patients with ‘seamless care’ as they 
move from service to service according to their changing health 
needs – from preventative care to the most complex services.
Not only does our Company focus on providing the types 
of services needed across the Emirate, Al Noor is also 
dedicated to providing an exceptional patient experience. 
The latest Health Authority-Abu Dhabi (‘HAAD’) statistics 
show that, among private providers in Abu Dhabi, Al Noor is 
a leader when it comes to in-patient satisfaction with all three 
of its hospitals placed in the top four in Abu Dhabi.

Al Noor is devoted to ensuring that our services fully and 
effectively meet the needs of our patients and the 
communities we serve. We have opened facilities over a wide 
area of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, providing ‘closer to home’ 
care to as many people as possible. Furthermore, our 
patients are able to receive all of their care, from treating an 
ear infection to cardiac surgery, within the Al Noor healthcare 
system.
Al Noor has a strategic presence in the three main 
geographical areas of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi: with medical 
centres in Abu Dhabi City, Al Ain, and the Western Region. 
The first two are densely populated and have high patient 
volumes. As flagship facilities, our three in-patient hospitals 
are well positioned, with two in the city of Abu Dhabi and one 
in the city of Al Ain. The hospitals are in ideal locations to 
support future growth and expansion.
Leading Operator
With comfortable modern facilities, the latest medical and 
diagnostic equipment, and world class staff, Al Noor 
hospitals are renowned in the UAE for delivering 
exceptional standards of patient care. All three Al Noor 
hospitals hold JCI accreditation and ISO certification. They 
boast high staff-to-patient ratios and enjoy consistently 
high patient satisfaction scores.
The Company operates 17 out-patient medical centres in 
the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the Emirate of Dubai, and the 
Sultanate of Oman, all of which opened between 2002 and 
2014. The medical centres provide out-patient and 
diagnostic services, with general practice and some 
medical specialties.

Strategic Report
Ian Tyler
Non-Executive Chairman
“After last year’s outstanding 
performance, I am pleased to report 
that this year has been another 
strong year. Furthermore, it has been 
a year of transition, with the 
appointment of a new Chief 
Executive and two more changes in 
the executive team. This team has 
been tasked with continuing to build 
on the successes of the past which 
have led to Al Noor being the market 
leader in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. 
We have set the bar high, yet feel 
confident that the new leadership 
can take Al Noor into the future and 
through ever greater focus on our 
patients and services, deliver value 
to shareholders.”
We continued to deliver well against our 
strategy in 2014. Our performance was 
driven by organic growth, fuelled by the 
expansion of services in our hospitals, and 
the opening of three new medical centres, 
with more planned to open in 2015. 
The acquisition of Gulf International 
Cancer Centre, the only private cancer 
centre in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 
strategically positions the Company to 
deliver care in the rapidly-growing 
oncology segment. Additionally, 
management continued to integrate the 
acquisitions made in 2013.
We have seen new competing physical 
capacity coming into the market in 
Abu Dhabi during the year and we expect 
further new capacity in 2015. However, 
our leading market position in Abu Dhabi 
supported by continuing investment in 
facilities, physicians, and new service lines 
and our focus on medical quality puts us 
in a strong position to continue to look 
after our patients and grow shareholders’ 
value despite these long anticipated 
competitive challenges.
We continue to make the investments 
necessary to deliver growth. At least four 
additional medical centres are expected to 
become operational in 2015, including one 
in Sharjah, the third largest emirate of the 
UAE. Construction of the new 40-bed 
hospital in Al Ain is progressing and we 
anticipate it opening in 2016. We have 
continued to invest in the renewal of 
Khalifa Street Hospital, and we are 
planning the construction of a new building 
at Airport Road Hospital which is expected 
to double its capacity.

I wish to acknowledge all of our staff who 
have made 2014 a successful year. Through 
my tours of our facilities and my interactions 
with our people, I have come to learn that 
their commitment to our patients is a key 
driver of our success. On behalf of Al Noor, 
I thank them for their dedication to the 
patients who choose to entrust us with 
their care.
Al Noor owes its success to its leadership and 
in particular to Dr. Kassem Alom who has 
founded, developed and led the Company 
from its inception in 1985. I am delighted that 
Dr. Alom has agreed to remain on the Board 
as Deputy Chairman following the handover 
of executive leadership to Ronald Lavater. 
As the market continues to evolve, I feel 
confident that Ronald and his team will take 
the Company through its next phase of growth, 
and one that will continue to bring success 
to the Company and value to shareholders.

Ronald Lavater
Chief Executive Officer
“Prior to Johns Hopkins, my career 
at Hospital Corporation of America 
(‘HCA ’), the largest private hospital 
company in the United States, 
allowed me to provide leadership for 
both mid-sized and large tertiary 
hospitals in highly competitive, 
growing markets. My previous 
experience as both CEO and Chief 
Operating Officer in a number of 
hospitals demonstrated my 
professional passion – providing the 
highest quality healthcare to patients 
while supporting our most valuable 
resources – our doctors, nurses, 
clinical ancillary staff and 
administrative teams.”
Leading the Transition
Building on a 29-year tradition of 
advancement and commitment to our 
patients, 2014 was a year of continued 
growth, clinical quality improvements, 
system enhancements, financial success 
and leadership transition for Al Noor.
As we move forward, with acknowledged 
challenges and equally clear opportunities, 
I value the trust and confidence the 
Company’s Board has placed in me as 
successor to the pioneering visionary, 
Dr. Kassem Alom, who founded 
Al Noor in 1985. Dr. Alom, together with his 
team, created the largest and best private 
hospital group in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi 
and we are committed to building on his 
legacy. I am delighted that he will remain on 
the Board as Deputy Chairman.
As Al Noor prepares for the future, my 
immediate priorities are clear: solidify our 
leadership team and clarify our strategy for 
growth. This will also require our entire 
organisation to manage change effectively 
while reinforcing our commitment to 
excellent patient care. As CEO I remain 
committed to lead this transition by being 
transparent with employees, clear in my 
assessment of the challenges we have 
ahead and respectful of those who care for 
our patients every day; all with a focus on 
the Company’s long-term vision.

Strategic Report Financial Statements
As part of the process of putting together 
a new leadership team, I am pleased to 
report that we have successfully recruited 
two highly skilled individuals to fill key 
leadership positions.
• We welcomed Dr. Georges Feghali as 
our new Chief Medical Officer in 
January 2015. Dr. Feghali brings 
incredible clinical as well as 
management experience and will be 
highly effective in recruiting additional 
quality physicians to Al Noor.
• We also are delighted that David Hoidal 
– who joined the team in November 
2014 as our interim Chief Operating 
Officer – has, as of February 2015, 
taken the role permanently. David is an 
exceptional operations manager with a 
proven track record of producing 
efficiencies while building solid 
organisational structures
With more placements to be announced 
later in 2015, we are building a talented 
leadership team with the right experience, 
right focus and a strong commitment to 
achieve Al Noor’s strategy for clinical, 
service excellence and growth.
Parallel to solidifying a dynamic leadership 
team, has been my commitment to learning 
about Al Noor from its employees and 
patients. In recognition of the considerable 
challenge of succeeding Dr. Alom, I outlined 
my ‘100 Day Plan’ at the start of my tenure 
which emphasised meeting as many 
employees as possible, talking with our 
patients and their families about their 
experiences and visiting all our patient care 
facilities. Through Town Hall meetings and 
other gatherings at all of our hospitals and 
medical centres, I have been warmly 
received by our clinical and administrative 
staff. The transition from Dr. Alom has been 
well organised and viewed positively by our 
employees as the next evolution for Al Noor.
2014: Key Facts
In 2014, our people have delivered 
improvements in quality, grown the

Critical Performance Elements:
Continuing to grow a successful 
healthcare company requires attention 
to a number of performance elements. 
My executive leadership team is 
committed to high performance with a 
constant eye on these critical elements.
Patient Care:
At the core of our success will always be 
our commitment to patient care. Our 
enduring commitment to excellence has 
been the platform for Al Noor’s strong 
reputation and for our financial success. I 
would like to recognise and thank all of our 
employees, management and staff alike, 
for their dedication and for the passion 
they bring every day towards improving the 
lives of our patients. They have been, and 
continue to be, the fundamental strength 
of Al Noor and reside at the heart of 
everything we do as we grow and serve 
and excel. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 8
Strategic Report
commitment to quality and highly talented 
leadership teams will allow us to manage 
these challenges.
Regulatory Environment
The healthcare regulator in Abu Dhabi 
continues to raise standards and has set out 
an ambitious strategy to measure quality 
and report to the community the quality of 
healthcare services offered by the providers 
in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Al Noor is 
actively engaged with the regulator on this 
strategy, offering advice and guidance from 
the provider side. We believe that 
transparency about the quality of services 
will improve the healthcare delivery system 
for all, and will benefit the quality providers 
like Al Noor.
Health Insurance Environment
Our insurance partners continue to push for 
quality metrics as well as proper unitisation 
of services to reduce unnecessary visits 
and tests. We support these efforts and 
have participated in such initiatives.
Two such examples are with Daman, the 
largest insurance company in the Abu 
Dhabi market and our largest payer, are:
• The Maternity Management Programme 
aims to provide full support and care 
throughout the nine months of 
pregnancy and onwards ensuring safe 
pre-natal and post-natal care
• The Asthma Project is a cross-sector 
healthcare improvement partnership 
project by ANHAR, HAAD, DAMAN and 
NOVARTIS to improve the quality and 
safety of clinical care offered to asthma 
patients, both children and adults. By 
the end of the project ANHAR will be 
certified as Asthma Centre of 
Excellence by DAMAN health insurance
We enjoy a strong relationship with all our 
insurance companies in our market. During 
my first 100 days I met with each of the CEOs 
of our top insurance companies, covering 
nearly 90 percent of our business. I will 
continue to build on these relationships so 
that we will be appropriately paid for the 
quality of our services and the assets we put 
in place to serve the patient population.
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Recruiting High Quality Medical Staff:
Maintaining and enhancing Al Noor’s 
dedicated cadre of physicians remains key 
to our strategic and financial success. As 
we acquire more access points for patients 
and streamline to improve admissions, we 
must also keep pace with this increasing 
demand by recruiting highly skilled 
physicians. In addition, we target our 
recruitment efforts toward specialties that 
serve an ageing population and/or patients 
with specific lifestyle related conditions. 
We believe that the addition of highly 
skilled physicians remains essential to 
maintain our international standards of 
care, to meet our population’s needs, and 
to serve our growing number of in-patient 
and out-patients.
Greater Diversity of Services:
In 2014, we continued to expand our range 
of primary, secondary, and tertiary care 
services. We have carefully invested in 
areas of high acuity such as cardiac 
surgery, cardiology, orthopaedics, and 
nuclear medicine. We now provide plastic 
and reconstructive surgery, colorectal 
surgery, and laparoscopic gynaecology. 
Our ability to offer patients a full spectrum 
of integrated and advanced services, 
increasingly a ‘Continuum of Care,’ 
differentiates us from our competitors. 
This, combined with our internationally 
recognised standards of quality care and 
patient safety, continues to position Al 
Noor as a market leader.
Enhanced Patient Access:
Our financial performance was driven 
by several factors including acquisitions 
such as Al Madar and our commitment 
to increase capacity at our medical centres 
and hospitals to meet our communities’ 
demands for services.
We also continue to bolster our network of 
medical centres, opening three in 2014, 
expanding our hours for patients who need 
our services. We have strategically 
positioned new centres in residential areas 
that have been historically underserved and 
in newly populated communities where we 
can be ‘first-to-market.’ By providing primary 
care in residential areas, we capture the 
demand close to home and are able to refer 
patients through our extensive network of 
secondary and tertiary care.
Financial Performance:
Al Noor’s financial performance continues 
to be strong with 23% growth in revenue 
driven by 19.2% and 3.8% growth in 
out-patient and in-patient volume 
respectively. Underlying EBITDA increased 
by 18.5% to US$98.1m, but Underlying 
EBITDA margin decreased to 21.9%. This 
was primarily due to losses in start-up 
medical centres, medical staff wage inflation 
and increased corporate infrastructure.
Market Update
Competitive Environment
The healthcare delivery landscape in the 
Emirate of Abu Dhabi remains an attractive 
market for strong competitors and is 
expected to intensify as new providers open 
new facilities. We are watching a number of 
competitors with our strategy in mind and 
an eye toward their strength as a competitor 
or their potential as partner. For example, 
the Emirate of Abu Dhabi will see Cleveland 
Clinic Abu Dhabi, Danat Al Emarat Hospital, 
NMC’s Brightpoint Royal Women’s Hospital, 
NMC Royal Hospital at Khalifa City and 
Oasis Hospital all start operations in 2015. 
As a consequence, there will continue to 
be stiff competition for locally available 
medical staff and patients will have 
increased choices for medical services.
Should oil prices remain low, this could 
impact economic activity and the numbers 
of expatriate workers arriving or residing in 
the country, which could impact our 
performance due to the rate of population 
and growth. Additionally, government 
funded and subsidised health plants 
(Thiqa and Basic) could see budget 
pressures due to continued low oil prices. 
Providers and insurance companies who 
depend on the government for funding 
could see their budgets reduced due to 
lower oil prices.
However we believe that Al Noor’s 
reputation, geographic coverage, Corporate Governance

Looking Ahead
I have assessed the key elements of the 
Company’s strategic plan set out at IPO 
and found it to contain the right areas of 
focus to continue Al Noor’s growth agenda. 
To move forward, we have developed a 
strategic framework to guide our initiatives 
which fall into three areas:
• Grow the Current Asset Base – 
this includes our continued plans for 
expansion of our facilities, enhancement 
and integration of our systems, adding 
facilities where appropriate, and 
capturing efficiencies. This will allow us to 
scale-up as a larger system of hospitals 
and medical centres.
• Expand the ‘Asset Portfolio’ this 
includes strengthening our “Continuum 
of Care” and diversifying services 
reaching beyond the existing clinical 
services at our hospitals and medical 
centres and positioning Al Noor with 
even greater presence and market 
leadership across Abu Dhabi.
• Expand into New Markets both within 
the UAE and beyond using a disciplined 
approach of M&A and greenfield 
projects.
This strategy will allow us to grow and build 
based on the strength of the Company, 
maintain our premier position in the 
immediate Abu Dhabi market and strengthen 
our Company infrastructure and ‘platform’ 
for growth in the wider UAE and beyond.
My Personal Commitment
We operate in one of the most dynamic 
healthcare environments in the Gulf region. 
We have a rapidly ageing demographic with 
an increasing incidence of lifestyle-related 
medical conditions such as diabetes and 
obesity. However, there are ‘gaps in 
healthcare services’ for some parts of our 
population and a serious lack of coordination 
providing access to appropriate care at the 
right time and in the right location. The UAE 
government is committed to encouraging 
the development of a healthcare industry 
that is comparable to the world’s most 
developed nations to address the country’s 
healthcare needs.
Al Noor is well positioned to respond to 
these needs, close the gaps and 
effectively deploy and demonstrate a new, 
more integrated healthcare delivery 
system. We have experienced tremendous 
growth over the last few years and while 
we have seen increasing competition in the 
region, we believe that Al Noor’s 
reputation, geographic coverage, 
commitment to quality and highly talented 
leadership teams combined with the 
investments we continue to make in our 
medical staff and infrastructure will allow 
us to continue to experience strong 
growth. Al Noor will continue to expand 
our services and locations to meet the 
needs of our patients and the communities 
we serve and we will continue to provide 
high-quality care in a compassionate and 
friendly way and in so doing we will meet 
the expectations of our shareholders.
This is an exciting time in Al Noor’s history. 
We have experienced tremendous growth 
over the last few years and will continue to 
expand our services and locations to meet 
the needs of our patients and the 
communities we serve. I am confident that 
working together as the Al Noor family, we 
will continue to provide high-quality care to 
our patients in a compassionate and 
friendly way and in so doing we will meet 
the expectations of our shareholders.
Ronald Lavater
Chief Executive Officer
“Our aim – and my commitment – is to meet the needs of our patients at all stages 
of their journey. As the leading private healthcare provider in the Emirate of Abu 
Dhabi, Al Noor will be the model of an integrated healthcare system. In turn, creating

History & Milestones
Brief History
Al Noor was founded by Dr. Kassem Alom in 1985, with a 
small polyclinic and five employees. The following year the 
first Al Noor Hospital opened; one of the earliest private 
healthcare organisations in Abu Dhabi. During the late 1980’s 
the Company focused on hiring quality physicians, investing 
in state-of-the-art equipment and providing international 
standards of medical/clinical diagnostics and treatment and 
quality customer service that simply did not previously exist in 
the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
During the 1990s, Al Noor became the first private hospital in 
Abu Dhabi to perform in vitro fertilisation (‘IVF’), the first to 
introduce electronic medical records and the first to complete 
open heart surgery. In education, it was the first private 
hospital to upgrade the medical training in the local medical 
community.
With burgeoning growth and an influx of expatriates, the 
government introduced compulsory healthcare insurance in 
2007 and actively encouraged investment in private 
healthcare. Al Noor responded by opening two new hospitals 
in quick succession – one in Al Ain in 2006 and a much larger 
facility on Airport Road in Abu Dhabi City in 2008. The 
strategic locations, supported by outlying satellite medical 
centres, gave the Al Noor Group the largest footprint of any 
private hospital group in the Emirate. Between 2006 and 
2009, all three hospitals were accredited by the USA-based, 
and internationally respected, Joint Commission International 
(‘JCI’), placing the quality of Al Noor medical care alongside 
many of the finest global medical institutions.
In recent years, the Company has continued to expand its 
reach with two new medical centres and to grow its services 
in each hospital. Al Noor has also maintained its reputation 
for being first-to-market, being the first private hospital in 
Abu Dhabi to bring many services to the population.

Healthcare is expected to be among the 
fastest growing industries in the UAE for 
the following reasons:
• A population that is growing and 
rapidly ageing: according to Global 
Insight, the population of the UAE is 
projected to increase by a CAGR of 
1.7% from 2010 to 2030, while the 
population over 65 years of age is 
projected to increase by a CAGR of 
9.2% over that same period
• An increasing incidence of lifestyle-
related medical conditions: lifestyle 
diseases and conditions such as 
diabetes, obesity, cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases tend to occur 
more frequently in wealthier countries 
such as the UAE. In particular, with 
respect to diabetes and obesity, in 2011 
the UAE was in the top 10 countries in 
terms of the percentage of its 
population that was defined as obese 
(30.4%), and in the top five countries in 
terms of the percentage of population 
with diabetes (18.9%), according to the 
International Diabetes Foundation 
Report (5th Edition, 2012 Update)
• Service gaps in the current 
healthcare market: HAAD has 
identified services for which the current 
supply does not meet demand in the 
Emirate of Abu Dhabi. These include 
obstetrics and gynaecology, 
paediatrics, neonatology, cardiology, 
oncology, intensive and critical care 
medicine, emergency medicine, and 
psychiatry
• Growth in the privately insured 
population outside of the Emirate of 
Abu Dhabi: Other Emirates, including 
Dubai, plan to implement healthcare 
reforms, such as mandatory health 
insurance. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi 
has seen higher per capita healthcare 
spending since its introduction in 2007

As the sixth largest oil producer in OPEC benefiting from approximately 8. 1 % of the world’s oil reserves, the 
UAE had a GDP of US$402.3bn in 2013, giving it one of the highest per capita GDP (US$43,049) in the 
world. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit, real GDP growth for the UAE is forecast at 3.6% in 
2015 – 2019. As of 2013, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi accounted for approximately two-thirds of the UAE 
economy and almost 94% of its crude oil exports.
Over the last 20 years the Emirate of Abu Dhabi has been in the process of diversifying its economy away from oil revenues by 
establishing a number of industrial zones to foster private sector development, which is projected by the Statistics Centre of Abu Dhabi 
(‘SCAD’) to lead to a 6.5% growth rate in non-oil related GDP from 2013 to 2016 (as compared to an overall GDP growth rate of 5.7% 
for the same period). Corporate Governance

Case Study
Multidisciplinary Approach to Care
At Airport Road Hospital, a mother 
and her baby were saved thanks to 
the efforts of a multidisciplinary team 
comprised of the ICU team, the NICU 
team, a cardiologist, a cardiac 
surgeon, and an obstetrician.
A female patient who was 26 weeks 
into her pregnancy presented with 
a pulmonary embolism. She was 
admitted to the ICU after being 
diagnosed in our emergency room. 
After two weeks in the ICU, she 
suddenly developed a massive 
pulmonary embolism with cardiac 
arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(‘CPR’) was started and the decision 
to conduct an emergency Caesarean 
section was taken. The procedure 
was performed on the ICU bed while 
the mother was undergoing CPR and 
the baby was received by the 
neonatal ICU (‘NICU’) team and 
stabilised. After one hour of CPR, 
the patient was resuscitated, and, 
after spending a few days in hospital 
to ensure she had adequately 
recovered, was safely discharged 
with her healthy newborn baby. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 14

Geographic Distribution
Al Noor is devoted to ensuring that our 
services fully and effectively meet the 
needs of our patients and the communities 
we serve. We have opened facilities over a 
wide area of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 
providing ‘closer to home’ care to as many 
people as possible. Al Noor has a strategic 
presence in the three main geographical 
areas of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi: Abu 
Dhabi City, Al Ain City, and the Western 
Region. The first two are densely 
populated and have high patient volumes. 
As flagship facilities, our three in-patient 
hospitals are well positioned with two in 
the city of Abu Dhabi and one in the city of 
Al Ain. The hospitals are in ideal locations 
to support future growth and expansion.
Business Model & Key Strengths
Our integrated healthcare service offering is one of the most comprehensive 
amongst healthcare providers in the UAE. Our geographic distribution, high 
quality of care and scope of services have resulted in our position as one of the 
leading healthcare providers in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Corporate Governance

High Quality Care and 
Differentiated Positioning
We believe that the foundation of our 
leading position among private healthcare 
service providers in the Emirate of Abu 
Dhabi is our continuous focus on providing 
high quality medical services. This has 
allowed us to differentiate ourselves from 
competing private healthcare providers in 
the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
We are also the preferred private hospital 
for out-patients and in-patients in the 
Emirate of Abu Dhabi, including, in 
particular, Thiqa (the plan for UAE 
Nationals) and Enhanced (the insurance 
segment for high income expatriates) 
patients, based on a survey of patients’ 
preferred hospitals for in-patient and 
out-patient care conducted by GRMC 
Advisory Services in 2013.
We are committed to hiring the most 
highly skilled and experienced physicians 
available in the UAE. Many of our physicians 
have academic appointments and 
several have been asked to sit on HAAD 
committees in their respective specialties.
The current combination of Al Noor’s wide 
geographic footprint in the Emirate of Abu 
Dhabi and its ‘Continuum of Care’ operating 
model, which is designed to provide the 
highest quality of medical care through a 
single vertically integrated healthcare 
network, has allowed us to capture and 
retain the broadest possible patient base. 
The higher value Thiqa and Enhanced plan 
patient segments relative to Abu Dhabi Basic 
plan holders (the plan for lower income 
expatriates) have historically accounted for 
the majority of our patient population. In 
2014, our Thiqa, Enhanced and Basic plan 
holders accounted for 25.2%, 39.6% and 
35.2%, respectively, of our total insured 
out-patient volumes and 22.2%, 41.7% and 
36.1% respectively, of our total insured 
in-patient volumes. The Thiqa and Enhanced 
patient populations also generate a higher 
value per claim than Basic plan holders as 
illustrated by the table below which provides 
information compiled by HAAD:

Scope of Services
In addition to providing core medical, 
surgical and emergency services, we have 
differentiated ourselves in the Abu Dhabi 
healthcare market by offering specialised 
and complex services such as 
cardiothoracic surgery, bariatric surgery, 
renal dialysis, nuclear medicine and a 
fertility centre. We believe that our 
integrated healthcare service offering is 
one of the most comprehensive amongst 
healthcare providers in the Emirate of Abu 
Dhabi, and allows us to provide 
international standards of patient care, 
with a particular focus on clinical 
excellence and patient safety, and a 
commitment to assuring the best possible 
healthcare for those we serve. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 16

Our Strategy
Al Noor Strategic Framework
Locally Focused 
Hospitals with Centres 
of Excellence
We continue to position our hospitals as 
acute care hubs for our network. Our 
hospitals will diversify services and 
specialise in key areas to meet the needs 
of our local patient population. 
Designated ‘centres of excellence’ will 
emerge as part of this strategy. Centres of 
excellence in healthcare involve selected 
clinical programmes or service lines 
providing specialised expertise, and 
state-of-the-art technology within 
established best-practice guidelines – 
intentionally designed to create and 
sustain exemplary quality outcomes. 
Centres of excellence typically carry an 
imprimatur either through formal 
certification or by reputation. Al Noor’s 
work in cardiology, oncology and 
maternal/child services might evolve 
toward and become certified as Centres 
of Excellence. Developing service lines 
with this designation creates a clear 
competitive advantage and is often 
recognised favourably by health 
insurance companies.
Medical Centres 
Positioned to Protect 
Market Share
The 17 Al Noor medical centres provided 
services for 611,495 patients in 2014. Each 
medical centre and the affiliated physicians 
focused on providing quality care for their 
patients. As we evolve in our ability to 
share systems and to coordinate required 
referrals for follow up care, our hospitals 
and our medical centres will function even 
more effectively as a network – as a more 
integrated care provider . This strategy of 
defining and managing our out-patient and 
our in-patient populations combined with 
the continued placement of medical 
centres in key population sectors will 
ensure that Al Noor can improve access 
for its patients.
Establishing a 
‘Continuum of Care’ 
within the Al Noor System
As Al Noor increasingly becomes 
‘the healthcare home’ for our patient 
population, we must create a more 
comprehensive ‘Continuum of Care’. 
Such a continuum covers the delivery 
of healthcare over a period of time through 
a complete array of health services spanning 
many levels and intensity of care. Services 
typically include preventative services, 
urgent care, ambulatory and diagnostic care, 
acute care, extended care, home care and 
rehabilitation to name a few key components 
of the continuum.
Strength &       growth Corporate Governance
17 Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Financial Statements
A true continuum includes the availability 
of these services as well as an integrated 
mechanism to track patient needs, guide 
them toward the most appropriate access 
to care and then track the health 
information that drives efficiencies in the 
delivery and payments for care. Although 
building an integrated “Continuum of 
Care” is not a short-term achievement, 
once established, Al Noor becomes the 
healthcare home for our patients at every 
stage of life.
Creating an Integrated 
Healthcare System
The concept of an integrated system in 
healthcare remains a ‘work in progress’ 
and long-term journey. Market leaders do 
seem to agree, however , that a healthcare 
delivery system is best positioned to grow 
and compete when it:
• Positions comprehensive services 
across a ‘Continuum of Care’;
• Understands the needs of its patient 
population;
• Establishes standards for care 
delivery that produce cost effective, 
quality outcomes;
• Builds an information system that 
improves patient interactions, clinical 
decision-making and financial 
tracking; and
• Creates an organisational culture to 
effectively coordinate and collaborate 
among physicians, diagnostic 
facilities, hospital services and 
managers within the system.
“We do know that strengthening 
our hospitals, coordinating our 
medical centres and expanding 
services to provide a 
‘Continuum of Care’ must 
be supported by our ability to 
share information, establish 
standards of care and capture 
efficiencies across our network 
for care delivery. As we build 
toward this kind of system, 
Al Noor will become the model 
of an integrated healthcare 
system and our success will 
be beneficial for our patients 
and for our investors.”
Ronald Lavater , CEO
As part of our five-Y ear Strategy, 
Al Noor has recognised an 
opportunity to enhance healthcare 
services through greater 
integration of the organisation’s 
facilities and personnel to 
become a dominating healthcare 
network of inter-related 
and self-referring services.
T oday, the Company’s promise of 
a ‘Continuum of Care’ is unique in 
Abu Dhabi. Our patients are able 
to receive virtually all of their care 
– from urgent to elective, from 
live-saving to life-enhancing – 
within the Al Noor family of 
services and professionals. We 
are confident that no other private 
sector provider can make such a 
promise.

Cardiac Services at 
Airport Road Hospital
Airport Road Hospital has significantly 
grown its cardiac services offering in 
2014. Recognising the strong unmet 
demand for complex cardiac services in 
the community, the management team 
successfully recruited the doctors and 
other medical staff needed and invested 
in the equipment necessary to deliver 
more comprehensive cardiac services.
The cardiac services team at Airport 
Road Hospital has highly-skilled 
physicians including:
• One cardiac surgeon;
• Three cardiologists;
• Five interventional cardiology 
consultants;
• Three cardiac intensivists;
• 24/7 in-house on call; and
• A team of catheterisation lab and 
cardiac nurses and technicians.
The Cardiology services performed by 
this team include:
• Non-invasive cardiac procedures and 
diagnostic testing including 
transthoracic and transesophageal 
echocardiography, Stress ECG, Stress 
Echocardiography, Dobutamine Stress 
Test, Tilt Table Test, Ambulatory Blood 
Pressure monitoring, Holter monitoring 
and Cardioversion;
• A full range of invasive cardiac 
interventions including Percutaneous 
Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty 
(‘PTCA’), Intravascular Ultrasound 
(‘IVUS’), Fractional Flow Reserve 
(‘FFR’), Optical Coherence Tomography 
(‘OCT’), Pacemaker insertion, 
Intracardiac defibrillator (‘ICD’) 
implantation. Inferior Vena Cava (‘IVC’) 
filter insertion, Pericardiocentesis, 
Temporary pacemaker insertion and 
Reveal Device implantation; and
• The cardiac surgery services 
performed include coronary artery 
bypass graft (‘CABG’) surgery, mitral 
valve replacement, and atrial septic 
defect repairs.
Achievements:
• In 2014 Al Noor established a Heart 
Attack Centre making it the only private 
hospital in the UAE with a 24/7 heart 
attack programme, with an in-house 
dedicated cardiologist on call 24/7
• Door to balloon time, an important 
quality indicator, is approximately 45 
minutes, well below the international 
benchmark of 90 minutes
• Al Noor is the only private hospital that 
does angiograms by radial approach 
(90% of the cases), which results in a 
shortening of length of stay to less than 
four hours
• Al Noor is the first private hospital in 
Abu Dhabi to perform ICD 
implantation, pacemaker insertion, and 
IVC filter insertion, the only private 
hospital in UAE with IVUS, FFR and 
OCT platforms and the only one to 
perform the Tilt Table Test and to 
implant Reveal Devices
Over 1,000 cath lab procedures were 
performed in 2014, an increase of 18% 
on 2013. Over 80 cardiac surgeries were 
performed in 2014, with a mortality rate 
of zero. Corporate Governance

Founded in 2004, the Gulf International Cancer Centre 
(‘GICC’) is a leader in cancer treatment in Abu Dhabi, 
offering Radiation Therapy, Medical Oncology, and 
PET/CT scan services. Cancer care cases are forecast 
to grow at 10 – 14% annually in Abu Dhabi and the 
GICC has the capacity to serve the treatment needs of 
a significant number of our patients. The centre is 
managed by highly experienced medical staff 
who trained in North America and Europe. Al Noor 
acquired GICC in Q1 2014, making the Company 
the only private health system in Abu Dhabi with 
comprehensive cancer services.
GICC holds the first PET/CT scan installed in the UAE. The PET/CT scan 
detects a cancerous tumour in the body and its spread using radioactive 
glucose, helping physicians decide whether the patient will need surgery, 
radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. The radioactive glucose is made 
available by a committed cyclotron, present at the centre. Bringing this 
service to the UAE has reduced the number of patients going abroad for 
this service. Additionally, Al Noor has already succeeded in generating 
referrals to GICC from Muscat, as this service is unavailable in Oman.

Minimally-Invasive Cardiac Surgery
A 36-year-old woman with a congenital heart condition recovered 
quickly following a minimally-invasive procedure conducted by our 
cardiac surgeon at Airport Road Hospital.
Dr. Norbert Augustin diagnosed the patient with Atrial Septal Defect 
(‘ASD’) – a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of the 
heart. This defect resulted in the enlargement of her right side of the 
heart and damage to the valve between the right atrium and the right 
ventricle. To treat her condition, Dr. Augustin carried out the two-and-
a-half hour surgery using a minimally-invasive technique that allowed 
direct access to the heart, using a 6 – 8cm incision as opposed to the 
conventional 18 – 25cm. This technique offered a decreased length of 
stay, with the patient going home after four days.

Operational Review
In 2014, demand for the Company’s 
healthcare services continued to grow. 
Growth was driven by the Company’s 
continued expansion of its services in 
existing facilities and by the addition of 
new medical centres across the UAE. 
Revenue increased 23% on 2013, driven 
by a 27% growth in out-patient revenue 
(including other revenue) and a 12% 
increase in in-patient revenue during 
the year.

In 2014 the Company added 64 net revenue generating doctors across our hospitals and 
various medical centres. These additional doctors helped with the continued expansion 
of services and the geographical footprint of the company across the UAE.
• Underlying EBITDA increased by 18.5% to US$98.1m compared to FY2013.
• Underlying EBITDA margin was 21.9% which was 0.8% down compared to 2013
• Underlying operating profit of US$85.4m, an increase of 13.8% compared with FY2013
In 2014, in the Central region, the Company opened three new medical centres and 
completed the acquisition of the Gulf International Cancer Centre, a reputed out-patient 
oncology diagnostic and treatment centre in Abu Dhabi. The Airport hospital performed 
in line with expectations however this was offset by a drop in volumes at Khalifa Street 
Hospital. The decrease in volumes of the Khalifa Street Hospital was due to a variety of 
reasons such as new competition opening in the vicinity, physician attrition and the 
ongoing refurbishment of premises to improve the patient experience at the premises.
In the Eastern region the Al Ain Hospital has performed very well. The performance of 
the medical centres in the eastern and western region has also been very good.
Average revenue per out-patient improved by 8% despite a less favourable insurance mix 
as a result of changes in service mix, improved claim management, improved clinical 
documentation and high average revenue per out-patient in the GICC. Average revenue 
per in-patient improved by 8% for the same reasons.

Operational Milestones
Airport Road’s growth in 2014 has been the result of numerous 
initiatives. New out-patient service lines have been added such as 
family medicine, fetal imaging, and endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (‘ERCP’) and LASIK services.
In-patient capacity has also increased through the expansion of our maternity ward’s 
NICU capacity, which has helped accommodate growing demands in these service 
areas. The maternity ward rooms have undergone major renovations in addition to the 
VIP and Royal suites to create a ‘home away from home’ atmosphere.
The state-of-the-art hospital has also expanded its Ophthalmology sub-specialties, 
introducing a fully equipped operating theatre that includes world-class vitroretinal 
surgery equipment.
In the year 2014, numerous successful initiatives have been implemented to improve the 
patient experience and reduce out-patient waiting times. The hospital is also well 
prepared to meet the increasing demands of environmental, health and safety standards. 
It is also worth mentioning that various staff engagement activities were carried-out to 
enhance staff satisfaction.
Khalifa Street remains committed to excellence in the delivery of 
quality care and patient-centred services. In August, the 73-bed 
hospital successfully completed the Joint Commission International 
(‘JCI’) reaccreditation survey with great success. It is the first private 
healthcare institution in Abu Dhabi to receive the JCI golden seal on 
the 5th edition standards.
The hospital is one of Al Noor’s oldest facilities in a highly competitive part of the city, 
and therefore faces a few challenges today. Therefore, to deal with these challenges, the 
Company has initiated several projects to renovate and expand out-patient clinics as well 
as inpatient rooms. Occupational Health was added to the scope of services; a fully-
fledged clinic is now delivering a complete spectrum of pre-employment and medical 
checkups. Services include, but are not limited to, offshore and onshore medical fitness 
certificates, qualified medical personnel onsite, healthcare facility management in remote 
locations, among others.

In 2014, Al Ain Campus underwent expansion to meet growing

areas, the hospital entrance and the lobby have all been renovated 
and given a new fresh look to increase the comfort level of patients.
Furthermore, the hospital has successfully managed to add 14 new clinics to meet 
increasing volumes and patient demands. The hospital has also expanded its portfolio of 
services by initiating Vascular Surgery and Advanced Ophthalmology Surgical services 
and expanded its ER observation beds and Recovery Room.
Another major milestone achieved in 2014 was the upgrade of the Special Care Baby Unit 
to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to care for premature infants and those who require 
intensive care.
In addition, a state-of-the-art Nuclear Medicine department was launched in February 
2014, providing break-through nuclear imaging solutions and the right medical expertise.
Our 17 medical centres are strategically located in residential areas 
in order to be attractive as a patient’s first point of care. Our medical 
centres serve as ambassadors to the community, often making the 
Company’s first impression and influencing future relationships with 
our patients.
Projects
The Healthcare Projects Department has had another successful year operating and 
managing its clinics at the Emirates Palace Hotel, Abu Dhabi Women’s College and Abu 
Dhabi Men’s College. In addition to these clinics, the projects department was 
successful in obtaining contract renewals with two client based projects;
Critical Infrastructure Coastal Protection Authority (‘CICPA’) 4th year extension for the 
provision of two clinics at Sweihan and SADR and Emirates Aluminum provision of 
emergency, primary and occupational health services.
Furthermore, the Healthcare Projects Department increased its portfolio of projects by 
opening three new clinics namely; Al Salam Living City Clinic, Al Saweed Clinic and ICAD 
Clinic.

Results
The Company has delivered a strong performance in 2014. Revenue 
grew by 23% and Underlying EBITDA grew by 18.5%, primarily 
generated by strong out-patient performance at our hospitals and 
medical centres, both established ones and the new centres.

Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’)
The underlying basic EPS for the year grew from US$65.3 cents per 
share to US$70.0 cents per share, an increase of 7 .2%.
After non-underlying items, which consisted mainly of IPO costs 
and the cost of writing off unamortised facility costs in 2013, 
basic EPS increased by 23.4%, year on year.
Revenue
Revenue increased 23% to US$449.1m compared to FY2013, 
driven by a 27% growth in out-patient revenue and a 12% 
increase in in-patient revenue during the year.
In volume terms, the 27% growth in out-patient revenue was 
driven by a 19% increase in volume and the 12% increase in 
in-patient revenue came from a 4% increase in volume. In an 
increasingly competitive market, the Group’s strategy of 
consolidating its position in the primary care market by:
• improving the quality of patient care
• recruiting high quality medical staff
• providing greater diversity of services and enhanced patient 
access through opening of medical centres; and
• the expansion of services in hospitals and acquisition of 
medical centres has led to more patients than ever before 
turning to Al Noor for their healthcare needs.
Despite the market place competition for talent, a proactive hiring 
process has resulted in the Group successfully recruiting 
additional doctors.
2014 2013 Change
Number of revenue
generating Doctors 534 470 14%
The hiring of doctors helped us deliver new services and expand 
existing services across the hospitals and medical centres in all 
our Regions. For example, in the Central Region at Airport Road 
hospital and in the Western and Eastern Region at Al Ain Hospital, 
the ICUs were expanded. New services such as Lasik and 
vitroretinal surgery were also introduced. Doctors recruited to 
work at Airport Road have supported interventional cardiology 
there and at Al Ain the addition of new physicians has allowed the 
establishment of nuclear medicine services, a sleep study lab and 
a diabetic foot clinic, the upgrade of the bone density unit and 
delivery of interventional radiology.
EBITDA and Margins
Underlying EBITDA grew 18.5% from US$82.8m in 2013 to 
US$98.1m in 2014. However, underlying EBITDA margins declined 
from 22.7% to 21.9% through a combination of wage inflation for 
medical staff but significant investment in our facilities, people 
and services which will sustain the Group’s future growth. We 
comment further on costs below.
In the Central Region comprising our two largest hospitals, Khalifa 
Street and Airport Road and the majority of our medical centres, the 
Khalifa Street hospital saw a decline in revenues of 1% year on year 
as a result of reductions in out-patient and inpatient volume. 
Revenues at Airport Road increased by 18% driven by higher 
out-patient and inpatient volumes. Combined with our more 
established medical centres, revenue for the Central Region 
increased from US$278mm to US$317m. At Khalifa Street, we 
started a significant programme of works in the late stages of 2013 
to re-organise and upgrade aspects of the hospital, including the 
conversion from its previous mixed usage of residences and hospital 
facilities to that of a dedicated healthcare facility. Inevitably, there has 
been some disruption during these works which have run on through 
2014 and will continue into 2015 with further capital expenditure 
earmarked. This has impacted adversely on both revenues and 
running costs at Khalifa Street during 2014 and hence the profits of 
the Central Region show a decline of US$2.5m, but the work is 
essential to reposition Khalifa Street as a first class healthcare 
operation in the heart of the city looking after the needs of Abu 
Dhabi’s residents and families. The Central Region segment also 
contains several new clinics that have started providing healthcare 
services in the last two years. There is a 12-24 month lead time 
required for these new clinics to build their patient numbers to a level 
that covers their start-up costs and contributes to Group profit and 
we therefore expect to see a steady improvement in financial 
contribution through 2015 and into 2016 from these newer facilities. 
In particular, we are focussed on the opportunities provided by our 
acquisition of the Gulf International Cancer Clinic in 
February 2014.
The Western and Eastern Region has seen revenue grow 
substantially by 50% from US$86.9m to US$130.6m with profits 
more than doubling from US$17.2m to US$37.0m. These increases 
arise from very strong performances driven by patient volumes as 
well as higher value services at our hospital in Al Ain, and the clinics 
at Madinat Zayed, Al Madar and Al Yahar.
In the International Region, our clinic in Oman which provides a range of 
services is being repositioned with a focus on dialysis services for which 
there is considerable demand and we expect to see the start-up losses 
of this clinic reduce in the year ahead and the clinic move into profit as it 
serves an increasing number of patients. Similarly, with the appropriate 
investment in skills and services at our Manchester clinic in Northern 
Emirates, we expect to see patient volumes increase and move the 
clinic to sustained profitability in the year ahead.
Cost structure
The Group’s total costs on an underlying basis have increased in 
2014 versus 2013 rising from US$290.0m to US$363.7m. Total 
underlying costs represented 81% of revenue in 2014 compared 
with 79% in the prior year.

*SG&A does not include non-underlying costs.
The increase in costs arises not just from the growth in delivery of 
patient care but also reflects the wage inflation that is prevalent in 
our market place as competing healthcare providers, opening new 
facilities in our Regions, all seek high quality physicians. In addition, 
the Group’s new management team is identifying areas where 
further expenditure is vital to maintain and improve the services 
which we provide to our patients and this is already reflected in the 
small percentage increase that costs represent as a proportion of 
revenue in 2014. However, management also see opportunities to 
bring greater efficiency to bear on the operations of the Group. 
Taken together, management anticipates that 2015 is likely to see a 
further increase in costs as investment is made in the short term with 
efficiencies starting to flow towards the end of 2015 and into 2016.
Medical Staff Costs
Medical staff costs have increased due to increased medical 
staff numbers and reflect the impact of wage inflation in the UAE in 
our sector.

Cost of Medicines and Consumables
Although the total cost of medicines and consumables has 
increased with activity levels, as a percentage of revenue, costs are 
down year on year. This decline is due to the increase in out-patient 
clinic revenues in the overall revenue mix; out-patient visits consume 
fewer consumables compared to in-patient visits.

Gross Margins
The results for 2014 show a small improvement in gross margins by 
0.5% compared with 2013. The positive effects of revenue mix, for 
example due to a higher growth in out-patient revenues, and costs of 
medicines and consumables have marginally outweighed the impact 
of salary costs and lower margins at the newer Clinics which still 
have to grow their patient volumes to target levels.
2014 2013 Inc %
Gross Margin % 42.8% 42.3% 0.5%
Selling, General and Administrative Overheads
The selling, general and administrative expenses of the Group 
have gone up significantly during 2014 due to a number of factors. 
Initiatives taken by the Group to recruit for a range of senior 
leadership positions, a number of which represent new posts, is a 
principal driver of this growth in cost. In addition, a greater focus 
on the support infrastructure needed to support the Group going 
forward and provide a sound platform for growth in services has 
added cost in the area of quality management, recruitment and 
areas of corporate governance, including a range of costs that are 
needed to support a Premium listed company.
Depreciation and amortisation costs have increased from 
US$1.8m to US$3.3m in line with our expenditure on leasehold 
improvements, equipment and fittings and our acquisition of the 
Gulf International Cancer Centre earlier in the year.
The group continues to benefit from stable operating lease 
arrangements for its properties with the increases in rent arising 
largely from new clinics and facilities as shown below.
Rent
The break-down of rental expenses is as follows:
2014

2013
(US$m) Inc %
Existing Premises 15.5 15.2 2%
New Clinics & Acquisitions 2.4 0.9 155%
Interest and Taxation
The Group incurs commitment fees on the US$82m capex/ 
working capital facility which is currently undrawn. Besides this 
expenditure, as the Group has no external borrowings, it does not 
incur any financing costs.
The Group has no tax liability as it operates mainly in the UAE which 
has no corporation tax regime. Results from Sultanate of Oman and 
the parent company in the UK both generated tax losses in the year. 
The Group anticipates recovery of this loss in the future for Oman as 
the clinic there increases its activity and the tax asset shown in the 
balance sheet reflects this. There is no current prospect of the losses 
in the UK being recovered and therefore no deferred tax asset is 
carried for these. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 34

Financial Review continued
Non-underlying Costs
During the year the Group incurred non-underlying costs 
amounting to US$0.6m relating to acquisitions.
Capital Expenditure
During the year the Group incurred total capital expenditure of 
US$65m as follows:
• A sum of US$31.5m on the acquisition of the Gulf International 
Cancer Centre and the deferred consideration of Al Madar, 
which has achieved its earnout thresholds;
• A sum of US$26.5m on capital expenditure across our 
operating segments on existing hospitals and medical centres, 
and new medical centres; and
• A sum of US$7.0m incurred on hardware and software 
principally related to the upgrade to SAP.
The Group has continued with its organic growth plan, upgrading its 
existing hospitals and medical centres. The Group has incurred 
capital expenditure both for the replacement of equipment as well as 
for the introduction of new services. Though higher than previous 
years, the capital expenditure was and is essential to sustain the 
momentum in out-patient and in-patient volume growth and with the 
quality of facilities that competitors are opening in the Abu Dhabi 
market in 2015, investment in our portfolio remains essential as 
evidenced by the construction of our new hospital in Western and 
Eastern Region to complement our existing Al Ain hospital and in the 
Central Region, our work at Khalifa Street already referred to.
In order to ensure uniform systems and controls across the Group 
and to allow us to integrate acquired entities successfully, the 
Company embarked on a SAP ERP implementation in 2013, which 
continued through 2014 when we successfully implemented the 
financial and material handling modules. The implementation 
continues into 2015 as we seek to integrate patient accounting.
The capital expenditure is broken down below:

Cash (including Working Capital)
Cash generated from operating activities, before adjusting for 
working capital movements, was US$102.3m, (2013: US$84.0m). 
After working capital adjustments, cash generated was US$81.3m 
(2013: US$87.2m).
The change in working capital year on year reflects increased 
activity levels but also includes the impact of an increase in 
debtor days due to delayed receipts from one of the Group’s 
insurers. Inventory levels have increased to reflect management’s 
decision to hold greater stocks and reduce the risk of long lead 
time on delivery of products.
Working capital management remains a key focus area for the 
Company and the new SAP system is starting to provide 
management with greater detail to facilitate work in this area.
Cash balances at year end were US$82.9m with an additional 
US$13.6m held on deposit.
Going Concern
Having made enquiries the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has adequate resources to meet 
its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date 
of approval of these consolidated financial statements. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial information.
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the strategic review on pages 1 to 48. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the financial statements and notes on 
page 88.
Dividend
The Board has reviewed the results for the year and is pleased 
to recommend a final dividend of 9 pence per share to be paid 
in cash for the year ended 31 December 2014. This excludes 
the 3.7 pence per share paid as an interim dividend. The total 
dividend reflect a distribution of 28% of the Profits After Tax for 
2014 attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company.
This final dividend will be paid on 15 May 2015 to all ordinary 
shareholders who were on the register of members at the close 
of business on 17 April 2015. Corporate Governance

Risk Mitigation
 è Growth Strategy
Our growth strategies may be adversely affected 
by our inability to identify or acquire suitable 
facilities for new hospitals or medical centres.
Our growth may also be negatively affected by 
the inability to scale up the organisational 
resources (funds, human resources, leadership) 
and operations against the growing demands of 
the business.
The Company’s CSO leads the business 
development function and is actively pursuing 
projects across the UAE. By targeting a number of 
opportunities at the same time, the Company is 
able to mitigate this risk.
We continuously evaluate potential investment 
opportunities. All acquisition and disposal projects 
are reviewed by the Corporate Executive 
Committee as well as the Board and Audit and 
Risk Committee to provide guidance and alternate 
options, wherever needed.
Each major project is supported by an extensive 
project plan and an Oversight Committee that 
approves the plan. The committee is responsible 
for regular monitoring; takes appropriate decisions 
and provides guidance/support to facilitate timely 
completion.
 è Reputation
Company reputation is at risk if we are unable to 
act in an ethical manner consistent with the 
stakeholders’ expectations (including patients, 
suppliers, investors, etc.).
Furthermore, if we do not continually enhance 
our facilities with the most recent technological 
advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, 
it could affect our brand and reputation.
The Company has established an ethics 
framework that includes a Code of Business 
Ethics, an ethics committee and ethics reporting 
and investigation procedures. The Company has 
also rolled out an anti-bribery policy and fraud 
reporting policies.
We allocate capital expenditure for upgrading 
facilities on an ongoing process and as part of the 
annual budget process, we allocate capital 
expenditure for upgrading facilities as an ongoing 
process.
 è Human Resources
Our performance depends on our ability to 
recruit and retain high quality doctors and other 
healthcare professionals, such as nurses and 
technicians.
Heavy dependence on key executives and 
potential loss of the services of (i) one or more of 
our key executives or (ii) a significant portion of 
our management personnel could weaken our 
management team.
A succession planning framework has been 
established and its implementation is in progress. 
The framework includes a process for the 
identification of key positions, appropriate 
successor(s), their training and regular reviews.
Recruitment and attrition of medical staff are 
closely monitored and are included in the monthly 
management report that is reviewed by the 
Corporate Executive Committee.
 è Competition
We face competition from other hospitals and 
healthcare providers that may impact our 
revenues, profitability and market share. 
Hospitals compete on factors such as 
reputation, clinical excellence and patient 
satisfaction. We also face competition from 
other providers such as standalone clinics, 
out-patient centres and diagnostic centres and 
may face further competition from international 
healthcare companies.
Our strategy is focused on investing in our home 
markets (where we have already established a 
significant presence) and growing in those 
markets where we can apply our clinical expertise 
and quality of care to manage competition. We are 
focused on providing high quality care and patient 
satisfaction at all our facilities.
Key Risks & Uncertainties
Identification and management of key risks 
faced by the Company are key considerations 
for the Board of Directors. These risks are 
monitored at all levels throughout the business.
The Company considers the identification 
and mitigation of risks as a key priority 
across the organisation. Therefore the 
Company has established a risk 
management framework to ensure that 
appropriate processes are in place and key 
risks are identified and managed effectively.
The quality departments at each hospital 
play a key part in identifying, managing 
and reporting risks at the Hospital level as 
part of the JCIA process. In accordance 
with its continuous improvement plans, the 
Company periodically invests in the review 
of its quality management processes and 
medical services to ensure that its 
standards of patient care and safety 
are enhanced.
The key risks, the potential impact and the 
mitigation of risks are analysed in the table 
below. Corporate Governance
39 Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Financial Statements
Risk Mitigation
 è Payers/Insurance
The vast majority of our revenues come from a 
relatively small number of insurance providers. 
If our relationship with insurers deteriorates, 
we may not be able to negotiate favourable fee 
arrangements and/or our business may 
otherwise be adversely affected.
We are also exposed to the risk that insurance 
companies may reject, delay or refuse to make 
payment for claims we submit for medical 
services rendered to patients claiming coverage 
under such schemes.
The Company mitigates its exposure by 
maintaining strong relationships with insurance 
companies. The CEO and Board members also 
participate in meetings with the larger companies.
The Company has established a process for 
rejection tracking and monitoring. Reasons for 
rejections are investigated and claims are 
resubmitted based on review by an independent 
team. Submission accuracy is improved by 
submitting claims according to insurers’ 
requirements.
Rigorous monitoring of rejection rates for each 
category/location (e.g. hospitals, insurance 
company, claim type etc.) by the Board and the 
Senior Management team including CEO, COO, 
CFO, and Hospital Directors, etc., ensures timely 
identification of issues and remedial actions, as 
needed.
 è Supply Chain
We source the majority of our medical supplies, 
pharmaceuticals and equipment from UAE-
based agents acting as the exclusive distributors 
for third-party suppliers in the UAE. We also 
outsource various activities, such as cleaning 
and maintenance services, to sub-contractors.
The use of third-party suppliers and sub-
contractors may expose us to supply 
bottlenecks, pricing issues, quality problems 
and other potential liabilities that may arise in 
cases where such third-party suppliers and 
sub-contractors fail to meet their commitments.
The Company’s material management model is 
designed to ensure the timely supply of products. 
Close monitoring of the inventory and supplies 
helps ensure that our hospitals and medical 
centres have the medicines and consumables 
they need.
Safety stock, inventory levels and back-up supply 
arrangements are in place to mitigate the risk of 
stock outs or non-availability.
We also maintain direct relationship with 
manufacturers to manage unforeseen bottlenecks 
in the supply chain or pricing issues.
 è Quality of Care
Failure to maintain a high level of patient 
satisfaction and quality of care could result in 
damage to our reputation, significant financial 
loss (including medical malpractice suits) and 
difficulty in achieving licensing requirements.
A Committee at the board level (Quality 
Committee) has been established to oversee the 
quality of care and patient safety.
Furthermore, there are quality committees at each 
of the hospitals to monitor compliance with JCI 
standards and to take appropriate actions to make 
sure that we are compliant with the accreditation 
standards.
Regular patient satisfaction surveys are 
conducted and a Quality and Patient Safety 
Committee has been formed at the Corporate 
level to ensure that patient measures are linked 
with the satisfaction surveys.
Local application of a wide range of clinical risk 
controls and regular monitoring aim to ensure that 
patients are protected from events that may lead 
to adverse outcomes.
 è SAP Implementation
The Company started implementation of SAP in 
2013 to enhance its accounting & financial 
system and extend it to operational areas 
(non-medical) like Human Resources, Material 
Management, etc.
The Company went live on the financial and 
materials management modules in 2014. In 2015 
the Company plans to go live on the patient 
billing and human resources modules.
While adequate measures have been taken, we 
cannot rule out the possibility of delay or failure 
in successful implementation. If delays occur, 
the Company may have to incur additional 
expenditure and/or may not be able to realise 
projected benefits.
The Company has selected services from one 
of the top SAP integration consultants in the 
healthcare sector globally and appointed KPMG 
to provide project management assurance.
Explicit terms have been inserted in the contract 
to penalise the service provider for delays caused 
by them, if any.
There were strong levels of commitment from the 
management team which supported and 
facilitated successful implementation of SAP.
A Steering Committee comprising members from 
senior management team oversees the projects 
progress and provides guidelines and resources, 
as needed.
The Company also mitigates this risk by 
undertaking regular reviews of investment and 
progress, both in terms of the Corporate Executive 
Committee and the Board.
 è Pricing of Services
Pricing of services by healthcare providers in 
Abu Dhabi is regulated and is based on the 
mandatory tariff list issued by Health Authority of 
Abu Dhabi (‘HAAD'). There is a possibility that 
the prices may undergo changes and adversely 
impact on our revenues and profits.
The Company mitigates this risk by maintaining 
strong relationships, holding meetings regularly 
and presenting the providers’ outlook when HAAD 
invites feedback from providers. The impact of 
such changes are assessed and additional 
mitigation measures are introduced, as needed. 
This includes negotiations with payers on revised 
prices for the following financial year. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 40

Chamber of Commerce Women in Business Committee that promoted the professional advancement of women. The programme 
encourages companies and organisations to give women more opportunities to advance their careers by offering them positions of greater 
responsibility and leadership.

Corporate Continuing Education (‘CE’) Department
The French poet, Anatole France says 
“An education isn’t how much you have committed to memory, or even how much you know. It’s being able to differentiate between 
what you do know and what you don’t.” In a world where technology and medicine are the fastest changing and developing areas, 
the CE Department of Al Noor is committed to providing different platforms for continuous medical knowledge updates.
The CE Department, with the support of the Senior Management, Conferences’ Organizing Committee, Marketing Department and 
other departments, not only within Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc, but also various internationally reputable healthcare organisations, has 
succeeded in organising a wide range of successful events in 2014. These events have all been accredited by the Health Authority-Abu 
Dhabi (‘HAAD’) as category 1 CE hours.
On 13 and 14 March 2014 the 9
th
 ICAN ‘Women’s and Child Health’ was hosted in Abu Dhabi, which boasted an international faculty in 
a programme arranged to tell the story of women’s and children’s health from the stage of conception all the way through to the early 
life of a child and the continuation of women’s health after birth. The topics included Current Advances in Assisted Reproductive 
Procedures, Fetal Echocardiography, Perinatal Psychiatry, Neonatal Infections, Diabetes in Children, Cervical Cancer and Autism 
Spectrum Disorders. Full details are available on the ICAN’s website www.icanuae.com.
Our vision of enhancing and filling the gaps of continuing education in the region by adding to the ICAN family, was further fulfilled by 
presenting the 1
st
 IMCAN (International Management Conference of Al Noor Hospital) on 22 May 2014 entitled ‘Leveraging Information. 
Improved Performance. Better Healthcare’. The IMCAN is aimed at Healthcare Management from various administrative areas, and 
attracted the top management from healthcare institutions in the Government, Public and Private sectors within the UAE.
Our relationship with New York University College of Dentistry (‘NYUCD’), remains successful, and the 4
th
 IDCAN was hosted in 
September 2014 in collaboration with NYUCD. World-renowned speakers such as Dr. Kambiz Khalili, Dr. Olivier Nicolay, Dr. Joao 
Carames and Dr. Mamta Mehra along with a distinguished regional faculty delivered a world class Dental programme.

Apart from the prestigious external events, the CE Department is very conscious of the need to focus on our internal healthcare 
professionals’ continuing education needs.
The CE Department is a firm believer of embracing technology and all the benefits it can bring to education – one such example is 
video-conferencing. During 2014 we have continued for the fourth year in a row to connect to Houston Methodist Global Health Care 
Services via live video-conferencing once a month for their scheduled lecture series.
The Health Authority – Abu Dhabi PQR sets (Professional Qualification Requirements) for, all healthcare professionals and they need to 
present a certain number of Continuing Education hours each year in order to renew their professional licenses. The CE Department 
not only makes sure that there are enough events hosted in order for the healthcare professionals to achieve this requirement, but also 
assists the doctors assemble the correct documentation for submission by the Group’s Licensing Department.
Each of the three main Al Noor Hospitals: Khalifa Street, Airport Road and Al Ain, held weekly one hour Continuing Medical Education 
(‘CME') sessions, and either one and a half or one hour Continuing Nursing Education (‘CNE') sessions on a weekly or fortnightly basis, 
in their respective facilities. The primary attendance and focus is on our internal physicians and nurses, but external healthcare 
professionals are also welcomed. Each hosting hospital transmitted their session via real time video conference to the other hospitals, 
including the smaller branches, to enrich the scientific knowledge sharing between all the heath professionals in the group and to 
ensure that no Al Noor Healthcare professional will ever lack the opportunity to enhance their knowledge for the greater benefit of 
our patients.
To maintain the highest quality speakers and content for our regular internal programme, we carefully monitor our Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs). In 2014 we had an average speaker rating of 3.66 (91.5%) for CNE and 3.34 (83.5%) for CME, on a scale of 1 to 4 
(with 4 being the highest).
The total hours of weekly CE made available in 2014, internally, to the Company’s staff was 425.5 hours. The total number of attendees 
of the CE reached 12,953.
Furthermore, the Al Noor Hospital e-library portal has again proven to be a helpful tool for Al Noor’s staff. The online medical database 
includes Micromedex by Thomson Reuters, UpToDate by Wolters Kluwer Health and the recently added Lippencott’s Nursing Advisor 
and Procedure and Skills. The total number of views for January to December 2014 was 8,420 for the databases. The number of 
registered users increased from 1,235 in 2013 to 1,863 by the end of 2014, largely due to an increased awareness of the site following 
the commencement of an induction session for all newly joined Al Noor staff and periodic training sessions on the usage of the 
e-library portal. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 42
Strategic Report
The CE Department has a strong awareness of the importance of community responsibility. This has been demonstrated by many 
opportunities and initiatives in place, including work placements for UAE students which have been facilitated in collaboration with 
local education institutions such as Abu Dhabi Women’s College and Abu Dhabi Men’s college. These opportunities give the 
undergraduates a ‘one of a kind’ experience to get involved in quality and customer satisfaction projects under the supervision of our 
managers. This also extends to graduates and trainees with medical experience, and who are in need of valuable practical exposure to 
the medical field practice. After obtaining the necessary HAAD approval, we arrange temporary limited time placement as observers in 
various departments such as the pharmacy, biomedical department and medical laboratories. This gives students and trainees an 
opportunity to shadow and observe a medical professional while they practice their everyday work in the field.
During 2015, it is planned to continue organising the ICAN series (ICAN, IMCAN, INCAN, IDCAN and IPCAN) and introduce the IGCAN 
(International Gynaecology Conference of Al Noor). In addition to organising four newly introduced specialised symposia in 
Neurosciences, Ophthalmology, Surgery and Radiology.

The Company is dedicated to provide a safe, healthy and sustainable environment to all patients, staff, contract employees, visitors, 
contractors, vendors and other stakeholders affected by and or involved in the activities of the hospitals or medical centres in which 
we operate. Our facilities are committed to preventing and controlling injuries and illnesses, through the provision of safe work 
practices. We are also committed to the enhancement of the employees’ health and well-being.
The Company is fully in compliance with the Environment, Health and Safety requirements of HAAD, Dubai Health Authority, Ministry of 
Health and local city municipalities in whose jurisdictions we operate including the safe disposal of medical waste.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The Company firmly believes in the dignity and individual rights of every human being as set forth in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. These principles are reflected in all that we do and are fundamental to the practices of an ethical company. We are 
committed to supporting human rights through our compliance with laws and regulations in all aspects and geographies of our 
operations, as well as through our policies and programmes. Our guidelines include:
• Encouraging open and honest communication between management and employees at all times;
• Complying with child labour laws;
• Complying with laws prohibiting forced, bonded, or indentured labour;
• Providing compensation and benefits that are competitive and comply with applicable laws for minimum wages, overtime hours,

• Promoting workforce diversity; and
• Protecting individual privacy.
The Company’s position on human rights is reinforced through our employment and ethics policies which are designed to ensure that 
we conduct business in a legal and ethical manner at all times.
ENVIRONMENT
The Company provides high quality primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services through a network of hospitals and out-patient 
medical centres in the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman. Since the publication of the previous Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions Statement, the Company’s operations have grown through acquisition, resulting in the addition of three medical centres and 
four satellite clinics. The Company’s services are therefore currently provided by three hospitals and 17 out-patient medical centres.
In accordance with the UK Government regulatory requirements, the Company is reporting its greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions. The 
entities containing the GHG sources which we are reporting on are those which we include within our consolidated financial statements. 
We do not have responsibility for emission sources in entities that are not included in our consolidated financial statements.
For the 12 month period 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014, our GHG emissions were as below (including prior year comparatives):

conversion factors for fuel sold specifically in the UAE, where our vehicles and generators are located.

e was identified in the year ended 30 September 2013. 
Reporting on GHG emissions is a new process for the Company and, in order to accurately represent this information to stakeholders, the Company has chosen to correct 
the prior year omission. Accordingly, the restatement has an impact on the Total tonnes CO

GHG emissions are reported. It will therefore not tally with patient numbers reported in other sections of the Annual Report.

Strategic Report Financial Statements
In calculating our GHG emissions, we have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), The 
Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol Version 2.0, the 2014 UK Government Conversion Factors for Company Reporting and the IEA 
CO 2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion (2012 edition).
The reporting year is the twelve month period from 1 October to 30 September. The Company continues to use a 12 month period which is 
non-coterminous with the financial year in order to allow time to collect the required data. Emissions reported above include those emanating 
from all businesses that would be treated as subsidiaries of the Group for financial reporting purposes for the 12 month period to 30 
September 2014.
The Company’s GHG emissions have increased by 8% when compared to the previous GHG Emissions Statement. This is due to the 
growth in the Company’s operations during the reporting period: the acquisitions made have increased the estate and therefore the 
energy use in our buildings. However, the Company has achieved a more efficient ratio for kg CO
2
e per patient treated as compared to 
the prior reporting year. The Company’s GHG efficiency has improved by 8% overall.
Al Noor Hospital Marks Earth Hour
Al Noor Hospital Airport Road took part in the world’s largest grass-roots 
environmental movement, Earth Hour. A number of employees gathered 
at the hospital’s helipad area to join millions of people around the globe in 
turning-off non-essential lights from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm on Saturday 29 
March 2014 and 28 March 2015.
Once the lights were switched-off, participants switched on hundreds of 
LED tea light candles to show their support for the environment.
By participating in Earth Hour, the hospital took an active step in 
supporting a global activity that helps prevent climate change and 
intends to participate in future initiatives dedicated to the environment.

Cancer
Al Noor takes an active role in spreading awareness of cancer to help improve public understanding about the disease and its various types.
Breast Cancer:
Breast cancer awareness month was in October 2014 and Al Noor organised an activity in collaboration with Abu Dhabi Mall in an 
effort to raise breast cancer awareness. The activity kicked-off with the first symbolic walkathon ever held at the mall, which witnessed 
a large turnout of people who united in support for the fight against breast cancer.
Following the walkathon, a breast cancer awareness booth was available to encourage mall visitors to learn more about the disease. A 
medical team comprising physicians, health educators, midwives and nurses was readily available to educate the community on 
screening, early detection and the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle.
Throughout the day, visitors were invited to attend various lectures that were aimed at promoting the importance of regular self-
examinations to help detect any changes at an early stage. Moreover, educational material highlighting key information relating to 
breast cancer was distributed throughout the day, in addition to free mammogram vouchers.
Colorectal Cancer:
Al Noor stepped-up its health awareness efforts by organising a slew of activities that were intended to raise the public’s awareness on 
a common type of cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum known as colorectal cancer.
All three hospitals organised on-campus activities to educate the public on the importance of regular screening and early detection. To 
encourage screening, participants at risk of developing the disease were handed free vouchers that entitled them to a free Fecal 
Immunochemical Test (‘FIT’) known to detect hidden blood in the stool. A medical team comprising Oncologists and 
Gastroenterologists were available to provide advice and free consultations.
The events were successfully inaugurated with a symbolic release of dark blue balloons (which is the colorectal cancer designated 
colour). The highlight of the event was the display of a walk-through inflatable colon, which was available for people to learn more 
about the various stages of the disease. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 46

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report
Introduction
This Report, which is available on the Company’s website, explains 
key features of the Company’s governance structure to provide a 
greater understanding of how the main principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’), published in September 2012 
by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’), have been applied and to 
highlight areas of focus during the year. The Code can be found on 
the FRC’s website: www.frc.org.uk.
The report also includes items required by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules. The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts. It has 
considered and endorsed the arrangements to enable it to confirm 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Compliance with the Code
With the exceptions as noted below, the Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Code.
(i) Code Provision B.1.2 – the number of independent Non-Executive 
Directors, excluding the Chairman, constitutes less than half the 
Board;
(ii) Code Provision B.2.1 – a majority of members of the Nomination 
Committee are not independent Non-Executive Directors;
(iii) Code Provision C.3.1 – Ian Tyler, the Company Chairman, is also a 
member of the Audit and Risk Committee; and
(iv) Code Provision D.2.1 – Faisal Belhoul, who is a member of the 
Remuneration Committee, is not an independent Non-Executive 
Director and Ian Tyler, who is Chairman of the Board, is also the 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Non-Compliance – Explanation
Code Provision B.1.2 – in accordance with the Relationship 
Agreement, parties to that agreement who hold more than 10% of 
the Company’s shares are entitled to appoint one representative to 
the Board for every 10% of shares held. More details on the 
Relationship Agreement can be found on page 79 of this report. 
Accordingly, Astro II SPV and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Butti Al 
Hamed have each appointed two Non-Executive Directors to the 
Board. Faisal Belhoul and Khaldoun Haj Hasan represent Astro II 
SPV, and, Sheikh Mansoor Bin Butti Al Hamed and Ahmad Nimer 
represent Sheikh Mohammed Bin Butti Al Hamed on the Board. All 
four shareholder representatives actively participate in the affairs of 
the Company and the Board considers that their collective 
experiences, skills, knowledge and contributions enhance Board 
discussions and decision making. None of the shareholder-
appointed Non-Executive Directors are paid any fees for their duties 
as Directors.
At the beginning of 2014 the Board was made up of 10 Directors 
and comprised an independent Chairman (who was independent 
on appointment), one executive Director, five non-independent 
executives Directors and four non-executive Directors. In October 
2014, Dr Kassem Alom stepped down from his role as Chief 
Executive Officer and took up the role of Deputy Chairman. 
Ronald Lavater was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and 
these changes resulted in the number of directors on the Board 
increasing to 11 and the number of non-independent Directors 
increasing to six as Dr Kassem Alom was not considered 
independent. As a result the Board intends to appointment at 
least one additional non-executive Director to bring the balance of 
independent directors back to the position at the IPO.
Code Provision B.2.1 – With the experience of Dr Kassem Alom in 
UAE Healthcare, and Ian Tyler through his previous experience within 
companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, their input on the 
recruitment of suitable directors is invaluable in this niche market, 
and both their presences on the Nomination Committee are crucial 
in optimising the effectiveness of its decision making, ensuring a 
high quality Board is in place.
Code Provision C.3.1 – Ian Tyler is a chartered accountant and has 
previously held the role of finance director. His broad range of 
experience, financial knowledge and skill are valuable additions to 
the Audit and Risk Committee and help to ensure that this committee 
discharges its duties effectively and efficiently.
Code Provision D.2.1 – As set out above, investor-nominated and 
shareholder representatives have been appointed to the Board and 
actively participate in the activities of the Company. They are 
represented on the Remuneration Committee through Faisal Belhoul. 
Ian Tyler’s knowledge of remuneration best practice of UK listed 
companies is a valuable addition to this Committee.
How the Board Works
The Board and its Committees
The Board is responsible for the effective oversight of the 
Company. It also agrees the strategic direction and governance 
structure that will help achieve the long-term success of the 
Company and deliver shareholder value. The Board takes the lead 
in areas such as strategy, financial policy and making sure we 
maintain a sound system of internal control. The Board’s full 
responsibilities are set out in the matters reserved for the Board. 
The Board also delegates authority to its Committees to carry 
out certain tasks on its behalf, so that it can operate efficiently 
and give the right level of attention and consideration to relevant 
matters. The composition and role of each Committee is 
summarised on pages 59 to 63. The matters reserved for the 
Board and the full terms of reference of each Committee are 
available on our website. Strategic Report

Board Composition, Qualification and Independence
The composition, experience and balance of skills on the Board 
are regularly reviewed to ensure that there is the right mix on the 
Board and its committees and that they are working effectively. 
There are currently 11 Directors on the Board, which comprises a 
Non-Executive Chairman (who, for the purposes of the Code was 
independent on appointment), one Executive Director, four 
independent Non-Executive Directors and five Non-Executive 
Directors who are considered by the Board not to be 
independent. The current members of the Board have a wide 
range of skills and experience. Detailed knowledge of our Group’s 
operations, the healthcare industry, doing business in the UAE, 
and leading a company listed on the London Stock Exchange are 
all crucial to the Board’s ability to lead the Company successfully.
Diversity
The Board welcomes the recommendations of the Davies Review 
of Women on Boards and supports the principles of boardroom 
diversity. The Board has adopted a Board diversity policy and will 
ensure these principles are embedded into its operation. The 
Directors acknowledge the benefits, including gender diversity 
and remain committed to ensuring that the Company’s Directors 
bring a wide range of skills, knowledge, experience, background 
and perspective to the composition of the Board. Since the year 
end the Company has appointed three females to its senior 
management team: the Senior Director for Human Resources, 
Chief Information Officer and Chief Nursing Officer. Additionally, 
the Board will increase, at its earliest opportunity, the level of 
representation of females and minorities when considering 
refreshing and renewing Board membership. However, all 
appointments will continue to be made on merit against objective 
criteria, in the context of the overall balance of skills and 
backgrounds that the Board needs to maintain in order to remain 
effective.
Key Board Roles
Chairman – 
Ian Tyler
Chief Executive Officer – 
Ronald Lavater
• Leads the Board
• Promotes high standards of 
corporate governance
• Facilitates effective 
contributions by the 
Non-Executive Directors
• Promotes a culture of 
openness and debate
• Encourages constructive 
relations between Executive 
and Non-Executive 
Directors

actions
• Supports the Chairman to 
ensure that appropriate 
governance standards 
spread through the 
organisation
• Ensures that the Board is 
made aware of the 
employees’ views on 
relevant issues
Interaction Between the Chairman and the Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are 
separate, with a distinct division of responsibilities. The 
partnership between Ian Tyler and Ronald Lavater is based on 
mutual trust and is facilitated by regular contact between the two. 
The separation of authority enhances independent oversight of 
Executive Management by the Board and helps to ensure that no 
one individual on the Board has unfettered authority. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 56
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director (“SID”) is Seamus Keating, who 
is available to shareholders if they have concerns that the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or other Executive 
Directors have failed to resolve, or for which such channels of 
communication are inappropriate. The SID also acts as an internal 
sounding board for the Chairman and serves as intermediary for 
the other Directors, with the Chairman, when necessary. While 
there were no requests from shareholders or Directors for access 
to the SID during the reporting period, the role of the SID is 
considered to be an important check and balance in the Group’s 
governance structure. In accordance with the Code, neither the 
Chairman nor the SID are employed as executives of the Group.
• Acts as intermediary 
between Directors when 
required
• Works closely with the 
Chairman, acts as a sounding 
board and provides support
• Is available to shareholders 
and other Non-Executive 
Directors to address any 
concerns or issues they feel 
have not been adequately 
dealt with through the usual 
channels of communication
• Constructively challenge 
management proposals
• Help develop proposals 
on strategy
• Have a prime role in 
appointing and, where 
necessary, removing 
Executive Directors
• Have an integral role in 
succession planning
Non-Executive Director Independence
The Board considers and reviews the independence of each 
Non-Executive Director on an annual basis as part of the 
Directors’ performance evaluation. In carrying out the review, 
consideration is given to factors such as their character, 
judgment, commitment and performance on the Board and 
relevant committees and their ability to provide objective 
challenge to management. The Board has concluded that each of 
the Independent Non-Executive Directors continues to 
demonstrate those behaviours and continues to be considered by 
the Board as independent.
The experience, professional backgrounds, international diversity 
and independence of the current Directors can be summarised as 
follows:
Industry sector experience
 Healthcare  4
 Finance 3
 Infrastructure 3
 Technology 1

Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Appointment and Tenure
All Directors serve on the basis of letters of appointment which 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
The letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected 
of Non-Executive Directors who, on appointment, undertake that 
they will have sufficient time to meet what is required of them. 
The Company does not place a term limit on Director’s service 
as all continuing Directors will present themselves for annual 
re-election by shareholders at the Company’s future Annual 
General Meetings (‘AGM’).
Director Induction and Training
The Chairman, with the support of the Company Secretary, 
is responsible for the induction of new Directors and ongoing 
development of all Directors. New Directors receive a full, formal 
and tailored induction on joining the Board designed to provide 
an understanding of the Group’s business, governance and key 
stakeholders. The induction process may include provision of an 
induction pack, operational site visits, meetings with key 
individuals and briefings on key business, legal and regulatory 
issues facing the Group. As the internal and external business 
environment changes, it is important to ensure the Directors’ 
skills and knowledge are refreshed and updated regularly. 
Accordingly the Chairman, with the assistance of the Company 
Secretary, ensures that updates on corporate governance, 
regulatory and technical matters are provided to Directors at 
Board meetings. In this way, Directors keep their skills and 
knowledge relevant so as to enable them to continue to fulfil their 
duties effectively.
During the year, the Directors participated in various training 
sessions refreshing their knowledge of their obligations under the 
UK regulatory regime. Since the year end, Business Ethics related 
and Takeover Code director responsibilities education sessions 
have been held.
Information and Support Available to Directors
All Board Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who 
advises them on Board and governance matters. The Chairman 
and the Company Secretary work together to ensure that Board 
papers are clear, accurate, delivered in a timely manner to 
Directors, and of sufficient quality to enable the Board to 
discharge its duties. As well as the support of the Company 
Secretary, there is a procedure in place for any Director to take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties, where considered necessary.
Director Election
Following recommendations from the Nomination Committee, 
the Board considers that all Directors continue to be effective, 
committed to their roles and have sufficient time available to 
perform their duties. As set out in the 2013 Annual Report and 
Accounts, and, in accordance with provision B.7.1 of the Code 
and the Directors’ letters of appointment, all Directors will be 
subject to annual re-election. Accordingly, all Directors elected in 
2013 will seek re-election at the Company’s second AGM being 
held on 12 May 2015, as set out in the Notice of AGM.
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
have or may have interests that conflict with those of the 
Company, unless that conflict is first authorised by the Directors. 
This includes potential conflicts that may arise when a Director 
takes up a position with another company. The Company’s 
Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise such potential 
conflicts, and there is in place a procedure to deal with any actual 
or potential conflict of interest. The Board deals with each 
appointment on its individual merit and takes into consideration 
all the circumstances. All potential conflicts approved by the 
Board are recorded in a Conflicts of Interests Register, which is 
reviewed by the Board at least quarterly to ensure that the 
procedure is working effectively.
Board Evaluation and Effectiveness
The Board and its Committee were formed upon IPO in June 2013 
and in January 2015 an internal evaluation commenced and was 
conducted by the Company Secretary under the direction of the 
Chairman. The Company Secretary had distributed a tailored, 
high-level questionnaire for the Directors’ completion. 
The questionnaire was structured to provide Directors with 
an opportunity to express their views about:
• the performance of the Board and its committees, 
including how Directors work together as a whole;
• the balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Directors; and
• individual performance, particularly considering whether 
each Director continues to make an effective contribution.
The Board’s second evaluation process was concluded in March 
2015. In accordance with the requirements of UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board intends to undertake an externally 
facilitated evaluation in its third year. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 58

Shareholder Engagement
Responsibility for shareholder relations rests with the Chief Executive 
Officer. He ensures that there is effective communication with 
shareholders on matters such as governance and strategy, and is 
responsible for ensuring that the Board understands the views of 
shareholders on matters such as governance and strategy. We are 
supported by our corporate brokers with whom we are in constant 
dialogue. As part of a comprehensive investor relations programme, 
formal meetings with investors are scheduled to discuss the Group’s 
interim and final results. During intervening periods, the Company 
continues its dialogue with the investor community by meeting key 
investor representatives and holding investor roadshows. During the 
year, the Company met with 60 shareholders and potential 
shareholders. Presentations to analysts are posted on the 
Company’s website at www.alnoorhospital.com.
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)

the Board. The Committee gives due consideration to laws and 
regulations, the provisions of the Code and the requirements of 
the Listing Rules.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the

The Committee receives reports from external advisers and from 
the senior management team, as required, to enable it to

Significant Issues
Summarised below are some of the significant issues the 
committee considered in relation to the financial statements 
during the year.
Revenue Recognition
The Group estimates revenue in respect of insurance claims 
based on historical trends, its experience of insurance companies 
and the current economic climate. The Committee throughout the 
year reviewed trends in rejection rates and the provisioning 
methodology and satisfied itself on the application of a consistent 
process for determining the level of provisions required. The 
Committee has further satisfied itself on the timely conclusion of 
reconciliations with Insurance companies.
Other Areas of Focus:
Goodwill
The committee has reviewed the impairment assumptions and 
business plans to satisfy itself with the goodwill calculations in 
respect of acquisitions completed during the year as well as 
existing goodwill balances.
Internal controls
The committee reviewed internal controls and risk management 
reports from the management team and its internal audit team at 
each meeting.
SAP Implementation
The Company is in the process of implementing the SAP ERP 
system with a view to eliminating legacy systems and 
implementing a single robust integrated system for the core 
business needs of the company. During the year the company 
went live on the finance and materials management modules of 
SAP. The Committee received reports from management on the 
implementation and modules going live in 2015, the risks 
associated with such implementation, and steps being taken to 
mitigate against these risks. The Committee will continue this 
review of the implementation across 2015.
Internal Audit
The Committee receives regular reports on the control 
environment from the Internal Audit Director supported by 
Deloitte LLP. These reports highlight key improvement themes 
and recommend areas for focus. In addition, the Committee has 
visibility of management responsiveness in addressing internal 
audit actions.
External Audit
The external auditor was appointed 29 July 2013, and was 
re-appointed at the 2014 AGM. KPMG LLP has therefore acted as 
the external auditor to the Group throughout the year. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor is based in London and is supported by an audit 
team based in the UAE. The Committee is responsible for oversight 
of the external auditors, including approving the annual work plan 
and, on behalf of the Board, approving the audit fee.
External Auditor Independence and Effectiveness
In particular, it is the Committee’s responsibility to monitor the 
performance, objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor. In 2014 the Committee held two private meetings 
with the external auditor without management being present with 
one meeting being held following the year end. The effectiveness 
of the external auditors is evaluated by the Committee each year. 
The Committee examines five main performance criteria – 
robustness of the audit process, independence and objectivity, 
quality of delivery, quality of people and service, and value-added 
advice.
The Committee has recommended to the Board that the re-
appointment of KPMG as the Company’s external auditor be 
proposed to shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
Provision of Non-Audit Services
Non-audit services provided by the external auditor are approved 
in accordance with the Company’s non-audit services policy.
The Chief Financial Officer is authorised to engage the external 
auditor to perform separate non-audit services up to an aggregate 
fee of US$25,000 annually. The Chairman of the Committee is 
authorised to engage the external auditor to perform non-audit 
services up to an aggregate fee of US$250,000 annually.
The Committee is aware of the changes and potential changes to 
the requirements for external auditor selection given recent 
reviews by the Competition Commission and the EU and has 
updated its non-audit services policy in respect of its prohibited 
services. As a general principal, the Committee will seek to keep 
the ratio of fees for non-audit services to statutory audit services 
at or below 1:1. However, this ratio may be exceeded where the 
Committee is satisfied on the question of independence and in its 
judgement believes that the auditor is best placed to undertake a 
particular piece of non-audit work. The Committee is aware that a 
statutory mechanism to apply a cap on non-audit fee levels will 
start to apply to the Company from 17 June 2016. Strategic Report
61 Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Corporate Governance Financial Statements
From 2020, therefore, under current proposals, non-audit services 
will be capped at 70% of the average of the statutory audit fees 
for the preceding three years. The Audit Committee will ensure 
that the Company establishes a panel of professional advisors of 
requisite quality over the coming years to enable the Company to 
comply with the new legislation while allowing the Company 
access to the appropriate professional advice for its business. 
The Committee has also updated its own terms of reference to 
include:
• The additional responsibilities of the Committee;
• External audit firm rotation not to exceed 20 years in 
anticipation of UK Government Legislation with a tender 
process after not more than 10 years; and
• Rotation of the lead audit partner after five years with the 
flexibility of an additional two years if it is considered 
necessary to maintain audit quality and the extension is 
disclosed to shareholders.
The Committee will continue to monitor developments throughout 
the year.
Approval of non-audit services is given on the basis that the 
service will not compromise independence and is a natural 
extension of the audit or if there are overriding business or 
efficiency reasons making the external auditors most suited to 
provide the service.
Total non-audit services provided by KPMG for the year ended 
31 December 2014 were US$395,000 (2013: US$1,689,000) which 
is 71% (2013: 409%) of total audit and audit-related fees.

Audit fees 557 413
Non-audit fees 395 1,689
Ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees (per cent) 71% 409%
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the non-audit related 
services undertaken by KPMG included quarterly and half-yearly 
reviews, work in connection with IT project management 
assurance, tax services for a closed company review and 
Greenhouse Gas reporting. A breakdown of fees paid to the 
auditor is set out in note 23 on page 103.
Risk Management and Internal Controls
The Board recognises its overall responsibility to present a 
balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position 
and prospects and has responsibility for ensuring that 
management maintain effective systems of risk management and 
internal control and for reviewing the effectiveness of these 
systems. Such systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable, and not absolute assurance, against 
material misstatement or loss.
Each year the Board reviews the effectiveness of our risk 
management and internal control processes that cover all 
material controls, including financial reporting, operational and 
compliance controls. The latest review covered the financial year 
to 31 December 2014 and the period up to the approval of this 
Annual Report and Accounts.
The processes in place include identifying, assessing and 
managing risk, both at an operational and strategic level. Our risk 
identification and mitigation processes have been designed to be 
responsive to the business as it develops and to the environment 
in which it operates. Our internal control process starts with 
identification of risks, documentation of controls in place and 
evaluating their effectiveness (both design and operational). We 
do this through routine reviews carried out by process owners 
and facilitated by relevant dedicated, specialist teams.
Risk registers are in place for all businesses and functions. We 
also maintain a Group-level risks register which describes the key 
risks and assessment of their likelihood and impact as well as the 
controls implemented to manage these risks. This register will 
be reviewed by the Committee and the Board as part of their 
standard processes. Our current key risks are summarised in 
the Strategy section ‘Key Risks and Uncertainties’ on pages 
38 and 39.
Whistleblowing
The Committee oversees the Company’s processes for handling 
reports from whistleblowers. The Code of Business Conduct 
encourages all employees to report any potential improprieties 
in financial reporting or other matters. All reports received are 
reported to the Audit and Risk Committee, and where appropriate, 
our Legal and or Internal Audit function may be asked to investigate 
issues and report the outcome to the Committee. The Code of 
Conduct was updated during the year and training was provided 
to the Group’s employees and the Board. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 62

William S. Ward.

Role of the Nomination Committee
The Committee assists the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities relating to the composition and make-up of the 
Board and any committees of the Board. It is also responsible for 
periodically reviewing the Board’s structure and identifying 
potential candidates to be appointed as Directors or Committee 
members as the need may arise. The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for evaluating the structure, size and composition 
including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of the 
Board and Committees of the Board, retirements and 
appointments of additional and replacement Directors and 
Committee members and makes appropriate recommendations 
to the Board on such matters.
Main Activities
• Succession planning; and
• Composition of the Board and its Committees including 
consideration of balance, skills and diversity of Directors.
During 2014, the Committee’s areas of focus included considering 
and assessing the balance of skills, experience and diversity on 
the Board. At the beginning of 2014 the Board was made up of 10 
Directors and comprised an independent Chairman (who was 
independent on appointment), one executive Director, five 
non-independent executives Directors and four non-executive 
Directors. In October 2014, Dr Kassem Alom stepped down from 
his role as Chief Executive Officer and took up the role of Deputy 
Chairman. Ronald Lavater was appointed as Chief Executive 
Officer and these changes resulted in the number of directors on 
the Board increasing to 11 and the number of non-independent 
Directors increasing to six as Dr Kassem Alom was not 
considered independent. As a result the Board intends to 
appointment at least one additional non-executive Director to 
bring the balance of independent directors back to the position at 
the IPO.
The Committee is aware that throughout the year the Board did 
not fully comply with the UK Code recommendations on balance 
and has concluded that there are some attributes which need to 
be brought onto the Board, including diversity. The Committee 
has been considering ways in which it can address these going 
forward, and as a consequence, a search process is underway to 
appoint an additional Non-Executive Director in due course. 
Whilst the successful candidate will be appointed on merit, the 
Committee is mindful that gender diversity is a key area that 
should be considered and addressed.
The Committee also assisted the Board with the search for a new 
Chief Executive Officer. Heidrick and Struggles (UK) Limited, who 
assisted with the recruitment of William S. Ward in 2013, 
specialise in the recruitment of high calibre executives and 
non-executive directors and were engaged again by the Company 
to ensure that the widest possible pools of candidates were 
available to select from.
A shortlist of potential appointees was considered by the 
Committee and the Board and candidates were invited for 
interview based on merit and against objective criteria, after 
assessing their relevant qualifications and time commitments. 
After interviewing suitable candidates, the Committee was 
pleased to recommend Ronald Lavater to the Board as a potential 
Chief Executive Officer. The Board, who have ultimate 
responsibility for Board appointments, were mindful of 
Mr. Lavater’s history of hospital leadership roles in the UAE and 
experience gained in a listed healthcare environment in the United 
States when assessing his candidacy. He was appointed to the 
Board with effect from 1 October 2014.
The biographical details of the current directors can be found on 
pages 48 and 51. The Committee considers that the performance 
of each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be 
effective and that they each demonstrate commitment to their 
role, including commitment of time for Board and Committee 
meetings and any other duties. In accordance with the 
recommendation for FTSE 350 companies set out in the Code, 
all of the Directors of the Company will be subject to annual 
re-election at the AGM.
The corporate responsibility section on pages 40 to 47 of the 
report explains the Group’s approach to diversity, including 
gender diversity percentages. Since the year end the Board 
has adopted a Board diversity policy.
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors, including the expected time commitment, are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office. Strategic Report

management committee and not a Committee of the Board. 
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Ethics setting out 
the general behaviours expected of Board members, employees, 
suppliers, contractors, agents and partners in a range of different 
areas including:
• Compliance with laws and regulations;
• Dealing with matters fairly as regards to competitors, 
suppliers, customers or colleagues;
• Potential conflicts of interest; and
• Dealing with anti-bribery and corruption.
The Business Ethics Committee, pursuant to its charter, is 
responsible for monitoring, overseeing and reviewing compliance 
by Senior Management and all other employees of the Group with 
the Code of Business Ethics, as well as making changes to the 
Code of Business Ethics as needed. It is also responsible for the 
initial review of all allegations of violation of the Code of Business 
Ethics and for recommending the appropriate course of action to 
be taken, including whether any information needs to be provided 
to federal and/or regulatory authorities.
Main Activities

• The implementation of the Code of Business Ethics;
• Investigated the reports and complaints received by the 
Committee; and

Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholder,
In 2014, the Company performed well, exceeding its forecast profits and continuing on the path of strong sustainable growth. During 
the year, we successfully concluded the acquisition of GICC and opened three new medical centres along with a number of satellite 
clinics. We also added 64 revenue generating physicians (net of resignation), driving growth in patient volumes.
Whilst the business performed strongly in 2014, we did not reach all of the stretching targets we set for the business. Whilst EBITDA 
generated was close to target, margin and cash conversion were both below threshold levels. Certain operational and quality measures 
were met, reflecting some key areas of progress. Consequently, the annual bonus achieved was 11.8% of maximum.
This year has also seen the execution of several planned changes in the leadership of the Group and the Committee has considered 
and determined appropriate remuneration packages.
In October, Dr. Kassem Alom stepped down as CEO and as an Executive Director of the Company, and was appointed as Non-
Executive Deputy Chairman of the Company. As Deputy Chairman, he will continue to play an active role with the Company and the 
Board will continue to benefit from his sound judgment and wealth of accumulated experience; as part of his role, he will also ensure a 
smooth handover of executive responsibilities to the new Chief Executive.
With effect from 1 October 2014, Ronald Lavater was appointed CEO. His remuneration arrangements on recruitment were in line with 
the remuneration policy as agreed by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, and are set out on page 70.
Remuneration for 2015
The shareholders approved the remuneration policy as set out in the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2014 AGM, and the 
Remuneration Committee is comfortable that the policy remains appropriate and should continue to operate for 2015 with no major 
changes:
• Base Compensation for the CEO will remain at the level agreed upon his appointment in October 2014. For information, the average 
base compensation increase across the Group will be 10% for all employees, reflecting the continued high demand for healthcare 
professionals and the prevailing rate of inflation in the UAE
• The structure and quantum of the annual bonus for the Leadership Team is set in line with market practice, with performance 
measures selected to drive alignment with shareholders’ interests
• Performance shares are granted annually under the long-term incentive, with vesting after three years based on earnings per share 
(‘EPS') growth and relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’), conditions which we believe provide strong alignment between the 
Leadership Team and shareholders. This alignment is further strengthened by the operation of share ownership guidelines
Although there are no changes to the remuneration policy proposed, it has been included in this year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the information of shareholders.
The Committee believes the policies continue to be the right ones for Al Noor, and that decisions have been taken within that policy 
that are in the best interests of long-term shareholders. We look forward to your support for this report.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Company’s remuneration policy was put to a shareholder 
vote at the 2014 AGM and was approved by 98.24% of 
shareholders. There is no requirement to vote on the policy in 
2015 unless any changes to the policy are proposed, and the 
Committee does not intend on making any changes to the policy 
at this time.
The policy is set out below for information only; the chart showing 
remuneration scenarios on page 68 has been updated to reflect 
proposed 2015 remuneration levels, and the tables on page 69 
have been updated to reflect the current composition of the 
Board.
Policy Overview
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for 
establishing appropriate remuneration arrangements for the CEO 
and other senior management in the Group.
In setting the remuneration policy for the CEO and other senior 
management in the Group, the Committee will ensure that the 
arrangements are in the best interests of both the Group and its 
shareholders, by taking into account the following general 
principles:
• To lead the UAE market in medical quality by attracting, 
retaining and motivating the best person for each position, 
without paying more than is necessary;
• To ensure total remuneration packages are simple and fair in 
design so that they are valued by participants;
• To ensure that the fixed element of remuneration is determined 
in line with local market rates, taking account of individual 
performance, responsibilities and experience, and that a 
significant proportion of the total remuneration package is 
linked to financial rewards;
• To balance performance pay between the achievement of 
financial performance objectives and delivering sustainable 
stock market out-performance; creating a clear line of sight 
between performance and reward and providing a focus on 
sustained improvements in profitability and returns; and
• To provide a significant proportion of performance linked pay 
in shares, allowing senior management to build significant 
shareholding in the business and therefore aligning 
management with shareholders’ interests and the Company’s 
performance, without encouraging excessive risk taking.
Consideration of Shareholder Views
The Company is committed to maintaining good communications 
with investors. The Committee considers the AGM to be an 
opportunity to meet and communicate with investors, giving 
shareholders the opportunity to raise any issues or concerns 
they may have. In addition, the Committee will seek to engage 
directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies 
should any material changes be made to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 66

Notes
1 A description of how the Company intends to implement the above policy is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
2 Base compensation includes base salary plus fixed cash allowances, which are a normal part of the fixed remuneration package for employees in the UAE.
3 The annual bonus is focused predominantly on key financial performance indicators, to reflect how successful the Group has been in managing its operations. The 
balance is determined on how well the Executive Directors performed against annual operational targets including measures of clinical excellence. The LTIP performance 
measures (EPS and TSR relative to other companies in the healthcare sector), reward significant long-term returns to shareholders and long-term financial growth. 
Targets are set on sliding scales that take account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the Company. Only modest rewards are available for 
achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of challenging strategic plans approved at the start of each year.
4 The Committee operates long-term incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and the HMRC rules 
where relevant. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans. These 
include (but are not limited to) the following:
 Who participates;
 The timing of the grant of award and/or payment;
 The size of an award (up to plan limits) and/or a payment;
 Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
 Determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes;
 Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends); and
 The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
5 Wages include base salary but exclude all fixed cash allowances.

Corporate Governance
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Previous Awards
Authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former directors (such as, the 
vesting or exercise of past share awards) when the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy was approved by Shareholders in 2014.
The Committee considers pay and employment conditions of 
employees in the Group when determining Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. When considering the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration structure and levels, the Committee reviews base 
compensation and annual bonus arrangements for the 
management team, to ensure that there is a coherent approach 
across the Group. The annual bonus plan operates on a similar 
basis across the senior management team and aims to encourage 
a high level of employee share ownership. The key difference in the 
policy for Executive Directors is that remuneration is more heavily 
weighted towards long-term variable pay than other employees. 
This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created 
for shareholders and the remuneration received by the 
Executive Directors.
The Committee does not formally consult with employees in 
respect of the design of the Executive Director remuneration 
policy, although the Committee will keep this under review.
Remuneration Scenarios for the CEO
The chart below shows an estimate of the potential future 
remuneration payable for the CEO in 2015 at different levels of 
performance. The chart highlights that the performance-related 
elements of the package comprise a significant portion of the 
CEO’s total remuneration at on-target and maximum performance.

2 The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits (as 
disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 71) for the year ended 
31 December 2014.
3 The end of service gratuity is based on the provision accrued (as disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on page 71) for the year ended 31 December 
2014 in line with the UAE Labour Law limit.
4 Minimum performance assumes no award is earned under the annual bonus plan 
and no vesting is achieved under the LTIP; at on-target, 50% is earned under the 
annual bonus plan and 50% is achieved under the LTIP; and at maximum full 
vesting under both plans.
5 Share price movement and dividend accrual have been excluded from the 
above analysis.
Directors’ Recruitment and Promotions
The policy on the recruitment or promotion of an Executive 
Director takes into account the need to attract, retain and 
motivate the best person for each position, while at the same time 
ensuring a close alignment between the interests of shareholders 
and management.
If a new Executive Director were appointed, the Committee would 
seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration 
policy approved by shareholders, save that there would be 
discretion to award a combined annual bonus and LTIP of up to 
400% of base compensation. Flexibility would be retained to set 
base compensation at the level necessary to facilitate the hiring of 
candidates of appropriate calibre in external markets and make 
awards or payments in respect of deferred remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In terms 
of remuneration to compensate for forfeited awards, the 
Committee would look to replicate the arrangements being 
forfeited as closely as possible and in doing so, would take 
account of relevant factors including the nature of the deferred 
remuneration, performance conditions and the time over which 
they would have vested or been paid.
For an internal appointment, any incentive amount awarded in 
respect of a prior role may be allowed to vest on its original terms, 
or adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. 
Any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue.
The Committee may also agree that the Company will meet 
certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with 
the approved remuneration policy at that time.
Directors’ Service Agreements and 
Payments for Loss of Office
The Committee seeks to ensure that contractual terms of the 
Executive Director’s service agreement reflect best practice.
The CEO’s service agreement is terminable on six months’ notice. 
In circumstances of termination on notice the Committee will 
determine an equitable compensation package, having regard 
to the particular circumstances of the case. The Committee has 
discretion to require notice to be worked or to make payment in 
lieu of notice or to place the director on garden leave for the 
notice period.
In case of payment in lieu or garden leave, base compensation, 
benefits and end of service gratuity will be paid for the period of 
notice served on garden leave or paid in lieu. If the Committee 
believes it would be in shareholders’ interests payments would be 
made in phased instalments and in the case of payment in lieu will 
be subject to be offset against earnings elsewhere. Strategic Report
69 Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Corporate Governance Financial Statements
An annual bonus may be payable in respect of the period of the 
bonus plan year worked by the Director; there is no provision for 
an amount in lieu of bonus to be payable for any part of the notice 
period not worked. The bonus will be scaled back pro-rata for the 
period of the incentive year worked by the Director and would 
remain payable at the normal payment date.
Shares under the deferred annual bonus and long-term incentive 
arrangements are subject to the rules which contain discretionary 
provisions setting out the treatment of awards where a participant 
leaves for designated reasons (i.e. participants who leave early on 
account of injury, disability or ill health, death, a sale of their 
employer or business in which they were employed, statutory 
redundancy, retirement or any other reason at the discretion of 
the Committee). In these circumstances a participant’s awards 
will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and instead will 
continue to vest on the normal vesting date or earlier at the 
discretion of the Committee, subject to the performance 
conditions attached to the relevant awards. The awards will, other 
than in exceptional circumstances, be scaled back pro-rata for 
the period of the incentive year worked by the Director.
In addition to the above payments, the Committee may make any 
other payments determined by a court of law in respect of the 
termination of a Director’s contract.
In the event of a change of control all unvested awards under the 
deferred annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements would 
vest, to the extent that any performance conditions attached to the 
relevant awards have been achieved. The awards will, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, be scaled back pro-rata for the period 
of the incentive year worked by the Director.
The date of the CEO’s service contract is:
Ronald Lavater 1 October 2014
The service contract is available for inspection during normal 
business hours at the Company’s registered office, and available 
for inspection at the AGM.
Non-Executive Directors’ Terms of Engagement
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by letter of appointment for 
an initial period of three years, which are terminable by three 
months’ notice on either side. However, the Company intends on 
complying with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and accordingly all Directors will stand for annual re-election 
by shareholders at future AGMs until the Board determines 
otherwise.
In 2014 four Non-Executive Directors were considered to be 
independent of the Company.

This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with Part 
4 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and 
9.8.6R of the Listing Rules. The Annual Report on Remuneration 
will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM. The 
information on pages 64 to 75 has been audited.
Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with 
the Board the policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
including setting the over-arching principles, parameters and 
governance framework and determining the initial remuneration 
package of each Executive Director. In addition, the Committee 
monitors the structure and level of remuneration for the senior 
management team and is aware of pay and conditions in 
the workforce generally. The Committee also ensures full 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation 
to remuneration.
Members and Activities of the Committee
The members of the Committee during 2014 were Ian Tyler (Chair), 
Seamus Keating and Faisal Belhoul. All members were Non-
Executive Directors, save Ian Tyler, who was Non-Executive 
Chairman. None of the Committee members have day-to-day 
involvement with the business nor do they have any personal 
financial interest, except as shareholders, in the matters to be 
recommended. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The number of formal meetings held and the

External Advice Received
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on 
remuneration matters from New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a trading 
name of Aon plc. The Committee also consulted with the CEO but 
not in relation to his own remuneration.
NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
adheres to the Voluntary Code of Conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK.
The fees paid to NBS for advice to the Committee during 2014 
were £128,715. No additional fees were paid by the Group to NBS 
or any other part of Aon plc in respect of other services. The 
Committee monitors the relationship with external advisers and 
remains confident that NBS is independent and no conflicts of 
interest exist.
Shareholder Voting at AGM

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2015
Ronald Lavater was appointed as Chief Executive on 
1 October 2014 with the following remuneration package, 
all elements of which fall with the Group’s approved 
remuneration policy:
• A salary of US$750,000 per annum;
• An annual bonus opportunity of 150% of salary;
• A long-term incentive participation level anticipated to be 175% 
of salary per annum;
• Usual benefits including medical insurance and car allowance, 
but no additional payment for housing allowance; and
• End-of-service benefit as prescribed under UAE law.
No additional payments were made to Mr Lavater on recruitment 
and there was no buy-out of any awards lost as a result of leaving 
previous employment.
Base Compensation
The CEO’s base compensation was reviewed on appointment and 
the Committee considered that no adjustment was required for 2015. 
By way of context, the Committee considered the increase in base 
compensation for the senior management team and the workforce 
generally, where the average increase across the Group will be 10%. 
Accordingly, base compensation for 2015 will be as follows:

Annual Bonus for 2015
For 2015 the annual bonus opportunity will be 150% of base compensation. The annual bonus will be assessed 80% against financial 
and 20% against operational objectives, including measures of clinical excellence, to provide a rounded assessment of the Group and 
individuals’ performance.
50% of the bonus payable will be paid in cash and 50% will be deferred into shares. Clawback provisions will apply to both the cash 
and share elements.
Long-term Incentive to be Granted in 2015
The Committee intends to grant an LTIP award to the CEO in 2015 over shares with a value of 175% of base compensation. Vesting of 
50% of the award will be based on EPS growth and the remaining 50% will be determined by TSR, with half of that amount measured 
relative to the FTSE World Healthcare Index and the other half against a tailored group of healthcare companies operating in markets 
similar to our own.
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance, in that they ensure the CEO is 
incentivised and rewarded for the financial performance of the Group as well as creating value for shareholders.
The award will be subject to clawback provisions.
Performance condition Threshold target (25% vesting) Stretch target (100% vesting)
EPS growth 6% per annum 15% per annum
TSR vs World Healthcare Index In line with index 8.5% per annum above the index
TSR vs Healthcare sector peers Median of peers Upper quartile of peers
End of Service Gratuity
As required under the UAE Labour Law, the Company accrues for the end-of-service gratuity entitlement in respect of the CEO, 
whereby the gratuity shall be 21 days’ wages
1
 for each year of the first five years of employment and 30 days wages for each additional 
year of employment thereafter, on the condition that the total gratuity does not exceed two years’ wages.
1 Wages include base salary but exclude all fixed cash allowances.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman’s and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Board, based on the responsibility and time 
committed to the Group’s affairs and appropriate market comparisons. Individual Non-Executive Directors do not take part in 
discussions regarding their own fees. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive no other benefits and do not participate in 
short-term or long-term reward schemes. A summary of the current fees and those for 2015 are set out below. Dr. Kassem Alom was 
appointed Deputy Chairman from 1 October 2014. The fees for this position were set at £90,000 from this date, and will not be 
changed for 2015. No other changes to fees for 2014 were considered appropriate, as these levels were recently determined:

benefits (primarily medical insurance and car benefits) from the Company following his retirement as CEO. The value of these benefits (US$19,372) was offset 
against his end of service gratuity received under UAE law, so there was no cost to the Company from providing these benefits and they have not been included

Annual Bonus for 2014
For 2014 the annual bonus opportunity was 150% of base compensation, pro-rated to reflect period of service. The annual bonus was 
assessed against financial and operational objectives, including measures of clinical excellence, to provide a rounded assessment of 
the Group and individual’s performance.
The measures, weightings, performance and outturn are set out below:
Measure Weighting Performance against measure
Payout of

Delivery of strategy 10% Measures relating to opening of clinics, lab consolidation and assessment 
of clinical quality achieved in full or in part
50.0% 5.0%
Total 100% 11.8%
Consequently, the annual bonus achieved was 11.8% of maximum. For Ronald Lavater, the amount awarded (17.7% of salary, i.e. 11.8% 
of his 150% of salary maximum bonus) has been pro-rated to reflect his three months of service during 2014. He will therefore be paid 
a bonus of US$33,187, equivalent to 4.425% of salary.
For Ronald Lavater, 50% of the bonus payable will be paid in cash and 50% in shares. Clawback provisions will apply to both the cash 
and share elements.
Under the terms of his contract agreed at IPO, Dr. Kassem Alom was not eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan for 2014.

Directors’ Interests in Ordinary Shares
Through participation in performance-linked share-based plans, there is strong encouragement for Executive Directors to build and 
maintain a significant shareholding in the business.
The Committee has adopted a formal policy requiring any Executive Director to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to 200% of base compensation. Until this threshold is achieved they are required to retain no less than 50% of the net of tax 
value of any share award that vests. Ronald Lavater was appointed with effect from 1 October 2014. He will build and maintain a 
shareholding in line with the Committee’s formal policy. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares in 
the Company but are not subject to a formal shareholding guideline. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 74

Directors Pension Entitlement
The Company does not operate a pension scheme and 
accordingly no element of remuneration is pensionable.
Payments to Former Directors
Dr. Kassem Alom stepped down as CEO on 1 October 2014. He 
received remuneration as set out above for his period of service 
for 2014 and received no payments in addition to this in respect of 
his leaving office. He was not eligible to participate in the 
executive bonus scheme for 2014. Dr. Kassem Alom continued to 
receive certain benefits (primarily medical insurance and car 
benefits) from the Company following his retirement as CEO. The 
value of these benefits (US$19,372) was offset against his end of 
service gratuity received under UAE law, so there was no cost to 
the Company from providing these benefits.
Dr. Kassem Alom was subsequently appointed Deputy Chairman 
on 1 October 2014, with fees this position set at £90,000 per 
annum. He received a fee of £22,500 for the period worked in 
2014, as shown in the historic remuneration table on page 72.

No payments were made in respect of loss of office during the

The interests of the Directors of the Company at the 31 December 2014, in the issued shares of the Company disclosed in accordance with the 
FCA’s Listing Rules are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 73 and 74. The Remuneration Report also sets out details of any changes in 
those interests between the year end and 29 March 2015.
Powers of Directors
Our Directors’ powers are determined by UK legislation and our Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’). The Articles may be amended by a special 
resolution of the members. The Directors may exercise all of the Company’s powers provided that the Articles or applicable legislation do not 
stipulate that any such powers must be exercised by the members.
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
The rules about the appointment and replacement of Directors are contained in our Articles. They provide that Directors may be appointed by 
ordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Directors. Directors must retire and put themselves forward for election at their first 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) following their appointment.
Directors wishing to continue to serve as members of the Board, will seek re-election annually in accordance with provision 8.7 .1 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code Members may remove a Director by passing an ordinary resolution of which special notice has been given, in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Indemnification of Directors
The indemnification for Directors provided by the Company has been arranged in accordance with the Company’s Articles and the Companies 
Act 2006. As far as is permitted by legislation, all Officers of the Company are indemnified out of the Company’s own funds against any liability 
incurred while conducting their role in the Company; other than any liability to the Company or an associated company.
Compensation for Loss of Office
There are no agreements in place with any Director that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, 
except that provisions of the Company’s share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover.
Share Incentive Schemes
All of the Company’s share-based employee incentive plans detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 75 contain provisions 
relating to a change of control of the Company. Vesting of outstanding awards and options on a change of control would normally be at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, who would take into account the satisfaction of any applicable performance conditions 
at that time and the expired duration of the relevant performance period. Strategic Report

Principal Shareholders and Relationship Agreement
In accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4 (14), the Company has set out below a statement describing the relationship agreement entered into by the 
Company with its principal shareholders.
As at 29 March 2015, Astro II SPV, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Butti Al Hamed and Dr. Kassem Alom (the ‘Principal Shareholders’) hold 20%, 
28.25% and 6.04% respectively, of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
The Company originally entered into a relationship agreement dated 21 June 2013 (the ‘Original Relationship Agreement’) with 
Sheikh Mohammed Bin Butti Al Hamed, Astro II SPV and Dr. Kassem Alom (together the ‘Principal Shareholders’), Ithmar Capital and Ithmar 
Capital-Astro (together ‘Ithmar’). The Original Relationship Agreement was amended and restated on 13 November 2014 (the ‘Amended and 
Restated Relationship Agreement’) in order to comply with the changes to the Listing Rules relating to controlling shareholders implemented by 
the UKLA on 16 May 2014. A ‘controlling shareholder’ is any person who exercises, or controls on its own or together with any person(s) with 
whom it is acting in concert, 30%. or more of the votes able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general meetings of the Company. 
Prior to the parties entering into the Original Relationship Agreement, the Takeover Panel at the time determined that the Principal Shareholders 
and Ithmar were deemed to be acting in concert for the purposes of the Takeover Code.
The Original Relationship Agreement, or with effect from 13 November 2014, the Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement governs the 
relationship between the Principal Shareholders, Ithmar and the Company and the principal purpose of which is to ensure that the Company is 
capable of carrying out its business independently of the Principal Shareholders, Ithmar and their respective associates and that transactions 
and arrangements with the Principal Shareholders, Ithmar and their respective associates are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms 
(subject to the rules on related party transactions in the Listing Rules).
Under the Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement, each Principal Shareholder and Ithmar undertakes to comply with the following 
‘independence provisions’ set out in the agreement as required under the Listing Rules:
• transactions and arrangements between the Company and itself (and/or its associates) are, and will be, at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms;
• neither it nor any of its associates will take any action that would have the effect of preventing the Company from complying with its 
obligations under the Listing Rules; and
• neither it nor any of its associates will propose, or procure the proposal of, a shareholder resolution that is intended or appears to 
be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
The Company has and, in so far as it is aware, the Principal Shareholders, Ithmar and their respective associates have, complied with the 
independence provisions set out in the Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement from the date of the agreement, during the relevant 
period under review.
In accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement for every 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company (or an interest which carries 10% or more of the aggregate voting rights in the Company from time to time) held by a Principal 
Shareholder Group, the relevant Principal Shareholder shall be entitled to appoint one Director to the Board, up to a maximum of two Directors.
If a Principal Shareholder or lthmar ceases to hold 10% of the Company’s share capital (or 10% of the aggregate voting rights in the Company), 
the rights and obligations of that Principal Shareholder and any member of its Principal Shareholder Group under the Amended and Restated 
Relationship Agreement shall terminate. If there ceases to be any Principal Shareholder holding 10% of the Company’s share capital (or 10% of 
the aggregate voting rights in the Company) the Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement shall terminate. The ordinary shares owned by 
the Principal Shareholders rank pari passu with the other ordinary shares in all respects.
Risk Regarding the Use of Financial Instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies are disclosed in Note 27 to the financial statements on pages 104 to 106.
Post-balance Sheet Events
There have been no other material events since the year end.
Dividend
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 9 pence per ordinary share to be paid on 15 May 2015 to all ordinary shareholders 
who were on the register of members at the close of business on 17 April. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 80

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts, including the consolidated financial statements 
and the Company financial statements, the Directors’ Report, 
including the Remuneration Report and the Strategic Review, in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. Under that law 
the Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company on a consolidated and individual basis and 
of the profit or loss of the Company on a consolidated basis for 
that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is not appropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the Company’s financial position and enable them to ensure 
compliance with the Companies Act 2006; they are also 
responsible for safeguarding the Company’s assets and for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 48 and 51 confirms that:
• to the best of their knowledge, the consolidated financial 
statements and the Company financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB 
and IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Company on a consolidated and individual basis;
• to the best of their knowledge, the Annual Report and 
Accounts includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
on a consolidated and individual basis, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it 
faces; and
• they consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Opinions and Conclusions Arising from Our Audit
1 Our Opinion on the Financial Statements is Unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 set out on pages 84 to 
117. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our Assessment of Risks of Material Misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risk of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit was as follows:
Recognition of Revenue
Refer to pages 59 to 61 (Audit committee report), page 91 (accounting policy) and page 100 (financial disclosures)
• The risk: Revenue is stated net of potential estimated insurance claims considered likely to be rejected from, inter alia, disputes with 
insurers over the medical necessity of services provided and administrative errors in claims processing. The group estimates these 
claim rejections based on historical trends, its experience in dealing with insurance companies and the current economic 
environment. A small change in the Group’s estimate of the rejection rate could have a material impact on the income statement.
• Our response: Our audit procedures in this area included:
 – Assessing the Group’s forecasting of rejection rates through a comparison of historical actual claims settled to the original 
gross claims on a sample basis. Such past experience gives a proxy rejection rate to be applied to current revenues enabling 
a comparison with the revenue recognised in the income statement. We use our understanding of current insurance practice 
and our review of historical trends in claim rejections to assess the appropriateness of using prior experience as a basis 
for forecasting;
 – Obtaining reconciliations of insurance claims agreed between the Group and its insurance companies and assessing whether 
the latest positions were used by the Group in forming the rejection rate estimate;
 – Testing the accuracy and completeness of underlying data to assess whether there was appropriate capture of gross revenue. 
We tested IT system based controls and processes over the completeness of the daily transfer of data from the Group’s health 
information system (‘HIS’) where patient information is stored to the Group’s enterprise resource planning module (‘ERP’) and 
then to SAP where the general ledger is maintained. We also test the Group’s monthly reconciliation controls between HIS and 
ERP and between ERP and eClaims, which is the system where insurance claims are submitted for reimbursement; and
 – Considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the degree in estimation involved in the recognition of 
revenue.
3 Our Application of Materiality and an Overview of the Scope of Our Audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at $4m, determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit 
before tax, normalised to exclude acquisition related costs as disclosed in note 18, of which it represents 4.7%.
We report to the audit committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding $0.2m, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group audit team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was 
performed using the materiality level set out above and covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax, and total Group 
assets.
4 Our Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is Unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.

they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides

• the Audit and Risk Committee section of the Corporate Governance Report does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
• Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement, set out on pages 34 and 81, in relation to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 54 to 63 relating to the company’s compliance with the ten provisions of 
the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and Responsibilities

Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows
For the year ended 31 December Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Financial Statements
88
1 Status and Activity
Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc (the ‘Company’ or ‘Parent’) is a 
Company which was incorporated in England and Wales on 
20 December 2012. The Company is a public limited liability 
company operating mainly in the United Arab Emirates (‘UAE’). 
The address of the registered office of the Company is 
C/O Capita Company Secretarial Services, 1st Floor, 40 Dukes 
Place, London, EC3A 7NH. The registered number of the 
Company is 8338604.
The activities of the subsidiaries are the operation of medical 
hospitals and clinics and the sale of pharmaceuticals, medical 
supplies and related equipment. These consolidated financial 
statements include the financial performance and position of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the 
‘Group’) (refer note 3(a)).
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board 
of Directors on 29 March 2015 and the consolidated statement of 
financial position was signed on the Board’s behalf by the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income 
statement as a part of these consolidated financial statements.
2 Basis of Preparation
The financial information presented for the comparative year 
ended 31 December 2013 essentially represents the financial 
performance and position of the same continuing business albeit 
that the Parent Company of the Group changed in 2013 as a 
result of group reorganisations.
On 14 June 2013, as a necessary step to its Initial Public Offering 
on 21 June 2013, the Company (i.e. Al Noor Hospitals Group plc), 
issued 100 shares to the shareholders of the previous Parent 
Company of the Group, Al Noor Holdings Cayman Limited 
(‘ANHC’), in exchange for 100% of the issued shares of ANHC. 
The effect of this was to add a new parent company on top of 
the existing group – this being the only change – prior to its 
flotation and gave rise to reverse acquisition accounting by the 
new parent company. In considering the requirements of IFRS 3, 
consideration was given as to whether this was a business 
combination. The conclusion reached by the Directors was that 
this was not a business combination by the new parent company 
merely the addition of a new holding company to a continuing 
business, i.e., a group reorganisation.
The impact, for accounting purposes, of the transaction on 
14 June 2013 was to present the Company as if it had always 
been the Parent Company of the Group with the consequent 
continuation of the book values and history previously reported 
by ANHC, save for alteration of the equity section of the prior 
year’s statement of consolidated financial position to reflect that 
of the new Parent Company.
(a) Statement of Compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (adopted IFRS) and the 
Companies Act 2006.
(b) Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
the going concern basis. At 31 December 2014, the Group had 
net assets amounting to US$238.2m (2013: US$180.7m), 
principally as a result of the proceeds from the Initial Public 
Offering on 21 June 2013 and net profit for the period ended 
31 December 2014. The group is profitable, cash generative and 
has access to an undrawn committed borrowing facility of up to 
US$81.7m. Having considered the Group’s cash forecast for a 
period of 12 months from the date of signing the consolidated 
statement of financial position, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to meet its 
liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of these consolidated financial statements. Thus, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial information.
(c) Basis of Measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except where adopted IFRS mandates that 
fair value accounting is required.
(d) Functional and Presentation Currency
The consolidated financial statements and financial information 
are presented in United States Dollar (US$), rounded to the 
nearest thousand. The functional currency of the majority of the 
Group’s entities is the United Arab Emirates Dirham (‘AED’) and is 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. The United Arab Emirates Dirham (‘AED’) is 
currently pegged against the United States Dollar (US$) at a rate 
of 3.67 per US Dollar.
(e) Use of Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future 
periods affected.
Information about judgements, estimates and assumptions in 
applying the Group’s accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements is included in the following notes:
• Note 5 – Intangible assets and goodwill
• Note 14 – Employee benefits
• Note 16 – Revenue
(f) Measurement of Fair Value
Fair values in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired 
through business combination are determined for measurement 
based on the following methods.
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
89 Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group 
uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair value is 
categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on 
the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level I that 
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
price) or directly (i.e. derived from price)
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs)
Plant and Equipment
The fair value of items of plant and equipment is based on the 
market approach and cost approaches using quoted market 
prices for similar items when available and replacement cost 
when appropriate.
Inventories
The fair value of inventories is determined based on the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated 
costs of sale.
Trade and Other Receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the 
present value of future cash flows, discounted, if material, at the 
market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Financial Liabilities
The fair value is calculated based on the present value of future 
principal and interest cash flows, discounted, if material, at the 
market rate of interest at the reporting date.
(g) Non-Underlying Items in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income
Items that are unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as 
non-underlying items in the income statement. In addition, where 
the Directors are of the opinion that separate presentation of an 
item or items provides helpful information about the Group’s 
underlying business performance, such amounts are included in 
the non-underlying category with full disclosure of their nature. 
Non-underlying items include the following items:
• Acquisition related costs (refer note 29)
• Finance charges (refer note 20)
• First time registration fees in London Stock Exchange 
(refer note 18)
3 Significant Accounting Policies
Except for the changes below, the accounting policies set out 
below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standards, including 
any inconsequential amendments to other standards, with a date 
of initial application of 1 January 2014.
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
None of these new standards had an impact on these 
consolidated financial statements.
(a) Basis of Consolidation
(i) Business Combination
The Group accounts for business combinations using the 
acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group 
(see (a) (iii)). The consideration transferred in the acquisition is 
measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment 
(see 3(d)). Any given bargain purchase is recognised in the profit 
and loss account immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as 
incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. 
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related 
to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in the profit and loss account.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value 
at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is 
reclassified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is 
accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in the 
profit and loss account.
In addition, if the contingent consideration is dependent on the 
former owners of the acquired company remaining in 
employment, the payment will be treated as a post-acquisition 
employment expense rather than as part of the consideration for 
the business combination.
(ii) Non-Controlling Interests (‘NCI’)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result 
in a loss of power to control are accounted for as equity 
transactions.
(iii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities where the Group has the power to 
exercise control. Control is achieved where the Group has power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date on which control commences until the date on 
which control ceases.
(iv) Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised income and expense 
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014

3 Significant Accounting Policies continued
(b) Property and Equipment
(i) Recognition and Measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (if any). In the 
context of property and equipment acquired as part of an 
acquisition of a business, cost will be the fair value of the property 
and equipment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset and includes any other costs directly 
attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its 
intended use. Purchased software that is integral to the 
functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that 
equipment. When parts of an item of property and equipment 
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property and equipment. The gain or 
loss arising on the disposal of an item of property and equipment 
is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the 
carrying amount with the difference being recognised in the profit 
and loss account.
(ii) Subsequent Costs
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the 
component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured 
reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is 
derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property 
and equipment are recognised in the profit and loss account 
as incurred.
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual 
value. Depreciation is recognised in the profit and loss account on 
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of 
each component of an item of property and equipment. 
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain 
that the lease will be renewed on expiry. Assets classified as 
capital work in progress are not subject to depreciation. The 
estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are 
as follows:
Leasehold improvements 4 years
Medical equipment and tools 4–11 years
Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 4 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
methods are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted 
if appropriate.
(c) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value and comprise pharmaceutical and medical supplies. Cost is 
calculated using the weighted average method and includes all 
costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business less estimated selling and distribution expenses.
(d) Impairment
Non-Financial Assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax 
assets) to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually 
for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped into the smallest 
group of assets that generates cash flows from continuing use 
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or 
Cash Generating Units (‘CGUs’). Goodwill arising from business 
combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its 
value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. Value in use is 
based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessment of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying value of an asset 
or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses are allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGU, 
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in 
the CGU.
(e) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows that 
reflect current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability.

Financial Statements

(f) Employee Benefits
(i) Defined Benefit Plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit other than a 
defined contribution plan. The Group currently operates an 
unfunded scheme for employees’ end of service benefits that 
follows relevant local regulations and is based on periods of 
cumulative service and levels of employees’ final basic salaries. 
The Group’s obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is 
calculated by estimating the amount of future benefits that 
employees have earned in return for their service in the current 
and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value. Such benefits are based on the applicable 
provisions of the UAE Labour Law. The discount rate is the yield 
at valuation date, on US AA-rated corporate bonds, which in the 
absence of a deep market in corporate bonds within the UAE is 
the relevant proxy market as determined by the actuaries.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using 
the projected unit credit method. When benefits of the plan are 
improved, the portion of the increased benefit related to past 
service by employees is recognised in the profit and loss account 
at the earlier of when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs 
or when the Group recognizes related restructuring costs or 
termination benefits. To the extent that the benefits vest 
immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss account. The Group recognises all re-measurements 
from defined benefit plans immediately in the other 
comprehensive income and all administrative expenses related to 
defined benefit plans within the profit and loss account. Gains 
and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit 
plan are recognised when the curtailment or settlement occurs.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is 
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past 
service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized 
immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognises gains and 
losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the 
settlement occurs.
Monthly pension contributions are made in respect of UAE 
national employees, who are covered by the Law No. 2 of 2000. 
The pension fund is administered by the Government of Abu 
Dhabi – Finance Department, represented by the Abu Dhabi 
Retirement Pensions and Benefits Fund.
(ii) Short-term Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be 
paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this 
amount as a result of a past service provided by the employee, 
and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
(iii) Share-based Payments Transactions
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment 
awards granted to employees is generally recognised as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting 
period of the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related 
service and non-market performance conditions are expected to 
be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on 
the number of awards that meet the related service and non-
market performance conditions at the vesting date. For 
share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the 
grant-date fair value of the share–based payment is measured to 
reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences 
between expected and actual outcomes.
(g) Revenue Recognition
Revenue represents the invoiced value of medical services 
rendered and pharmaceutical goods sold during the year, and is 
stated net of discounts.
Rendering of Services
Revenue from the provision of medical services to in-patients and 
out-patients is recognised in the profit and loss account in 
proportion to the stage of completion of the medical service at 
the reporting date. As a result of the majority of patients having 
medical insurance cover, the Group’s revenue is largely derived 
from insurers and therefore is stated net of potential estimated 
insurance claims likely to be rejected. The Group estimates 
potential insurance claim rejections based on historical trends 
and treats this as a discount which is recognised as a reduction 
of service revenue.
Sale of Goods
Revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical goods in the course of 
ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable, net of returns and trade 
discounts. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, 
recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs 
and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no 
continuing management involvement with the goods and the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
(h) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets including software that is acquired by the 
Group having finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. Software is amortised on a straight-line basis in the profit 
and loss account over its estimated useful life from the date that it 
is available for use. Assets classified as software under 
development are not subject to depreciation. The estimated 
useful life of software is four years.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the 
future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which 
it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally 
generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in the profit and 
loss account as incurred. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014

3 Significant Accounting Policies continued
(i) Segment Reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses. Segments are disclosed based on the components of the entity that management monitors in making decisions about 
operating segments (the ‘management approach’). Such components are identified on the basis of internal reports that the entity’s 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) reviews regularly. All operating segments’ results are reviewed by the Group’s CODM to 
make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance, for which discrete financial information 
is available.
(j) Earnings per Share
The Group presents basic earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the 
profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the year.
The Group calculates diluted earnings per share by increasing the average number of shares by reference to the average number of 
potential ordinary shares held under option during the period. This reflects the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased 
using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price. The market value of 
shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period. Only share options which have met their 
cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.
(k) Lease Payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease.
(l) New Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Adopted
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2014 have not 
been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on these 
consolidated financial statements of the Group, except for the following which could change the classification and measurement of the 
financial assets. The full extent of the impact has not yet been determined.
• IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” (expected effective date of 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contract with Customers” (expected effective date of 1 January 2017)

Goodwill
a. In February 2013, the Group acquired a clinic, Al Noor Hospital Family Care Centre – Al Mamura LLC, formerly known as Solutions 
Medical Centre LLC located in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (refer note 29). There are no material separately identifiable tangible and 
intangible assets and therefore the majority of the purchase consideration is for goodwill, representing the location and future 
earning potential of the clinic.
b. In October 2013, the Group acquired 75% of the shares and voting interests in Al Madar Group LLC and Manchester Clinic LLC 
(refer note 29). There are no material separate tangible and intangible assets for Manchester Clinic LLC and therefore the majority of 
the purchase consideration is for goodwill, representing the location and future earning potential of the clinic.
c. On 10 February 2014, the Group acquired a clinic, Emirates American Company for Medical Services LLC (also known as Gulf 
International Cancer Centre/GICC) (refer note 29). The goodwill is attributable mainly to the synergies expected to be achieved from 
integrating the company into the Group’s existing business activities. The Company is the sole provider of cancer diagnostic 
services in the City of Abu Dhabi.
Impairment Testing for CGUs Containing Goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows:
US$’000
Al Madar Group LLC 5,985
Manchester Clinic LLC 4,884
Gulf International Cancer Centre/GICC 9,794
Multiple units without significant goodwill 1,383
22,046
Al Madar Group LLC and Gulf International Cancer Centre/GICC
During the year, Al Madar Group LLC and Gulf International Cancer Centre/GICC performed as expected and no indications of 
impairment of the goodwill have been identified at 31 December 2014.

Manchester Clinic LLC
The recoverable amount of this CGU was based on its value in use determined by discounting the future cash flows to be generated 
from the continuing use of the CGU.
The estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceed its carrying amount by US$563,000.
Key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount are set out below. The discount rate was estimated based on the 
historical industry average weighted-average cost of capital.
Discount rate 14.2%
Terminal value growth 2.0%
The cash flow projections included estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter. The terminal growth rate was 
determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumptions 
that a market participant might make.

15 Equity-Settled Share-Based Payment Arrangements
On 26 June 2013, the Group established an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement under the Company’s Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) that entitles selected key management personnel to be awarded with shares of the Company. No consideration 
was paid for granting of the awards, which are structured as conditional awards as explained below.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches: one tranche is subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions set by the 
Remuneration Committee of the Group, measured over a performance period of three financial years ending 31 December 2015; the 
second tranche will vest on 31 December 2016 provided the participant remains employed by the Group on that date.
The fair value of the above arrangement has been measured based on the quoted share price of the Company available on the London 
Stock Exchange at grant date of the above awards. As at 31 December 2014, other than forfeited shares numbering 83,011, it is 
assumed that all other shareholders under the above arrangement will satisfy all the performance conditions set by Remuneration 
Committee of the Company.
Furthermore, the Board approved a share award to senior management in relation to the IPO. No consideration was paid for granting of 
the awards, which are structured as non-conditional awards and granted as at the date of the IPO. The fair value of this arrangement has 
been measured based on the quoted share price of the Company available on the London Stock Exchange at grant date of the awards.

based payment expense (refer to note 15).
Transaction costs arising on the issue of equity instruments do not include indirect costs, such as the costs of management time and 
administrative overheads, or allocation of internal costs that would have been incurred had the shares not been issued. Transaction 
costs of the Initial Public Offer (‘IPO’) that are directly attributable to the issue of new shares are accounted for as a deduction from 
share premium. Costs relating to the issue of existing shares are expensed in the profit and loss account.
Judgment has been used to determine whether transaction costs are directly attributable or not. Allocation of costs between 
previously issued shares and new shares is made proportionately based on the relevant number of shares.
22 Taxation
The Group operates solely in the United Arab Emirates and Sultanate of Oman. There is no corporate or other tax in the United Arab 
Emirates (‘UAE’) and therefore the Group has no tax liability arising in the UAE.
In the Sultanate of Oman, the Group’s operations have reported a loss for the year ended 31 December 2014 and accordingly a 
deferred tax asset amounting to US$269,000 (2013: US$134,000) has been recognised.
The Group’s Parent Company is registered in the UK and has recorded a loss for the year ended 31 December 2014. No deferred tax 
asset has been accounted for as recovery of this loss against future UK taxable profit is uncertain.

The Group defends various legal claims raised against it in the normal course of business. Where it considers that it is probable that it 
will settle a claim, management estimate the likely amount of settlement and provide accordingly. Claims that are considered remote or 
only possible represent contingent liabilities of the Group. If the Group’s defence against these contingent liabilities is not successful, 
the Group may ultimately become liable for settlement. The Group’s Medical Malpractice Insurance Policy covers all settlements made 
by the Group subject to insurance deductibles and the overall coverage provided by the policy. The Board of Directors and 
Management do not expect actions arising from the claims currently classified as contingent liabilities to have a material effect on the 
Group’s future financial position.

224,131 220,970
The Group leases a number of premises under operating leases from a shareholder of the Group (refer note 7(d)). The leases are for an 
initial period of 25 years with an option for the Group to renew the lease after that date at a market rate. The leases are cancellable only 
at the option of the Group, during the initial period of 25 years, with one year’s written notice, unless the Ministry of Health (or similar 
body) cancels the Group’s trade licences or otherwise prevents the Group from operating in the premises, in which case the leases 
could be immediately cancelled. Although the non-cancellable element is only one year, the remaining period of the initial 25 year 
profile is disclosed because the Group considers it is currently unlikely the leases will be cancelled. The lease rentals are subject to 
an increase of 5% per annum on a compound basis after 20 years. The terms of the Group’s material leases which were effective from 
1 January 2012, are as follows.

27 Financial Instruments
(a) Capital Management
The Board’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for stakeholders. In recent years, the Group has been strongly cash generative and this has 
allowed the Board to declare dividend payments in each of the last three years. The Company raised US$150m from Premium Listing 
on the London Stock Exchange in 2013. Accordingly, the capital base increased by the same amount.
The Board’s policy is to develop and maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor and creditor confidence and to sustain 
the future development of the business. The Board believes that the Group can sustain an amount of debt so as to be financially 
efficient and regularly reviews its optimal target gearing ratio. In the event that the Group wishes to undertake any significant expansion 
requiring the raising of new capital, the Board will carefully consider what the appropriate ratio of debt to equity should be.
Retained earnings, cash reserves and bank facilities available to the Group are used within the business and are considered to be the 
capital of the Group.
(b) Financial Risk Management Objectives
The Group is exposed to the following risks related to financial instruments-credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest 
rate risk. During the current year, the Group did not enter into or trade in any new financial instruments, investments in securities, 
including derivative financial instruments, for speculative or risk management purposes.

Financial Statements

105 Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
(c) Credit Risk
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
reporting date was:
Note
2014
US$’000
2013
US$’000
Trade and other receivables 8 108,108 80,880
Bank balances 9 82,550 107,517
Amounts due from related parties 7(c) 851 1,219
Short-term deposit 10 13,624 –
205,133 189,616
Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group, and 
arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables and bank balances. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with 
creditworthy counterparties; significant revenue is generated by dealing with high profile customers for whom the credit risk is 
assessed to be low. The Group attempts to control credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with specific 
non-related counterparties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of such non-related counterparties. Balances with banks 
are assessed to have a low credit risk of default since these banks are highly regulated by the central bank of the United Arab Emirates.
Concentration of credit risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same 
geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly 
affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentration of credit risk indicates the relative sensitivity of the 
Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic location. All balances with banks represent local 
and international commercial banks. The fixed deposits accounts are made in various local and international commercial banks. The 
amount that best represents maximum credit risk exposure on financial assets at the end of the reporting period, in the event 
counterparties fail to perform their obligations generally approximates their carrying value.
Majority of customers have been transacting with the Group for several years, are either sovereign owned, listed or private companies 
and have a good credit performance record with the company.
(d) Liquidity Risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Directors of the Group, who have built an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash 
flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its funding requirements. The table below summarises the maturity profile 
of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities. The contractual maturities of the financial liabilities have been determined on the basis 
of the remaining period at the end of reporting period to the contractual repayment date. The maturity profile is monitored by 
management to ensure adequate liquidity is maintained. The maturity profile of the liabilities at the end of reporting period based on 
existing contractual repayment arrangements was as follows:

(e) Foreign Currency Risk Management
The Group does not have any significant exposure to currency risk as most of its assets and liabilities are denominated in UAE Dirhams 
or in US$, the latter being currently pegged to the UAE Dirham at a fixed rate of exchange of 3.67 AED/US$. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Financial Statements
106
(f) Interest Rate Risk
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that at any time at least 50% of the debt exposure to changes in interest rate on borrowings of 
the Group is hedged, provided the total debt exceeds US$25m. The Group has not entered into any new hedge contract during the 
year ended 31 December 2014.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Management considers that the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts as stated in 
the consolidated financial statements except for the items specified separately.
As at 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group did not have any material financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured subsequent 
to initial recognition at fair value.
The fair value measurements of all of the Group’s assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value, or for which fair value is 
disclosed are categorised as level 3 fair values (i.e. not based on observable market data).
28 Operating Segments
The Group has the following major reportable segments, which are the Group’s strategic business units for which the Group’s CODM 
reviews internal management reports. The Group operates in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the Emirate of Dubai and the Sultanate of 
Oman and the following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:
Reportable segments Operations
Central region Operation of hospitals, clinics and pharmacies in Abu Dhabi. The hospitals cater to both in-patient 
and out-patient care.
Western and Eastern region Operation of hospitals, clinics and pharmacies in Abu Dhabi. The hospitals cater to both in-patient 
and out-patient care.
International Operation of clinic and pharmacies in the Sultanate of Oman. The clinic caters to out-patient care.
Northern Emirates Operation of clinic and physiotherapy in Dubai. The clinic caters to out-patient care.
Performance is measured based on segment profit as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s 
CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is most relevant in evaluating 
the results of each segment.
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used 
for more than one year. As a result of the Group’s liabilities not being directly reviewed by the Group’s CODM, segment liabilities have 
not been disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

included in ‘Administrative expenses’ under non-underlying.
During the year 2014, the Group has finalised the accounting records of four branches namely Dubai, Ajman, Abu Dhabi and Al Maqam 
which were acquired on 31 October 2013 as part of acquisition of Al Madar Group LLC. As a result of this, the statement of financial 
position as at 31 December 2013 was restated with the identifiable assets and liabilities as shown below.
As there is no additional consideration payable, recording these net assets as at 31 December 2013, results in a reduction of the 
original goodwill figure from US$7,526,000 to US$5,985,000 as at 31 December 2013.

statements are available at the registered office of Al Noor 
Hospitals Group Plc C/O Capita Company Secretarial Services,

32.5 Basis of Preparation
(a) Statement of Compliance
The comparative information include activities for the period from 
20 December 2012 to 31 December 2013 (‘the period’). No profit 
and loss account is prepared by the Company as permitted by 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
(b) Basis of Measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis.
(c) Functional and Presentation Currency
The consolidated financial statements and financial information 
are presented in United States Dollar (US$), rounded to the 
nearest thousand. The functional currency of the majority of the 
Group’s entities is the United Arab Emirates Dirham (‘AED’) and is 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. The United Arab Emirates Dirham (‘AED’) is

32.6 Significant Accounting Policies
Except for the changes below, the accounting policies set out 
below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these financial statements.
The Company has adopted the following new standards, including 
any inconsequential amendments to other standards, with a date 
of initial application of 1 January 2014.
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
None of these new standards had an impact on these financial 
statements.
(a) Financial Assets
The Company’s financial assets comprise amount due from a 
related party and bank balance.
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it 
transfers the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the asset to another entity.
(b) Financial Liabilities
The Company’s financial liabilities comprise of other payables. 
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial 
liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement. The Company has no compound 
financial instruments.
(i) Equity Instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company comprise 
ordinary shares and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs.
(ii) Debt Instruments
Other payables are classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and are 
initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective 
yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of 
allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period. The Company 
derecognises financial liabilities when its contractual obligations 
are discharged, cancelled or expire.
(c) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can 
be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
(d) Finance Income
Finance income comprises foreign currency exchange 
differences.
(e) Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised 
as a deduction from equity.
(f) New Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Adopted
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations 
that are not yet effective for the period ended 31 December 2014 
have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. 
None of these is expected to have a significant effect on these 
financial statements of the Company, except for IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
instruments’, which could change the classification and 
measurement of the financial assets. The extent of the impact has 
not yet been determined.

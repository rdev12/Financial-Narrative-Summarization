OUR bUSINESS
■ Local knowledge, international sales  ■ Focus on emerging markets
What we do
ITE is an organiser of business 
to business (B2B) exhibitions and 
conferences specialising in emerging 
and developing markets. ITE 
organises high‑quality events of an 
international standard throughout 
the 17 countries in which it operates. 
As an exhibition organiser, ITE hires 
venues at which it stages its events 
and markets the events to both 
exhibitors and visitors. Exhibitions 
and conferences provide an 
opportunity for participants 
from national and international 
companies to meet, network 
and transact business. 
ITE’s principal business of organising 
B2B trade exhibitions accounts for 
97% of the Group’s revenues. 
Conferences account for circa 2% 
of the Group’s revenues and other 
activities relating to the core 
exhibition business (mostly 
publishing) account for 1% of revenue. 
Why we do it
The exhibition media is the best 
media for suppliers to display and 
demonstrate their products to 
potential buyers. This is particularly 
powerful in emerging and developing 
markets where face to face meetings 
are the cultural norm and where 
alternative media, B2B publishing 
and on‑line marketing opportunities 
are less developed.
How we do it
ITE’s strength derives from its focus 
on organising B2B exhibitions and 
conferences, the development of 
strong brands in key industry sectors 
and the regional expertise in the 
markets in which it operates. ITE has 
been operating in these markets for 
over 20 years and its experience 
and local knowledge are unique.
ITE’s sector brands are a key asset. 
The brands have been established 
through a sustained record of 
delivering high quality events which 
meet customer expectations. ITE’s 
events serve key industries including 
construction & interiors, oil & gas, 
food & drink, travel & leisure, motor 
& transport, fashion, medical & 
healthcare and IT & telecoms. 
ITE has an extensive office network, 
covering both the territories where 
our events are held and international 
sales offices in other countries. ITE 
is able to operate at a national level 
where local staff are close to local 
industry trends and at an 
international level where our sales 
teams are in regular communication 
with key industry suppliers in our 
sectors. The Group has 30 offices 
across the world, each of them 
employing almost exclusively 
local staff.
The offices of the Group co‑operate 
in a unique way. Each office sells its 
own exhibitions, but participates with 
equal levels of commitment in the 
exhibitions organised by other offices. 
This holistic approach has been 
carefully cultivated through the years 
and enables ITE’s business to follow 
long‑established trading patterns.

OUR bUSINESS IN A GLObAL CONTExT
The global exhibition market was 
estimated to be worth circa $27 billion 
in 2012 (the last year for which data 
is available), a 5% increase on 2011. 
The table to the right sets out the 
distribution of the world’s exhibition 
business and shows that developed 
markets continue to account for the 
majority of the global market. However, 
emerging markets have increased their 
share of the global market and now 
account for over one third of the total. 
Russia, Turkey and the CIS countries 
– ITE’s core market area – account for 
approximately 6% of the global market, 
whilst Asian markets (China, India and 
South East Asia) account for 
approximately 10%.
The graph to the right illustrates that 
emerging markets grew more quickly 
than developed markets during 2012, 
a trend which is expected to continue. 
Future growth prospects are indicated 
by the share that an exhibitions market 
has of GDP. On this basis, India and 
China have the most substantial growth 
potential amongst exhibition markets 
worth $200 million or more. Projected 
growth, set out in the bottom right 
chart, is expected to be led by both 
price increases, on the back of 
increased international participation, 
and increases in metreage, as new 
venue capacity comes on stream. 
ITE is the sixth largest organiser in the 
world by revenue, and the third largest 
in emerging markets. ITE remains the 
largest exhibition organiser in Russia 
with an estimated market share of 22%. 
Strong prices and an internationalised 
outlook mean that Russia continues to 
be an attractive market. ITE’s position 
in Central Asian markets is even 
stronger, where it is the dominant 
international exhibition organiser. The 
market in Turkey is more fragmented 
but ITE retains its position as the 
leading international exhibition 
organiser, with 7% of the market.
With its core markets expected to 
continue to grow, a key part of ITE’s 
strategy is to ensure it retains and 
builds upon its leading positions in 
these markets. In addition, ITE aims to 
apply its free cash flow to expanding its 
business model to new markets where 
there is good potential for growth. 
Recent investments in India, South East 
Asia and China are all designed to 
enable ITE to participate in the strong 
growth expected in these regions. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Strategic report
OUR STRATEGy
ITE’s objective is to create sustainable growth 
in headline earnings per share through a strategy 
of creating and maintaining sustainable positions 
of market leadership in the exhibition business 
in developing markets.
Strategic priorities Achievements

build
build and strengthen on existing 
market leadership
ITE’s existing positions of market leadership are founded 
on its ability to generate international sales, its recognised 
brands, its local office infrastructure and its longstanding 
relationships with venues. ITE targets new sectors and 
regions within its existing markets where there is potential 
to increase the participation of international exhibitors.
ITE has continued to invest in its international sales presence in the year. In 2013 the total net metres sold by the Group’s 
international offices increased by 15% to 133,000m
2
, representing circa 25% of the Group’s revenues. 
In its core markets ITE has supported the development of venue facilities which in turn has helped the Group’s exhibitions 
to prosper. Many of ITE’s major events have agreements which provide for venue facilities for at least three years ahead. 
This year ITE has agreed to support the development of a new venue in Krasnodar, where ITE will have exclusive rights 
to run exhibitions.
02  
Expand
Leverage our business model into 
new markets and geographies
In existing markets this strategy means targeting new 
sectors or regions in which to acquire or develop businesses 
where there is potential for the participation of international 
exhibitors. In new markets, ITE is targeting the development 
of exhibition businesses where there is clear opportunity for 
strong future growth.
This year ITE has expanded its presence into India, South East Asia and China. This has allowed the Group to run its 
existing brands in new markets. The launch of Paperex Indonesia, Transasia in Singapore and Oil & Gas and Beauty 
in Myanmar are good examples of the opportunities created by access to new marketplaces.
New acquisitions in the year have added 25,000m
2
 of space and over £2 million of profit. The Group’s acquisitions 
of Chinacoat and Beauty Eurasia after the year end will further enhance earnings in 2014.
03  
brand
Grow and develop our portfolio of 
international brands
ITE has established strong brand identity in certain 
exhibition sectors. ITE aims to ensure that new launches 
and acquisitions are aligned with existing brands in these 
sectors. ITE is also working to enhance and extend its 
existing brand identities, as well as developing brand 
identities in other sectors.
ITE has been working to improve the strength of its existing international brands and to improve international recognition 
of its local brands. As part of this, some industry vertical groupings have been established to ensure consistency of 
presentation and message across the Group.
ITE is also working to ensure that the new construction business in the Group, notably in Turkey and India, are aligned 
with ITE’s historic construction brand and that all the benefits available from sharing best practice are realised.

management
ITE is aware that its success is dependent on its people. 
As such, ITE is committed to investing in staff development 
throughout the Group and in particular, the management 
team that supports growing events and the continued 
expansion of the business.
We have made good progress in developing the strength and depth of the management team in the year as well as 
improving the communication between the different offices. We have continued to develop the Group intranet as well 
as opening up communication by functional management i.e. connecting staff lines across the different offices such as 
construction/marketing/IT. Our rolling programme of internal senior management and functional conferences has been 
a huge success as has the leadership development programme. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Group performance
ITE has continued to expand its 
business this year through a mixture 
of organic and acquisition led growth. 
The Group has now firmly established 
itself in the Asian exhibition markets 
through its investments in ABEC in 
India, Tradelink and ECMI in Malaysia 
and since the end of the financial year 
in Sinostar in China. Good organic 
growth across our core portfolios in 
Russia and the CIS together with a 
strong biennial performance from 
the Moscow International Oil and Gas 
Exhibition have combined with the 
newly acquired businesses in Asia to 
deliver record financial and operating 
results. In this, the stronger year of its 
biennial pattern, ITE’s revenues were 
£192.3 million (2012: £172.3 million) and 
have yielded headline profits before tax 
of £59.4 million (2012: £53.0 million) 
and headline diluted earnings per 
share of 19.3p (2012: 16.9p). Reported 
pre‑tax profit was £43.9 million 
(2012: £40.5 million) and fully diluted 
earnings per share was 14.0p (2012: 
12.8p). The Group finished the year 
with net cash of £23.5 million (2012: 
£13.0 million), after investing £26.1 
million on acquisitions during the year. 
board and management
Michael Hartley has served ITE as a 
Non‑executive Director since October 
2003. He has been Chairman of 
both the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees during his tenure and 
has made a significant contribution 
to ITE’s Board over the last ten years. 
In line with corporate governance 
best practice Mike is standing down 
at the next AGM of the Company. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to express our appreciation for his 
focus and dedication to the Group. 
Stephen Puckett joined ITE’s Board as 
a Non‑executive Director on 1 July 2013 
and will succeed Mike as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. Stephen 
brings a wealth of relevant experience 
in emerging markets gained in his 
previous role as Chief Financial Officer 
of Michael Page International PLC. The 
Board has taken positive steps this 
year to strengthen itself and the way 
in which the Non‑executives interface 
with the Executives. Following an 
external review of Board effectiveness, 
we are adopting a number of initiatives 
in line with the recommendations 
of the review. Notably we intend to 
appoint an additional Non‑executive 
Director and establish a separate 
sub‑committee of the Board to review 
risk and the Group’s mitigation of risk. 
ITE continues to prosper because 
of the efforts and loyalty of its staff 
worldwide. The Group now has 
30 operating offices in 17 different 
countries with a broad range of 
cultural backgrounds, all co‑operating 
with each other and participating 
in helping to grow ITE. Almost 50% 
of our staff have been employees 
of ITE for more than five years, and 
60% are participants in one of our 
equity schemes. I am proud to be 
Chairman of a Group with such a 
dedicated employee base, and I, 
on behalf of the Board, would like 
to thank and acknowledge the 
contribution of ITE’s management 
and employees to this year’s result. 
ITE’s Board recognises that good 
corporate governance is in the 
long‑term interests of the Group 
and we are conscious of our 
responsibilities for setting values 
which underpin the Group culture. As 
Chairman, I am mindful of my personal 
responsibility for leading the Board 
and ensuring it operates effectively. 
Dividend
ITE’s growth has supported a 
consistent increase in annual dividends. 
This year the interim dividend was 
increased from 2.1p to 2.3p and 
the proposed final dividend is 4.7p, 
making a full dividend for the year of 
7.0p (2012: 6.5p). This is an increase 
in dividend of circa 8%, in line with 
the underlying earnings growth in 
headline profits over the biennial 
cycle. The final dividend is proposed 
for payment on 10 February 2014.
Outlook
This year, the Group has again 
enjoyed good trading conditions in 
its major markets, producing a strong 
financial performance. Although 
large events have traded well, much 
of this year’s growth has come from 
our portfolio of medium sized events, 
often run from the smaller regional 
offices. This growth in smaller events 
looks set to continue into 2014, and 
forecasts are for economic growth 
in Russia to be maintained at current 
levels. Currency fluctuations were 
not a significant factor in this year’s 
results, but the Group’s results remain 
sensitive to sterling strength against 
the currencies of ITE’s markets. At 
30 November revenues booked 
for 2014 were £106 million, in line 
with the Board’s expectations and 
representing circa 55% of market 
expectations for 2014 revenues. 
On a like‑for‑like basis revenues 
are circa 7% ahead of last year.
The recent announcement of the 
Sinostar joint venture means ITE enters 
the new financial year with good 
business prospects in three of the 
major emerging market economies: 
Russia, India and China. Growth 
prospects remain positive in Russia 
and most of the CIS markets, and the 
Group’s portfolio of core events should 
continue to perform well. With a strong 
balance sheet and operating cashflows, 
the Group remains in an excellent 
position to expand its business 
through organic development and 
acquisitions. The Board is focused on 
the execution of ITE’s strategy, and has 
confidence in ITE’s future prospects.

The Group’s performance this year
ITE has delivered a good trading 
performance with increased revenue 
reflecting good trading conditions 
in most of its markets and a strong 
result from its biennial Moscow 
International Oil and Gas Exhibition. 
ITE’s main focus this year has been 
on the development of its business in 
the Asian markets of India, South East 
Asia and most recently China. These 
acquisitions and investments in Asia 
have had a relatively small effect on 
this year’s results, but will make a more 
significant contribution in the future. 
Revenues for the year of £192.3 million 
(2012: £172.3 million) represent a 12% 
increase over last year and are derived 
from volume sales of 793,000m
2
, 
marginally less than last year. Organic 
revenue growth was £12.3 million with 
the net biennial pattern accounting for 
an additional £3.9 million of revenue, 
and first time contribution from 
acquisitions a further £3.8 million. 
Gross profits increased by £10.4 
million, of which circa £3.8 million 
is attributable to the net biennial 
pattern. The good trading result was 
achieved during a period of higher 
levels of planned investment made in 
the management and infrastructure 
of the Group. This reflects both 
the full year costs of businesses 
acquired last year and supporting 
the Group’s expansion in Asia.
Mosbuild, the Group’s largest and most 
profitable event performed well this 
year in a competitive environment, 
and delivered volume and revenue 
growth. The Group’s other large events 
traded well, but the main drivers 
of organic growth in revenues and 
gross profits were the next tier of 
medium sized events and the regional 
offices as the Group’s portfolio 
becomes increasingly diversified. 
Trading conditions in most of our 
markets were good throughout 
the year with the Russian regional 
offices of Siberia and Krasnodar, 
together with Azerbaijan all putting 
in strong performances and all 
reporting revenue growth of more 
than 10%. Trading conditions in the 
other Central Asia markets were also 
good and supported strong revenue 
growth. The UK, Turkish and Ukrainian 
businesses performed less well. The 
UK and Ukraine were hampered by 
difficult economic conditions and 
the Turkish business was impacted 
by space constraints on its largest 
events and a weaker Turkish Lira.
The main factors affecting Group 
profitability this year are summarised 
in the profit bridge on page 13. 
Development of the business
The main objectives for the Group 
this year were securing the position of 
ITE’s premiere Moscow construction 
event, Mosbuild, in its new competitive 
environment and continuing with the 
business expansion programme in Asia. 
Mosbuild performed well this year, 
selling more space than last year and 
growing its revenue base, but delivered 
slightly lower profits than last year. 
More importantly visitor and exhibitor 
research confirmed that its positioning 
as the ‘must attend’ construction 
event had not been affected by 
the recent change in venue and 
format of the event. ITE is continuing 
to invest in the event to ensure 
Mosbuild retains its current status.
The Group has now established a 
strong business base in Asia and the 
acquired businesses are performing 
well. In December last year we 
acquired a 28.3% minority stake 
in ABEC, a major Indian exhibition 
business, with an option to take a 
controlling position in 2015. We have 
spent this year developing the working 
relationship with ABEC’s management 
and establishing where we can best 
co‑operate between our respective 
businesses. This has resulted in a 
repositioning of our existing Indian 
business which now runs alongside 
the ABEC business. In January of this 
year we acquired a small maritime 
event alternating between Singapore 
and Hong Kong, to form the base 
for the launch of an ITE transport 
infrastructure brand in Asia, TransAsia. 
Also in January we acquired a 75% 
majority position in Tradelink, owner 
of Metaltech, the leading metalworking 
event in Malaysia. With the retention 
of the existing management, this event 
has the potential to be a platform for 
growing other metalworking events 
in Asia. In April we agreed terms to 
form a joint venture with the owners 
of ECMI, a Malaysian based business 
running its Beauty and Laboratory 
events in Malaysia, Indonesia and 
Vietnam. This joint venture provides 
ITE with a fast track route to launching 
exhibitions across South East Asia. 
It has already helped generate the 
launches of Paperex (from India) in 
Indonesia, and Beauty and Oil & Gas 
events in Myanmar for next year. In the 
autumn our UK fashion business MODA 
agreed terms to co‑operate on a 
recently launched event for menswear 
in Hong Kong. In November we were 
able to announce the formation of a  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Strategic report
CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S
STATEMENT Co NTINuED
joint venture to develop exhibitions 
in the coatings and surface finishing 
industries by investing £33 million in 
a 50% shareholding in the Chinacoat 
exhibition business. As well as 
acquiring a stake in one of the leading 
exhibitions in the world in this growing 
sector, the purpose of the joint venture 
is to use the Chinacoat brand and data 
to support a roll out of other events 
across the manufacturing countries 
of Asia, and into the end user markets 
of Russia and the CIS. ITE is committed 
to building a network of offices across 
Asia and now has representation in 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and on 
the South Eastern Chinese seaboard. 
It is important for ITE to invest in 
building the ‘brand’ and profile of its 
events to support the development 
of portfolios along vertical industrial 
lines. This aspect of our strategy 
was exemplified by the acquisition 
in October of Beauty Eurasia, the 
principal event serving the beauty 
industry in Turkey. Aligned with 
the beauty events we acquired 
in Ukraine last year and the ECMI 
beauty exhibitions run in Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Vietnam, ITE now has an 
opportunity to build a strong presence 
in the beauty sector in more markets.
In Russia, the benefits of common 
brands and systems developed over 
the last few years are now being 
realised with an active programme 
of replicating and cross‑marketing 
events into and across the regional 
markets. New opportunities are 
expected to arise from the expansion 
in regional venue capacity over the 
next few years. Recently we have 
seen new regional exhibition centres 
developed in Ekaterinburg and 
Novosibirsk which have helped to 
generate renewed levels of growth in 
the local exhibition businesses. Over 
the course of 2014 the Expoforum 
venue will open in St Petersburg. 
This is a major new venue of 50,000m
2
 
gross with conference facilities that 
will present new opportunities for the 
further development of exhibitions and 
conference businesses in the North 
West of Russia. In the South West, 
ITE’s Krasnodar office has signed an 
agreement to be the principal user 
of a new venue, which will add over 
30,000m
2
 of quality exhibition space 
in the city. The new venue should 
be completed and ready for use by 
2016. The Group is well positioned 
to participate in the growth that 
these investments in local exhibition 
facilities are expected to generate. 
ITE’s objectives and strategy
ITE’s principal objective is to create 
a business with sustainable growth 
in headline earnings per share. Its 
strategy is to develop positions of 
market leadership in the exhibition 
business in emerging and developing 
(high growth) markets.
Four priorities underpin ITE’s strategy: 
 – Build on existing positions of 
market leadership 
 – Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for 
strong market positions 
 – Enhance and improve our 
exhibition brands 
 – Invest in developing our people
ITE’s performance against its 
strategic priorities is set out below:
(i) build on existing positions of 
market leadership:
ITE’s existing positions of market 
leadership are founded on its ability 
to generate international sales, its 
recognised brands, its local office 
infrastructure and its longstanding 
relationships with venues.
International sales strength 
ITE’s ability to generate international 
sales has differentiated it from its 
local competition in Russia and the 
related CIS markets. Through its 
subsidiary sales offices the Group has 
established a loyal customer base and 
a geographic reach which is hard to 
replicate for competitors. In 2013 the 
total net metres sold by the Group’s 
international sales offices increased 
by 15% to 133,000m
2
. This represents 
circa 25% of the Group’s 2013 revenues, 
an increase on 2012 reflecting the 
Group’s investment in building‑up 
its international sales presence last 
year, including opening a new sales 
office in Malaysia to target potential 
customers from South East Asia. 
Approximately 11% of revenues were 
sold by the Group’s London office, 4% 
by its German office, 3% by its Chinese 
office and 3% by its Turkish office. 
ITE’s international brands
ITE has established strong brand 
identities in certain exhibition sectors. 
In particular, the Build brand in 
construction, the Oil & Gas events 
brand, the ITE Travel exhibition and 
World Food brands all have strong 
reputations with customers as leading 
events in the Russian and CIS markets  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

earned through more than fifteen years 
of sustained good performance. The 
Group is working to ensure that the 
new construction businesses in the 
Group, notably in Turkey and India, are 
aligned with ITE’s historic construction 
brand and that all the benefits available 
from sharing best practice are realised. 
The acquisition of Beauty Eurasia 
and ECMI has created an opportunity 
for ITE to build an internationally 
recognised brand in this sector. 
There are also a number of developing 
brands in security, transport, 
packaging, printing and mining events 
which have prospects to support 
new events in different markets. 
Building ITE’s local office 
infrastructure 
ITE’s brands have built their reputation 
through sustained delivery of 
successful exhibitions to customers. 
The foundation of this is in ITE’s 
local offices which now employ over 
900 staff. Local offices generate the 
local sales, reputation and visitor 
participation of the event as well 
as managing technical staging of 
the exhibitions. Critically they own 
and develop the database of local 
visitors who make the exhibition 
successful for the exhibitors. In its 
core markets, ITE’s local offices have 
always been a competitive advantage 
over other international exhibition 
organisers and a barrier to entry for 
new organisers wishing to run events. 
ITE will continue to develop strong 
local offices as part of its exhibition 
business in new markets. The Group 
has an integration programme for new 
offices acquired into the ITE network 
and is increasing its investment in the 
infrastructure that underpins these  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Strategic report
offices and in staff training. The Group 
has high rates of employee retention 
in its offices, and supports this by its 
commitment to having widespread 
equity ownership – currently more 
than 60% of staff participate in 
some form of equity scheme. 
Maintaining venue relationships
ITE has always enjoyed longstanding 
relationships with the venues that 
host its exhibitions. In its core markets 
ITE has supported the development 
of venue facilities which in turn has 
helped the Group’s exhibitions to 
prosper. The Group has always sought 
to establish rights to run its main 
exhibition themes in its partner venues 
at the time of its choice and ITE has 
continued to work on maintaining and 
improving the venue relationships 
that underpin its business. Most of 
ITE’s major events have agreements 
which provide for venue facilities 
for at least three years ahead. This 
year ITE has agreed to support the 
development of a new venue in 
Krasnodar, where ITE will have the 
exclusive rights to run exhibitions. 
(ii) Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for strong 
market positions:
In existing markets this strategy means 
targeting new sectors or regions in 
which to acquire or develop exhibitions 
where there is potential for the 
participation of international exhibitors. 
In new markets, ITE is targeting the 
development of exhibition businesses 
where there is clear opportunity 
for strong future growth. 
This year the Group has expanded its 
business presence into India, South 
East Asia and China. In so doing it has 
acquired expertise in new sectors – 
some of which have potential in ITE’s 
core markets, and also made it possible 
for the Group to run its existing brands 
in the new markets. The launch of 
TransAsia, Paperex Indonesia and Oil 
& Gas Myanmar are good examples of 
the opportunities created by access 
to new marketplaces. In time the 
Group will benefit from extending the 
newly acquired Chinacoat and Beauty 
portfolios back into its core markets.
As the Group’s acquisition activity 
over the last two years has opened 
up access to new markets, there are 
now increasing synergies and benefits 
to be gained from strengthening 
its industry portfolio in each sector. 
The Group aims to increasingly focus 
its acquisition activity on building 
portfolio strength and leadership 
in exhibition sectors – creating 
stronger more defensible business 
positioning for its exhibitions. 
(iii) Enhance and improve our 
exhibition brands: 
The Group’s management has been 
working to improve the strength of 
ITE’s existing international brands. 
This is being achieved by introducing 
product improvements to enhance 
customer experience and ensuring 
consistency in the presentation and 
promotion of similar events in ITE’s 
vertical industry sectors. The Group’s 
brand development projects have 
covered all aspects of product quality, 
naming, character, tone‑of‑voice and 
graphic designs associated with events 
in the Group’s largest portfolios. The 
improvements will deliver numerous 
benefits, including increasing the 
global recognition of ITE’s brands 
and enabling the Group to launch 
‘cloned’ events into new territories.
(iv) Invest in developing our people:
We have made some good progress 
in developing the strength and depth 
of the leadership and management 
teams in the year as well as improving 
the communication between the 
different offices. We have improved 
our talent management processes, 
including identifying and addressing 
individual development needs. 
Our rolling programme of internal 
senior management and functional 
conferences has been a huge success 
as has the leadership development 
programme. We have also continued 
to extend and develop internal 
communication between offices 
and opened up communication 
by functional management i.e. 
connecting staff lines across the 
different offices such as construction/
marketing/IT and finance. 
ITE’s strategic objectives are 
unchanged. We have been successful 
in establishing positions in new 
markets and the future accent will be 
more orientated towards development 
of brands and industry verticals 
in order to leverage the potential 
synergies of the newly acquired assets.

ITE’s existing positions of market leadership are 
founded on its ability to generate international sales, its

longstanding relationships with venues.
Through its international sales ITE has established a loyal 
customer base and a geographic reach which is hard to

ITE’s local offices continue to provide a competitive 
advantage over other international exhibition organisers 
and a barrier to entry for new organisers wishing to run 
events. ITE’s local offices now employ over 900 staff and 
during the year further steps have been taken to integrate 
recently acquired offices into the ITE network.
In its core markets ITE has continued to support the 
development of venue facilities which in turn has helped

Many of ITE’s major events have agreements which

New opportunities are expected to rise from the expansion 
in regional venue capacity over the next few years. New 
regional exhibition centres in Ekaterinburg and Novosibirsk 
have demonstrated the positive effect that additional 
venue capacity can have on ITE’s exhibition portfolio, 
so the planned developments of new venues in both 
St Petersburg and Krasnodar offer considerable 
opportunities for future growth. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

business acquisitions 
in the year
In existing markets, ITE targets new sectors or regions 
in which to acquire and develop acquisitions where 
there is potential for the participation of international 
exhibitors. In new markets, ITE is targeting the 
development of exhibition businesses where there 
is clear opportunity for strong future growth.
This year ITE has expanded its presence into India, South 
East Asia and China. In December 2012 the Group acquired 
a 28% stake in Asian Business Exhibition & Conferences Ltd 
(ABEC). ABEC is one of India’s leading exhibition 
businesses, running 19 exhibitions across 11 vertical markets 
including construction, architecture, design, education, 
lifestyle, real estate, and oil & gas. Characterised by strong 
local management, ABEC’s 8% market share makes it India’s 
largest private exhibition organiser. The portfolio of events 
is complementary to ITE’s existing exhibition interests in 
India and the two businesses will be run concurrently.
In January ITE acquired a 75% stake in Tradelink. Tradelink 
runs the successful Metaltech, Automex and Weldtech events 
that take place together annually in May at Kuala Lumpur’s 
Putra World Trade Centre. Focused on the area of machine 
tool technology and metal fabrication, they are Malaysia’s 
leading events in this growing sector occupying over 
10,000m
2
 of exhibition space annually. In February, the 
Group acquired the successful Work Boat Asia and China 
Maritime exhibitions that are focused on the area of marine 
equipment and services. The acquisition in April of a 50% 
stake in ECMI, which organises beauty events across South 
East Asia, further established ITE’s presence in the region.
In November 2013 ITE announced the acquisition of a 
50% stake in the ChinaCoat exhibition. ChinaCoat serves 
the decorative, industrial coatings and surface finishing 
industries in China and the surrounding region and is 
the leading industry exhibition in the region.
These acquisitions, whilst being earnings‑enhancing in 
their own right, also create significant opportunities for 
the Group by providing access to new marketplaces.

Key beauty brands have been acquired In the last two decades, ITE has developed a number of 
successful brands that are renowned for providing effective 
marketplaces for businesses. ITE has established leading 
brands in a number of key sectors, in particular the build 
brand in construction, but the Group also leads in Oil & Gas, 
Travel and Food.
 
During the year ITE ran a number of initiatives designed 
to improve the strength of its existing international brands. 
The Group has brought together expertise in key industries 
through a vertical management structure to complement 
the existing geographical structure. The Group has also 
engaged in a series of brand development projects which 
have covered all aspects of product quality, naming, 
character, tone‑of‑voice and graphic designs associated 
with events in the Group’s largest portfolios.
ITE is working to ensure that the new construction 
businesses in the Group, notably in Turkey and India, are 
aligned with ITE’s historic construction brand and that all 
the benefits available from sharing best practice are realised.
ITE is also working to establish a strong brand for 
some of its newly acquired shows. In October the Group 
acquired Beauty Eurasia, the principal event serving the 
beauty industry in Turkey. Aligned with the beauty events 
we acquired in Ukraine last year and the ECMI beauty 
exhibitions run in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, 
ITE now has an opportunity to build a strong presence 
in the beauty sector in more markets.

Employees in

ITE is aware that its success is dependent on its 
people. As such, ITE is committed to investing in staff 
development throughout the Group and in particular, 
the management team that supports growing events 
and the continued expansion of the business.
Job satisfaction and staff retention have always been 
strengths associated with ITE. The Group encourages 
staff to seize career development opportunities. Staff can 
switch job functions if they possess the necessary skills 
and drive to succeed in another role. Others move offices, 
relocating to a new city or country in order to progress. 
There are no fewer rewards for those who choose to stick 
to their profession of choice, because working for ITE 
provides the variety of products, markets and projects 
for people to constantly develop and test their talents.
ITE has high rates of employee retention in its offices, with 
almost half of the Group employees having served in the 
business for five years or more. Key to this commitment is 
widespread equity ownership – currently more than 60% 
of staff participate in some form of equity scheme.
ITE continues to invest in staff training and recruitment. 
The Group has made good progress in developing the 
strength and depth of the leadership and management 
teams in the year, improving the communication between 
the different offices, and improving the talent management 
process. The Group has also continued with its rolling 
programme of internal senior management and 
functional conferences as well as the leadership 
development programme.

Overall in 2013 the Group ran 233 events (2012: 264). The

RUSSIA
During the year ITE held 112 events in Russia (2012: 118), with 
total volume sales this year of 399,100m
2
 (2012: 391,800m
2
). 
Revenue of £121.1 million was 15% higher than the previous 
year, reflecting a combination of organic growth and the 
return of the biennial Moscow International Oil & Gas Exhibition 
(MIOGE). On a like‑for‑like basis volume sales in Russia 
increased by 2% and revenues by 10% over last year’s result. 
The Russian economy continues to grow although at 
a slower pace than in recent years, with GDP growth of 
around 2% in 2013 and slightly higher growth forecast for 
2014. This backdrop of economic stability underpinned by 
relatively stable commodity prices, most notably oil, is 
providing the environment for continued growth in ITE’s 
exhibitions, particularly in the offices outside Moscow. 
Moscow is ITE’s largest office in Russia accounting 
for around 80% of the region’s revenues. The office has 
performed well this year with the continued success of 
Mosbuild, the Group’s largest event, and the return of the 
biennial MIOGE. Moscow’s volume sales for the year were 
258,500m
2
 (2012: 251,200m
2
); on a like‑for like basis volume 
sales were 3% higher and revenues 7% higher than in the 
prior year. The portfolio of industrial events led by 
Aquatherm Moscow delivered double digit growth which 
helped offset a small decline in volumes at the Moscow 
International Travel and Tourism exhibition from 20,000m
2
 
to 19,500m
2
. The largest events in Moscow run in the 
second half of the year and all performed strongly. As 
expected Mosbuild continued to prove resilient to local 
competition, delivering volume sales of 68,700m
2
 an 
increase of 4% on the prior edition, although investment to 
improve the quality of visitor and exhibitor experience 
reduced profits. The biennial MIOGE returned in June 
delivering a record 24,000m
2
 (2011: 22,800m
2
) and record 
revenues. The logistics event TransRussia and the security 
event, Moscow International Security & Protection again 
both produced double digit growth, and World Food 
Moscow grew 2% from 24,400m
2
 to 24,900m

In St Petersburg, ITE made further good progress, building 
on the improving trading conditions experienced over the 
past two years. During the year ITE operated 19 events from 
this office increasing sold space by 8% to 31,600m
2
 (2012: 
29,200m
2
) and revenues by 15%. There was good growth 
across all sectors, with notably strong growth in Mining 
World Russia and Expoelectronica, the former serving the 
mining support services industry, and the latter focusing on 
electronic components. The St Petersburg business has now 
recovered to its pre‑recession market size and the opening 
of a new venue in the city in mid‑ 2014 will provide the Group 
with access to increased space in a world class facility.
In Novosibirsk, Siberia, ITE is the anchor tenant in the city’s 
main venue which opened in early 2012. The international 
quality space it offers has provided a platform for growth in 
the Group’s business in this region. During 2013 the region held 
27 events (2012: 26), with overall volume sales of 45,000m
2
 
(2012: 42,700m
2
). Local revenues improved by 27% to over 
£8 million, as lower yielding events were removed from the 
portfolio and remaining products grew strongly.
The Krasnodar region in south‑west Russia is one of the 
most prosperous outside Moscow. The region is the centre 
of the Russian agricultural industry and is the base for a 
number of international manufacturers. The exhibition 
portfolio covers a broad range of sectors, the largest events 
being in the agriculture and construction sectors. In total 
this office contributed volume sales of 64,000m
2
 (2012: 
68,000m
2
) and generated over £9 million in revenues 
this year, growing by 13% over the prior year. However, the 
Group’s business in Krasnodar is restricted by the size of 
the current venue, and in August the Group entered into 
an agreement to become the anchor tenant at a new venue 
in the city with over 30,000m
2
 indoor space and 15,000m
2
 
dedicated outdoor space, which is due to be completed in 
early 2016. It is anticipated that this new facility will allow 
ITE’s largest events to grow and the business to expand 
into new industry sectors.

Strategic report
ITE’s principal offices in Central Asia are in Kazakhstan, 
Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. This year ITE organised a total 
of 69 events (2012: 93) across these territories delivering 
total volume sales of 82,300m
2
 (2012: 80,200m
2
), an 
increase of 3% over the previous year. Revenues of £28.9 
million represented an increase of 9% over the previous year. 
All of the economies in this region are largely dependent on 
oil and gas for their overseas earnings and economic wealth. 
The consistent $100+ price of oil has helped support 
economic confidence within these economies feeding 
through to good levels of economic growth, which has 
been reflected in the growth of the Group’s business 
in the region this year. 
Kazakhstan continued to grow well in 2013, delivering volume 
growth of 4% and revenue growth of 6%. This was driven by 
a strong performance in the construction sector which, while 
it has not yet recovered to its pre‑recession peaks, grew by 
36%, along with a further strong performance in the leisure 
and Health & Pharmaceutical sectors. Oil & Gas remains the 
largest sector in the region, accounting for around 40% of 
regional revenue. The largest event in the region is the 
Kazakhstan Oil & Gas Exhibition (KIOGE) which took place in 
Almaty in October 2012 and was slightly larger than the prior 
edition at 8,600m
2
 (2012: 8,500m
2
). ITE continues to enjoy a 
good working relationship with Atakent, the principal venue 
in Almaty, and at present this facility offers the Group 
sufficient space in which to operate its events.
In Azerbaijan, ITE has once again experienced strong growth 
backed by the country’s continued economic expansion. 
This year the region achieved volume sales of over 24,700m
2
 
(2012: 22,400m
2
) a 10% increase on the prior year. ITE is also 
benefitting from being the recognised industry leader and 
has organised a number of one‑off third party conferences 
resulting in an overall revenue increase of nearly 30% during 
the year.
ITE’s Uzbekistan business showed a decline in 2013 selling 
11,600m
2
 (2012:13,600m
2
) as a result of a number of shows 
moving date out of the financial year. Excluding these timing 
differences, volumes and revenue grew by 8% led by events 
in the Textile Machinery and Food sectors.

The Eastern and Southern Europe region comprises the 
Group’s offices in Turkey and Ukraine. Overall the region sold 
252,800m
2
 in 2013 (2012: 268,600m
2
), which on a like‑for‑like 
basis represented a decrease of 4% in volumes but from which 
was generated a 1% increase in like‑for‑like revenues.
Ukraine has continuing economic and political difficulties, 
but remains an attractive market for ITE over the long term. 
In the short term, economic conditions are forecast to 
remain challenging and ITE will concentrate on staging 
and maintaining its high quality market leading exhibitions 
ensuring that it will benefit when conditions improve. 
During the year volume sales increased by 7% to 66,000m
2
 
(2012: 61,500m
2
), helped by the first editions of some small 
exhibitions acquired with the Autoexpo portfolio in May 2012. 
Overall revenues grew by 2% on a like‑for‑like basis aided by a 
solid performance from the 2012 acquisitions (Autoexpo and 
Beauty) but held back by a flat performance of the Group’s 
largest event in the portfolio Aquatherm, serving the heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning sectors and sensitive to 
weaknesses in the construction sector.
In Turkey, while there were political tensions this year, the 
economy continues to grow and economic forecasts are for 
further economic growth of around 4% per annum over the 
short to medium term. There was a mixed performance from 
the Turkish portfolio of events this year, with lower volume 
sales of 186,700m
2
 (2012: 207,100m
2
), due to a change in the 
mix of biennial events, event timing and currency weakness. 
On a like‑for‑like basis volume sales were 3% less than last 
year, with revenues unchanged. Turkeybuild the pre‑eminent 
construction event in Turkey, took place in early May and 
delivered its largest ever event with volume sales of 36,200m
2
. 
The event enjoys strong demand for additional space from its 
exhibitors, which at present can’t be satisfied by the current 
venue arrangements, although work has now begun on 
additional space at the venue which is expected to be 
completed ahead of the 2015 edition. The Group’s leading 
regional travel event EMITT, again produced an excellent 
performance selling over 27,000m
2
 on improved margins. 
The Group is focused on improving the margins in this office 
by increasing the level of international participation and 
decreasing the influence of trade associations and adding 
events to the portfolio which match this criteria. The 
acquisition of Beauty Eurasia announced in early October 
2013 with its high level of international participants is in line 
with this strategy and improves the quality of the Turkish 
events portfolio and supports the Group’s establishment 
of an international Beauty brand. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The Group’s business in the UK is focused on the Fashion 
industry. Through MODA the Group owns the leading 
mid‑market fashion event for Womenswear, Menswear, 
Footwear and Lingerie which runs twice a year in 
Birmingham generating volume sales in excess of 35,000m
2
 
annually. In London the Group operates Bubble, a niche 
high‑end childrenswear event, Jacket Required, a 
designer‑led menswear event, and it also owns a 40% stake 
in Scoop, a designer‑led womenswear event. This year saw 
a good performance from the portfolio gaining further 
market share in very difficult market conditions which 
impacted the sector across Europe. Overall these events 
were flat in volumes and revenues with the mid‑market 
sector experiencing a small decline in trading, offset by 
a strong performance in the niche high‑end fashion 
exhibitions. The Group is now looking to take its expertise 
in the fashion sector outside the UK and in October 2013 
it acquired a 20% interest in The Hub a designer‑led 
menswear event in Hong Kong.
In December 2012, the Group purchased a 40% stake in 
Warsaw based Lentewenc (Lent). Lent aims to exploit a gap 
in the Warsaw market for quality international exhibitions 
and has already launched a number of events for 2013 
and 2014.

The Group’s operations in this region are in India, South East 
Asia and China. These represent new markets for ITE in 
which to grow our existing products and develop new 
sectors. These markets are characterised by fast growing 
economies, underpinned by a rapidly expanding aspirational 
middle class population which is expected to drive consumer 
demand. In addition, they have relatively immature exhibition 
industries and these two factors combine to offer excellent 
growth opportunities for ITE over the medium term. ITE has 
focused its initial expansion of activities in this region during 
2013 with acquisitions in India and Malaysia.
The Indian exhibition industry offers great potential due to 
the current lack of international quality venue space within 
the country which is severely limiting the industry at present 
and has slowed ITE’s progress in India since entering the 
market in 2009. In December 2012, the Group continued 
to expand its presence in this market with the purchase of 
a 28.3% stake in ABEC, India’s largest private exhibition 
organiser. The portfolio of 19 exhibitions across 11 sectors 
includes Acetech – India’s leading construction event. With 
the larger biennial events absent it was a quieter year within 
our existing Indian business, with the focus on integration 
of the previous years acquisitions, repositioning our existing 
business to run alongside and complement ABEC and 
improving the efficiencies of the existing operations. 
The Group entered the South East Asian market for the first 
time in 2013, with three acquisitions. In January, we purchased 
a 75% stake in Tradelink. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia the 
company runs the Metaltech event serving the machine tool 
technology and metal fabrication industries. The event, which 
sells over 12,000m
2
 takes place each May in Kuala Lumpur and 
performed ahead of our initial expectations. In February the 
Group made a small acquisition in Hong Kong, acquiring the 
biennial Asia Work Boat and China Maritime events. In April 
the Group purchased a 50% stake in Kuala Lumpur based 
ECMI which operates the pan‑Asia professional beauty event 
series Cosmobeaute and the laboratory equipment Lab 
exhibitions. These acquisitions, and ECMI in particular, offer the 
Group a base of operations from which to replicate its events 
across the region, and the Group has already announced the 
launch of an Oil & Gas event and Cosmobeaute in Myanmar, 
Paperex in Indonesia, Cosmobeaute in Thailand and 
TransAsia in Singapore.

Revenue and gross profit 
Revenue for the year was £192.3 million 
(2012: £172.3 million) and gross profit 
for the year was £88.1 million (2012: 
£77.7 million), an increase in gross 
margin by 1% to 46% (2012: 45%) driven 
by the Group’s stronger biennial year. 
Administrative expenses across the 
Group increased to £44.5 million 
from £39.8 million in the previous 
year. Administrative expenses 
include significant non‑cash items, 
including an amortisation charge of 
£13.1 million on acquired intangibles 
(2012: £13.5 million), a charge for 
share based payments of £2.2 million 
(2012: £2.1 million) and a foreign 
exchange loss of £0.2 million arising 
on the translation of foreign currency 
assets (2012: a gain of £0.3 million).
Excluding these non‑cash items, 
administrative expenses increased 
by £4.6 million to £29.0 million 
(2012: £24.5 million), with £1.1 million 
of the increase being overheads 
relating to the full year impact of 
acquisitions made in the prior year 
and acquisitions made in 2013. Overall, 
Group administrative expenses 
excluding non‑cash items and 
transaction related costs represented 
14% of revenue (2012: 14%).
Operating profit was £45.0 
million against a prior year profit 
of £39.0 million, resulting in 
net operating margins of 23% 
(2012: 23%) for the year. 
Headline pre‑tax profit for the year 
was £59.4 million (2012: £53.0 million).
Other operating income 
£0.3 million (2012: £0.4 million)
Other operating income represents 
rental income earned from 
subletting surplus office space, 
principally at ITE’s London office.
Investment revenue
£1.1 million (2012: £3.2 million)
Investment revenue came from 
interest on bank deposits of £1.0 
million (2012: £1.0 million). The prior 
year included gains on the revaluation 
of put options on acquisitions made 
during 2011 of £1.6 million and gains 
on the settlement of contingent 
consideration of £0.5 million. 
Finance costs
£2.2 million (2012: £1.7 million)
Finance costs represent the interest 
cost of the Group’s borrowings in 
Sterling, Euro and US Dollar (£0.5 
million), bank charges (£0.5 million) 
together with a loss on the revaluation 
of put options on acquisitions and 
an imputed interest charge arising 
on the discounting of the Group’s 
put option liabilities of £0.3 million.
Tax charge
The tax charge of £8.2 million 
represents 19% of profit before tax 
(2012: 20%). The Group continues 
to focus on tax efficiency across the 
Group, with the reduction in the tax 
rate this year resulting from further 
effects of the lowering of underlying 
corporation tax rates within the main 
operating economies of the Group, 
together with efficiencies within the 
Group structure. The lower levels 
of underlying corporation tax, if 
sustained, will continue to benefit 
the Group’s tax rate in the future.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased 
by 9% to 14.2p (2012: 13.0p). Diluted 
earnings per share also increased 
by 9% to 14.0p (2012: 12.8p).
The Group achieved headline diluted 
earnings per share of 19.3p (2012:

Return to shareholders
The Group has recommended a 
final dividend of 4.7p per share for 
2013, to bring the total dividend 
for the year to 7.0p per share 
(2012: 6.5p), an increase of 8%.
ITE is committed to maximising 
shareholder value through a long‑term 
progressive dividend policy, set against 
a principle of maintaining at least two 
times cover across the biennial cycle, 
together with the reinvestment of 
profits into expanding the business. 
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations 
in the year was £66.2 million, 
representing 112% of headline profits 
(2012: £55.9 million, 105%). The 
principal applications of cash were 
£26.1 million applied to acquisitions 
(2012: £19.6 million); £0.9 million 
applied to new venue loans and 
advances (2012: £6.2 million); 
£11.1 million was paid in tax (2012: 
£11.6 million); and £16.4 million was 
distributed as dividends to the Group’s 
shareholders (2012: £15.2 million). The 
increase in net cash balances over the 
year was £10.4 million, with the Group 
holding £23.5 million in net cash at 30 
September 2013 (2012: £13.0 million).
Acquisitions 
On 25 March 2013, ITE acquired 
a 75% stake in Tradelink ITE Sdn 
Bhd (‘Tradelink’) for initial cash 
consideration of £4.1 million with 
additional deferred consideration 
estimated at £2.6 million payable 
contingent on subsequent 
performance. During the financial year 
this portfolio of Malaysian exhibitions 
contributed revenue of £2.3 million 
and £1.2 million of profit before tax 
to the Group’s headline results.
Investments in joint ventures and 
associates
On 3 December 2012, the Group 
purchased a 28.3% share in Asian 
Business Exhibition & Conferences 
Limited (ABEC) for £14.0 million. 
The Group holds put and call 
options to acquire an additional 
31.7% stake in ABEC in 2016.
On 11 April 2013 the Group purchased 
a 50% stake in certain exhibition assets 
of ECMI Trade Fairs S.E.A. Sdn Bhd 
(ECMI) for £1.7 million. A deferred 
payment of £0.9 million is due in April 
2014. In addition, the Group holds 
put and call options to acquire an 
additional 25% of the business in 2017, 
with further options held to acquire the 
remaining 25% of the business in 2019.
Subsequent to the year end, 
on 15 November 2013, the Group 
acquired a 50% stake in Sinostar ITE 
which owns Chinacoat and SFChina, 
the leading coatings and surface 
finishing exhibitions in China. The 
initial investment comprises £30.0 
million cash with a further amount 
estimated at £3 million payable in June 
2014 contingent on the performance 
of the business to 31 March 2014.

Net assets increased by £9.5 million 
to £109.3 million. The main changes 
are in net cash (an increase of £10.5 
million), investments in joint ventures 
and associates (an increase of £17.3 
million), goodwill and intangibles 
(a decrease of £8.7 million) and 
the movement in deferred revenue 
(an increase of £7.2 million). 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill and intangible assets have 
increased during the year due to 
the acquisition of Tradelink. The 
intangible assets balance represents 
acquired customer relationships, 
trademarks and licences, visitor 
databases and computer software. 
Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure 
on plant and equipment reduced 
slightly during the year to £0.9 
million (2012: £1.3 million) and 
included exhibition equipment, 
office fixtures and fittings. Capital 
expenditure on computer software 
in the year was £0.8 million (2012: 
£0.6 million). The increase reflects 
continued investment in computer 
software to enhance our exhibition 
visitor experiences, develop our 
office network and support our sales, 
marketing and accounting functions. 
venue arrangements
The Group has long‑term 
arrangements with its principal 
venues in its main markets 
setting out ITE’s rights over 
future venue use and pricing.
In Moscow the Group utilises two main 
venues:‑ Expocentre is ITE’s principal venue 
in Moscow and hosts five of its largest 
exhibitions including Mosbuild, Moscow 
International Oil & Gas Exhibition, 
Moscow International Travel & Tourism, 
World Food Moscow, and Moscow 
International Protection & Security 
Exhibition. ITE has an agreement with 
Expocentre which secures the Group’s 
rights to hold its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates until 2015.
Crocus is located on the outskirts 
of Moscow city centre and hosts 
a number of events including 
Expoelectronica, TransRussia and 
Rosupack. ITE has an agreement with 
Crocus on an event by event basis, 
providing rights to hold its exhibitions 
at the venue on agreed rates until 2016.
Lenexpo is located in St Petersburg. 
ITE has an agreement with Lenexpo, 
providing rights to hold its exhibitions 
at the venue on agreed rates until 2014. 
Construction has now begun on a new 
venue for the city with completion 
due by mid‑2014 and ITE has signed 
a protocol agreement to hold its 
current events in the new venue.
Expocentre Novosibirsk was opened 
in February 2012. ITE is the anchor 
tenant for the venue with exclusive 
occupancy rights for over six months 
of the year. The Group operates all 
of its Siberian exhibitions from this 
venue and has contracted rights to 
operate on these terms until 2021.
In Krasnodar, ITE currently holds 
all its exhibitions at Krasnodar 
Expocentre with secured rights until 
2015. In September 2013 the Group 
signed an agreement to become the 
anchor tenant at a new purpose‑ built venue due to open in 2016. 
Tuyap is ITE’s principal venue in 
Istanbul, located close to the city’s 
international airport, and holds 
the majority of the Group’s Turkish 
exhibitions including Turkeybuild. 
ITE has an agreement with Tuyap 
which secures its rights to conduct 
its exhibitions at the venue on 
agreed rates through 2014.
The International Exhibition Centre 
(IEC) is the principal venue in Kyiv 
and hosts all of the Group’s Ukrainian 
events, including the Aquatherm 
exhibition and all events within the 
recently acquired Beautex and SIA 
portfolios. ITE has an agreement with 
IEC which secures its rights to conduct 
its exhibitions at the venue until 2017.
Atakent Exhibition Centre is the largest 
venue in Almaty, Kazakhstan and hosts 
the Kazakhstan International Oil & Gas 
events and KazBuild exhibitions. ITE’s 
agreement with Atakent confirms its 
rights to hold its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates until 2017.
Baku Expocentre is the principal 
venue in Baku and hosts all of the 
Group’s exhibitions in Azerbaijan. 
ITE has an agreement with Baku 
Expocentre which secures its rights 
to conduct its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates until 2015.

FINANCE DIRECTOR’S 
STATEMENT Co NTINuED
Treasury
During the year, the Group experienced 
a net foreign exchange loss of £0.2 
million (2012: gain of £0.3 million). 
The exchange rate for the Euro at 
30 September 2013 was €1.19:£1 
(30 September 2012: €1.25:£1); 
the exchange rate for the Ruble at 
30 September 2013 was R52.0:£1 
(30 September 2012: R50.5:£1); the 
exchange rate for the US Dollar at 
30 September 2013 was $1.61:£1 
(30 September 2012: $1.61:£1).
During the year, 40% of the Group’s 
sales were priced in Euros, 30% in 
Rubles, 8% in Pound Sterling, 1% 
in US Dollars, the balance being 
in various local currencies. Overall 
49% of the Group’s cash receipts for 
the period were collected in ‘hard’ 
currency (Sterling, Dollars or Euros) 
and 51% was collected in various local 
currencies, the majority being Rubles.
The average exchange rates used 
to translate sales into Sterling 
were: R48.9:£1 (2012: R47.3), 
€1.20:£1 (2012: €1.17:£1). The Group 
estimates that a 1 cent movement 
in the Euro impacts profit by 
£250,000 and a 1 Ruble movement 
impacts profit by £500,000. 
The Group uses derivative instruments 
and currency borrowings to protect 
itself against the effect of currency 
fluctuations on a proportion of its sales 
and its balance sheet. The Group’s 
policy on derivative instruments is that:
 – it will hedge no more than 75% of 
the value of anticipated Euro 
denominated sales derived from 
outside Russia and the CIS; and
 – it will only enter into derivative 
transactions up to 36 months ahead.
The Group funds the development 
of venues and facilities where 
improvements will enhance the 
prospects and profitability of its 
business. The funding can take the 
form of a prepayment of future venue 
fees (‘advance payment’), or a loan 
which can be repaid by cash or by 
offset against future venue fees 
(‘venue loan’). Generally the funding 
brings rights over future venue use and 
advantageous pricing arrangements 
through long‑ term agreements. Venue 
loans and advance payments are 
included in the Balance Sheet under 
non‑current and current assets.
Share capital
During the year the Company issued 
509,117 (2012: 294,658) ordinary shares 
of 1p in the year. All of the total new 
issues were pursuant to the exercise 
of options and yielded aggregate 
consideration of £150,117. During the 
year the Company made no additional 
purchases of shares for the Employees 
Share Option Trust (ESOT). As at 30 
September 2013 ESOT held 3,654,988 
(1.5%) of the Company’s issued share 
capital (2012: 5,366,722 (2.2%)). 
Reserves
The movement in the translation 
reserve from £5.1 million to £12.1 
million represents the loss on the 
retranslation of the Group’s overseas 
assets denominated in foreign 
currencies. This is driven primarily 
by movements in Sterling/Ruble and 
Sterling/Turkish Lira exchange rates. 
The movement in the hedge reserve 
from £5.2 million to a debit balance of 
£0.4 million primarily represents the 
loss on revaluation of Euro derivative 
instruments deemed effective hedges. 
The reduction in the put option 
reserve follows the acquisition of 
an additional 20% equity stake in 
Turkeybuild exercised in April 2013. 
At 30 September 2013, the Group’s Sterling value of the outstanding balances of 
advance payments and venue loans was £4.1 million (2012: £8.9 million) as follows:

At 30 September 2013, the Group 
had entered into forward contracts 
to sell Euros for Sterling between 
October 2013 and September 
2016. The value of the contracts 
is €73.5 million at an average rate 
of €1.20:£1. These instruments are 
designated as hedging instruments.
The Group finances its operations 
through cash holdings and banking 
facilities. The objective of the Group 
is to maximise investment income 
and minimise interest costs, bearing 
in mind its liquidity requirements. 
During the year the Group entered 
into currency borrowing arrangements 
to minimise its exposure to foreign 
exchange risk on trade receivables. 
At 30 September 2013 the Group had 
currency borrowings in the form of 
overdrafts of £12.9 million denominated 
in Sterling, £1.8 million denominated 
in US Dollars and £2.9 million 
denominated in Euros. In addition the 
Group had term loans drawn in Sterling 
of £3.0 million (2012: £13.3 million).
Group borrowing facilities
The Group has long‑term borrowing 
facilities provided by Barclays Bank. 
The arrangements extend until 30 
June 2015 and consist of term and 
overdraft facilities totalling £30 million. 
For short‑term debt, such as overdraft 
facilities or debt with a term of less 
than 12 months, fixed or floating rates 
of interest are used. For debt with 
a term of greater than 12 months, 
when the borrowing is not covered 
by existing cash holdings, it is policy 
that at least 50% must have fixed 
rates of interest so as to minimise 
the Group’s exposure to interest rate 
movements. It is Group policy that 
its cash balances are not invested in 
instruments that would put the capital 
value at risk. All invested funds have 
a determinable rate of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure 
continuity of funding for operational 
needs through cash deposits and 
debt facilities as appropriate. The key 
requirement for the business is to 
maintain flexibility to allow the Group 
to take advantage of opportunities that 
could arise over the short term. The 
needs of the business are determined 
on a rolling cash flow forecast basis, 
covering weekly, monthly, annual and 
3‑years’ requirements. Short term 
flexibility is maintained by holding 
cash in current accounts and high 
liquidity money market funds. The 
Group has overdraft facilities in place 
both to permit currency borrowing 
as part of its foreign exchange 
management and to allow flexibility 
in where it holds its cash balances.
The Group is conscious of the risks 
associated with holding deposits in 
foreign‑domiciled banks. The territories 
in which ITE operates do not all have 
internationally recognised banks and 
the Group has relationships with a 
number of domestic banks. The Group 
seeks to use the territories’ leading 
banks and to minimise the level of cash 
held in such banks. Of the Group’s 
total cash balance of £44.0 million as 
at 30 September 2013, 72% was held 
in institutions with a rating of grade 
A or above and 21% in B to BBB+.
Going concern
The Group and Company’s business 
activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out 
in the Chief Executive’s statement 
and Divisional Trading Summary. The 
financial position of the Group and 
Company, its significant cash balance, 
its cash flow, liquidity position and 
absence of net long‑term borrowings 
are described within this Finance 
Director’s statement. In addition, note 
21 refers to the Group and Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
After making enquiries, reviewing 
the Group and Company’s forecasts 
and projections and taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources 
to continue its operations for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they have adopted the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements.

RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
The Group identifies and monitors the key risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and runs the business in a way that 
minimises the impact of such risks where possible. The risk profile of the Group is deemed to be unchanged in the year. 
Operational risks Potential impact Mitigation
Political uncertainty and 
regulatory risk
The Group’s business is principally carried out 
in Russia, the CIS, Turkey and Asia. Changes in 
law or the regulatory environment could have 
an effect on some or all of the exhibitions of 
the Group.
ITE has reduced the risk by establishing its 
businesses as independent Russian, CIS, Turkish 
and Asian companies fully contributing to the 
local economy, and the diversity of businesses 
across sectors and geography provides 
protection for the longer‑term prospects 
of the Group.
Economic instability 
reduces demand for 
exhibition space
Reduced demand for exhibition space would 
reduce the profits of exhibitions.
ITE operates across a wide range of sectors 
and countries to minimise the exposure to any 
single market. ITE, through its relationships with 
venues and staff has a relatively flexible cost 
structure, allowing it to manage its event 
margins in the short and medium term. This 
was clearly evidenced during the Group’s 
performance during the recent recession.
Commercial relationships The Group has key commercial relationships 
with venues which secure the Group’s rights 
to run its exhibitions in the future.
These key relationships are regularly reviewed 
and the Group seeks to maintain its exhibition 
rights for up to at least three years forward for 
significant exhibitions where possible.
venue availability Damage to or unavailability of a particular 
venue could impact the Group’s short‑term 
trading position.
The Group carries business interruption 
insurance policies which protect profits on its 
largest events covering annual revenue of circa 
£120 million against such an event in the short 
term. In the longer‑term the Group seeks to 
maintain good relationships with its principal 
venues to ensure the continuance of availability.
Competitor risk Competition has existed in ITE’s markets for 
some years. ITE faces competitive pressures 
on a market‑by‑market basis.
In all of its overseas markets, ITE has a strong 
position as an international organiser, achieved 
through effective use of its international sales 
network and its established brands for major 
events. A single exhibition or sector in a market 
could have its prospects curtailed by a strong 
competitor launch; however, the breadth of 
ITE’s portfolio of events, with its geographic 
and sector diversity, reduce the risk of a 
competitive threat to the Group’s overall 
business.
Integration and 
management of 
acquisitions
With new acquisitions there can be no 
assurances that the Group will achieve the 
expected return on its investment, particularly 
as the success of any acquisition also depends 
on the Group’s ability to integrate the acquired 
business or assets.
The Group has formal investment decision 
criteria to identify suitable, earnings enhancing, 
acquisitions targets and employs experienced 
professionals to drive the acquisition process 
and performs, when appropriate, financial, tax, 
legal and commercial due diligence. 
Post‑acquisition plans are prepared to ensure 
businesses are effectively integrated into the 
Group and that planned synergies are realised.
People ITE’s employees have longstanding 
relationships with customers and a unique 
knowledge of the exhibitions business. Loss of 
key staff could impact the short‑term prospects 
of a specific event or sector.
ITE has sought to build loyalty in its staff by 
ensuring remuneration is competitive and 
through a wide distribution of the Group’s 
long‑term incentive plans. ITE has a good 
record of retaining its key staff through both 
growth and recessionary times.
Financial risk – 
foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign 
exchange rates against Sterling for both trading 
transactions and for the translation of overseas 
operations. The principal exposure is to the Euro 
and the Ruble which form the basis of the Group’s 
invoicing and to the Ruble which forms the base 
books of the Group’s Russian operations.
The Group seeks to minimise exposure by:
 – Protecting a certain amount of Euro 
denominated sales with forward contracts.
 – Seeking to maximise the matching of costs 
and revenues in the same currency. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

ENvIRONMENTAL 
IMPACT
As a media services company, the 
Group acknowledges that its business 
has an impact on the environment, 
albeit relatively minor, and ITE follows 
current best practice in each of its 
markets by observing industry and 
country legislation. The Group is aware 
that this is an area of increasing 
concern to employees, shareholders 
and customers alike. By identifying 
environmental improvements, we 
expect to see increased efficiencies 
and with that reduced costs and the 
management of environmental issues is 
part of our business strategy to create 
long‑term value for shareholders. 
board level responsibility
The Group Finance Director has 
direct responsibility for environmental 
matters and chairs the Environmental 
Matters Committee which monitors 
the Group’s emissions, considers and 
makes recommendations for 
improvements and mitigations of the 
Group’s environmental impact, and 
commissions and reviews external 
reporting of the Group’s environmental 
impact for regulatory or voluntary 
disclosure. 
The Group’s new Reporting Protocol
For the past three years ITE has 
reported material GHG (Greenhouse 
Gas) emissions from its UK operations 
– with the aim of driving efficiencies, 
reducing costs and improving 
environmental management across its 
UK offices; and creating long‑term 
value for shareholders.
This year the Group has expanded the 
scope of its reporting to cover GHG 
emissions at the global level covering 
over 1,000 staff, based in approximately 
30 offices, in 17 countries. 
During the year, the Group worked with 
CarbonSmart, a carbon consultancy, 
to develop a GHG Reporting Protocol, 
based on DEFRA and World Resource 
Institute guidelines. 
The Group has decided to measure 
GHG emissions based on financial 
control boundaries – so operations 
which are consolidated as subsidiaries 
in the Group’s financial statements have 
been included in the measurement 
exercise. Associates and joint ventures 
of the Group have not been included as 
the Group does not exercise sole 
control over these operations. As the 
Group does not exercise financial 
control over the properties in which 
exhibitions are held, emissions arising 
from these properties have not 
been measured.
The Company does not manufacture 
or sell any tangible products 
and has identified the following 
key activities as being within the 
GHG reporting requirements: 
 – Scope 1: Natural gas; company cars; 
onsite fuel consumption and fugitive 
emissions (i.e. refrigerants). 
 – Scope 2: Purchased electricity and 
heat and steam. 
At present, scope 3 activities (e.g. 
business travel; waste; freight shipping) 
are excluded from the reporting scope. 
It is believed that at present the quality 
of the data would not be sufficiently 
robust for accurate reporting in 
these areas.
The Group has identified GHG 
emissions per employee as the most 
appropriate available KPI (referred to 
as the intensity ratio) and the Group 
has set a target of reducing the 
Group’s GHG emissions per employee 
in the next 12 months. 
Measurement of environmental 
impact in 2013
The Group collected data from most 
offices in the Group on the activities 
identified above for the year ended 
30 April 2013. This is the first year of 
collecting data on a Group wide basis 
and so will act as the benchmark year. 
This also means that no comparatives 
are presented below. 
Offices covering 97% of employees 
provided data. In order to present a 
total emissions report for the Group, 
results from similar offices have been 
extrapolated based on the number of 
employees to estimate total emissions. 
In some offices, electricity and heat 
charges are included in office rental 
charges and information has not been 
provided by office landlords. In these 
cases, an estimate has been calculated 
based on similar offices’ usage and 
office floor space data.

CORPORATE SOCIAL 
RESPONSIbILITy
Overview
The Board of ITE believes that 
corporate and social responsibility is an 
important part of the Group’s culture 
and that the adoption of good practice 
will have a positive impact on profits 
and increase the long‑term value 
for shareholders. Due consideration 
is given to risks arising from social, 
ethical and environmental issues as 
part of an ongoing risk review process.
Employees 
The Board recognises the importance 
of diversity amongst its employees 
and is committed to ensuring 
that employees are selected and 
promoted on the basis of merit and 
ability, regardless of age, gender, 
race, religion, sexual orientation or 
disability. The gender split across 
the Group as at 30 September 2013 
is illustrated in the table below:
Male Female
Board 7 1

The Group has a policy of encouraging 
employees, especially those from the 
locations in emerging markets, to move 
around the offices of the Group, thus 
providing development opportunities 
for all staff. In addition, employees are 
assisted in their career development 
through an annual appraisal scheme, 
and sponsored training is provided 
where there is a benefit to both the 
individual and the Company. All staff 
are eligible to receive share options 
or awards under the Employee’s 
Performance Share Plan as the Board 
feels that it is important for them to 
take an active part in the success 
of the Company and to share in the 
long‑term value they help to create.
The Board recognises the need to 
provide a safe working environment 
for employees and exhibitors and 
visitors at the Group’s events. Each 
office is responsible for ensuring 
that their business operates in 
compliance with Group policies 
and the relevant local health and 
safety legislation. Employees receive 
regular Health and Safety training. 
Staff from all regions with lead 
responsibility for the operation of 
the Group’s exhibitions on‑site also 
attend regular training courses.
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is 
aware of both the benefits to its 
business of engaging with its various 
constituencies in a socially‑responsible 
manner and the risks of failing to do 
so. As an operator of internationally‑ focused businesses in emerging 
markets, the Company ensures that 
it is culturally sensitive in its dealings 
with the local community and that 
its employment and development 
policies are non‑discriminatory and 
encourage the employment of local 
nationals at all levels in the Company. 
The Company actively supports its 
employees in their support of local 
community projects. Charitable 
donations across the Group totalled 
over £46,000 (2012: £36,000).
In Russia the Group supports a number 
of local charities – particularly those 
involving children’s charities. During 
2013 this has included providing 
direct financial funding as well as 
providing volunteers to assist on 
specific projects and workshops. 
In August, the Novosibirsk office took 
part in a charity campaign called 
‘Getting Children from Orphanages 
Ready for School’. Staff from the 
local office collected stationery and 
other items to prepare children from 
the local orphanage for school, as 
well as raising money to take a child 
from the orphanage to the shops in 
order to fully kit them out for school.
In St Petersburg, exhibitions organised 
by the local office featured the ‘+1 Good 
Deed’ charity programme. This allowed 
a range of charitable organisations 
to be present at the exhibitions for 
volunteers to collect donations, sell 
gifts and speak about their work.
In the UK, the London office held 
charity auctions and sponsored 
activities, matching funds raised 
by employee contributions. The 
office continued its work with Hope 
for Children, raising more money 
for Namuwongo during the year. 
Namuwongo is a slum on the edge 
of Kampala, Uganda, which has been 
adopted by the UK exhibitions industry  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

to provide support and to work with 
the community to help them achieve 
their long‑ term objectives. During 
the year ITE employees also had the 
opportunity to visit Namuwongo 
to see how the money raised was 
benefiting the local community.
The Group is looking to increase 
further the number of its offices which 
take part in charitable activities.
Ethics and human rights issues
Integrity is core to the Group’s values 
which it actively promotes in its 
dealings with employees, shareholders, 
customers and suppliers and with the 
authorities of the countries in which 
it operates. The Group recognises 
that reputation is a valuable and 
fragile asset gained over a substantial 
period of time and is committed to 
good practice in respect of human 
rights. The leadership position of the 
Group’s exhibitions and the long‑term 
growth of its core shows is a testament 
to the success of its practices.
All ITE staff are required to comply 
with the laws and regulations of the 
country in which the Group operates. 
The Group promotes high ethical 
standards in carrying out its business 
activities and has clear guidelines 
for dealing with gifts, hospitality, 
corruption, fraud and the use of 
inside information. These are available 
to all staff on the Group intranet. 
These standards are designed to 
avoid causing or contributing to 
adverse human rights impacts.
The UK Bribery Act places obligations 
on the Group and senior management. 
Key management are required to 
complete an e‑learning course, 
tailored to the requirements of 
the business and designed to train 
and test the individuals on the UK 
Bribery Act. The course covers the 
requirements of the UK Bribery Act 
along with example scenarios and 
implications of Act breaches. 
The Group is a member of UFI (the 
Worldwide Exhibition Organisers 
Association) and through this, 
the attendance figures at our key 
exhibitions are audited by independent 
services. This helps to provide 
assurance to our exhibitors and visitors 
as to the standard of our exhibitions.
The Group aims to provide high 
quality of service at all its events in 
all locations. The Group operates to a 
strict minimum quality level to ensure 
events are provided to exhibitors and 
visitors at international standards, 
irrespective of where they are held.
The Group ensures that all advertising 
and public communications avoid

excellent results. The remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
The Group places great importance in the development of its staff to support the business in meeting its objectives. This 
is reflected in the training initiatives in place for staff, both internally and externally. The Group keeps employees informed 
on matters affecting them and on matters affecting the Group’s performance through regular newsletters and through 
meetings, both formal and informal. Employees are able and are encouraged to move around the Group in order to 
experience the business environment in other offices. The Group actively encourages the participation of employees 
in activities of offices other than their own. The Group distributes long‑term incentives widely to staff in all offices. 
At 30 September 2013 approximately 60% of staff held long‑term incentives in some form. As a result, the Group’s

UK c orporate Governance c ode compliance
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and supports the principles laid down in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 (‘the Code’). This statement

The Board considers that the Company has been in compliance with all the principles and provisions of the Code

t he Board
The Board of Directors (‘the Board’) currently has eight members, comprising the Non‑executive Chairman, Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director, an additional Executive Director, and four independent Non‑executive Directors.
All the Directors bring strong judgement to the Board’s deliberations. The Board is of sufficient size and diversity that the 
balance of skills and experience is considered to be appropriate for the requirements of the business. 
The Non‑executive Directors are all independent of management and free from any business or other relationship, including 
those relationships and circumstances referred to in provision B.1.1 of the Code that could materially interfere with the exercise 
of independent and objective judgement. The Company considers that the Chairman was independent on appointment. 
The Non‑executive Directors were all appointed for an initial three‑year term and (in common with the Executive Directors) 
are subject to re‑election each year by shareholders at the AGM, and, as set out in the Code, the Board continuing to be 
satisfied that they remain independent,.

The different roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged. A responsibility statement for each of those 
roles has been agreed and adopted by the Board.

incentive schemes. At all times at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, has comprised independent Non‑executive 
Directors. At the AGM on 30 January 2014 all the Directors will once again offer themselves for re‑election in compliance 
with Code provision B.7.1., with the exception of Michael Hartley as noted above.
r ole of the Board
The Board has overall responsibility to shareholders for the proper management of the Company. It met seven times during 
the financial year and held its July Board meeting at its office in Moscow. It has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it 
for decision making, including responsibility for the overall management and performance of the Group and the approval 
of its long‑ term objectives and commercial strategy, approval of annual and interim results, annual budgets, material 
acquisitions and disposals, material agreements and major capital commitments, approval of treasury policies, and 
assessment of its going concern position.
Board members receive appropriate documentation in advance of each Board or Committee meeting which normally 
includes a detailed report on current trading and full papers on matters where the Board will be required to make 
a decision or give approval. These are delivered through an electronic platform, improving the efficiency of its 
communications and reducing paper usage.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review, at least annually, by the Board of medium‑term plans and 
the annual budget. Management accounts are circulated to the Board on a monthly basis and business performance and 
any significant variances to budget are formally reviewed at scheduled Board meetings. All major investment decisions

of Directors in respect of claims arising in the performance of their duties. 
Board effectiveness review
During 2013 the Board commissioned a Board effectiveness review (the Review) which was conducted by an external, 
independent facilitator, Sharon Constancon of Genius Methods Limited. Genius Methods has no other connection with 
the Company or any member of the Board. 
The Review took place between April and September 2013 and included the completion of a detailed questionnaire, a 
series of structured interviews with each of the Directors and the Company Secretary, and the observation of one Board 
and one Committee meeting. Feedback from the Review was provided in the form of a report which was presented by 
Genius Methods to the September Board meeting, which then discussed the findings and the recommendations proposed 
by Genius Methods. 
The Review concluded that the Board was effective with a strong and professional Chairman, a strong cadre of 
Non‑executive Directors with a broad range of experience and expertise, and a Chief Executive who takes a positive 
and pro‑active approach to supporting the Board.
A number of suggestions for improvement were made by Genius Methods which were discussed, and it was agreed 
that the following areas should be focused on over the next twelve months to improve the Board’s effectiveness further:
 – The recruitment of an additional Non‑executive Director to the Board. 
 – Increasing the amount of time spent by the Board each year on developing the Group’s strategy.
 – Reviewing the composition and remit of the Board and its Committees to ensure greater efficiency and optimal 
performance.
 – Progressing the Group’s succession planning agenda and talent management process.
 – Ensuring that management information submitted to the Board and its Committees continue to be fit for purpose. 
independent professional advice
The Board has approved a procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, 
if required. No such advice was sought by any Director during the year. In addition, the Directors have direct access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
t raining and development
An induction programme is arranged for newly‑appointed Directors which include presentations on the business, current 
strategy and shareholder expectations. Guidance is also given on the duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a Director of 
a listed company and key Board policies and procedures. Business familiarisation involves Directors visiting exhibitions in 
markets in which the Group operates to gain a greater understanding of the Group’s activities and to meet senior managers 
throughout the business. 
Every Director has access to training as required and is encouraged to continue his or her own professional development 
through attendance at seminars and briefings.
c onflicts of interest 
The Company’s Articles of Association, in line with the Companies Act 2006, allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts 
of interest that may arise and impose limits or conditions, as appropriate. The Company has established a procedure whereby 
any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is agreed without the conflicted Directors 
voting or without their votes being counted. In making such a decision, as always, the Directors must act in a way they 
consider in good faith will be most likely to promote the success of the Company. No request to authorise an actual or 
potential conflict of interest was made during the year.
Board c ommittees 
There are a number of standing Committees of the Board to which various matters are delegated. They all have formal 
terms of reference approved by the Board which are available on the Group’s website (www.ite‑exhibitions.com).

Governance
directors’ res Po NsiB iLities state MeNt
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standards require that Directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
r esponsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
 – the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 – each of the Directors considers that the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

The Committee met four times during the year. By invitation, all meetings were attended by the Group Finance Director, 
the Group Chairman and our external auditor Deloitte LLP and for certain meetings or parts of meetings, the Group Financial 
Controller, and the Group’s Head of Internal Control. Other relevant people from the business were also invited to attend certain 
meetings or parts of meetings to provide a deeper level of insight into certain key issues and developments. To maximise 
effectiveness, meetings of the Committee generally take place just prior to a Company Board meeting. The Chairman of the 
Committee reports to the Board, as part of a separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee and matters of particular 
relevance to the Board in the conduct of their work.
Separately, the Chairman of the Committee has also held meetings with:
 – the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the external auditor to review the progress with matters 
raised in the management letter and separately the potential impact of technical accounting updates; 
 – the external auditor, and; 
 – the Group’s Head of Internal Control.
Following publication of the revised version of the Code, which applies to financial years commencing on or after 1 October 
2012, the Board requested that the Committee advise whether it believes the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee’s terms of reference have been amended to reflect this and can be found on our website at  
www.ite‑exhibitions.com/corporate‑governance.aspx.
Each of the four Committee meetings held during the year has a particular specific focus, in order as follows: the 
management letter from the external auditor following the prior year’s audit; the review of the external auditor’s interim 
review work and the interim financial statements; the external audit plan; the results of the external audit and review of the 
annual financial statements and associated investor presentations. In addition, every meeting reviews summaries of the 
latest internal audit reports, the update of the risk assessment, and any correspondence received by the Board which 
falls within the Committee’s remit.

Governance
In assessing the appropriateness of the financial statements the Committee concentrated on the following significant audit 
risks, which were agreed with Deloitte in advance of the audit and were the focus of their audit and on which the Committee 
received written reports from management and Deloitte as part of the audit process: 
 – a cquisition accounting  
As there is exercise of judgement involved in identifying and valuing the consideration and the assets acquired in a 
business combination. The Committee assesses the processes used in the identification and valuation of acquired assets 
and liabilities including the reasonableness of any assumptions used. This year, for example, amongst other things, the 
Committee considered whether there was appropriate consistency between the assumptions made about terminal 
values and amortisation lives. Whilst remaining satisfied with the previous assumptions used, the Committee identified 
refinements to the methodology to be adopted in future. The Committee also assesses the final split of consideration 
between goodwill and identified intangible assets.
 – impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  
Which involves measuring the carrying value of goodwill against the discounted cashflows of each of the cash generating 
units (CGU). Each regional office is considered to be a CGU. There are a number of judgements to consider including 
the discount rates used, the growth rates applied and the expected life of the shows. Discount rates are selected to reflect 
the risk adjusted cost of capital for the respective territory. Growth rates and the respective life of the shows reflect 
management’s view of the long‑term forecast rates of growth and longevity for the shows in the respective territory. 
 – r ecoverability of venue advances and loans  
One of the key factors of success in the exhibition business is maintaining strong relationships with suitable venues. 
As part of these relationships, the Group often makes loans or advances to venues. Assessing the future recoverability 
of the venue loans and advances involves judgement. This is exercised by considering the track record of recoveries, 
together with assessment of economic conditions and show performance in the relevant territory. 
 – t he appropriate recognition of revenue  
Is critical to the financial statements. The Committee believes that the risk is focused on the validity and cut‑off of 
revenue. All revenue is recognised when the service has been delivered. With respect to exhibitions and conferences 
the Group usually invoices its customers in advance of the show and so defers the revenue until the date the event has 
completed. Floor plan audits
1
 are seen as central to the controls process for the accurate recognition of revenue and 
confirming that floor plan audits are being performed on a timely and robust basis forms a critical part of internal 
audit testing of procedures during the year on a rolling basis to each operating unit.
internal control
In 2008 a formal process of internal audit was implemented which involved appointing a Head of Internal Control, identifying 
a limited scope audit of minimum acceptable control practices and appointed KPMG LLP to carry out the audits on a rolling 
basis amongst certain operating units. The reports are made available in summary form to the Committee and in detail form 
to the Group Finance Director, relevant operating management and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Group’s Head 
of Internal Control assists with training and monitors correction to any identified issues. Each year, the Committee reviews 
the proposed internal audit programmes, which have a greater focus on higher risk units. There has been a considerable 
improvement over the past periods. In 2012 the audit scope was extended to include elements of the Group’s programme 
to ensure its compliance with the UK Bribery Act. This year the audit scope was reviewed by the Committee, and following 
liaison with Deloitte, was extended to include tests of some additional internal control processes.
The effectiveness of the internal control process is assessed annually on an informal basis involving discussions with local 
management teams and others involved in the process. The Committee plans to improve the documentation of its review 
and formalise this effectiveness assessment process in the coming year. 
r isk Management
The Group’s risk assessment process and the way in which significant risks are managed is a key area of focus for the 
Committee. Its work is primarily driven by the Group’s assessment of its principal risks and uncertainties as set out on page 38. 
These risks and uncertainties are the output of a full review, performed annually, involving a ‘top down’ review by the Executive 
Directors and a ‘bottom up’ risk assessment performed by each operating unit management team considering the risks facing 
their business unit. As part of this annual process, the plans to mitigate the identified risks are reviewed. The Committee reviews 
these assessments and makes adjustments to the overall risk plan as appropriate.
The Committee receives reports from the Group Finance Director at each meeting on perceived changes to the risks 
identified and approves any changes to the risk plan. 
Based on the suggestions of the external review of Board effectiveness (outlined on page 48, at the Board meeting in 
September 2013, it was decided to create a new Risk Management Committee of the Board, to be chaired by the Group 
Finance Director.

external audit
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit 
cycle. A detailed audit plan is received from Deloitte, which sets out the key risks identified. For the 2013 financial year, the 
primary risks were in relation to acquisition accounting, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, revenue recognition 
and recoverability of venue advances. 
Deloitte provided the Committee with their views on these issues at the Committee meeting held to consider the financial 
statements. In addition they undertook to provide the Committee with details of any identified matters greater than 
£40,000 and any other adjustments that were qualitatively significant which management had not corrected on the 
basis that the matters were not, individually or in aggregate, material. 
The effectiveness of the external audit process is currently assessed by the Committee based on discussions with those 
involved in the process. Private meetings were held with Deloitte at both of the Audit Committee meetings which considered 
the financial statements (in May and November) to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback from the 
Committee and the auditor without management being present. Matters discussed were the preparedness and efficiency 
of management with respect to the audit, the strengths and any perceived weaknesses of the financial management team, 
confirmation that no restriction on scope had been placed on them by management and how they had exercised professional 
judgement. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external audit partner outside the formal committee process 
through the year.
The Committee plans to complete a formal review of the effectiveness of the external audit process in January 2014. 
a ppointment and independence
The Committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor, including the rotation of the audit partner each 
year and also assesses their independence on an ongoing basis. The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every five years. The current audit partner was appointed this year. He was selected from 
a shortlist of three suitable and available partner candidates provided by Deloitte LLP and based on interviews conducted 
separately by the Group Finance Director and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Committee reviewed and 
endorsed their recommendation.
Deloitte LLP were first appointed by the Company in 2002. Whilst the Group has not formally tendered the audit since 
then, the Committee has undertaken a review of the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process each year. When 
considering the suitability of the external auditor, the Committee takes account of the ability of the auditor to deliver an 
audit across the geographies in which the Group operates. In addition, considerable importance is placed on the findings 
set out in the Public Report on the most recent inspections of Deloitte carried out by the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Audit Quality Review team and their reports on all other auditors in its sample. The Committee notes the consistently good 
assessment of Deloitte against its peers. When considering suitable external auditors the Committee also takes account of 
the ability of the auditor to add value through observations from the audit process and their interactions with management. 
The Committee is cognisant of its responsibility under the revised Code to tender the audit every ten years and notes 
that this period can be extended to coincide with the period ending the current engagement partner’s rotation if longer. 
The Committee plans to tender the audit in 2017 to take effect for year ending 30 September 2018, after the five‑ year 
rotation period of the current external audit partner, although this decision shall be reviewed annually. For year ending 
30 September 2014, the Committee has provided to the Board its recommendation to the shareholders on the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s auditors.
During the year, Deloitte LLP and member firms of Deloitte LLP charged the Group £339,000 (2012: £349,000) for audit 
and audit related services.
Non‑audit services
To safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor from becoming compromised, the Committee 
has a formal policy governing the engagement of the external auditor to provide non‑audit services. No material changes 
have been made to this policy during the year. In addition, non‑audit fees on any specific project cannot exceed £50,000 
without the express approval of the Chair of the Committee, who must report to the Committee on the use of this 
delegated authority at the next committee meeting. 
Our policy ensures that the Committee challenges the decision to use Deloitte LLP where suitable, practical and 
reasonably‑priced alternatives exist. In addition, the Committee considers the overall level of non‑audit fees and would 
not expect these fees to be in aggregate greater than the audit fee. Full details of the split between audit and non‑audit 
fees can be found in note 6 on page 93.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

impact of c ompetition c ommission report
The Committee notes the latest guidance from the Financial Reporting Council following the report from the Competition 
Commission issued on 15 October 2013. Amongst other things this requires the Audit Committee to: 
 – assume sole responsibility for audit matters such as agreeing audit scope and audit fees, advising the Board on the 
reappointment of external auditors and initiating tenders;
 – initiate a new advisory vote on the Audit Committee report;
 – tender the external audit at least once every ten years;
 – note the increased frequency of reviews by the Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality Review team and the public 
disclosure of the grade awarded following the review; and
 – ensure compliance with the prohibition of ‘Big Four only’ clauses in loan documentation. 
The Committee has reviewed the guidance and will implement these recommendations as required for the 2014 financial year.

The Nomination Committee comprises Neil England, Michael Hartley, Linda Jensen and Stephen Puckett and is chaired 
by Marco Sodi.
It meets as required and is responsible for considering and recommending to the Board suitable candidates for appointment 
as Executive and Non‑executive Directors. There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board which involves the Nomination Committee interviewing candidates proposed by either existing Board 
members or external search consultants. Careful consideration is given to ensure appointees have sufficient time available to 
devote to the role and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is maintained. When dealing with 
the appointment of a successor to the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director will chair the Committee instead of the 
Chairman. When the Committee has found a suitable candidate, the Chairman of the Committee will make a proposal to the 
whole Board and the appointment is the responsibility of the whole Board following recommendation from the Committee.
diversity
ITE has adopted a Board Diversity Policy which recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board, and sees 
increasing diversity at Board level as an important element in maintaining a competitive advantage. A truly diverse Board in 
its broadest sense will include and make good use of differences in the skills, regional and industry experience, background, 
race, gender and other qualities of Directors. These differences will be considered in determining the optimum composition 
of the Board and when possible should be balanced appropriately. All Board appointments are made on merit, in the 
context of the skills and experience the Board as a whole requires to be effective.
The Committee met three times during the year and was active in the appointment of ITE’s new Non‑executive Director, 
Stephen Puckett. The selection process began with the agreement of a specification for the role by the Committee and 
the subsequent appointment of external search consultants, Heidrick & Struggles, who have no other connection with the 
Company, to carry out a search and review of prospective candidates. After completion of a rigorous interview process, 
the Committee’s recommendation that Stephen Puckett be appointed was passed unanimously by the Board, with 
Stephen joining the Company as a Non‑executive Director on 1 July 2013.
Other activities during the year included:
 – reviewing the succession planning and talent mapping processes for senior management; and
 – reviewing the balance of skills and experience on the Board and considering if any changes were necessary.

I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013, which has been 
prepared by the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) and approved by the Board.
The Group delivered a strong set of results in 2013. Revenues were £192.3 million (2012: £172.3 million) and yielded headline 
profits before tax of £59.4 million (2012: £53.0 million) and headline diluted earnings per share of 19.3p (2012: 16.9p). 
Executive reward has continued to be an area of focus for shareholders and the wider public over the past year and the 
Committee is aware of the sensitivities regarding Executive pay at a time of continued economic challenge and uncertainty. 
We fully support the new reporting regulations introduced by the Government earlier this year and the objective of further 
increasing the transparency of Executive remuneration arrangements. This year’s report is therefore presented in line 
with The Large and Medium‑sized Companies and Group’s (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and 
is divided into two new sections. The first is the Policy Report which outlines the Group’s remuneration policy, setting 
out components of pay, how they are linked to business strategy, and the framework for assessing performance for 
the Executive Directors. The second section is the Annual Report on Remuneration which reviews how the policy was 
implemented in 2013 and includes a table showing a single figure of total remuneration for Executive Directors. It also 
summarises how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2014. Mindful of the increasing length of remuneration 
reports, we have aimed here to be concise without compromising on transparency. I hope these changes help make the 
Remuneration Report clearer and easier to understand and would welcome any feedback or comments.
During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration arrangements in place at ITE Group to ensure they remain 
aligned with our business strategy, help reinforce the Group’s continued success and provide strong alignment with the 
delivery of value to shareholders. As part of its review, the Committee identified some modifications for future long‑term 
incentive cycles which it believes will bring arrangements more into line with developments in market practice since the 
plans were approved by shareholders in 2004, and will strengthen alignment with shareholders. 
Following our review and consultation with major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, the Board will be 
seeking shareholder approval at the 2014 Annual General Meeting for a new 2014 Performance Share Plan to replace the 
existing ITE 2004 Performance Share Plan which expires on 26 February 2014. The key proposals are:
 – the introduction of an element on relative TSR for future PSP awards granted to the CEO, in addition to headline diluted 
earnings per share. These performance conditions will run concurrently, such that relative TSR without EPS growth is 
not rewarded;
 – the PSP will provide for annual awards of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances and up to 200% of salary 
in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment); and
 – the normal annual PSP grant size will be set at 150% of salary for the CEO (after consideration of the headline diluted 
EPS and relative TSR performance conditions) and at up to 100% of salary for other participants.
Additionally, to further encourage share ownership and strengthen alignment with shareholders, the Committee increased 
the share ownership guideline for the CEO from 100% to 150% of salary with immediate effect. Further details of these 
changes are set out in the Policy Report on page 57 and in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 64.
The Committee was pleased that the majority of shareholders consulted were supportive of these proposals which it believes 
will assist the Group in continuing to motivate and retain the talent it needs to deliver long‑term success. Following feedback 
from major shareholders, the Committee toughened the three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS performance 
requirements applying to 2014 PSP awards to be equivalent to 7% p.a. to 12% p.a. which it considers to be appropriately 
stretching over the three‑year performance period. Further details are provided on pages 67 and 68.
Resolutions to approve the Policy Report (subject to a binding vote) and the Annual Report on Remuneration (subject to an 
advisory vote) will be put to shareholders at the AGM.

In line with The Large and Medium‑sized Companies and Group’s (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
the following parts of the Annual Report on Remuneration Report are audited: the single total figure of remuneration for 
each Director, including annual bonus and performance share plan outcomes for the financial year ending 30 September 
2013; scheme interests awarded during the year; pension entitlements; payments to past Directors and payments for loss of 
office; and, Directors’ shareholdings and share interests. All other parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report are unaudited.
Policy r eport 
This section provides ITE’s remuneration policy for Directors which will apply from 1 October 2014, subject to approval 
at the 2014 AGM. The Group’s principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that the compensation offered is appropriate 
to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Group’s strategy 
and grow the business, having regard to the prevailing economic conditions and competition for such people in the 
markets in which the Group operates. 
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors:
a) the need to align the interests of the Executive with those of the shareholders;
b) the performance of the individual Executive and of the Group as a whole; 
c) the remuneration practice in the markets in which the Executive is principally based; and,
d) the remuneration packages offered to Executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Group.
s ummary of ite ’s remuneration policy applying from 1 o ctober 2014
The elements of the proposed remuneration policy for Directors are set out below. As outlined earlier, the Group is also 
proposing the introduction of a new Performance Share Plan to replace the 2004 Performance Share Plan which expires 
on 26 February 2014, and increasing the minimum shareholding guideline for the CEO. There are no other changes to 
the remuneration policy compared to 2013.

performance condition. 
Awards of nominal‑cost 
(or nil‑cost) options may 
be granted annually as 
a percentage of base 
salary. Vesting is based 
on performance measured 
over three years. The 
performance period 
normally starts on the 
beginning of the financial 
year in which the date 
of grant falls.
Dividends accrue on PSP 
awards and are paid on 
those shares which vest.
Award levels and 
performance conditions 
are reviewed before each 
award cycle to ensure they 
remain appropriate.
Payments made under 
the PSP are subject to 
clawback, for the later

of vesting or completion 
of the next audit of the 
Group’s accounts, in 
the event of a fraud or

of results being identified 
in relation to the years in 
which the PSP is earned. 
Award opportunities 
are up to 150% of base 
salary for the CEO 
(after consideration of 
the TSR performance 
condition) and up to 100% 
of base salary for other 
Executive Directors. 
Awards of up to 200% 
of base salary may be 
provided in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g.

20% of maximum vests 
for Threshold performance 
for the CEO (30% of 
maximum for other 
participants), rising on 
a straight line basis to 
full vesting for stretch

Awards to Executive 
Directors are subject to 
three‑ year cumulative 
headline diluted EPS 
performance. 
Awards to the CEO are 
subject to an additional 
relative TSR performance 
condition which runs 
concurrently, such that 
relative TSR without EPS 
growth is not rewarded. 
The TSR comparator 
group is normally the

uplift if ITE’s TSR is 
median or below, rising 
on a straight line basis 
to a maximum uplift of 
50% if ITE’s TSR is upper

In addition, for there to 
be any vesting on TSR, 
the Committee needs 
to satisfy itself that the 
recorded TSR outcome 
is a fair reflection of 
underlying business 
performance over the

Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
The measures used under the annual bonus plan are selected annually to reflect the Group’s key strategic priorities for 
the year and reinforce financial performance and achievement of annual objectives as well as individual performance. 
Financial measures include, but may not be limited to, headline profit before tax to reinforce achievement of sustainable 
profit growth.
The Committee considers that headline diluted EPS is the most appropriate measure of long‑term performance of the 
Group as it is well‑aligned with shareholder interests and provides good line‑of‑sight. The scheme is simple and is well 
understood by participants. The additional relative TSR performance condition further reinforces alignment with 
shareholder interests and helps to provide a balanced and progressive relationship between pay and performance.
Performance targets are set at such a level as to be stretching and achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities 
and economic environment. The annual bonus target is based on the annual budget approved by the Board. Prior to the start 
of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance zone (Threshold to Stretch) around the target, which it 
considers provides an appropriate degree of ‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform. 
The Committee reviews the performance targets applying to the PSP annually, prior to the start of the performance period, 
taking into account a number of internal and external reference points to help ensure they are appropriately stretching. 
Three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS performance targets are calculated as follows:
 – adjust the headline diluted earnings per share figure achieved in the base year to remove the biennial effect;
 – apply a compound increase to establish a ‘Threshold’ target for each of the three years;
 – apply a compound increase to establish a ‘Stretch’ target for each of the three years; and,
 – aggregate the performance target figures for each year to produce the cumulative headline diluted earnings per share 
performance targets for Threshold vesting and for Stretch.
Ahead of the start of each new PSP cycle, the Committee will reconfirm the TSR comparator group to ensure it remains 
relevant and robust.
differences in remuneration policy operated for other employees 
ITE’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group. All employees are eligible to participate in an annual 
bonus scheme with similar metrics to those used for the Executive Directors. Opportunities and specific performance 
conditions vary by organisational level with business area‑specific metrics incorporated where appropriate.
Senior managers are eligible to participate in the PSP. Performance conditions are consistent for all these participants, while 
award opportunities may vary by organisational level but are typically limited to 100% of base salary. Other employees are 
eligible for consideration of awards of share options to further support alignment with shareholder interests (see page 112 
in the notes to the consolidated accounts for more information on all‑employee share option plans).

s hareholding guidelines
The Committee recognises the importance of aligning the interests of Executives with shareholders through the building 
up of a significant shareholding in the Group. Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of 
the after‑tax gain made on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a minimum shareholding of a 
value equivalent to at least 100% of annual base salary. During the year, the Group strengthened the shareholding guideline 
for the CEO to a minimum holding equivalent of 150% of base salary. Details of the current personal shareholdings are 
provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 64.
r emuneration policy for new directors 
When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, including by way of internal promotion, the Committee may make use 
of all the existing components of remuneration as follows:
Component Approach Maximum value
Base salary Determined in line with the stated policy, and taking 
into account their previous salary. Initial salaries 
may be set below market and consideration given to 
phasing any increases over two or three years subject 
to development in the role.
Not applicable.
Benefits In line with the stated policy.
Pension In line with the stated policy.
a nnual bonus In line with stated policy, with the relevant maximum 
pro‑rated to reflect the proportion of the year served. 
100% of base salary.
2014 Ps P In line with the stated policy. 150% of base salary 
(200% in exceptional circumstances).
In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant 
factors (including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited) to ensure 
that arrangements are in the best interests of both ITE and its shareholders. The Committee may consider it appropriate to 
grant an award under a structure not included in the policy, for example to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer, and will exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary. In doing 
so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including the expected value of all outstanding equity awards using a 
Black‑Scholes, or equivalent valuation and, where applicable, taking into account toughness of performance conditions 
attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met. 
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Group will honour any contractual 
commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director. 
In cases of appointing a new Non‑executive Director, the approach will be consistent with the policy. 
s ervice contracts and exit payments policy
Non‑executive Directors are engaged on the basis of a letter of appointment. In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, all Directors are subject to re‑election annually at the AGM. The Chairman has a six ‑ month notice period and the 
Non‑executive Directors have a one ‑ month notice period. The Non‑executive Director Letters of Appointment are available 
to view at the Group’s registered office and the effective dates of their Letters of Appointment are as follows:

Governance
Executive Director service contracts have no fixed term and have a notice period of 12 months from either the Executive 
or the Group for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones, and a notice period of 6 months from either the Executive or the Group for 
Edward Strachan. Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Group’s registered office. The dates 
of the Executive Director service contracts and the relevant notice period are as follows:

which currently runs from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 and may be extended for a further period or periods by mutual agreement.
The Committee’s policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre‑established contractual arrangements and the 
rules of the relevant incentive plans. In doing so, the Committee’s objective is to avoid rewarding poor performance. 
Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate their loss. 
Termination payments are limited to base salary and benefits during the notice period. If an Executive Director’s contract 
is terminated, they are eligible for a pro‑rated annual bonus over the period to the date of cessation of employment, 
subject to performance. 
In addition to the contractual provisions regarding payment on termination set out above, the Group’s incentive plans and 
share schemes contain provisions for termination of employment.

 An individual would

considered by the Committee to be retirement, or any other reason as the Committee decides. Bad leaver provisions apply 
under other circumstances.
2 Under the 2004 PSP which expires in February 2014, awards normally lapse on leaving unless the awardholder is considered a good leaver. Upon 
death of an awardholder, awards would normally vest in full at that time. If an individual retires as determined by the Committee, outstanding PSP 
awards would normally continue and be pro‑rated for performance over the full period. The Committee can instead determine that the award will 
vest at the time of cessation, to the extent that performance targets are achieved and taking into account the length of the period served. Awards 
to other good leavers will normally vest to the extent that performance targets are achieved on the date of cessation. On a change‑of‑control, 
outstanding awards will normally vest to the extent that performance targets are achieved and taking into account the period served to the 
date of change‑of‑control.
external appointments 
The Executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board and provided only that 
such appointments do not prejudice the individual’s ability to fulfil their duties at the Group. Whether any related fees are 
retained by the individual or remitted to the Group will be considered on a case‑by‑case basis.

c onsideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
When reviewing and setting Executive remuneration, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment 
conditions of all employees of the Group. The Group‑wide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing 
the salaries of the Executive Directors. Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding 
Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly. 
c onsideration of shareholder views
It is the Committee’s policy to consult with major shareholders prior to any changes to its Executive Director remuneration 
structure. During the year, the Group consulted with major shareholders holding approximately 60% of the Group’s issued 
share capital and shareholder representative bodies, the ABI and ISS on the proposed introduction of a new long‑term 
incentive plan to replace the Performance Share Plan which expires on 26 February 2014. The Committee was pleased that  
the majority of investors were supportive of the proposed introduction of an element on relative TSR (in addition to headline 
diluted EPS) for future awards to the CEO, the concurrent nature of these two performance conditions such that relative 
TSR without EPS growth will not be rewarded, an opportunity of 150% of salary for the CEO (after consideration of the TSR 
performance condition) and an increase in the CEO’s minimum shareholding guideline from 100% to 150% of base salary.
Following feedback from major shareholders, the Committee increased the three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS 
performance requirement applying to 2014 PSP awards, as described in the Notice of Meeting. Following discussions with major 
shareholders on the Group’s approach for 2013 PSP awards, the Committee intends to remove the partial adjustment for €:£ 
exchange rate movements for future awards to simplify the arrangements and aid transparency. Therefore the achievement of 
the three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS requirements for 2014 (and future) awards will be assessed based on actual 
results over the three financial years of the performance period, in line with the policy. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Governance
a nnual r eport on r emuneration
t he r emuneration c ommittee (‘the c ommittee’)
The members of the Committee are the Group’s Non‑executive Directors, Neil England (Chairman), Michael Hartley, 
Linda Jensen, Marco Sodi and Stephen Puckett, following his appointment to the Board on 1 July 2013.
The Committee met four times during the year. Further details of attendance of Non‑executive Directors at Remuneration 
Committee meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 47. The following individuals attended 
meetings by invitation and provided material advice to the Committee to enable it to make informed decisions:
 – Russell Taylor, Chief Executive; and
 – Jane Stables, Human Resources Director.
No individual was present when their own remuneration was being discussed. The Remuneration Committee’s Terms 
of Reference are available on the Group’s website.
The Committee is responsible for:
 – recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman (who absents 
himself from discussions regarding his own remuneration), Executive Directors and key members of senior management; 
 – measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the Executive Directors’ and key managers’ total 
remuneration on behalf of the whole Board;
 – determining the structure and quantum of short‑term remuneration; and,
 – granting awards under long‑term incentive plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option Schemes. 
The main issues discussed and/or approved during the financial year under review included:
 – approval of the prior year Directors’ Remuneration Report, review of shareholder comments and AGM voting on the report;
 – annual review of the Executive Directors’ salaries or fee arrangements and benefits;
 – review of the Executive Directors’ performance against the targets set under the 2013 annual bonus scheme;
 – review of the design and targets for the 2014 annual bonus scheme including personal objectives;
 – review and approval of awards made during the year under the Performance Share Plan, including consideration of the 
performance targets to be applied for awards granted in January 2013;
 – approval of the vesting level for Performance Share Plan awards vesting on performance to 30 September 2013; 
 – review of the key design features for the renewal of the Group’s long‑term incentive plan, which is to be put to shareholders 
for approval at the AGM in January 2014; and
 – consultation with shareholders on the new 2014 Performance Share Plan.
advisers
Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) were appointed by the Committee as its independent remuneration adviser following a 
competitive selection process in July 2012 and was retained during the year. The Committee evaluates the support provided  
by its advisers annually and is comfortable that Kepler provides independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does 
not have any connections with ITE that may impair their independence. Kepler is a founding member and signatory to the 
Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
Other than advice to the Committee, no other services were provided by Kepler to the Group. The fees paid to Kepler for  
work carried out in 2013 for the Remuneration Committee totalled £29,330 and were based on time and materials.

3. Value of long‑term incentive awards which vested on performance to 30 September (or may vest shortly thereafter) of the relevant year. This 
includes the estimated value at vesting of January 2011 PSP grants and 2009 Long Term PSP grants, details of which can be found below. For the 
comparison year, 100% of the February 2010 PSP grant vested on performance to 30 September 2012 and the share price at vesting on 11 February 
2013 was 268.0p. Note that PSP gains reported in previous remuneration reports has been based on the gain on exercise rather than vesting. 2013 
CEO total remuneration is above the maximum shown in the performance scenarios due to the impact of share price appreciation between grant 
and vesting.

vesting of Long‑ t erm Ps P awards granted in June 2009
To help reinforce delivery of the five‑year business plan, Executive Directors were granted PSP awards in June 2009, vesting 
50% on headline diluted EPS targets for the financial year ending 30 September 2013 and 50% on TSR against the constituents 
of the FTSE All‑Share Media index from 1 June 2009 to 31 December 2013. Awards will vest on 31 December 2013.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2013, ITE’s headline diluted EPS of 19.3p exceeded the Stretch requirement of 17p 
which warranted 100% vesting of this element. The performance period for the TSR element ends on 31 December 2013. Over 
the performance period from 30 June 2009 to 30 September 2013, ITE’s TSR was tracking above upper quartile relative to its 
comparator group, warranting full vesting of this element at this time. Estimated vesting of 2009 PSP awards for each of the 
Executive Directors is summarised in the table below. This will be reported in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration 
based on TSR performance over the period to vesting on 31 December 2013 and the share price on date of vesting. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

executive director base salaries/fees
During the year, Russell Taylor, the Chief Executive, received £425,000 in salary. With effect from 1 October 2013, he was 
awarded an increase to £440,000 p.a., equivalent to an annualised increase of 3.5%. His next salary review date will be 
1 October 2014.
During the year, Neil Jones, the Finance Director, received £243,000 in salary. With effect from 1 October 2013, he was 
awarded an increase to £250,000 p.a., equivalent to an annualised increase of 2.9%. His next salary review date will be 
1 October 2014.
With effect from 1 April 2013, Edward Strachan receives a fee as a Director of ITE of £42,500 p.a. (2012: £40,000 p.a.). 
Kyzyl Tan receives a consultancy fee of £217,500 p.a. (2012: £212,000) in respect of Edward Strachan’s services. 
Executive Director salary increases were broadly in line with the typical increase across the UK employee population.
Pension and other benefits
The Group makes a contribution equal to 10% of Russell Taylor’s base salary to his personal pension scheme and 
a contribution equal to 5% of Neil Jones’ base salary to his personal pension scheme. 
Benefits are in line with the policy.
a nnual performance bonus
Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan participate in a performance‑related annual bonus scheme, the Executive 
Bonus Plan, designed to reinforce delivery of sustainable profit growth and achievement of strategic objectives. 
2013 bonus framework
For the 2013 financial year, the maximum annual bonus opportunity was 100% of salary for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones 
and 75% of the annual Director’s fee and consultancy fee for Edward Strachan. In each case the annual bonus was based 
80% on financial targets and 20% on personal targets. 
The financial element was based upon the achievement of headline profit before tax. A range for headline profit before tax 
was set of £52 million to £59 million with 0% of potential at £52 million, 50% of potential at £54.7 million, 100% of potential at 
£59 million, and straight line vesting between. The Committee considered these targets to provide an appropriate degree of 
‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform. The table below summarises the financial performance targets set and 
actual performance during the financial year.

Personal objectives for Russell Taylor were set by the Group Chairman, and for Neil Jones and Edward Strachan by the 
Chief Executive. In all cases these were reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee in advance who also 
approved recommendations on the level of achievement against them at the end of the performance period.
Russell Taylor’s personal objectives for the year ended 2012/13 were related to business development in emerging markets 
outside of Russia, strengthening venue partnerships, redesigning the management structure and information management. 
Payout under this element of the bonus was assessed at 68% of the potential award on personal objectives.
Neil Jones’ personal objectives for the same period related to budgetary control, delivery of new accounting system, 
improving the quality of management information, and strategic projects. Payout under this element of the bonus was 
assessed at 80% of the potential award on personal objectives.

Edward Strachan’s personal objectives for the same period were related to security of venues and new launches in certain 
territories. Payout under this element of the bonus was assessed at 75% of the potential award on personal objectives.
After taking account of their personal targets, Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan earned 94%, 96% and 95% 
of their respective potential bonus opportunities.
2014 annual bonus framework
For the financial year commencing 1 October 2013, the Executive Bonus Plan will operate in line with the remuneration policy. 
Bonuses are based 80% on headline profit before tax and 20% on personal objectives. Bonus opportunities remain unchanged. 
The Committee intends to disclose financial performance targets and personal objectives retrospectively in next year’s Annual 
Report on Remuneration, subject to these no longer being considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive.
Long‑term incentives
s cheme interests awarded during the year
The Group has two plans which it operates for the Executive Directors, the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share 
Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors’ Performance Share Plan 2004. Awards can be made to Executives over 
shares worth up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group 
employees. 
Awards granted on 10 January 2013 are subject to cumulative headline diluted EPS for the three financial years ending

The performance conditions were chosen by the Committee to incentivise management to deliver sustained growth in 
headline diluted EPS performance over the next three financial years. Actual results are adjusted to reflect 50% of the 
impact of € : £ exchange rate movements from the base year average to help strengthen the incentive effect of the PSP 
by reducing the sensitivity of results to external uncontrollable factors during the performance period. 
In addition, vested awards will be subject to clawback for the later of one year following date of vest or completion of the 
next audit of the Group’s accounts in the event of a fraud or material misstatement of results being identified in relation 
to the years in which the PSP is earned.

2014 Ps P framework
Awards are anticipated to be granted in January 2014 under the new PSP, for which shareholder approval will be sought 
at the 2014 AGM as detailed in the policy. It is proposed that awards will be assessed against cumulative headline diluted 
EPS for Executive Directors, and against an additional relative TSR performance condition for the CEO. Both headline 
diluted EPS and TSR performance conditions will be measured over the three financial years ending on 30 September 2016. 
The proposed cumulative headline diluted EPS performance target is of aggregated fully diluted headline diluted EPS of 
63p (for a 30% award, 20% for the CEO) and 69p (for a 100% award) to be earned over the three financial years ending 
on 30 September 2016. Between 30% and 100% vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Governance
The targets were calculated as follows:
 – Adjusting the fully diluted headline EPS achieved in the financial year September 2013 to remove the biennial effect 
 – Applying a compound increase of 7% (i.e. inflation + 4%) to establish a ‘threshold’ target for each of the three years
 – Applying a compound increase of 12% (i.e. inflation + 9%) to establish a ‘full vesting’ target for each of the three years
 – Aggregating the target figures for each year to produce the aggregated fully diluted headline EPS targets for threshold 
vesting (20% for the CEO and 30% for other participants) and for maximum vesting (100%) 
The proposed arrangements do not include an adjustment for €:£ exchange rate movements from the base year 
average to simplify the arrangements and aid transparency, although discretion remains to make an adjustment 
in exceptional circumstances. 
For the CEO’s award, it is anticipated that the two measures will operate concurrently so that relative TSR without 
EPS growth would not be rewarded, as illustrated in the vesting schedule below:

2014 LTIP vesting schedule
It is proposed that awards will be up to 150% of salary for the CEO if both the three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS 
and relative TSR performance conditions are met in full, and up to 100% of salary to Executive Directors for full achievement 
of the three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS performance condition. The proposed TSR vesting condition is ITE’s 
3‑year TSR rank vs. a comparator group which for January 2014 LTIP awards is proposed to be the FTSE 250. TSR 
performance in the upper quartile of ranked companies will result in a multiple of 1.5 being applied to the CEO’s award. 
TSR performance below median rank will result in a multiple of 1 being applied to the CEO’s award, with the multiple being 
calculated on a straight line basis for TSR performance between median rank and upper quartile performance.
c hairman and Non‑executive d irector fees
During the year the Committee reviewed the Chairman’s fee in light of the time commitment and fees payable at comparator 
companies and increased this from £130,000 to £145,000 p.a., effective from 1 March 2013.
With effect from 1 October 2013, the Non‑executive Directors receive a base fee of £44,000 (2012: £42,500), with an 
additional fee for the Senior Independent Director of £3,000 (2012: £2,500) and for the Audit and Remuneration Committee 
Chairs of £5,500 (2012: £5,000). The Non‑executive Directors’ fees for the year commencing 1 October 2013 are therefore as 
follows: Michael Hartley £52,500, Neil England £49,500, Linda Jensen £44,000 and Stephen Puckett £44,000.

dilution limits
The Group has at all times complied with the dilution limits set out in the rules of its share plans (principally a limit of 
10% in ten years). The Group will also operate within a dilution limit of 5% in any rolling ten‑ year period for discretionary 
schemes. In the ten‑ year period to 30 September 2013, awards made under the Group’s share schemes represented 1.70% 
(2012: 1.78%) of the Group’s issued ordinary share capital. Shares to satisfy awards granted under the Performance Share 
Plan which are normally purchased in the market do not count towards the dilution limits.
directors’ shareholding guidelines and share scheme interests
During the year the Executive Directors were required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after‑tax gain made 
on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up their minimum shareholding of at least 100% of annual 
base salary (150% for the CEO). All of the Executive Directors currently meet the shareholding guidelines.
The table below shows the Directors’ interests in shares owned outright and/or vested, and the extent to which ITE’s shareholding 
guidelines are achieved. There have been no other changes in the holdings of the current Directors and any connected persons 
between 30 September 2013 and 2 December 2013, being the last practicable date before publication of the remuneration report.

Financial statements
Independent audI tor’s report to the 
members of I te Group plc
o pinion
In our opinion the consolidated and Parent Company financial statements of ITE Group plc:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2013 and of its 
profit for the year then ended;
 – the Consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
 – the Parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated and company income statements, the consolidated and company 
statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statement of financial position, the consolidated and 
company cash flow statements, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity, and the related notes 1 to 
28. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union.
s eparate opinion in relation to Ifrs s as issued by the Iasb 
As explained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation 
to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
basis for opinions
We have audited the consolidated and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK and Ireland). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
below under Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditor. In performing our audit as required by those standards, 
we complied with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors including those requiring us to be 
independent and objective.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Finance Director’s statement on page 37 that the business is a going 
concern. We confirm that
 – we have not identified material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern which we believe would need to be disclosed in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and
 – we have concluded that management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements to be appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

a uditor commentary
o ur assessment of risks of material misstatement significant to our audit
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team: 
 – the assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill. Management is required to carry out an annual 
impairment test, which is complex and judgemental and based on a number of assumptions including future profitability 
and discount rates; 
 – the recoverability of venue rental advances. These advances are made to venue owners and the recoverability depends 
on the future performance of the venue and the counterparties;
 – accounting for businesses acquired by the Group. The Group has made a number of acquisitions and the accounting 
for each involves judgement and is based on assumptions about the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired; and
 – revenue recognition, including the validity of revenue and cut‑off. 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
o ur application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the financial statements, would 
be changed or influenced. We also determine a level of performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of 
testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged 
would be material for the financial statements as a whole. In line with generally accepted practice, we calculated planning 
materiality for the Group as approximately 5% of profit before tax, which equated to £2.0 million. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £40,000, 
as well as differences below that threshold that in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds
a n overview of the scope of our audit
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non‑financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Our Group audit scope focused on five operating locations, being the Group’s operations in London, Leeds, Russia, Turkey 
and Kazakhstan which were subject to a full scope audit for the year ended 30 September 2013. These locations represent 
the principal business units of the Group and account for 85% of the Group’s revenue and 85% of the Group’s operating 
profit. Audits of these locations are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of Group 
materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the businesses concerned. In the remaining locations, analytical review 
and focussed testing is performed by the London Head Office team.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Financial statements
Independent audI tor’s report to the
members of I te Group plc continued
The Group audit team follows a programme of planned site visits that is designed to ensure the Senior Statutory Auditor 
or his designate visits the principal locations in Russia at least once a year and remaining locations as part of our rotation 
strategy. The Group audit team also holds detailed meetings with audit teams in the other locations. 
The way in which we scoped our response to the significant risks identified above was as follows:
The assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill – for goodwill and intangibles we challenged 
management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, described in note 11 to 
the financial statements, including specifically the cash flow projections, discount rates and sensitivities used. 
The recoverability of venue rental advances – for the assessment of the carrying value of venue rental advances we have 
reviewed the underlying agreements, considered and challenged management assumptions over future recoverability, 
such as the review of future exhibition plans and venue usage, and audited repayments and utilisation in the year.
Accounting for businesses acquired by the Group – we reviewed the sale and purchase agreements and audited the 
acquisition accounting. This included testing the validity and completeness of consideration and evaluating management’s 
assumptions and methodology supporting the fair values of intangible and net assets acquired for each significant 
acquisition in the period.
Revenue recognition – our procedures included understanding and testing the controls in respect of the Group’s revenue 
cycle and testing the revenue recognised in the period using a combination of substantive analytical procedures and tests 
of detail. In particular, to test validity and completeness of revenue, testing focused on management’s floor plan audits, 
where the final exhibition floor plan is reconciled to sales reports and invoices. 
The Audit and Risk Committee’s consideration of these judgements is set out on page 52. 
o pinion on other matters prescribed by the c ompanies a ct 2006 
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
matters on which we are required to report by exception
a dequacy of explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. Under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain elements of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. We have nothing to report arising from these matters or our review. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

c orporate Governance s tatement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising 
from our review.
o ur duty to read other information in the a nnual r eport 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 – is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading 
statements. 
r espective responsibilities of directors and auditor

1 General information
ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is given on page 123. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41 and 
in note 3. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out below.
Impact of new accounting standards
New, revised or changes to existing standards which have been adopted by the Group in the year ending 30 September 2013
The following new standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted the 
reported results or the financial position:
 – Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’; and
 – Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’.
The adoption of these new standards and interpretation has not changed any previously reported figures.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not 
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted 
by the EU):
 – Amendments to IAS 19, IFRS 7, IAS 32, IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27, IAS 28, IFRS 1, IAS 36 and IAS 39;
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement’;
 – IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’;
 – IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’;
 – IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’; and
 – IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for:
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – This will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
 – IFRS 10 – 13 were issued by the IASB on 12 May 2011 and which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013. The Group has not completed its assessment of the impact of pronouncements on the consolidated 
results, financial position or cashflows of the Group.
2 Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc (‘the Company’) is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to 
as ‘the Group’. The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. In addition, the Group has complied with IFRS as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time 
and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions 
are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Finance Director’s Report on page 37. 
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, 
except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.

2 Basis of accounting continued
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and the subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company 
drawn up to 30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of 
the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest of non controlling 
shareholders is stated at the non contolling interest’s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
in line with those used by the Group. 
All intra‑group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Non controlling interest consists of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business combination and the 
non controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the non controlling 
interest in excess of their interest in the subsidiaries equity are allocated against non controlling interest even if this results 
in a deficit balance.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Any costs attributable to the business combination are 
expensed directly to the Income Statement. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet 
the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non current 
assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non‑current assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition‑date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost 
of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of 
contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes 
in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non controlling interest’s proportion of the 
net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash‑generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash‑generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash‑generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro‑rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

2 Basis of accounting continued
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost. Customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor 
databases are measured at fair value. Computer software, customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor 
databases have a definite useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives 
are typically between three and ten years for customer relationships, for some trademarks up to twenty years and for 
visitor databases between five and eight years. Computer software is amortised over four years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate 
cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash‑generating unit 
to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash‑generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash‑generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised 
immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash‑generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash‑generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately, unless the relevant asset 
is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, 
on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements  – term of lease
Plant and equipment  – four to ten years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, 
or where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
a ssociates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control over those policies.
A joint venture is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise joint control. Joint control exists when decisions 
about the activities of the entity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Financial statements
2 Basis of accounting continued
The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements 
using the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at 
cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any 
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that entity (which includes any long‑term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the 
associate or joint venture) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to 
the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant associate or joint venture. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment 
of the asset transferred in which case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances
Venue advances arise where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off‑setting 
against future venue hire or by cash repayment. Where the advance can be settled in cash, the loan balance is measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method where the impact of discounting is material. Appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that 
the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are 
recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial Instruments
c lasses of financial instruments
The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of financial 
instruments by class are disclosed in note 21 to the accounts.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and 
derivative assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, 
and is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised 
(in full or partly) when the Group’s rights to cashflows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
investments
Investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market are classified as available‑for‑sale financial assets 
and stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 21. Gains and losses arising from changes 
in the fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve 
with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange 
gain and losses on monetary assets which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed of 
or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve 
is reclassified to the income statement.
Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive the 
dividends is established. 
c ash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on demand deposits, and other short‑term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and 
cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash equivalents 
are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.

Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non‑derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. This category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there 
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The estimates are based on specific credit circumstances and the Group’s 
historical bad receivables experience. No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short‑term 
nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the effective interest rate method is not applied. 
derivative assets
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or 
little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classified as at fair value through profit or 
loss. Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value 
at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement. These derivatives are 
acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: written put options, bank borrowings, trade and other 
payables held at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Written put options
Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in 
a subsidiary for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price. An amount equal to the 
liability is recorded in equity on initial recognition of a written put option. The liability is subsequently remeasured through 
the income statement.
Where considered significant, the Group’s written put options are discounted to their appropriate value. The unwinding 
of the discount is charged through the income statement over the period to exercise.
Bank borrowings
Interest‑bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on 
an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where bank loans and overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Group’s 
cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement. Loan and 
overdraft interest and associated costs that are considered to be financing in nature are presented as financing activities 
in the cash flow statement.
t rade and other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables 
are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced by a new liability with 
substantially modified terms. Trade and other payables are short‑term and there is no interest charged in connection with these, 
hence the effective interest method is not applied.
derivative liabilities
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in an underlying variable, requires no 
or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative liabilities are classified as fair value through profit 
or loss. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement. These derivatives 
are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses 
derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
88
Financial statements
2 Basis of accounting continued
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its derivative 
financial instruments as cash flow hedges. A derivative is presented as a non‑current asset or a non‑current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled 
within twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and 
the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. 
At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is 
used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values of cashflows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are 
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement as investment 
revenue or finance costs respectively. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised 
hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity 
at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group’s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s financial policies. Further details on these policies can 
be found in the Strategic Report on page 36. 
Fair values
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely 
accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cashflows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes 
for similar instruments and use of comparable arm’s length transactions.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business 
net of discounts, VAT and other sales‑related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs 
relating to future events are deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income 
and prepaid event costs respectively. Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable.
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, 
revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement. 
o perating profit
Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates & joint ventures and profit or loss on disposal of Group 
undertakings and before investment income and finance costs.

h eadline pre‑tax profit
Headline pre‑tax profit is a non statutory measure of performance used by the Group. It is defined as profit or loss from 
operations before tax expense not including amortisation of acquired intangibles, impairment of goodwill, profits or losses 
arising on disposal of Group undertakings, revaluation of financial liabilities in relation to put options over non controlling 
interests, imputed interest charges on discounted put option liabilities, gains or losses on the settlement of contingent 
consideration, direct costs on completed and pending acquisitions and disposals and tax on income from associates and 
joint ventures.
taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual 
rate where applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the 
rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Non monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the 
retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation 
of non monetary items carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of non monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. For such 
non monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Group’s accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative 
financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and 
their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange 
rates at the date of transaction are used. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the 
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 (the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates), cumulative translation 
differences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently, any gain or loss 
on disposal will exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Financial statements
2 Basis of accounting continued
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 
employee s hare t rust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (ESOT). Shares in the Company 
held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written 
off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
s hare based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (share based payment). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity‑settled share based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding 
the effect of non‑market‑based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity‑settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non‑market‑based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black‑Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects 
of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
l eases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not 
made on such a basis. Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis 
over the lease term.
c ritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by 
management and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of 
cash‑generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimation of future cashflows expected from the cash‑generating unit to perpetuity and a suitable discount rate in order 
to calculate present value. The period used in the calculation is based on management’s average expectation of the period 
over which the value will be derived from the cash generating units. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 
30 September 2013 is £78.6 million and £43.7 million respectively.
Acquired intangible assets
The valuation of acquired intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future 
cashflows arising from customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases to determine the value of 
those intangible assets. The key assumptions used in estimating the net present value of the additional future cashflows are 
the discount rate, royalty rate, attrition rate and the period over which the intangible assets affect future cashflows. 
intangible asset useful economic lives
The life of an intangible asset is estimated by management based on the expected period over which cashflows generated 
from that asset will arise. The amortisation charge reflected in the financial statements is directly impacted by the estimation 
of useful lives by management.
Share based payments 
The Group makes share based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value 
at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually 
vest. The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group’s share price 
volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives. Management regularly performs a true‑up of 
the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.

t axation 
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes 
the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the 
Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The Group 
takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the 
eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results and 
future cashflows.
3 segmental information
IFRS 8 introduces the term Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Senior Management Board comprising Russell 
Taylor (Chief Executive Officer), Neil Jones (Group Financial Director), Stephen Keen, Alexander Shtalenkov, Nik Rudge, 
Colette Tebbutt, Suzanne King and Jane Stables is considered to be the CODM.
ITE’s reportable segments are strategic business units that are based in different geographic locations, predominantly 
in the developing and emerging markets. Each business unit is managed separately and has a different marketing strategy 
as determined by the local management. The products and services offered by each business unit are identical across 
the Group.
The Group evaluates the performance of its segments on the basis of headline pre‑tax profit and operating profit. See note 2 
for more details.
The revenue and profit before taxation are attributable to the Group’s one principal activity, the organisation of trade 
exhibitions, conferences and related activities and can be analysed by geographic segment as follows. No individual 
customer amounts to more than 10% of Group revenues.

12 Goodwill acquired through business combinations
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected 
to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2013
 £000
2012 
£000
UK & Western Europe 7,662 7,692
Central Asia & Caucasus 7,968 6,680

Eastern & Southern Europe 15,976 18,296
Asia 5,954 2,195
78,575 76,309
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cashflows 
during the period. Management estimates discount rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the cash‑generating units. The growth rates are based on management forecasts. The Group 
prepares cashflow forecasts based upon the most recent financial plans approved by the Board and extrapolates the 
planned cashflows. Assumed growth rates based on GDP growth rates in the local markets and management judgements 
have been applied for the first three years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of between 2% and 7% is applied thereafter. 
These rates do not exceed the average long‑term growth rate for the businesses in the relevant markets.
The pre‑tax discount rates applied to the cash generating units are between 13% and 15%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used. Management believes that 
no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to exceed its 
recoverable amount.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions 
arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for each 
CGU with the sensitivities summarised as follows:
 – An increase in the discount rate by 1%.
 – A decrease of 5% on forecast cashflows over the term for all CGUs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease 
in forecast cashflows.

The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature at the 
balance sheet date. If necessary, adjustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill within 12 months 
of the acquisition date. 
The goodwill arising on acquisition of £4.5 million represents the perceived value placed by the Group of having an 
established operating position in a new emerging market. The acquired business organises exhibitions in Malaysia, 
predominantly Metaltech which serves the machine tooling and metal fabrication industry.
The acquired business contributed £2.3 million to Group revenue and £1.2 million to profit before tax during the year. 
These results would be unchanged had the business been acquired on 1 October 2012. Transaction costs relating to the 
above acquisition were £0.2 million.
other acquisitions
On 28 January 2013 the Group acquired 100% of the exhibition assets of Baird Publications Pty Ltd for consideration of 
AUD 600,000 (£400,000). The assets acquired comprise a small number of trade events in Hong Kong. No goodwill arose 
on the acquisition of Baird Publications Pty Ltd.
On 22 April 2013, EUF, a subsidiary of the Group, exercised its put option to acquire an additional 20% of Yem Fuar for 
consideration of TRL 13.8 million (£5.0 million) taking its total stake to 80%. The Group retains a put option to acquire the 
remaining 20% of Yem Fuar, which is expected to be exercised in April 2014.
During the year the Group made several payments of deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions made in previous 
years. See note 19 for details. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

18 Bank borrowings
Following a refinancing of its loan obligations on 19 November 2012, the Group utilised a £10.0 million (2012: £15.0 million) 
multi‑currency committed revolving credit facility and a £20.0 million (2012: £15.0 million) multi‑currency net overdraft 
facility. The borrowings are arranged at floating interest rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk. The Directors 
estimate that the carrying value of the borrowings approximates their fair value. More details are given below.
Revolving credit facility
The revolving credit facility provides committed credit facilities through to 1 July 2015. Drawdowns bear interest at 
interbank rates of interest plus a margin of 2.0%. The average interest rate on the facility approximated 2.5% throughout 
the year (2012: 2.1%). The facility has been secured by a guarantee between a number of Group companies.
The total drawdowns of £3.0 million under the facility at 30 September 2013 were denominated in Sterling. At 30 September 2013 
the Group had £7.0 million (2012: £1.7 million) of gross undrawn committed loan facility.
Bank overdraft
The bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. The overdrafts bear interest at the base rate plus a margin of 1.75%. The 
average interest rate on the bank overdrafts approximated 2.2% throughout the year (2012: 2.1%). The overdrafts have been 
secured by a guarantee between a number of Group companies.
Of the total overdraft at 30 September 2013, £12.9 million (2012: £13.3 million) is denominated in Sterling, £1.8 million 
(2012: £2.1 million) is denominated in US Dollars, and £2.9 million (2012: £nil) is denominated in Euros. The Euro and US 
Dollar overdraft are taken out to act as a partial hedge against UK monetary assets in those currencies. At 30 September 
2013 the Group had £2.4 million (2012: £nil) of net undrawn committed overdraft facilities.

The Yem Fuar put option liability has been discounted at a rate of 5% and the undiscounted amount is £4.6 million. The 
Tradelink put option liability has not been discounted as the effect is not material. The equity option asset of £0.1 million 
relates to the fair value of the call option held over Summit, which is accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. 
The options held in respect of Scoop, ECMI and ABEC are valued at £nil. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate to their fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of foreign currency risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board. Compliance 
with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into financial 
instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency 
and interest rate), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents the Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Strategic report 
on page 38. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Board has established policies to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value 
of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. Market risk 
exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward‑plus 
or forward foreign exchange contracts.

Forward foreign exchange contracts 
As at 30 September 2013 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group has 
committed to amounted to £61.5 million (2012: £81.2 million). These arrangements are designed to address significant 
exchange exposures for the next 36 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing 
the Group to less than six months or more than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 2013, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net liability of approximately £0.4 million 
(2012: net asset of £4.2 million). These amounts are based on market valuations.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain 
currency trade receivable balances. These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management. 
All foreign exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income statement.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no significant interest‑bearing assets, other than cash, the Group’s income and operating cashflows 
are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its 
borrowings at floating interest rates. This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating 
interest rate borrowings. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed 
in the liquidity risk section of this note.

c redit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial 
assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments. 
These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of 
only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s 
objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk 
is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Group’s trade receivables and the details of the Group’s allowances for doubtful receivables 
can be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held. The territories 
in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies such 
as Moody’s and Fitch. The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash held in such 
banks. The Group’s exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value 
of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

Management review debtors ageing on a contractual basis and also based on when an event has been held. The Group 
raise invoices on events using stage payments. Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed 
and chased. Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when 
the service is provided. Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage 
outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated 
by the Group’s management based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical 
areas and the Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The 
demographics of the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country, in which the customers 
operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.

The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade 
receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and 
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cashflows. Where material, 
it is discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition. The main component of this allowance is a specific 
loss component that relates to individually significant exposure on shows which have taken place but the debt has not been 
collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show and past experience.
The details of the movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables are shown below.

£0.1 million was released (2012: £0.2 million) and an additional allowance of £0.1m was made.
l iquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from 
inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests 
with the Board of Directors. They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of 
the Group’s short, medium and long‑term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt 
facilities as appropriate. 
c apital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of 
the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft and bank loan which is disclosed in note 17 and note 18 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in note 23 and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in the above table. The following is the analysis of deferred tax 
balances for financial reporting purposes:
2013

£000
Deferred tax liabilities (11,443) (14,414)
Deferred tax assets 2,112 1,763
(9,331) (12,651)
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £4.3 million (2012: £3.5 million) available for offset against 
future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £46.1 million (2012: £39.7 million). No liability 
has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

options. No (2012: nil) ordinary shares were issued in respect of Directors remuneration. The total consideration for the 
shares issued was £150,179 (2012: £72,097).
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. At the Extraordinary General Meeting 
held on 17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(ESOT). The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who exercise options under the 
Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the market or 
subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the Employee Share Ownership Trust. The amount of the reserve 
represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration paid for the Company’s shares purchased 
by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the balance sheet date.
The ESOT held 3,654,988 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2013 (2012: 5,366,722 shares). During the year 334,650 share 
options and 1,377,084 nominal share options under the Employees Performance Share Plan were granted against ESOT held 
shares. The market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2013 was £9.9 million (2012: £11.1 million).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest‑free loan of up to £12.5 million for the purpose of 
buying shares. At 30 September 2013, the amount of the loan drawn down was £8.6 million. The ITE Group plc Company 
only profit and loss account and balance sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2013 The

year based on market value. The vesting period is three years and awards are exercisable up to ten years from the date of 
grant. For conditional awards the vesting is automatic on the satisfaction of performance targets. The options are forfeited 
if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The awards are also subject to a performance target. Further

Financial statements
n otes to the Company a CCounts
For the year ended 30 s eptember 2013
1 basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Group going concern disclosure on page 83.
These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards and have been applied consistently.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and 
the preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
t rade debtors and creditors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted 
for on an accrual basis to profit or loss.
equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and 
its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in 
periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement 
to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements. 
Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled 
over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

1 basis of accounting continued
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
that date. Non‑monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period.
employee s hare t rust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (ESOT). Shares in the Company 
held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off 
to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
s hare based payments
The Company issues equity‑settled share based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non‑market‑based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity‑settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non‑market‑based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black‑Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects 
of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
2 profit for the year
The profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2013 was £5.8 million (2012: profit of £21.0 million). As permitted by 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

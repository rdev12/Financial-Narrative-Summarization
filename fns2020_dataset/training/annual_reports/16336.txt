Ultra’s place in the market
Ultra presents the market with a wide portfolio of highly-differentiated, specialist capabilities and
innovative technologies, applicable across the DEFENCE & AEROSPACE, SECURITY & CYBER,
TRANSPORT and ENERGY domains. In often challenging markets, as government customers wrestle
with ﬁscal uncertainties, Ultra works across the Group and with partners, to offer cost-effective, proven
and comprehensive advanced technology solutions which can best match customer needs and budgets,
rather than presenting a standard, non-optimal product. Through this approach the Group is increasing
market access and pursuing areas of customers’ preferential spend.

Markets – where we operate
Ultra constantly positions within its main
market domains to sustain growth.
Through its evolved strategic review
process, the Group has demonstrated a
long track record of identifying future
growth sectors within its core markets.
Ultra then invests to create differentiated
offerings in these sectors.
Ultra continues to focus on maximising
revenue from the largest addressable
defence budgets in the world. The Group
has a significant transatlantic capability and
derives almost half its revenue from North
America, where the Group continues to
follow a strategy of identifying and
pursuing areas of preferential funding. The
Middle East and Asia Pacific regions are
capable of being larger markets for Ultra. 
A full analysis of the Group’s markets and
clusters is on the following pages.
Ultra’s customers
Ultra’s independence allows it to work with
the world’s major prime contractors in its
markets and to sell its wide portfolio of
specialist capabilities to a broad range of
customers around the world. The graphic
below shows the major customers for the
Group’s 2014 revenue. Within Ultra’s top
customers, such as the US Department of
Defense (DoD), the UK Ministry of Defence
(MoD) and BAE Systems, the Group
actually supplies to a wide range of
different project ofﬁces, integrated project
teams and platform teams. Therefore, Ultra
deals with a larger number of different
partners and customers than the graphic
might, at ﬁrst, suggest.
Geographic reach
A key strategic objective is to broaden the
Group’s geographic footprint (see page 13
for more detail). This is carried out in a
measured and controlled manner as Ultra
continues to focus its resources on a
limited number of regions and sectors,
where it is experiencing growth. Over the
last two decades, Ultra has expanded and
developed its international footprint and
now has signiﬁcant business in Europe,
North America, the Middle East and the
Asia Paciﬁc.
Ultra has operations based in the countries
shaded light blue on the map above and
conducts business in the countries shaded

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Introduction
In 2014 Group order intake increased
signiﬁcantly, reﬂecting demand across our
market segments for Ultra’s specialist
capabilities. Market conditions, speciﬁcally
government spending pressures in the US
and UK, continued to frustrate revenues in
2014, although excluding Oman the
second half performance showed an
improvement on the ﬁrst half. Within the
Group, good progress has been made in
implementing market facing initiatives
whilst continuing prudent cost
management. The events that culminated
in the early termination of our Oman
Airport IT contract provided an unwelcome
distraction, although this will allow us to
bring to a head what is a unique and
increasingly difﬁcult commercial contract.
The Group intends to vigorously pursue all
options towards a satisfactory settlement.
The Group’s sustained investment and
constant focus on improving operational
efﬁciencies, together with Ultra’s inherent
agility has shown that the underpinning
business model is robust and is positioning
the Group for growth.

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Operational highlights
Features of the Group’s accomplishments 
in the year which will underpin future
performance included:
• The award of a £27m contract for the
Royal Navy’s Sonar 2050 Technology
Refresh (S2050TR) Programme. Under
this contract, which will be executed over
the next 10 years, the Group will deliver
and support new hull mounted sonars
for the Royal Navy’s eight Type-23
frigates. The S2050 Technology Refresh
programme will deliver, to the Royal
Navy, a world-leading sonar capability
providing persistent surveillance against
submarine and torpedo threats, at a
signiﬁcantly lower through-life cost.
• The award of a £12.9m contract from
EDF Energy for the manufacture and
support of nuclear reactor
instrumentation. Under this contract
Ultra will manufacture and support
safety-critical nuclear reactor
instrumentation for use in EDF Energy’s
current UK nuclear power stations. This 
is the second contract to beneﬁt from
Ultra’s recent investment in a state-of-
the-art nuclear instrumentation
manufacturing facility and further
cements EDF Energy’s and Ultra’s
relationship.
• The award of a contract by Airbus to
design, develop, supply and support an
electrical Ground Door Opening system
(eGDO) for its new A350 family of
aircraft. The eGDO system comprises a
set of electrical actuators, sensors and
fuselage-mounted control and indication
panels which allows airline ground
maintenance crews to open the landing
gear doors to access the landing gear
bay. Based on anticipated sales of the
aircraft, this contract is expected to be
worth in excess of £60m revenue to Ultra
over the life of the programme.
Ultra’s business model
Ultra’s prime objective continues to be to
outperform the market in terms of annual
increases in shareholder value, by delivering
above-average increases in earnings and by
communicating effectively with
shareholders and the ﬁnancial community.
The strategic framework, page 1, is
focused on ensuring that Ultra meets its
prime objective. This is achieved through
the strategies for growth, which are
described on pages 12 and 13, allied with
the business model described on pages 8
to 11. A key enabling component of Ultra’s
business model is the Group’s culture and
values, which are further detailed on pages
40 to 46.
The Group will continue to differentiate
itself from its competitors through its
technical innovation and high standards of
ethical business conduct. Underpinning this
cultural drive is a strong policy on ethics
and business conduct which is mandatory
for all employees across the entire Group.
Ultra educates its employees on anti-
bribery and corruption policies, including
gifts and hospitality practices. In the period,
Ultra decided not to pursue business in
areas where it was not satisﬁed that its
ethical standards would be maintained.
Executing against the growth strategies,
shown right, requires consistent
management focus and drive. Ultra’s
management team has to balance dealing
with the particularly challenging short-term
market conditions, whilst also ensuring that
it is fully addressing the need to continue
to position the Group for medium- and
long-term growth. The members of the
Executive Team understand through
experience, what makes Ultra different and
how to focus the Group’s businesses on
maintaining competitive advantage in the
various specialist market sectors in which
Ultra operates.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Positioning for growth
The acquisitions we have made this year
have added signiﬁcant capabilities, market
access and a critical mass to the Group.
They have assisted us to take the next step
in developing our business model, re-
aligning how we face the market. Ultra’s
broad portfolio of capabilities has been
positioned into eight clusters, each facing
a speciﬁc end market. This gives a
framework around which the Group can
more effectively apply its resources and
exploit the domain expertise and
technologies in its businesses that face the
same end markets. This framework allows
Ultra to address opportunities with more
complete offerings, whilst maintaining the
agility of a lower tier supplier. As a result
the Group can target opportunities in
speciﬁc markets without losing the
autonomy of its individual businesses. The
cluster approach also enables Ultra to take
an enhanced view of the capabilities in
each cluster and so better manage and
prioritise the Group’s investments against
speciﬁc end markets. The Group’s
operational performance and delivery will
continue to be via three divisions. 
Ultra’s eight strategic clusters 
are as follow:
The Group constantly strives to broaden its
customer base and widen its geographic
footprint. This not only provides growth,
but increases the robustness of the
business model. Ultra has made the
strategic decision to prioritise a number of
regions and sectors with higher growth.
The Group recognises that new markets
and geographic sectors take time to enter
and so these activities are carried out in a
measured and controlled manner, with due
consideration of risk. As Ultra continues to
address larger projects and grow its proﬁle
in new geographical regions it will be
necessary to implement improved project
management and contract management
skills. Ultra, as an independent, non-
threatening partner, is able to support all
of the main prime contractors and local
industry partners. The Group is therefore
well positioned to bring its specialised
equipment, systems and services to new
long-term platforms and programmes in
new markets and regions. Further details

Portfolio strength
To increase the breadth of the Group’s
portfolio of capabilities, Ultra continues to
invest over 5% of revenue on internal
development to generate new
differentiated offerings. These offerings are
aimed at niche market sectors where
customers preferentially focus their
expenditure. These investment activities
are led by the businesses and are robustly
reviewed by the Executive Team and the
Board. In parallel, Ultra continues to invest
in acquisitions, which bring complementary
world-leading niche capabilities and
market access to the Group’s portfolio. 
In February 2014, the Group acquired 
3 Phoenix Inc, a US business which is a
leading supplier of specialist sonar, radar,
intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance products and solutions.
The company has a 10 year track record of
delivering critical real-time sensor and
processing systems, primarily to the US
Navy, but also to commercial customers. 
3 Phoenix is now part of Ultra’s Tactical &
Sonar Systems division.
In May 2014, Ultra acquired two
companies, Forensic Technologies (FT) and
ICE. FT provides automated ﬁrearm
ballistics identiﬁcation and forensic analysis
systems to law enforcement agencies in
over 65 countries. FT is currently developing
a number of document security and
analytic products based on its existing
capabilities and areas of expertise. FT has
been integrated into Ultra’s Tactical &
Sonar Systems division.
ICE designs, develops, manufactures and
supports aerospace products including,
motor control electronics, electrothermal
ice protection controllers, pneumatic valve
controls and engine control interface units.
ICE customers include Parker Hanniﬁn
Corporation, Cessna Aircraft Company and
Meggitt. ICE has been integrated into
Ultra’s Controls business within the
Group’s Aircraft & Vehicle Systems division.
In June 2014, the Group acquired Lab
Impex Systems (LIS). LIS is a developer and
supplier of radiation measurement
solutions and services for use within the
nuclear industry. LIS provides systems
engineering, installation and support of 
full environmental radiation monitoring
systems, including alpha, beta, gamma
radiation and associated safety systems.
The business has been integrated into 
Ultra’s Nuclear Control Systems business
within Ultra’s Information & Power 
Systems division.
Customer needs
Ultra continues to adapt its behaviours to
maintain its agility and commitment to
meeting customer needs. To support this,
the Group has made good progress in
implementing market facing initiatives
which help it gain a better understanding
of customers’ real needs. These improve its
ability to offer differentiated and
comprehensive solutions in areas of
preferential spend across all its market
sectors. Ultra’s key behaviours LEAP and
LAUNCH also help to position the Group’s
portfolio of capabilities into end market
facing clusters. (More information on these
behaviours can be found on page 43).
Oman Airport IT contract
The termination of the Oman Airport IT
contract in February 2015 has had an effect
on the Group’s 2014 performance, with
revenue on the programme being limited
to that reported at the half year 30 June
2014. The substantive reasons given in the
notice of termination are related to Ithra
not meeting contractual milestones and
Ithra’s assessment is that the termination 
is unjustiﬁed, wrongful and unlawful. Ultra
is in discussions with its legal and claims
advisers regarding the termination and
recovery of Ithra’s costs and claims. It has
been considered prudent to take an
exceptional and non-underlying provision 
in the year to December 2014 in respect of
the Contract. The provision, which totals
£47m, includes the write off of the debt
owed on the Contract, termination costs
and other liabilities.
Summary
Performance for 2015 will beneﬁt from
acquisitions made in 2014 and from foreign
exchange translation at current rates.
However, set against the current market
backdrop of uncertainty over the timing and
feasibility of proposed US DoD budgets,
together with election activity in both the
US and UK, overall Ultra expects 2015
performance to be broadly stable. We will
continue to balance investment for future
growth with focus on efﬁciencies and
managing our costs to support proﬁtability.
Looking further ahead our optimism
improves as market growth drivers present
revenue opportunities for our businesses
and the expected pace of order book
execution ticks up as a result of recent
contract awards. Further growth is
expected as the Group identiﬁes and
completes acquisitions. Internally, following
on from our cost management actions, we
are launching a group-wide initiative to
standardise our systems and some of our
processes. This will enable us to go beyond
individual businesses efﬁciencies, whilst
retaining Ultra’s critical success factors of
autonomy and agility. The Board
acknowledges the short-term headwinds
but judges that the actions being taken
should enable the Group to achieve an
improved performance from 2016.
I would like to ﬁnish by thanking all of
Ultra’s employees for their continued hard
work, dedication and enthusiasm. The
ability to implement Ultra’s strategies
successfully is entirely reliant upon the
engagement, commitment and passion of
the Group’s employees. I am conﬁdent that
Ultra is well placed to execute successfully
the strategies and plans to ensure that
growth continues in the future.
Rakesh Sharma
Chief Executive The Group will continue 
to differentiate itself from its
competitors by:
Technical innovation across its
broad portfolio of capabilities
Ultra focuses on developing innovative,
highly-differentiated solutions which are
delivered in close collaboration with
customers, partners and suppliers.
Commitment to deliver
Ultra has built a reputation for meeting its
commitments. This reputation is not only
based on businesses meeting their
obligations, but also by establishing a
culture within the Group, that is based on
this principle. Ultra believes that this
reputation is one of its defining and most
valuable characteristics. Behaving in this
way fosters long-term relationships.
The endeavours of its 
exceptional employees
Ultra would not be able to deliver value to
customers without the innovative and
entrepreneurial spirit of its staff. The broad
range of skills and capabilities held by the
Group’s employees are why Ultra is successful
in innovating to meet customer needs.
The ability to develop long-term value-
adding relationships with customers
Ultra businesses are expected to maximise
their relationships with customers for the
long-term, through a close understanding
of customer needs, leading to sustained
on-time delivery of high-quality products
and services. This creates a shared
dependency from the customers’
perspective and encourages a long-term
strategic relationship.

Ultra’s broad portfolio 
of specialist capabilities
The Group has a broad portfolio
of specialist capabilities which
deliver highly-differentiated
solutions focused on the
following market sectors:
DEFENCE & AEROSPACE,
SECURITY & CYBER,
TRANSPORT and ENERGY. 
The Group is seeking constantly to 
increase the number of specialist
capabilities in its market niches and to
increase the number of long-term
platforms and programmes on which
Ultra’s specialist capabilities are specified.
The expansive spread of specialist
capability areas mapped onto so many
platforms and programmes:
• provide resilience to Ultra’s financial
performance
• reduce the Group’s risk profile; and
• drive the Group’s growth
Ultra’s innovation
The Group has a strategy to invest
continuously to strengthen its capabilities
across its specialist niche markets. Ultra’s
deep understanding of the users’ domain,
its enduring customer relationships and its
outward-facing nature, inform the Group’s
investment decisions.
Ultra businesses innovate constantly to
create solutions (often through highly
specialised disruptive technological
innovation) to customer requirements
which are different from, and better than,
those of the Group’s competitors.
Ultra has consistently invested over 5% 
of its revenue in innovation, new products
and business development. In addition,
over 15% of Group revenue is customer-
funded product development. In total
therefore, over 20% of revenue spend is
focused on augmenting the portfolio of
capabilities and programme positions
which underpin further growth.
Corporate agility
A key differentiator for Ultra is the agility
which businesses in the Group exhibit in
their dealings with customers.
The Board provides effective leadership
and direction in delivering the key
corporate objective of reliable and
consistent growth in shareholder value. At
the operational level, the Executive Team
has responsibility for running the Group
and for delivery of strategy, financial
performance and team development.
Ultra’s individual businesses have a high
degree of operational autonomy, so that
they provide the exceptionally agile and
responsive support to customers and
partners, normally associated with a
smaller business. These benefits of
customer focus and agility are augmented
by the access to wider and complementary
technologies and expertise which lie
elsewhere in the Group (collaborative
autonomy) or with partners and by Ultra’s
strong financial position.
Ultra’s people
Ultra believes that the right
people, who embrace and
sustain Ultra’s culture, and 
who have the domain expertise,
are its most important asset 
in successfully enabling the
Group to deliver value to 
its stakeholders.

 Group 5.8%
 Customer 16.2% Position in the supply chain
Ultra has no strategic aim to be a tier 1,
top-level platform provider. The Group is
therefore, non-threatening to the tier 1
prime contractors such as BAE Systems or
Boeing and counts them amongst its key
customers. They can rely on Ultra to
provide the specialist capabilities at which
the Group is expert. Ultra concentrates on
tiers 2, 3 and 4, rather than aiming to be
a tier 1 platform provider. 
Ultra’s specialist capabilities are mainly at
tiers 3 and 4, supplying equipment and
components to support tier 1 and 2 systems
and programmes. The Group does undertake
tier 2 system integration, but does this
mainly when integrating its own tier 3
offerings. Ultra therefore, understands the
tier 3 detailed interfaces and so is able 
to manage the risk inherent in system
integration activities.
Ultra’s customer reach
Understanding the customer need
Ultra is continually evolving its
approach to match the markets
in which the Group operates.
This evolution is in response to:
• changing customer demands
• anticipating the direction of travel of 
the markets
• the Group striving to be the first to bring
new solutions to market
In its specialist capability areas, Ultra’s
understanding of the:
• customers’ domains
• demanding operational environments
• projected capability gaps which
customers would like addressed
is a key differentiator for the Group.
In short, Ultra’s understanding of the
customers’ need allows it to get to the
heart of the customer’s requirements and
develop effective and innovative solutions.
Strategic Clusters
The Group increasingly considers its
capabilities under 8 cluster headings that
describe common end markets. This allows
Ultra to better develop and apply its
domain expertise, capabilities and technical
synergies in common end markets.
Customer engagement 
Ultra’s LAUNCH is a behaviour which the
Group has developed to facilitate customer
engagement and relationship building.
LAUNCH is a way for Ultra’s businesses to
generate long-term customer relationships
which leads to a better pipeline of
opportunities and so ultimately, enables
growth. LAUNCH is aligned with the
Group’s approach to systems engineering
and project management.
This approach ensures Ultra understands
the real needs of its customers which
encourages a long-term strategic
relationship where Ultra’s businesses
become part of the customers’ extended
enterprises, to mutual benefit.
Flexible Partnerships
Ultra has an established ability to partner
and team (internally and externally) to
offer the best of breed technologies which
best meets customers’ requirements. The
Group is agnostic as to the source of
technology which is required to deliver
solutions. Where proven technology that
meets customers’ requirements exists
outside the Group, Ultra is happy to form
external teaming partnerships to access it.
Ultra sees these teaming arrangements as
a source of competitive advantage,
allowing Ultra to deliver differentiated
solutions which meet customer needs
efficiently, with lower development risk. It
is important that these teaming
arrangements are of benefit to all parties –
by working together, the team members
are able to win opportunities which would
not be possible in isolation.

Tier 4 Ultra’s value generation
Ultra’s strengths of customer
reach, people and capabilities
combine to enable Ultra to
generate and sustain value.
Ultra value for the customers
Ultra generates value by applying
electronic and software technologies in
demanding and critical environments to
provide highly-differentiated solutions to
meet customers’ needs.
Ultra businesses innovate constantly to
create solutions to customer requirements
which are different from, and better than,
those of the Group’s competitors, as
perceived by the customer.
Solutions
By applying these differentiated solutions
to a wide range of international platforms
and programmes, Ultra has built an
exceptionally broad portfolio of specialist
capability areas. Where the Group has a
number of complementary capabilities, it
can also combine these to offer more
comprehensive solutions. In other words,
Ultra’s products, capabilities and the
associated domain expertise uniquely
position the Group to be able to meet
more complex sub-system and system
requirements. The Group remains
committed to its strategy of continued
investment in its portfolio of innovative and
differentiated specialist capabilities, to
ensure that the business is well-positioned
to meet future market demand.
Support
Ultra offers support to customers of its
products and systems through the design,
delivery and in-service phases of a
programme. Ultra’s deep understanding of
its specialist capability areas and the users’
environment is a key factor in supplying
innovative solutions to ensure the
capabilities are delivered and sustained 
in-service and meet the customers’
through-life needs.
Sustaining value
In order for Ultra’s business model to
deliver success over the long-term, it must
be sustainable and it must manage any
inherent risk well.
Economic
Ultra’s governance structure ensures that all
of its businesses are well-managed, control
costs and are cash-generative. This allows
the Group to self-fund acquisitions which
deliver positions in new markets or
additional niche capabilities. Since the
Group’s formation, Ultra has maintained a
balance between organic and acquisition
growth, having integrated 55 acquisitions
since 1993.
Social
Ultra understands that the long-term
success of the Group will be enhanced
through continuous focus on value
creation for all its stakeholders. The Group
encourages its businesses to support their
local communities as well as discharging
their responsibilities to contribute to the
broader social well-being.
Environmental
Ultra recognises that it is important, both
for its employees and the communities in
which it operates, that effective measures
are in place to minimise the environmental
impact of its activities, as this will help to
secure the long-term future of the Group.
Ultra has committed to substantial
investments in manufacturing facilities
which will, in addition to improving
productivity, offer increased efficiencies
and reduce energy consumption.
Reducing risk to maintain value
Ultra’s business model supports a stable
and well-balanced business, with the aim
of reducing risk and maintaining the
generation of value.
Ultra’s strategy is to constantly broaden its
portfolio of products and services which 
are positioned on a large number of
international platforms and programmes in
the Defence & Aerospace, Security & Cyber,
Transport and Energy markets.
Ultra has an increasingly broad customer
base worldwide, with sales outside the UK
now representing over 65% of Group
revenue. Ultra is repositioning itself
constantly, into growth sectors and areas of
preferential spend, within its main markets.
The above factors, together with Ultra’s
market agility and organisational flexibility,
generate further robustness and resilience
in the Group’s financial profile and
mitigate risk.

12 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Increase the Group’s portfolio of specialist capability areas
Ultra concentrates on providing its customers with capabilities and systems, using the Group’s electronic and software
solutions for niche markets in defence & aerospace, security & cyber, transport and energy. Within these market sectors,
Ultra focuses on developing specialist capabilities which provide differentiated solutions to customers’ requirements,
often in demanding and critical environments.
Increase the number of long-term platforms and programmes
on which Ultra’s specialist capabilities are speciﬁed
Ultra positions these specialist capabilities on a long list of international platforms and programmes. This breadth of
platform and programme coverage creates a ﬂywheel effect which drives Ultra’s performance year after year, despite
market ﬂuctuations. Ultra is positioned on very many such platforms and programmes.
Broaden the Group’s customer base
Ultra’s independence allows it to sell its wide portfolio of specialist capabilities to a broad range of customers around 
the world. Ultra supplies to a wide range of different project ofﬁces, integrated project teams and platform teams 
within its customers, the largest of which include; US DoD, UK MoD, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin,
Raytheon and Boeing.
Widen Ultra’s geographic footprint
Ultra has pursued a strategy of gaining access to the two largest addressable defence budgets in the world. Despite the
recent budget reductions, the US still spends more on defence each year than the rest of the nations combined. The
majority of Ultra’s acquisitions have been in North America and the point has now been reached where the Group has a
transatlantic capability and derives more of its revenue from the US and Canada than it does from the UK. Ultra’s
revenue from the Middle East and Asia Paciﬁc regions is capable of expansion. The Group’s growing presence in Australia
and other regions indicates Ultra’s intent in this regard.

Cluster strategies 
Cluster definition
Ultra’s broad portfolio of
capabilities has been brigaded
into groupings of eight clusters
as detailed above. This better
allows the Group to exploit its
domain expertise and the
synergies between the
technologies in its businesses
that face the same end markets.
Why clusters?
Having obtained a critical mass of
capabilities across a broad portfolio, Ultra
is now taking the next step in developing
its business model; the transition to
clusters. Clusters are the natural evolution
of Ultra’s business model, supporting a
shift from individual products to allow
more complex offerings. This cluster based
approach will establish a framework that
aligns resources (e.g. marketing analysis,
R&D, marketing and sales effort) to greater
effect across each end market facing
cluster. This in turn supports the
development of coherent strategies against
particular end markets, based upon collective
market research and opportunity capture.
The cluster approach provides the Group
with improved analysis at an appropriate
level of fidelity. This allows Ultra to better
manage and prioritise the Group’s
investments, including R&D alignment and
acquisition strategy.

How the clusters operate
Autonomy remains crucial to Ultra’s
culture, allowing the Group to remain
agile, and to generate and deliver highly
differentiated, and often disruptive, niche
technological solutions to the market
place. The majority of business activity in
Ultra will continue to reflect this autonomy.
The cluster framework will provide the
Group with greater efficiency in
coordination. This cluster approach will
also ensure that Ultra’s skills and resources
are better aligned to lever the collective
strength of its broad portfolio of
capabilities to compete for larger
opportunities, beyond the ability of a
single business.
Cluster strategies
The Divisional strategies will be replaced
with eight tightly focused and more
coherent Cluster strategies. These will
better guide activities within the Group 
and inform the development of the 
Group’s capability portfolio. The strategies
of the individual businesses will inform 
and be nested inside a cluster strategy,
which in turn is nested inside the overall
Group strategy.
 2014 revenue (%)
More information about each cluster 
can be found on pages 16-23

During 2015 it is the intent to 
re-structure the divisions to reflect the
cluster construct and to report against
the new divisions at the end of 2015. Market overview
The proliferation of the modern submarine
threat is driving increased opportunity in
the underwater warfare market. Submarines
are strategic assets, fulfilling a range of
roles from intelligence gathering to area
denial operations. The growth in the
number of submarine platforms, coupled
with the increasingly capable Russian
submarine force and the growing threats
in the Middle- and Far-East, is seen to be
challenging the traditional western
underwater technological superiority.
Investment in ASW is growing rapidly as
nations react to counter these threats. 
Global financial pressures coupled with
increased capital platform costs mean that
nations can typically no longer afford
platforms dedicated to a specific role.
Instead, they are generally moving to use of
more, smaller multi-role platforms, of
frigate or off-shore patrol vessel size. As a
result, ASW solutions now need to be
modular with reduced footprints to fit on
these smaller vessels. Other key factors in
this growing ASW market are the desire for
short to no development times, requiring
investment in advance of contract awards.
Ultra has positioned itself well in both of
these areas, with continued investment in
ASW technologies including multi static
active systems and sonobuoys for use with
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). A key
export market driver is the increasing
requirement for indigenous technology
transfer to overseas customers, another
area where Ultra has strong pedigree with
recent export contracts.
Market outlook
The US continues its strategic rebalancing
towards Asia (the “pivot to the Pacific”). 
As a result, despite the wider US
Government funding pressures, ASW and
submarines remain areas of preferential
spend with increased budget allocation.
Further US spend is anticipated in acoustic
system upgrades for ships and torpedoes.
Ultra’s recent acquisition of 3 Phoenix
reinforces the Group’s position in the US, 
in particular with torpedo warning systems
and small arrays. More broadly in the
addressable Asia-Pacific market, spend
related to ASW systems, including towed
torpedo defence solutions, is projected to
rise to almost £0.5bn. India intends to
award three major ASW related
programmes totalling in excess of £100m
over the next five years. Ultra is well 
placed to address these needs based on 
its integrated sonar system and surface
ship torpedo defence system technologies,
both of which have enabled recent
contract wins in the UK and New Zealand.
More broadly the Group’s leading airborne
ASW technologies and continued
investment is positioning Ultra well for the
emergent UK, and wider, maritime patrol
aircraft requirements.

Market overview
In Ultra’s established defence markets
customers are now generally looking to 
re-establish balanced force presence and
intervention capabilities without the risk
exposure of a forced land footprint. As
such, after a decade of land based
operations, the focus on spending has now
moved towards maritime, air and Special
Forces. Ever present budget pressures
mean new build maritime programmes
have generally reduced either in number or
scale. As a result, existing platforms are
typically now being extended beyond their
original service lives and customers are
seeking more cost effective ways of
increasing the capabilities of their navies.
Consequently the demand for
system/sensor upgrades and technology
insertion programmes on existing hulls is
growing, particularly for navies in
emerging nations. For the export market in
general, new build maritime platform
programmes are often dominated by the
industrial politics of the nation concerned,
especially if they have indigenous
capabilities. As a result technology transfer
is an increasingly important factor enabling
business in the export market.
Market outlook
The power products segment in the US
market remains stable with Virginia Class
Submarine (VCS) production funding well
protected. Longer term growth
opportunities for Ultra specialist power
products will come with the Ohio
Replacement Program (ORP), projected to
provide 12 new hulls beginning in 2021.
Use of common subsystems with VCS will
help lower the cost growth risk that
currently exists on ORP . The US Navy is
investing in technical refresh of Arleigh
Burke-class guided missile destroyers (DDG-
51), Ohio class submarines, landing platform
dock (LPD-17) and replenishment naval
vessel (T-AKE class) which provides further
opportunities for growth of the Group’s
advanced power management products.
With the protection of maritime resources
rising in importance in areas such as the
South China Sea, there are increasing
requirements for submarines with extended
patrol times. The advent of air independent
propulsion capability is expected to increase
demand for power conversion and
degaussing products. Incumbent positions
on the UK Successor submarine
development programme will enable high
probability of production follow on for;
main static converters, electric cruise
propulsion and signature management.
Clean Power requirements of DoD and
aerospace specifications will continue to
drive the need for Ultra’s specialty
components highlighted by power filters
and multi-phase transformers. The Group’s
specialist signature management capabilities
will see growth opportunities in the next
five years through the US Navy’s Ohio
Replacement Program, replacement new
fleet oilers (TAO-X) and DDG-51 upgrades.
There is also increased focus on electric field
signature management due to the growing
awareness of influence mine threat.
More broadly the continuing demand for
surface platform system and sensor
upgrades plays well to Ultra’s strengths in
naval combat systems and electro-optics
and the Group’s pedigree in partnering
with local industry.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Market overview
In general the focus of military forces is to
reset away from the “hold and build”
operations of the last decade, back to
building more balanced and full spectrum
capable forces. This has seen a shift in
spending away from the Land sector,
which has resulted in a reduction in the
number of new land vehicle programmes
in Ultra’s established markets. Instead there
has been a significant growth in the
number of major capability enhancements
and life extension programmes for land
platforms. This plays to Ultra’s strengths in
electronic vehicle architectures. Land
platforms are now increasingly complex,
with multiple sensors, weapons and
communication systems. These complex
electronics are driving increased electrical
generation capacity and management
within the platform.
Market Outlook
In the UK and European markets the
reduction in the number of new vehicle
programmes has been partially offset by a
significant increase in the number of
platform life-extension and technical
insertion programmes. Further, there are
also upgrade programmes, as a number of
platforms procured to meet urgent
operational requirements over the last
decade of operations, are now being
absorbed back into core service. Ultra as a
provider of specialist capabilities is well
positioned to be able to support such
upgrade programmes. In the UK, the
Group has teamed with Morgan Advanced
Materials to provide the through-life
support of the UK Mastiff platforms. In the
US, despite the budgetary pressures which
led to the cancellation of several large new
vehicle programmes, the DoD has funds for
a number of platform upgrade
programmes, which offer opportunities for
Ultra given the Group’s electronic
architecture capabilities. More broadly, the
export market place is growing with a
number of prospective new vehicle and
upgrade programmes being initiated. This
includes the established markets of India
and Australia and the emerging markets in
the Middle East and Far East. In the Middle-
East, Ultra is working in partnership with an
indigenous platform provider to support
the upgrade of the existing vehicle fleet.
Combined, these potential programmes
offer significant opportunities and volumes.
Military forces are beginning to look 
how they can integrate soldiers and their
associated systems into the wider land
battlespace. Ultra is actively exploring
opportunities with a number of customers
regarding how it can apply its advanced
power management technologies to 
the soldier.

Market overview
Commercial aerospace remains a vibrant
sector with predictions of growth in core
markets of 4.8% per year. Large aircraft
manufacturers are buoyed by record order
backlogs that exceed 10,000 aircraft. This
growth in platform numbers is driven by
the demand for new aircraft in the
developing markets of Asia and South
America. The more established markets are
demanding new aircraft that offer
increased fuel efficiency and cost savings,
through use of innovative, lighter, smaller
and less power-hungry sub-systems, as well
as meeting the new regulatory
requirements. The military aerospace
market continues to see growth driven
predominantly by the production ramp up
of the existing major military aircraft
programmes. There are few new military
aircraft programmes, with the market
focused on technical insertion and
capability upgrades of existing airframes.
This is driving growth in the demand for
pneumatic stores ejection.
Market Outlook
In the civil aerospace sector, the twin aisle
market continues to grow and remains
dominated by Airbus and Boeing. Ultra
provides specialist wing ice protection
systems to the Boeing 787 and has recently
secured a contract to provide electrical
Ground Door Opening systems (eGDO) to
Airbus for its new A350 family of aircraft.
The single aisle market is also in growth,
but is seeing new entrants from the
emerging nations bidding for market share.
The regional aircraft market remains
crowded with competition from state
owned companies vying for national and
export orders. Investment in the business
jet market is focused on larger aircraft,
where Ultra has recently secured business
on the new Gulfstream aircraft. This has
resulted in a downturn across light and
medium aircraft, which instead is seeing
growth in airframe updates and refresh. In
the rotary wing market, growth drivers are
the emergency services, and oil and gas
users. Key requirements in this market are
minimising platform through-life costs. In
the military aerospace sector, the fixed
wing combat aircraft market will be
dominated for the next 20 years by the
projected sales of the F-35. Existing fixed
wing combat aircraft are still vying for
export orders in an increasingly competitive
sector. Ultra provides numerous products
and systems, including precision
pneumatics (HiPPAG) and human machine
interface systems, to a number of aircraft 
in this sector including F-35, Typhoon and
F-18. The air transport market is seeing a
number of competitors looking to fill the
niches left by C-17 and C-130. In this
sector Ultra has secured positions on the
Embraer KC-390 and on the Airbus
A400M. Although the UAV market
previously saw high demands, this was
driven by operational needs which are now
waning, and overall the UAV market
remains immature. Whilst there are a
number of UAV technology demonstrator
programmes, the real challenge in this
sector remains the safety case to support
successful airspace integration.

1 2 20 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Market overview
Budgets for security remain ring-fenced or
are growing substantially in the face of
terrorism, organised crime and drug
trafficking. Border security and critical
national infrastructure protection
opportunities are rising. This is driving the
increased market requirement for
surveillance and security solutions,
particularly in the Asia-Pacific, Central
American and Middle-East markets. The
market is seeing a growing demand for
interoperable and mobile networks that
deliver a single integrated picture showing
timely situational awareness. With a
growing number of devices capable of
collecting sensor data operating across
multiple communications networks,
integrated surveillance systems are now
increasing in complexity and scale.
Solutions need to be tailored to customer
need, comprehensive and be able to draw
upon “best of breed”, established and
clearly differentiated technologies.
Manpower pressures are resulting in
increased automation and a growing
dependency on technology based
solutions, particularly for surveillance tasks.
The reliance on air power as the principle
mechanism for early or urgent delivery of
military effect is driving the demand for
airborne intelligence, surveillance, target
acquisition and reconnaissance
(ISTAR).There has been a significant
growth in the use of unmanned air
vehicles and the associated intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance payloads.
The challenge remains the timely and
secure dissemination of such data, typically
video, around the battlespace. 
Market Outlook
In the civil security market, coastal and
port surveillance is expected to see limited
growth in the West whilst spending
elsewhere is expected to continue. The
land and border surveillance market will
continue to grow driven by geo-political
tensions, immigration control, smuggling
and trafficking. Identity and forensic
analysis is driving the increased need for
interoperability and information sharing
across law enforcement agencies nationally
and internationally. Ultra’s recent
acquisition of Forensic Technologies adds
greatly to the Group’s market access to this
sector. The protection of critical national
infrastructure (facility/enclaves surveillance)
is a growing market as governments begin
to counter the vulnerabilities through
increasing adoption of video surveillance
and wireless technologies. Ultra’s advanced
cyber security, communications and
surveillance capabilities mean that it is well
positioned in this sector. The
communications and intelligence
surveillance market continues to see
demand, but remains politically sensitive
following the Snowden leaks. 
In the defence market, recent and current
operations and experience will result in an
increased demand for precision strike,
reduced collateral damage and extended
stand-off ranges. Emerging doctrine places
more emphasis on intelligence and
surveillance assets together with the ability
to fuse or correlate these data streams into
a single real-time integrated picture that
can be disseminated down to the lowest
level. This is driving the growth in real-time
ISTAR (for both manned and unmanned
platforms) and the connectivity between
assets in the battlespace. Ultra’s leading
data fusion, situational awareness and
visualisation systems play well to this
growing need. In the land environment
there is a drive to replace ‘boots on
the ground’ with technology
wherever possible, especially for
covert surveillance.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Market overview
The military and security communications
market is seeing a greater demand for
interoperability, mobility and rapid
deployment solutions, alongside an
increased desire for smaller, faster, easier-
to-use technology that is less complex to
configure. This is translating into the
gradual modernisation of legacy equipment
and systems. The customers’ desire to
maintain interoperability throughout these
modernisation programmes is resulting in
smaller evolutionary changes as opposed to
step changes. This evolutionary approach
allows customers to exploit commercial and
modified commercial off the shelf
technology. In particular, the shift towards
using software defined solutions that
enable fast cycle upgrades to capability,
and the use of open and commercial
standards. The other key factor driving the
market in the exploitation of COTS
technology is the reduced funding that
military customers now have to develop
bespoke solutions. Globally there is a
growing reliance on machine to machine
(M2M) communications, especially in key
industrial and critical national
infrastructure. There is now a considerably
increased awareness of the vulnerabilities
of such systems and the market now
recognises the need for solutions to secure
M2M communications and industrial
control systems.
Market outlook
In general, the demand to deliver secure
voice, data and video communications is
increasing. This is driving the requirement
for faster performance using lower cost
platforms. More specifically, the data link
market is seeing an increased demand for
secure full motion video and C2 data links
to deliver real time situational awareness to
the smallest platforms at the tactical edge.
Ultra’s broad range of advanced data link
and communication and airborne gateways
solutions are strengths in this sector. This in
turn is driving the demand for high
performance radios and the demand for
more bandwidth and broader connectivity
(gateway) solutions. Ultra’s Orion multi-
mission radio has performed well in trials
with customers and means that the Group
is well positioned to deliver the next
generation of radios. The satellite earth
station market continues to be focused on
smaller, more portable and mobile
solutions that deliver higher bandwidth X
and Ka band solutions. Looking at the
encryption market, there is a general move
from link to IP based cryptographic
solutions. This is coupled with the move
from paper based key to electronic key
distribution and management systems.
Ultra, with its proven next generation of
end cryptographic products and strong
position in both UK and US cryptographic
programmes, allied to the Group’s proven
electronic key distribution and
management solutions, is well positioned
in this sector.
Overall, the secure low power
communication market is experiencing a
considerable increase through the growing
prevalence of connected devices. In this
sector Ultra is able to build on its reputation
as a trusted supplier of wireless network
solutions. Finally, the secure M2M
communications market is growing to
match the growing awareness of the threat
to unsecured industrial control systems.
Ultra’s proven certified security solutions
which are tailored to meet critical national
infrastructure and industrial needs position
the Group well in this sector.

2 4 Market overview
There are over 430 commercial nuclear
power reactors operating in 31 countries.
They provide over 11% of the world’s
electricity as continuous, reliable base-load
power and remain an important part of the
low carbon energy mix. In addition 56
countries operate about 240 civil research
reactors, with many of these in developing
countries. Globally there are over 70 new
reactors under construction. Many of the
new builds are proceeding within emerging
economies and in those countries where
there is substantial state backing. The
emphasis in established western markets
has however largely shifted to a shorter
term focus on safety system upgrades, life
extensions and emergency management
and plant sustainment programmes. In
addition to this the UK has recently
received approval from the European
Commission to proceed with a new
commercial model it has pioneered in
support of new nuclear build ambitions.
The nuclear market is generally very
conservative and supported through large
multinational organisations, however there
remain several complex niches served by
smaller specialist companies. It is a highly
regulated market, with high barriers to
entry, and as such is dominated by a
number of well-established global players.
The qualification of sensors and products
across multiple standards and platforms is
extremely expensive and offers further
barriers to entry once established. 
Market Outlook
Although the nuclear market is a long
cycle one, with plants taking several years
to come to completion, the outlook is
positive. Much of the current global fleet
of plants will need life extensions and
upgrades. These plants are largely older
analogue Instrumentation and Control
(I&C) designs, with the biggest market by
far being the US. The new build, digital,
I&C market which is currently dominated
by China, India and Russia, is of a similar
order of magnitude. Ultra has invested
significantly in new facilities for the test,
development and manufacture of sensors.
This has shown its value through enabling
recent contracts wins with EDF for the
provision of specialist sensors. The Group
currently provides equipment to 186
reactors across 16 countries, plus another
31 reactors currently under construction.
Furthermore the Group is uniquely
qualified on 8 new types (as well as many
legacy plants), meaning that it is well
positioned for the future.
The Fukushima accident has prompted
further growth in the nuclear emergency
management market, where there has been
a global reassessment of post-accident
response and support needs. Plant safety is
now increasingly reliant on secure data, and
as such cyber security is now a key part of
meeting the formal safety requirements.
Security concerns around proliferation and
the threat of terrorism are also driving the
growth in new deployable security and
surveillance systems for nuclear plants and
enhanced border security. Ultra’s domain
knowledge, through its suitably qualified
and experienced personnel (SQEP), coupled
with its extensive security and surveillance
capabilities (as described in C2ISR cluster on
page 20), position Ultra well in this sector.

Market overview
Transportation, including airport systems
and rail remains an area of strong
investment world-wide. The increase in
global air traffic and national prestige
projects is driving investment in airport
infrastructure. Rail infrastructure, globally,
is growing even more rapidly as a key
commercial and national enabler in both
established and emerging economies. In
established economies infrastructure
investment is focused on upgrading
existing capabilities and driving economic
recovery. In emerging economies, such
investment is being used to secure growth
and build national capacity.
Increasing global demand for energy has
led to the power generation, power
distribution, secure power management
and renewables markets also witnessing
increased investment, although these
markets generally face specific regional
regulatory and economic nuances.
Competition in the Airport IT market is
growing with many previously niche
products becoming commoditised. Allied 
to this, competition for major projects is
increasingly fierce.
Market Outlook
In the airport sector, the market for Airport
Master Systems Integration is experiencing
significant growth, especially in the demand
for tier 2 airports. This is particularly so in
the Middle East, Asia and South America
where there are number of capital projects.
The Airport & Airline Information
Management market is forecast to see
investment grow, although many of the
operational systems are now becoming
commoditised. There is increasing
polarisation between global commoditised
offerings and those with more localised
niche expertise, so Ultra will focus on the
ability to provide comprehensive solutions
over individual products. In light of the
termination of the Oman IT contract and
the loss of the Abu Dhabi Mid-Field
Terminal opportunity, Ultra has reviewed its
airport IT activities in the Middle-East.
Whilst the Group expects to continue to
do business in the region, and sees
opportunities for new contracts, there may
be some challenges in the short term.
The Rail Transit Power Conversion &
Control market is anticipated to see
significant growth. However, with the
exception of the Rail Control sector, the
market is becoming increasingly price-
sensitive. In the Power Management &
Renewables sector, the growing need for
compact, power dense solutions plays to
Ultra capabilities with energy storage and
fast switching both being key drivers for
growth. The Secure Energy Management
sector is forecast to see substantial
investment, particularly in areas related to
secure monitoring, analysis and control.
Although the Smart Grid market is
growing, it is likely to remain fragmented
until the appropriate regulatory
frameworks are established. However
Ultra’s broader secure communication and
data portfolio stands it in a good position.

Non-ﬁnancial performance indicators
Ultra’s four strategies for growth are described on pages 12 and 13 of this report. Performance indicators relating to the Group’s success
in these four dimensions are shown on those pages. The Group’s right people are its most important asset. Performance indicators that
relate to the recruitment, retention and development of Ultra’s staff are included on page 46 of this report. Ultra’s 2014 results
The order book at the end of 2014 was
£787.3m compared to £781.2m in the prior
year, despite a £96.9m reduction relating to
the removal of the Oman contract from the
2014 order book. Excluding Oman, order
intake of £760.0m in the period (2013:
£630.0m) led to underlying order book
growth of 7.2% with additional growth
from acquisitions of 6.8% and a foreign
exchange beneﬁt of 1.1%.
Revenue
The revenue of £713.7m represented a
decline of 4.2%, or £31.5m from the prior
year (2013: £745.2m). The contribution
from acquisitions was offset by the
negative impact of foreign exchange on
translation of overseas revenues and an
organic decline of 10.1%, 4% of which
related to the Oman Airport IT contract.
Following termination of the contract on 
9 February 2015, cumulative contract
revenue is £114m, of which £12m was
recognised in the ﬁrst half of 2014,
compared with £42m during 2013.
With approximately 50% of revenues sold
in US dollars, Ultra was impacted by an
increase in the US dollar rate to 1.65 (2013:
1.56) which reduced revenues by 3%.
Acquisitions contributed 9% to revenue,
primarily reﬂecting the impact of 3 Phoenix,
and Forensic Technologies together with
Lab Impex Systems and ICE acquired during
2014 as well as contributions from Varisys
and Wood & Douglas which were
purchased in 2013.
Excluding the impact of Oman, the organic
revenue decline of 6% comprised reductions
across all three divisions.

…the Group’s businesses sustained their focus on costs, delivering an
underlying operating margin of 16.5%. In Aircraft & Vehicle Systems, there were
increases in sales of specialist ice
protection systems and in revenue from
the Airbus A400M cargo handling system.
However these were offset by the impact
of the award and delivery of an £8m
urgent operational requirement in the ﬁrst
half of 2013.
As well as the impact of the Oman
termination, Information and Power
Systems is the division most impacted by
delays in the US defence and security
contract placement process with reduced
demand for both law enforcement and
security products, particularly legal
intercept, and also communication systems. 
There was also a reduction in revenue 
from our rail power management business
and from nuclear reactor control and
instrumentation sales in the UK although
this was partially offset by increased
revenues from nuclear temperature sensors
in the US and from the Virginia Class
submarine programme.
In Tactical & Sonar Systems, revenue from
US and international Anti-Submarine
Warfare (ASW) was strong, and there was
an increase in sales on international
command and control programmes. In
addition the two larger acquisitions made
in 2014, 3 Phoenix and Forensic Technology
have been integrated into this division.
However these positive impacts were
partially offset by reduced sales of Litening
Pods, and fewer radio spares sales together
with the impact of US budget cuts and
contract delays. 
Operating proﬁt and margins*
Underlying operating proﬁt* was £118.1m
(2013: £121.7m). Acquisition growth
contributed 7.8% which was offset by a
negative foreign exchange impact of 2.2%
and an organic decline of 8.6%. The
Group’s businesses maintained their focus
on restructuring their cost bases which
sustained an underlying operating margin
of 16.5% (2013: 16.3%). 
Following the securing of a number of new
orders to develop products for the
aerospace sector, Aircraft & Vehicle Systems
margins have been impacted by increased
R&D investment and lower margins during
the engineering phases of projects. The
prior year comparator also included the
high margin urgent operational
requirement, which, contributed to the
decline in margin to 17.5%. In Information
& Power Systems, the decline in sales
resulted in an overall decline in gross
margins, however the divisional margin
increased to 14.3% due both to overhead
cost savings and the reduced contribution
from the lower margin Oman Airport IT
contract. In Tactical & Sonar Systems,
proﬁts and margin rose reﬂecting increased
volume and margins on sonobuoys
together with the positive impact of the
prior year restructuring at Ultra’s TCS radio
business. There were also overhead cost
savings across the division.
Acquisitions contributed an additional
£9.5m to proﬁt, primarily in Tactical &
Sonar Systems, reﬂecting the acquisitions
of 3 Phoenix and Forensic Technology
during 2014.
Ultra continues to invest in research and
development to support future
opportunities; this investment, at £41.2m,
represented 5.8% of group turnover.
Interest and proﬁt before tax*
Net ﬁnancing charges*, excluding the
unwinding of discounts on provisions, fair
value movement on derivatives and the net
interest charge on deﬁned beneﬁt
pensions, were £6.1m (2013: £4.9m). The
increase reﬂected higher debt balances as a
result of the acquisitions during the year,
partially offset by the impact of lower rates
following the renewal of the revolving
credit facility in July 2014. The interest on
bank debt was covered 20 times (2013: 25
times) by underlying operating proﬁt*.
Underlying proﬁt before tax was £112.0m
(2013: £116.8m).

Ultra’s IFRS proﬁt before tax reduced from
£49.3m (2013) to £21.5m. An exceptional
non-underlying charge of £47m relating to
the Oman Airport IT contract has been
recognised in Proﬁt before tax. Proﬁt before
tax also includes a £7.3m charge reﬂecting
the impairment of the acquired goodwill
relating to Ultra’s minority shareholding in
the Al Shaheen joint venture, following a
review of our activities in the Middle East.
The prior year included the impairment of
the acquired goodwill relating to ProLogic. 
The £4.5m of acquisition related adjustments
included the release of an £8.4m provision
relating to the GigaSat earn out agreement
for which the 2014 target was not met
Tax, EPS and dividends
The underlying tax rate* reduced to 23.2%
(2013: 24.3%) due to a combination of
lower UK rates and the release of
provisions, following the close of certain
tax enquiries around the world.
Underlying earnings per share* were
123.1p (2013: 127.1p), a decrease of
3.1%. A ﬁnal dividend of 31.1p (2013:
29.5p) is proposed. If this is approved at
the Annual General Meeting, this will give
a full-year dividend of 44.3p (2013: 42.2p)
and will be covered 2.8 times.
Operating cash ﬂow
Underlying operating cash ﬂow* was £83.1m
and the ratio of cash to underlying operating
proﬁt was 70%. This represented an increase
from the £79.0m (65% conversion) recorded
in 2013, due predominantly to the phasing 
of working capital movements. The cash to
operating proﬁt ratio over a rolling ﬁve-
year period is 83%. 
Capital expenditure on property, plant 
and equipment was £8.4m, compared to
£13.9m in the previous year which
included investment in the Neutron Flux
Detector at Wimborne and the Cyber
facility. Expenditure in 2014 included
replacement of equipment across a
number of businesses.
Capital expenditure on intangible assets
(not acquired through acquisitions) was
£9.3m (2013: £7.7m), with the majority
relating to commercial aerospace and
investment to support the next generation
multi-mission radio. There was also
investment in ERP systems for our US
businesses. Amortisation of the same asset
class was £3.4m (2013: £2.9m).
There was a net inﬂow of working capital
of £12.2m, compared to an outﬂow of
£32.4m in 2013. There was an outﬂow of
inventories of £4.4m (2013: £4.2m) across
a range of businesses, notably in the
Group’s aerospace businesses, to support
customer requirements. The inﬂow for
receivables of £74.0m (2013: £43.1m
outﬂow) and an outﬂow of payables of
£57.3m (2013: £14.9m inﬂow) includes
the write-off of balances in Oman,
following the termination of the Airport IT
project. Excluding the impact of Oman,
debtors reduced by £18.8m reﬂecting the
expected unwind of the prior year position,
however creditors increased by £19.2m
partially reﬂecting the unwind of a number
of long term advanced payments. 
Non-operating cash ﬂow
With underlying operating cash ﬂow* of
£83.1m (2013: £79.0m), the Group funded
various non-operating items with net debt
increasing to £129.5m (2013: £42.2m). The
main non-operating items were:
• cash tax of £22.9m (2013: £25.6m) 
• acquisition spend of £107.5m (2013:
£24.7m) including acquisition fees and
other acquisition related payments, with
the majority of the spend in respect of the
four acquisitions completed in the year
• dividend payments of £29.7m, (2013:
£28.1m)
Treasury and balance sheet matters
Effect of acquisitions
The four acquisitions made in the year, 
3 Phoenix, Forensic Technologies, ICE and
Lab Impex Systems were made at a total
purchase consideration of £112.5m,
including related acquisition fees of £2.2m
The purchase consideration includes cash
acquired of £6.7m. In addition £1.7m was
spent on prior year acquisitions and fees.
Banking facilities
Ultra’s current banking facilities amount to
£300m in total, together with a £15m
overdraft. They are provided by a small club
of banks, led by the Royal Bank of
Scotland, and comprise two tranches. The
ﬁrst tranche is a £100m revolving credit
facility, which can be drawn down in any
major currency and is due to expire in
December 2017. The second tranche
provides a further £200m of revolving
credit, was signed in July 2014 and is due
to expire in December 2019. This second
tranche follows the renewal of the £90m
facility which was due to expire in 2016,
but was reﬁnanced early to ensure
continuity of funding and to take
advantage of improved interest terms. Both
facilities have the same covenants.
The Group also has a ‘shelf’ facility with
Prudential Investment Management Inc
(‘Pricoa’). This agreement effectively gives
the Group access to the US private
placement market on a bilateral basis. The
facility is non-committed, but is for up to
$195m. At 31 December 2014, $70m of
loan notes had been issued, which will
mature in 2018 and 2019. By using the
Pricoa facility, Ultra has been able to
extend the term proﬁle of its debt at a
competitive rate.
As well as being used to fund acquisitions,
the ﬁnancing facilities are also used for
other balance sheet and operational needs,
including funding day-to-day working
capital requirements. The US dollar
borrowings also represent natural hedges
against assets denominated in that currency. 
At the year-end, the total borrowings
drawn from the revolving facilities were
£122.0m (2013: £27.0m), giving headroom
of £178.0m (2013: £163.0m) in addition to
the £15m overdraft. £44.8m (2013:
£42.4m) of Pricoa loan notes had been
issued. The Group also held £41.3m of
cash, which was held for working capital
purposes and to fund acquisitions.
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong,
with net debt/EBITDA of 1.0 and net interest
payable on borrowings covered around 20
times by underlying operating proﬁt.

*see footnote on page 132 Interest rate management
Much of the Group’s current ﬁnancing has
been taken on to fund acquisitions in North
America. To reduce the risks associated
with interest rate ﬂuctuations and the
associated volatility in reported earnings,
Ultra has issued a total of $70m of ﬁxed-
rate, seven-year, notes to Pricoa.
Consequently, the Group has extended the
term proﬁle of its debt and has also ﬁxed a
substantial proportion of its interest for the
same seven-year period. The amount of
ﬁxed-term debt and the associated interest
rate policy is kept under regular review.
Pensions
Ultra offers company-funded retirement
beneﬁts to all employees in its major
countries of operation. Many UK staff with
longer service still participate in the Ultra
Electronics Limited deﬁned beneﬁt scheme,
which was closed to new entrants in 2003.
This is a contributory scheme in which the
company makes the largest element of the
payments, which are topped up by
employee contributions. The scheme was
actuarially assessed, using the projected
unit method at 31 December 2014, when
the net scheme deﬁcit, calculated in
accordance with IAS19, was £68.6m,
compared to £68.2m in 2013. The present
value of the liabilities rose by £36.3m in
2014, mainly because of the lower
discount rate, driven by the lower yield on
corporate bonds. The increase in the
scheme liabilities was offset by a £35.8m
increase in the value of the scheme assets.
There was a full actuarial assessment
carried out as of April 2013, the result of
which was a funding deﬁcit relating to past
service of £99.8m before tax, representing
an increase of £36.2m from the previous
funding deﬁcit. Following the completion
of the assessment, Ultra reached
agreement with the pension scheme
trustee board to eliminate the deﬁcit
through additional deﬁcit payments over a
10.5 year period; £8.0m in 2014, rising to
£8.5m in 2015 and £9.0m per annum for
the following 8.5 years. The next valuation
will take place as of April 2016.
The scheme has a statement of investment
principles which includes a speciﬁc
declaration on socially responsible
investment. This is delegated to the
investment managers. Pension
management and governance is
undertaken by the pension trustees on
behalf of the members. The trustees
include both company-nominated and
employee-elected representatives.
All staff who have joined Ultra in the UK
since the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme was
closed in 2003, have been invited to
become members of the Ultra Electronics
Group Personal Pension Plan and since
April 2011, the Ultra Electronics Group
Flexible Retirement Plan. Under the terms
of this deﬁned contribution scheme,
company payments are supplemented by
contributions from employees.
Certain employees at TCS in Canada
participate in a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme.
This scheme is closed to new employees
and had an IAS19 net deﬁcit of £0.9m at
the end of the year (2013: £0.6m). Regular
payments continue to be made, with both
company and employees making
contributions, so as to maintain a
satisfactory funding position. The Group’s
remaining Canadian employees participate
in a number of deﬁned contribution
pension plans. In the US, Ultra offers a
deﬁned contribution 401(k) retirement
beneﬁt plan to all full-time employees.
Under this plan, Ultra provides participating
and contributing employees with matching
contributions, subject to plan and US
Internal Revenue Service limitations.
Certain employees at the Swiss subsidiary
of Forensic Tecnology, acquired during
2014, participate in a deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme. The scheme had an IAS19
net deﬁcit of £0.2m at 31 December 2014. 
Foreign exchange risks
Ultra’s results are affected by both the
translation and transaction effects of
foreign currency movements. By their
nature, currency translation risks cannot be
mitigated, but the transaction position is
actively managed. 
The majority of sales made by Ultra’s
businesses are made in local currency, thus
avoiding any transaction risk. However, this
risk does arise when businesses make sales
and purchases which are denominated in
foreign currencies, most often in US dollars.
To reduce the potential volatility, Ultra
attempts to source, in US dollars, a high
proportion of the product sold in US
dollars. For the remaining net expense, the
Group’s policy is to hedge forward the
foreign currency trading exposure in order
to increase certainty. The expected ﬂows
are reviewed on a regular basis and
additional layers of cover are taken out so
that, for 2015, 100% of the expected
exposure is covered, reducing to 80% of
the exposure for 2016 and 36% for 2017.
Exposure to other currencies is hedged as it
arises on speciﬁc contracts.

aerospace sector, the divisional proﬁt has
been affected by increased R&D investment
and lower margins in the engineering

Embraer KC390 and MRJ. This was partially
offset by the impact of overhead savings.
The acquisitions of Varisys, during the ﬁrst

whilst foreign exchange partially offset this.
The resulting divisional margin was 17.5%

> Sales from the Oman Airport IT
programme during the ﬁrst half of 
the year were down reﬂecting the
prolongation of the overall contract.
Following notice of the termination 
of the programme we have taken a
prudent approach in the year,
recognising only £12m revenue in the
ﬁrst half of the year, and no proﬁt. In
2013, the division’s results included
£42m of revenue and £4m underlying
operating proﬁt from Oman. 
This division is the one most impacted by
delays in the US defence and security
contract placement process with reduced
demand for both high margin law
enforcement and security products,
particularly legal intercept, and also
communication systems.
There was also a reduction in revenue from
our rail power management business
recognising the maturity of the commuter
power market as the focus in the UK moves
on to high speed rail. Our nuclear business
in the UK was impacted by reductions in
reactor control and instrumentation revenue
following the Heysham reactor partial
shutdown and the extended decision
making process on Hinckley Point C. This
was partially offset by increased revenues
from nuclear temperature sensors in the US
and also from sales into the Virginia Class
submarine programme.
Although the acquisition of Lab Impex
Systems contributed to the divisional
revenues and proﬁts, this was offset by 
the negative effect of foreign exchange
across the division.
Proﬁts declined in the division as a result 
of these factors. However the cost savings
implemented during the period and the
reduction in the dilutive effect of the Oman
Airport IT contract resulted in a slightly
increased divisional margin of 14.3%. 
The order book change reﬂected the
removal of the Oman Airport IT contract,
but beneﬁted from a major contract award
from EDF Energy and the acquisition of 
Lab Impex Systems.
Strategy in action
In June 2014, Ultra’s EMS business was awarded a multi-year contract totalling over
US$21m from General Dynamics Electric Boat Corporation. The contract is for the
production of naval computer controlled power supply systems with deliveries over
the next five years.

> Revenue from US and international
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) was
strong, and there was an increase in
sales on international command and
control programmes. This increase was
partially offset by reduced sales of
Litening Pods, and fewer radios spares
sales together with the impact of US
budget uncertainty and contract
delays. The two larger acquisitions
made in 2014, 3 Phoenix and Forensic
Technology have been integrated into
this division.
Proﬁt rose by 29.6% reﬂecting increased
volume and margins on sonobuoys
together with savings from the prior year
restructuring at Ultra’s TCS radio business.
Further beneﬁt was derived from overhead
cost savings across the division.
The acquisitions also made a signiﬁcant
contribution to proﬁt, although this was
partially offset by the impact of foreign
exchange translation. As a result divisional
margin rose to 17.4%.
The order book increase included the ﬁrst
year’s order from the IDIQ sonobuoy award
from the US Navy, as well as the Litening
Pod CLS extension. This was supplemented
by the acquisitions of 3 Phoenix and
Forensic Technologies and by the effect of
foreign exchange.
Strategy in action
In May 2013, Ultra’s 3 Phoenix business was awarded three contracts totalling over
US$21m from the US Navy. The scope of these contracts includes work packages for
torpedo warning systems, submarine towed anti-submarine warfare arrays and radar
command and control software.

Description
Active efforts are being made to penetrate
Ultra’s networks, in order to gain access to
classiﬁed information, steal intellectual
property or disrupt business activity. There
is a security and business risk if Ultra fails
to secure its systems.
Potential impact
• Reputational damage to Ultra as a highly-
regarded provider of secure data systems
• Loss of business opportunity with removal of
government approval to work on classiﬁed
equipment development and manufacture
• Reduced product differentiation with loss of
intellectual property
• Disruption to business activity as systems are
cleansed and restored
Mitigation 
• Internal Audit and ‘spot checks’ to ensure
compliance with the Group Information
Security Policy
• Development of policy for classiﬁcation of
Group information assets
• Investment in the hardening of Ultra’s 
IT systems
• Implementation of monitoring by the Ultra
Cyber Protection Group will continue into 2015
Risk 1. Cyber-attack
• Probability – High 
• Trend – Decreasing
Description
Ultra’s core markets are changing as
government budgets come under ﬁscal
strain, placing signiﬁcant pressure on sales
and orders. Contract awards are more
heavily scrutinised and are more
dependent upon a close understanding 
of the customer’s need.
Potential impact
• Reduced business opportunity through 
an inability to respond quickly enough to
changes in the market environment by 
adapting our offerings and approach
• Inability to match the full range of a 
customer’s requirements
• Inability to maintain growth in declining 
defence market
Mitigation 
• Embed LAUNCH behaviours to improve
understanding of customer need
• Collaborate across the full Ultra capability
portfolio and/or partner to present
comprehensive solutions that match customer
needs, complemented by a structure and 
culture that promotes agility, innovation and
speed of response
• Develop and strengthen the marketing teams
within each business
Risk 2. Changing market environment
Description
Ultra is bidding for and delivering 
an increasing number of large and
complex contracts.
Potential impact
• Ultra could underestimate the required resource
or project complexity and so make a loss
• Ultra could fail to apply the appropriate
programme management skills to such 
large products, impacting on proﬁtability 
and reputation
• Ultra could need to provide for additional 
costs incurred until the end of the programme
(some years)
Mitigation 
• The Group Operating Manual has been 
updated to enhance the rigour and oversight 
of major bids
• ‘Lessons learned’ exercise to be conducted on
Oman and a ‘major integration projects
manual’ to be developed as corporate memory
• Ultra will recruit or team to bring in the
specialist skills required to manage large projects
• Introduction of project-team-based system
engineering and project management training
courses
• Review and approval of win strategies and 
bids will be conducted by the Executive team
and other senior managers independent of the
businesses or technologies involved
• More prudent proﬁt taking to be enforced 
ahead of acceptance milestones

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Description
Ultra has elected to cede some control of
certain businesses (e.g. US Proxy Board and
joint enterprises) to enhance market
position in key markets. Changes in local
regulation, or other cause, leads to an
adverse impact on the Group.
Potential impact
• Inability to exercise management control could
lead to an adverse impact on the Group
Mitigation 
• Ultra works hard to ensure that its joint 
venture partners and the members of the
Group’s security and proxy boards accord with
the Group’s corporate culture and way of 
doing business
• Ultra beneﬁts from the expertise which the
members of its JVs and boards bring to the Group 
• Ensure relationships continue to be mutually
beneﬁcial 
• Monitor the business environment for regulatory
or political change
• Bring the Proxy Division (SIS) under a US
national director with the appropriate clearances
Risk 5. Business control
Description
Currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations
impact adversely on Ultra’s business
performance.
Potential impact
• Ultra’s revenue and earnings could be adversely
impacted by the weakening of a currency in
which it generates sales
• The impact of foreign exchange could either be
through translation of the balance sheets and
proﬁts of foreign operations, or the impacts of
UK businesses transacting in a foreign currency
Mitigation 
• The translation impact cannot be mitigated
however the Group Finance Director ensures that
analysts and investors are aware of the impacts
• Transaction impacts are mitigated through the
Treasury policy of hedging forecast cashﬂows, and
where possible through ensuring that contracts
provide protection against exchange movements,
and cost and revenue currencies are matched
Risk 6. Currency Fluctuations
Description
Ultra is increasingly operating in regions 
of the world that are at risk of political
upheaval or untoward national event. 
Potential impact
• A major regional event impacts on the ability of
Ultra to deliver a signiﬁcant contract, leading to
unrecoverable revenue loss
• A political change within an established regional
market substantially removes Ultra’s ability to
operate successfully
Mitigation 
• Maintain an effective regional understanding
through good regional contacts and
partnerships, particularly through UK embassies
and UK/US defence and security agencies
• Develop positions across different regions 
to avoid singularity of risk
• Maintain awareness through research to raise
awareness and understanding of emerging crisis
and potential risk
• Consider regional risks during bid approval
Risk 7. Major geopolitical crisis
Description
The Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme deﬁcit becomes a serious liability
for the Group.
Potential impact
• Increasing pension liabilities make a material
impact on shareholder value
Mitigation 
• Retain Board focus on this key issue and hold
formal reviews of the Group’s pension strategy
annually
• Manage the issue through annual accounting
and triennial valuation processes, in order to
highlight issues to the Board as they emerge
• Retain Towers Watson as Group pension strategy
advisors and hold formal Board strategy reviews

Risk 9. Material legal/regulatory breach
Description
The Group’s businesses are capital-light,
but specialist knowledge-intensive. Ultra
fails to attract, develop and retain people
with the required specialist competences. 
Potential impact
• Ultra could lose key staff or capabilities, so 
that the Group cannot fulﬁll its contractual
obligations, or is forced to outsource work,
thereby reducing margins
Mitigation 
• Continue the Group’s strong emphasis on
recruiting, retaining and developing high-quality
individuals to work in Ultra teams. This is
delivered through the annual OSDP
(Organisation, Succession and Development
Planning) process
• Fast-track high-potential candidates and exploit
opportunities for secondments and inter-business
transfers
• Ensure all key staff have a nominated successor
• Ensure poor performance is addressed
• Monitor and review salary and beneﬁts surveys
• Engage with potential recruits at an early stage,
through links with schools and universities and
offer apprenticeships, work placements and
graduate training
Risk 10. Staff retention
Description
Ultra’s product development and
innovation does not sustain sufﬁcient
differentiation in the market place,
compared with commercial off the shelf
(COTS) products, or as a result of a
disruptive technology, or because of a
signiﬁcant change in customer preference.
Potential impact
• Research and Development (R&D) activity 
does not keep pace with technological
development, losing product differentiation
compared with competitors
• Ultra’s portfolio of specialist capabilities is
eroded through commoditisation
• Business is lost through increasing competition
Mitigation 
• Maintain Ultra’s cultural focus on understanding
customer need and delivering innovation
• Based upon comprehensive market and
competitor analysis, generate technology and
product roadmaps that bring differentiated
products to market to meet sales opportunities
• Better co-ordinate R&D investment across the
Group to avoid duplication and maximise
advantage
• Employ strategy reviews and game-planning 
to ensure R&D tracks plans and budgets
• Team externally to gain access to technology

40 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Ultra recognises that the success 
and sustainability of the business is
enhanced by positive relationships
with our stakeholders and continues
to focus on value creation for ALL its
stakeholders: local communities,
shareholders, customers, employees,
the environment and suppliers
*STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths)
In the Community:
Ultra’s businesses continue to be active
in local communities to create positive
links by engaging with local people and
local issues. Many businesses have
formed special relationships with
education establishments in the
surrounding communities; offering work
placements and visits to businesses as
part of AS level courses; providing
interview practice sessions, supporting
lessons, careers events and school
science fairs. Ultra also takes part in the
broader dialogue on STEM* education
at a national level and offers Arkwright
scholarships, a scholarship which
sponsors students looking for a career in
engineering through their A-level
education. Ensuring a long term supply
of talent to the business is essential and
Ultra dedicates itself to developing the
talent pipeline in schools and higher
education institutions. Each operating
business has its own locally-managed
charitable budget, which it directs to
maintain and grow connections with its
local community. Fundraising and
voluntary work in the local community
or at a national level is something the
Group is keen to encourage and actively
supports employees who undertake in
voluntary activities. Some noteworthy
examples in 2014 include:
• Forensic Technology, runs a “CSI for 
a day” initiative in local schools with
the goal of giving back to local
communities. Employees teach the
science behind forensic sciences, the
students then apply their learning to a
ﬁctional situation in order to identify
the guilty party. The winning team is
rewarded with book scholarships if
they continue their education. 
• Ultra is sponsoring a new WWI
exhibition at Bletchley Park, Milton
Keynes. The Bletchley Park site played
a signiﬁcant role during the Second
World War and this sponsorship will
help to generate more visitors and
also help to educate those who visit.
• Ultra’s Maritime Systems business
operates its own community working
group choosing one main charity 
to focus on each year as well as
helping various other organisations.
This year they chose the local charity
Feeding Others of Dartmouth
(F.O.O.D) and undertook many
fundraising activities and an employee
volunteering programme to provide
support to the charity.

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
…Shareholders:
Ultra aims to extend its long track record
of delivering above-average shareholder
returns. The Group’s primary objective is
to continue to outperform the market by
delivering above-average increases in
earnings and by communicating
effectively, through various means, with
shareholders and the financial community.
…Customers:
Ultra aims to be an excellent strategic
supplier to its customers. To do so, Ultra’s
businesses are focused on helping
customers identify their true needs whilst,
developing long-term relationships, based
on performance excellence and meeting its
commitments. Ultra’s businesses have built
long-term, mutually beneﬁcial relationships
with their customers and have become part
of the customers extended enterprises.
Examples from 2014 highlight Ultra’s
commitments to its broad customer base:
• In the aftermath of the search and rescue
operation for Malaysian Air Flight 370,
Ultra’s Avalon and USSI businesses
collaborated with the Australian Defence
Force (ADF) to provide a ﬂight recorder
“black-box” locating solution through
“specially-programed” sonobuoys.
Involvement in providing this solution
evolved from a conversation between
Avalon and the ADF on search
possibilities on a Wednesday; to USSI
manufacturing pallets of the specially
conﬁgured buoys for loading on a
military aircraft on Saturday the same
week. Due to this extraordinary effort
from Ultra, the ADF was able to execute
and deliver a plan for the special-
programed buoys for search and rescue
operations in just one week. 
• The US Navy’s NAVSEA Command has
recognised Ultra 3Pi by awarding the
Team Excellence Award for its role as
prime contractor for the Torpedo
Warning System and as a key member of
the joint government/ industry Surface
Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) Team. The
SSTD Team met the Chief of Naval
Operation’s requirement to deliver a
rapid prototype torpedo defence
capability on to a deploying aircraft
carrier in less than 2 years. 
• Ultra’s NCS business supported EDF
Energy in planning and performing
advanced signal diagnostics at one of
their Dungeness B Advanced Gas Cooled
Reactors to validate the operation of
sensors without requiring the reactor to
be shut down. The period from initial
contract to data analysis at the station
took less than two weeks and avoided
the need for an expensive reactor outage
in order to replace the sensors.
…Employees:
Ultra believes that the right people are its
most important asset; the ability to
innovate continually and meet customer
needs is based on the capabilities of its
employees. Ultra has a strong commitment
to developing people and securing the
talent pipeline, further details of which can
be found in the section Developing Ultra’s
People. The Group believes that to ensure
its continuing growth and success these
initiatives for talent development and
people retention are essential. However,
ultimate responsibility for individual talent
development resides within each of Ultra’s
businesses, a number of which have
launched unique initiatives to ensure
continuing employee development.
A few examples include:
• Ultra’s Airport Systems business has
introduced MAD (Making a Difference)
awards and every day hero awards to
provide recognition to staff who have
exceeded performance or made an
exceptional impact to the business. This
is part of the effort to increase focus on
thanking people for their contribution.
• During 2014 Precision Air & Land
Systems launched its Employee Voice
initiative with the aim of capturing
employees’ concerns following the move
to a new site. Focus groups were
organised to identify issues and following
this Improvement Teams were put in
place to follow through on action plans. 
• Ultra’s TCS business implemented a points
system where employees can nominate
other employees who went above and
beyond their duties. The points can be
used for small gifts. This program created
an atmosphere of respect and recognition
and ultimately of engagement.
…the Environment:
Ultra is committed to implementing and
enforcing effective measures to minimise
the environmental impact of its activities.
Following on from the pilot programme,
launched last year, with the Carbon Trust,
Ultra has assessed a further site in 2014.
Site assessments look at the environmental
impact of the operating businesses. At
both its Loudwater and Weymouth sites
opportunities have been identiﬁed to
reduce the environmental impact while
identifying material cost-savings which will
beneﬁt shareholders. Both sites have begun
to implement the recommendations
including; replacing all light bulbs and
sensors with LED technology and updating
insulation and pipework. The Loudwater
site is also beginning the review process for
some larger projects such as a new heating
system and more efﬁcient ventilation and
heat recovery. The Carbon Trust will
continue to audit other sites during 2015.
Ultra continues to be committed to
investing in manufacturing facilities to offer
increased efﬁciencies and reduce energy
consumption, while improving productivity
across the business. The Group also looks
for its suppliers to reduce their
environmental impact. At Ultra’s Maritime
Systems business cardboard packaging
from suppliers has been eliminated from
some assembly lines through the use of
reusable, collapsible packaging. Additionally
this report has been printed on a carbon
neutral printer.
…to Suppliers:
Ultra views its suppliers as an extension of
the Ultra enterprise as many businesses
rely on these suppliers for delivery of their
products and services. Many products and
services are safety- or performance-critical
in their end markets so working together 
is crucial. Partnership with suppliers and
customers generates innovative and
differentiated solutions which are at the
core of Ultra’s business model. Many Ultra
businesses work with their suppliers to
enable them to operate more efﬁciently.
For example, Maritime Systems help local
suppliers through the Canadian and US
export registration processes.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
The right people
The broad range of skills and capabilities
held by the Group’s employees are why
Ultra is successful in innovating to meet
customer needs.
As such the Board has recognised that 
the Group’s right people are its most
important asset. Therefore people and
their development are key initiatives for
the Group as it strives to achieve an
efﬁcient organisation with engaged and
competent people.
Domain expertise
Ultra prides itself on its deep understanding
of its specialist capability areas, combined
with knowledge of the users’ environment.
These are the key factors in delivering
innovative solutions to meet customers 
needs. To enable Ultra to develop its
domain expertise it ensures that its
employees also have the best expertise in
their ﬁeld. This allows the Group to have
the right people available to the customer
and who are best able to support their
needs in understanding and creating
solutions which fulﬁl these.
How Ultra manages its people
Ultra values the autonomy of its businesses
and believes a high degree of operational
autonomy enables businesses to focus on
delivering agile and responsive support to
their customers.
The Managing Directors and Presidents of
Ultra’s individual businesses, and their
management teams, are given as much
authority and responsibility as possible.
This allows these teams to maintain the
agility and sharp focus that is typical of
owner-managed businesses.
Without the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of its staff Ultra
would not be able to deliver value to customers.
People in action
Ultra’s Nuclear Control Systems
business is taking great strides to
address the skills gap within the
nuclear industry. They have developed
a strong mentoring culture within the
business to support the retention of
young talent. A strong advocate and
avid supporter of this is Senior
Engineer, Andy Durrant. 
Andy began his career in 1969 and has
been in the Nuclear Industry for 39
years. He is a Chartered Engineer (CEng)
and a member of the IET. Andy plays an
integral part in the recruitment of
graduates within the company and
always goes that extra mile to help;
providing working lunch talks with
young talent on professional
membership and the progression paths
open to graduates and apprentices.
Andy is truly passionate about helping
the next generation learn and has
invested signiﬁcant time and effort into
mentoring. He sees the importance not
just of technical competence but also in
developing broader skills by challenging
his graduates to network with
customers, engage in community and
educational events, and by ensuring
they too have a plan to progress to
becoming a mentor. Without the
“Andy’s” in businesses such as this, role
models would not be there to provide
direction, commitment and most
importantly that impetus to ‘want to
come to work’ and make a difference.
Graduates and
apprentices really
make a difference 
to the team spirit
bringing engineers
together to assist in
their mentoring.

Culture
Culture is what drives Ultra’s success and 
includes values, role models, processes,
procedures and the behaviours of its
employees. Ultra is committed to keeping
its culture strong as the Group expands
through organic growth, natural staff
turnover and acquisitions. The Group’s
culture, values and behaviours are shaped
by the guiding principles, in particular the
call for “an efﬁcient organisation with
engaged and committed people”. To
achieve this, Ultra has identiﬁed four
cultural behaviours of its people which are
highly valued and encouraged. These are
Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Audacity and
Paranoia. Together, they are known within
the Group as LEAP.
What people mean to Ultra
The broad range of skills and capabilities 
of Ultra’s employees support the Group’s
success in innovating to meet customer
needs. The quality of Ultra’s leadership
teams is constantly reviewed and improved
as this is essential to the continuing growth
and success of the Group. Ultra’s aim of
delivering an efﬁcient organisation, with
engaged and committed people to meet
the Group’s business commitments is a goal
all mangers work towards and is a measure
of their success. Many companies state that
their people are the company’s most
important asset. Ultra varies this slightly:
the right people are the Group’s most
important asset.
Growth through engagement
LAUNCH is a set of behaviours which the
Group has developed to facilitate customer
engagement and relationship building.
L Listen to customers
A Ask the right questions
U Understand what their ‘pain’ is
N identify the customers Needs; 
and get their agreement
C Create a relationship, opportunity 
and solution
H Holistic. Examine the bigger picture; 
how can Ultra maximise the scope
and value of the opportunity?
This approach ensures Ultra understands
the real needs of its customers; in addition
LAUNCH is a way for Ultra’s businesses to
generate long-term customer relationships
which leads to a better pipeline of
opportunities and so ultimately, enable
growth. LAUNCH is aligned with the
Group’s approach to systems engineering
and project management.

Ultra is committed to developing people and securing the talent pipeline to ensure the continued
growth and success of the Group. Great focus is placed on ensuring that the right people are in the
right roles. Furthermore businesses are responsible for and encouraged to develop their teams and
individuals continuously, which will enable people to grow with the business and not become a
constraint on the development of the Group.
Leadership: Good leadership is
extremely important to Ultra and a
number of models of leadership are
incorporated in the development and
training programmes which are
delivered around the Group.
Entrepreneurship: Being
entrepreneurial is a behaviour which
underpins the Group’s strategy. All
Ultra businesses seek to provide
customers with solutions which are
different from, and better than, those
of competitors. Ultra’s entrepreneurial
culture seeks to maximise the capability
to generate excellent ideas and the
business skills needed to bring them
successfully to market.
Audacity: Audacious thinking is the
difference between incremental
improvement and business
transformation. It takes the idea of
innovation, one of Ultra’s core values,
and invites employees to think about
issues in ways which are unconstrained
by existing norms, making use of
creative approaches in every aspect of
the Group’s business.
Paranoia: Paranoia, in the business
sense, is a concern and fear about
competitors and what they may do. It
also relates to concerns and fears
about things which can go wrong
internally. For Ultra, paranoia is
important in focusing its staff on
maximising their knowledge of the
competitive landscape, by constantly
asking questions of the Group’s
individual businesses, customers,
teaming partners and suppliers. 44 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Securing the talent pipeline
Ultra has been committed to developing
people ever since it was formed in 1993.
There are a number of programmes which
help the Group to attract the best people,
as well as encouraging students to develop
careers in engineering or business.
SCHOOLS
Ultra engages with local schools near many
of its businesses. Relationships with schools
and sixth form colleges take a variety of
forms; from work experience, longer work
placements, visits as part of AS level
courses, interview practice sessions, careers
events and Ultra employees supporting
both lessons and after school clubs.
Examples include: 
• Ultra’s ATS business received the
Distinguished Partnership Award from 
Del Valle Independent School District for
its outstanding contributions throughout
the year to Smith Elementary School.
• The Group’s NCS business has sponsored
the local Young Entrepreneur award, and
the “Enterprise Challenge” through a
social enterprise schools initiative. It held
mock interviews at local schools to help
develop employability skills, and hosted
industry talks with a local college. 
• In Middlesex Ultra has worked closely with
Greenford High School and during this
period the school has reported an increase
in the number of students applying for
engineering degrees at university. 
Ultra’s focus is mainly engineering but also
includes other STEM* subjects, ﬁnance and
commercial disciplines. Ultra also sponsors
students through their last years at school
via the Arkwright Scholarship. This provides
students with support and mentoring
during their studies and has led to students
electing to undertake STEM degree courses.
Ultra is a recognised major sponsor of the
scheme and currently has 10 scholars.
APPRENTICESHIPS
Many Ultra businesses have well
established and successful apprenticeship
programmes, which have later provided the
Group with engineering leaders. The Group
runs apprenticeship schemes at most of its
UK businesses and we currently have 46
apprentices in training in the UK.
There have been a number of notable
successes: this year one apprentice was a
ﬁnalist in the West London Business
Awards and received a commendation and
another was ranked in the top eight in a
World Skills competition.
NCS has worked with local engineering
ﬁrms to promote the “Apprentices mean
business” and the “Apprentice
Ambassador” network for Dorset.
Additionally it is an active member of the
Dorset Young People Forum and Dorset
Chamber of Commerce. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES
As well as traditional careers fairs Ultra
actively engages with lecturers and faculties
during degree courses as the Group has
excellent links with universities around the
world. This allows Ultra access to leading
research and enables it to form relationships
with students well before graduation. The
Group beneﬁts from working with
universities as it can collaborate on
innovation and recruit students who can
make a difference. Ultra currently has 10
sponsored university students and also
provides a number of work placements as
part of degree courses (16 in the last year).
Ultra businesses provide opportunities for
students to work on real projects via work
placements, co-operative programmes and
internship schemes; all internships are paid 
for, to promote access to all. The Group also
works with SEPnet to provide summer work
placements to students to help advance and
sustain physics as a strategically important
subject for the UK economy.
SUCCESS STORIES
• A school work experience student
returned to Ultra for paid vacation work,
was sponsored through their university
degree, completed their undergraduate
placement year and has begun work as a
graduate for the Group
• One former Ultra Arkwright Scholar has
been sponsored through university and is
expecting to graduate with a ﬁrst class
degree in 2015 when it is hoped he will
join Ultra in a full-time role
INSTITUTIONS
Ultra businesses worldwide have a variety
of links with their local business forums and
chamber of commerce members, helping
to encourage STEM* activities. Ultra’s
businesses are members of Engineering UK,
Cyber Challenge UK and other bodies
which research and develop new ways to
attract people into engineering careers, as
well as helping to forecast future trends in
the sector.

Engineering education Training and development
Ultra actively invests in and supports the
training and development of its employees.
Each business is responsible for identifying
the training needs of its employees and
managing its own training budget.
Employee performance and development
reviews are held annually, at a minimum,
and are used to identify the development
needs of individuals. Ultra has invested in
its Learning Academy, which is an online
portal, available to all of the Group’s
businesses to support training.
Speciﬁc training programmes are provided
for individuals as necessary. Many of these
are courses tailored to the speciﬁc
requirements of Ultra and the trainers have
an intimate knowledge of how the Group
operates across all of its businesses. These
training events include programmes on
leadership and management, along with
workshops on Ultra’s successful competitive
strategy, strategic selling, programme
management and systems engineering.
In 2014 Ultra’s Controls business set up 
the ‘Ultra Controls Academy’ which is an
inter-departmental initiative to formalise
and structure internal training courses.
Supporting drives to achieve best in class
performance and be continually recognised
as a world-class design and manufacturing
facility. Controls has brought teaching
practices in-house to create a more focused
and relevant training environment.
Additionally it can be expanded for all
future needs, as well as, be made available
to other businesses.
Businesses also look for further opportunities
to develop training outside of their training
budget. For example, Ultra’s fuel cell
business has received a $29,000 training
grant from the Michigan Skilled Trades
Training Fund. The fund is designed to
provide funding to companies who are
looking to enhance the existing skill-sets of
their workforce and the business will use
the funds to pay for Six Sigma Green Belt
certiﬁcation, soldering and wire harness
certiﬁed instructor training, and
programming and reporting training on
their ERP system.
Ultra’s businesses have developed
corporate partnerships with engineering
institutions, including the Institution of
Engineering and Technology, in order to
support and encourage employees to
pursue professional recognition (in the
form of CEng, IEng, or EngTech status) for
both their current and previous work and
academic achievements. To give students
access to real-life current work challenges,
and to enable Ultra employees to develop
their management and leadership skills,
there are opportunities to participate in
national schemes, such as the Engineering
Education Scheme (run by the Engineering
Development Trust) and competitions
promoting STEM* careers.
*STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths)
Ultra actively

training and
development of 
its employees.
Case study
Local students teamed up with
graduate engineers from Ultra’s
Precision Air & Land Systems business
to design a man-worn health
monitoring system for professional
soldiers. The system monitors health
aspects that the team deemed to be
the most important to the soldier. The
inspiration behind the project came
from the news about 3 soldiers who
died whilst undertaking a training
mission in the Brecon Beacons from
dehydration in a record heat wave in
the summer of 2013.
The team developed a comprehensive
list of the medical parameters and
identiﬁed technologies which could
help measure these key items. Research
varied from the assessment of existing
products to evaluating entirely new
approaches, particularly in the area of
water intake measurement which was a
key issue for the project. The team
went on to identify sensors for many of
the key measurements and to specify
suitable technologies. Supported by
Ultra engineers the students were able
to build a ﬁnal prototype of the body
worn equipment and programme the
monitoring interface.
The value of the system to Ultra
Precision Air & Land Systems has been
clearly demonstrated and the Head of
Advanced Technology Tony White, has
proposed submitting the system design
as a bid for funding from the Centre of
Defence Enterprise. 46 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Succession planning and retention
Each of Ultra’s businesses prepares an
annual ‘Organisation, Succession and
Development Plan’ to ensure that Ultra has
the right people in the right place in the
organisation. The plan assesses individuals
against their performance in their current
role and their potential to perform a larger
role in the short or longer term.
Assessments are recorded in Ultra’s Talent &
Succession system and give a performance
versus potential rating for each employee.
The system is used by businesses to ensure
a supply of suitable talent is available when
required and recognises that any role within
Ultra may become more challenging as the
business grows. The performance
categories consist of ‘exceed’, ‘meet’,
‘partially meet’ or ‘does not meet’ the
standard performance level. Equal attention
is given to enhancing the performance and
retention of those who meet and exceed
standard performance levels and to
addressing the challenges of the people
who fall into the ‘partially meet’ or ‘does
not meet’ categories. Where an individual is
not meeting the standard performance level
it often means that they need to be placed
in a role more suited to their talents, and in
which they can start to perform to the
required standards, It does not always mean
that those individuals must leave Ultra.
Ultra has a high retention rate of those
individuals in the businesses’ senior
management teams, who continually meet
or exceed expectations in terms of their
performance, or who are high-potential
and still developing in their new role. The
Group is able to create its next generation
of business leaders, through developing
and retaining those employees identiﬁed as
having high potential who will be able to
take up the challenge of continuing the
growth and expansion of Ultra.
Ultra has been able to appoint a high
proportion of its leaders at Board, divisional
and business level through internal
promotion. This is because the succession
planning element of the process aims to
ensure that there are always suitable
successors for all the management team
roles across each business and for other
senior level roles.
As well as the people listed as successors,
each business also identiﬁes people with
high potential. The combined list represents
Ultra’s ‘high-potential’ talent pool and is
used regularly to ﬁnd the right people to ﬁll
internal vacancies, via the Group’s Talent &
Succession system. Ultra businesses attend
graduate and undergraduate fairs, utilising
current graduates as the Group’s
ambassadors. Attendance has seen
applications for graduate schemes increase,
and this in turn helps to ensure that there is
a future supply of engineers for the Group.
In a typical year, Ultra recruits over 600 new
employees and acquisitions bring additional
new people into the Ultra family.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Ultra is committed to maintaining high
standards of business ethics as part of
being a responsible business. The Group
strives to uphold the rights of its employees
and create an honest and transparent
business both internally and externally. The
Group’s corporate responsibility initiatives
are focused in the following key areas:
Human rights
The Group recognises and respects the
rights of not only its employees but all
stakeholders and communities that it
encounters. As such, Ultra adheres to all
relevant government guidelines, designed
to ensure that its products are not
incorporated into weapons or other
equipment used for the purposes of
terrorism, internal repression or the abuse
of human rights as instructed by the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights. Ultra’s Board requires that the Group
should, at all times, be a responsible
corporate citizen and, as such, the Group
complies with all applicable legislation in
the countries in which it operates.
Ethical business conduct
Ultra is committed to ethical business
conduct.
MEETING LEGAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS
Ultra requires all employees, businesses and
third parties, who act on Ultra’s behalf, to
comply fully with its Policy Statement on
Ethics and Business Conduct and with the
applicable laws and regulations of the
countries in which it does business.
Ultra is committed to operating in
accordance with all legislative requirements,
including those pertaining to anti-bribery
and corruption practices, relevant national
export control regulations and competition
and anti-trust laws.
Ultra has a corporate ethics code, which
encompasses a gifts and hospitality policy.
All Ultra businesses are required to report on
compliance with the corporate ethics code
monthly. In addition, the Board reviews
compliance with the code twice a year.
The Ethics Code can be found in Ultra’s
Policy Statement on Ethics and Business
Conduct and its policies on anti-corruption
and bribery, competition compliance and
gifts and corporate hospitality. All of these
policies can be found on the Group website.
www.ultra-electronics.com/about-
us/corporate-responibility.aspx
PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND 
TRAINING TO EMPLOYEES
The Group continues to strengthen 
its policies, processes and training to
ensure employees have the clear guidance
they need in identifying and managing
ethical matters.
EthicsPoint is a Group-wide independent,
conﬁdential web-and telephone-based
hotline, which enables all employees to
anonymously report concerns about possible
improprieties and other compliance issues.
This is known as the Ultra Electronics
Employee Helpline.
All reports registered through EthicsPoint are
reviewed and responded to in a timely and
appropriate manner. The responsibility for
handling reports rests with Ultra’s senior,
independent Non-Executive Director (other
than US security-related issues which are
routed through the directors of the Special
Security Arrangement Board or Proxy Board).
No retaliatory action is taken against
employees for making reports in good faith
through EthicsPoint. Any employee found to
be in breach of the Policy Statement on
Ethics and Business Conduct is subject to
appropriate disciplinary action.
INDEPENDENT ETHICS 
OVERVIEW COMMITTEE
The Ethics Overview Committee was formed
with the remit to provide independent advice
and scrutiny of Ultra’s business activity,
providing assurance that the Group’s current
and planned undertakings are conducted in
a manner consistent with the legislative
environment and are transparent. The
Committee comprises six permanent
members, three of whom, including the
Chairman, are independent.
To maintain the highest degree of
impartiality, the independent members of
the Committee are self-selecting with the
appointment of the Chairman exclusively
within the remit of the independent
members. The Committee meets quarterly
and provides assurance that Ultra’s
business is being conducted in line with
the Group’s policies, processes and
relevant legislation. It does this through
discussions with senior managers, receiving
reports and visiting Ultra’s businesses. The
Committee undertakes a formal review of
business activities during these reviews and
the independent members provide advice
and guidance on the appropriateness of
target markets and customers and on
potential teaming partners. The
Committee also considers the reports that
come through the EthicsPoint helpline.
Diversity and inclusion
These values are embedded into the
organisation to ensure a business which is
truly representative of the environment in
which it operates. It is essential that all
employees feel fairly treated and are not
discriminated against in any way. To enable
this, Ultra complies with all applicable
employment rights and legislation in the
countries in which it operates. The Group is
strongly committed to maintaining a work
environment which provides equal
opportunities for all employees, regardless
of nationality, gender, ethnic background,
sexual orientation, religious beliefs, marital
status, disability or age. This is exempliﬁed
by the formation of the Diversity working
group, a Head Ofﬁce initiative lead by Mary
Waldner, Ultra’s Group Finance Director to
ensure diversity and inclusion is
championed amongst all of the businesses.
Ultra uses rigorous recruiting practices to
ensure the best candidate is selected, based
on objective requirements and assessments.
Ultra monitors gender and age diversity.
Sustainability (continued)
Corporate and Social Responsibility 
Ultra believes that a successful and sustainable business is built 
on more than just ﬁnancial results. Ultra has built a reputation for
meeting its commitments and a consistent track record of development
and growth. This reputation is based on Ultra’s businesses meeting
their obligations and the manner in which they do so.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Disabled employees 
Applications for employment by disabled
people are always fully considered, bearing
in mind the aptitudes of the applicant
concerned. In the event of members of
staff becoming disabled, every effort is
made to ensure that their employment with
the Group continues and that appropriate
training is arranged. It is the policy of the
Group that the training, career
development and promotion of disabled
people should, as far as possible, be
identical to that of other employees.
Health and safety
The safety and well-being of the Group’s
employees and visitors is a key priority for
Ultra. A healthy, committed workforce,
working in a safe environment, is necessary
to achieve superior business results. The
businesses manage a wide range of safety
risks, ranging from ofﬁce employees,
manufacturing employees and employees
providing services at customer sites,
including military bases and platforms. The
Group is committed to upholding and
improving health and safety across the
whole business and engaging in
continuous safety improvement activities.
The safety of the products and services
provided to users and customers is also of
importance to Ultra. Each individual
business ensures the appropriate legal and
ethical levels of safety are met across a
product’s life cycle, with particular
emphasis on the manufacturing, in-service
and disposal phases.
All Ultra operating business’s are required
to have a written health and safety policy,
which is to be upheld at all times.
Managing Directors and Presidents are
responsible for health and safety within
their business and for providing adequate
resource to meet the requirements of the
health and safety policy. Compliance is
assessed through independent external
audits which take place bi-annually. The
Chief Executive is the Board member with
overall health and safety responsibility.
The Board reviews each business’s 
annual report on health and safety
performance, which they are required to
submit, along with the result of the health
and safety audits.
The reportable/recordable accident rate has
decreased over recent years and is shown
in ﬁgure 1. Lost time accident data per
200,000 hours has been recorded for the
whole Group since 2010 and is shown in
ﬁgure 2.
The reportable/recordable accident rate 
per employee for 2014, fell from 0.77% 
to 0.51%.
Environment
Ultra is committed to putting effective
measures in place to minimise the
environmental impact of its activities. This 
is important both for its employees and the
communities in which it operates, as it will
help to secure the long-term future of the
Group. These measures include both the
operational business environment 
and the products and services which the
Group provides.
PRODUCTS
Environmental considerations are taken
into account throughout a product’s life
cycle, from concept through to disposal;
each individual business ensures its
practices and processes consider this.
Businesses work with their suppliers to
reduce the impact of their products and to
maximise the use of environmentally-
acceptable components. Ultra ensures the
full co-operation of all employees to
minimise environmental impact and
maximise the conservation of materials.
OPERATIONAL
The Managing Directors and Presidents 
of the operating businesses are
responsible for the implementation of 
the environmental policy and the Chief
Executive is the main Board member 
with overall environmental responsibility. 
Where it is appropriate, individual
businesses have ISO14001 accreditation.
Ultra’s formal environmental policy
addresses compliance with environmental
legislation, conformity with standards for
air, waste disposal and noise, the
economical use of materials and the
establishment of appropriate environmental
performance standards. Progress is
monitored through annual reporting and a
bi-annual external audit process, the most
recent of which took place in 2014.
Each site plans and manages compliance
with environmental requirements and the
processes for the storage, handling and
disposal of hazardous or pollutant materials
are reviewed on a continuous basis. Ultra
has caused no contamination of land in
2014, continuing the excellent track record
of the previous ﬁve years.

In addition,there were no environmental
incidents reported in the year.
In the UK, businesses are encouraged and
incentivised to reduce the net amount of
waste they produce. Ultra measures and
reports on its packaging waste annually
and this is shown in Figure 3.
The Group is working hard to address
energy conservation and emissions. Energy
consumption is measured annually and the
data compared with previous years.
As part of the Carbon Reduction
Commitment (CRC) programme Ultra, in
the UK, is registered with the Environment
Agency. The Group’s compliance emissions
reported for 2013/14 were 8,424t CO
2
.
Historic performance data is shown in
ﬁgure 4.
Ultra’s data for 2013/14 is available on the
Environment Agency’s website.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Ultra is committed to the systematic
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In
compliance with the 2013 Greenhouse Gas
Emissions Regulations, Ultra has collected
and consolidated information on carbon
dioxide (CO
2
) emissions from across its
portfolio of 27 businesses; 2013 was the
ﬁrst year this was undertaken and serves as
the baseline year.
Methodology
In 2014, each UK business reported on the
appropriate greenhouse gas metrics. These
metrics were aggregated to produce the
ﬁgures reported below to which standard
DEFRA conversion factors were applied.
Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme
The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme
(ESOS) is a new piece of legislation
introduced by the UK Government which
applies to Ultra. The scheme is run by the
Environment Agency (like CRC) and its
focus is to reduce the demand for energy.
The ﬁrst qualiﬁcation phase ends on 31
December 2014 with reporting required in
2015. An initial piece of work has been
launched which will lead to compliance. 
Additional environmental initiatives
In 2013, in addition to tracking its carbon
emissions, Ultra partnered with the Carbon
Trust to conduct a holistic Energy Review of
Ultra’s Command & Control Systems (CCS)
business, headquartered in Loudwater, UK.
Following on from this pilot programme
the Carbon Trust has assessed a further
site, in Weymouth (CEMS), in 2014. Both
sites have begun to implement the
recommendations including; replacing all
light and sensors with LED technology and
repairing and updating insulation and
pipework. Loudwater are also beginning
the review process from some larger
projects such as a new heating system and
more efﬁcient ventilation and heat
recovery. The Carbon Trust will continue
onto other UK sites throughout 2015.

Corporate Governance Report
Governance
Chairman’s governance statement Dear shareholder,
One of the key responsibilities of
a board of directors is to agree
its company’s strategy. As the
Chief Executive outlines in his
Review on pages 4 to 7, and as
we seek to demonstrate
throughout this Annual Report,
Ultra has a very clear strategic
path. Despite sustained pressures
on government budgets, at
home and abroad, Ultra’s
strategy, reinforced by its guiding
principles, culture and approach
to good corporate governance,
ensures Ultra remains a strong,
sustainable business.
Good governance
As the Directors review the strategy and
carry out their other duties, it is my role as
Chairman to lead the Board effectively. To
my mind, good governance is at the heart
of that. In order for you to see clearly how
we achieve that, we have provided a
corporate governance overview on pages
54 to 61. We also brieﬂy describe how this
structure supports the delivery of our
business strategy. You can ﬁnd more detail
in the full Corporate Governance Report.
On pages 36 to 39, we have also provided
an overview of the principal risks that might
prevent us from achieving the full potential
of our strategy. On page 58 we explain how
those risks are actively managed.
Board changes
During the year, the Board was engaged in
recruiting a Non-Executive Director. Details
of the process we followed are set out on
page 57. Mr John Hirst CBE joined the
Board on the 1 January 2015 and will seek
election at the 2015 Annual General
Meeting. John’s strong industry experience
and his understanding of the role risk
management plays in strategic decision-
making, combined with his knowledge of
regulatory and governance issues, will
further strengthen the Board’s governance
processes. A summary of John’s
biographical details is on page 57.
As was reported in the 2013 Annual Report
and Accounts, having served for over ten
years as a Non-Executive Director, Chris
Bailey will resign at the 2015 Annual General
Meeting. He will hand over the Chair of the
Audit Committee to John Hirst and Chair of
the Nomination Committee to Douglas
Caster. Sir Robert Walmsley has agreed to
take the role of the Senior Independent
Director following Chris’ retirement. On
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank
Chris for his excellent service in these roles
and wish him well in his retirement. In
November 2014, Martin Broadhurst became
Chair of the Remuneration Committee.
Appreciation
Before closing, and on behalf of the Board,
I want to thank the employees of Ultra
whose efforts helped us achieve so much in
what has been a difﬁcult year. I want to
express my appreciation to Rakesh and all
the members of the Executive Team for the
leadership they have shown. Finally, I would
like to thank all my fellow Directors for the
contribution they have made to our
discussions throughout a busy 2014.

Corporate Governance Report
Compliance statement
Throughout the financial year ended 
31 December 2014, the Board considers that it
and the Company have complied with the
provisions set out in the September 2012
edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code
(the Code). The Code is issued by the Financial
Reporting Council and is publicly available on
their website (www.frc.org.uk). This corporate
governance section of the Annual Report &
Accounts describes how we have applied the
main principles of the Code.
Role of the Board
The role of the Board is to provide effective
leadership and direction in delivering the key
corporate objective of reliable and consistent
growth in shareholder value. The Executive
Directors set the Group strategy which is subject
to challenge before final agreement by the full
Board. The Board also ensures that adequate
controls are in place, including calibrating risk
appetite and maintaining oversight of Ultra’s risk
management processes. The Board receives
regular compliance reports. The Board
encourages the Group’s businesses to behave
ethically and properly at all times and engenders
a culture of fairness to customers, suppliers and
employees. It is the function of the Group’s
management, through the Chief Executive and
his Executive Team, to run the operations of the
Group. During 2014 there were changes to the
Executive Team structure. Details on this can be
found on page 55.
The Board is responsible for major investment
decisions such as acquisitions and the allocation
of the Group’s R&D expenditure to major new
projects. To this end, in addition to the ten
scheduled Board meetings, the Board held 
seven unscheduled Board meetings in the year.
The Board conducts regular reviews of the 
major projects being undertaken by the
operating businesses.
A summary of some of the Board’s key
responsibilities and activities is set out opposite
and the full range of Board responsibilities are
detailed in the document entitled ‘Matters
reserved for the Board’ which is available from
the Investors’ section of the Group website.

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
How does the way we are governed support the delivery of our strategy? 
Good Governance is crucial to ensuring we are well managed and can deliver our strategic priorities.
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Nomination Committee
Chairman: Chris Bailey
Talented people are critical to the delivery of 
the Group’s strategy. The Nomination
Committee’s role is to keep under review the
structure, size and composition of the Board; 
to recommend appointments to the Board and
its Committees and to consider succession
planning to Board positions. 
Further details on page 60.
Audit Committee
Chairman: Chris Bailey
To deliver the Group’s strategy we must have
sound financial and non-financial controls. The
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing
our financial reporting, internal controls, risk
management and our relationship with our
external auditor. 
Further details on page 60.
Remuneration Committee
Chairman: Martin Broadhurst
We seek to reward senior management
competitively, to enable Ultra to recruit,
motivate and retain executives of high calibre
whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration
payments. The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for ensuring the remuneration of
Executive Directors and senior managers is
aligned with corporate strategy and objectives
along with the interests of shareholders. 
Further details on page 60.
The Board
Chairman: Douglas Caster; Senior Independent Director: Chris Bailey
All the Directors are collectively responsible for the success of Ultra. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising independent
and objective judgement and for scrutinising and challenging management.
The Board is responsible for approving our strategy and policies, for oversight of risk and corporate governance, and for ensuring expected returns on
investment are made from leveraging our portfolio strength. The Board is accountable to our shareholders for the proper conduct of the business and
our long-term success. It represents the interests of all stakeholders.
The Board has delegated some of its powers to three Committees (see below) and the Chief Executive (see below).
Members of the Board and their biographies are shown on pages 50 to 51. 
Chief Executive: Rakesh Sharma
The Executive Team comprises:
Chief Executive; Group Finance Director; Group Marketing Director; Chief Operating Officer; 
Group Human Resources Director and Company Secretary & General Counsel
The Executive Team is the body through which the Chief Executive exercises the authority delegated to him by the Board. It considers major business
issues and makes recommendations to the Chief Executive, and typically also reviews those matters which are to be submitted to the Board for its
consideration. The Chief Executive is responsible for establishing and chairing the Executive Team. 
Ethics Overview Committee
Three independent members: 
David Shattock (Chairman); Martin Bell; Major General (retired) Tim Cross
Three Ultra members: 
Chief Executive; Company Secretary & General Counsel; Managing Director Aircraft & Vehicle Systems division

Ultra is committed to ethical business conduct. In this regard, the Group has the beneﬁt of an independent Ethics Overview Committee. 56 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Governance (continued)
Corporate Governance Report 
Board meetings 
Comprehensive briefing papers are circulated to
the Directors in advance of each Board meeting to
enable an informed debate to take place at Board
meetings. Acquisition opportunities are presented
to the Board by the appropriate Divisional
Managing Director or President. This enables a full
discussion of the merits and risks of any
acquisition proposal to take place at an early
stage. Other significant matters that require
formal Board approval which are routinely
presented by the appropriate business include
major bids, updates on key strategic initiatives and
major capital and private venture development
expenditure proposals. The Executive Team as a
whole meets the Board annually to present the
proposed Strategic Plan for the next five years.
This is then debated with the Directors, changes
agreed and a final plan is approved. 
The scheduled Board meetings are rotated around
the sites of the operating businesses. During
2014, the Board visited seven operating
businesses in the UK. The Board held one of the
meetings at its joint venture subsidiary (Ultra
Electronics in collaboration with Oman Investment
Corporation LLC) in Oman, following a tour of the
Salalah and Muscat airport developments. 
During Board meetings at Ultra’s operating units,
presentations detailing recent performance, key
opportunities and future forecasts are given by
the senior managers of the host business.
Product demonstrations and site tours also take
place. This gives the Non-Executive Directors a
good practical insight into the operating
businesses. The Non-Executive Directors will also
conduct individual visits to businesses.

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
In 2014, Chris Bailey, Non-Executive Director, 
stepped down as the Chair of the
Remuneration Committee and was replaced 
by Martin Broadhurst.
Throughout 2014, the Board structure was in
line with the Code.
Diversity
Ultra continues to follow its overriding policy of
appointing the best person for a particular role,
regardless of sex, race, nationality, disability, sexual
orientation, age, marital status, religion or beliefs.
The Board contends that a board composed of
the right balance of skills, experience and diversity
of views is best placed to support a company in its
strategic objectives. The Board has considered in
detail the requirements of the Code regarding
gender diversity. In selecting the best person for 
a role, the Board gives active consideration to the
benefits of diversity, including gender diversity.
However, setting diversity target aspirations,
especially by specific dates, can distort the
selection process and conflict with its preferred,
diversity-aware ‘best person for the role’
approach. How the Board addressed diversity in
its selection process for a Non-Executive Director is
set out on page 60. You can read more about
the Company’s initiatives to improve diversity
across the Group, including information on the
gender split across the Board, Executive Team
and the Company as a whole, in the sustainability
sections of our Strategic Report on page 47.
Board skills and experience
The Board has a balance of skills, understanding,
perspectives and experience relevant to the
Group’s activities. The Board collectively
possesses a deep understanding of the Group’s
core defence, security, transport and energy
markets. This is complemented by its members’
experience and expertise in other industries and
disciplines including procurement, accountancy,
financial management and growing international
businesses. This range of skills and experience
informs the Board’s decision-making and enables
it to provide effective leadership.
The particular skills and experience that each
Director brings to the Board are described in
their biographical details on pages 50 and 51.
The Company has a policy whereby Executive
Directors, but not the Chief Executive, may
accept one appointment as a Non-Executive
Director in another listed company. Executive
Directors are permitted to retain any fees from
such external appointments. 
Board roles
There is a clear division of responsibilities
between the Chairman, the Chief Executive and
the Senior Independent Director, such that no
one individual has unfettered powers of decision
making. This formal division of responsibilities
has been agreed by the Board and is summarised
in a table which can be found on the Investors’
section of the Group’s website.
Non-Executive Directors
Chris Bailey, Sir Robert Walmsley and Martin
Broadhurst are the Group’s independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Chris has served on the
Board for over 10 years and will retire as 
Non-Executive Director at the Annual General
Meeting in 2015, therefore the Board determines
that he is independent. John Hirst became a Non-
Executive Director effective on 1 January 2015.
The Board considers the Non-Executive Directors
to be independent. In assessing independence,
the Board considers that they are independent of
management and free from business and other
relationships which could interfere with the
exercise of independent judgment, now and in
the future. The Chairman has considered the
Non-Executive Directors’ performance in the year
and has determined them to be effective and to
have demonstrated commitment to their roles.
The Board believes that any shareholdings of the
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors serve to
align their interests with those of all shareholders.
The key role of the Non-Executive Directors,
along with the Chairman, is to provide an
appropriate level of challenge and constructive
criticism to the plans of the Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors met without the
Chairman or Executive Directors being present
during the year to discuss aspects relating to the
Board and the Company and appropriate
feedback was given.
On behalf of the Company, the Non-Executive
Directors are active in developing relationships at
a senior level with the Company’s key suppliers,
customers and business partners.
Insurance
The Group maintains an appropriate level of
Directors and Officers Liability insurance cover in
respect of legal action against its Directors.
Board appointments – the process
In making appointments to the Board, the
Board, through the Nomination Committee, is
careful to identify the skills, knowledge and
experience needed for each role and to
complement the existing skills mix provided by
other Board members. The process followed by
the Nomination Committee in appointing
Directors is described on page 60. To ensure
selection from the widest possible talent pool, it
is the Company’s normal practice to engage the
services of independent, external search
consultants in recruiting new Directors.

Corporate Governance Report 
Directors’ induction and training
All new appointments to the Board receive a
comprehensive induction to the Group covering
the Group’s strategy, the products and services of
the Group’s businesses, the key markets in which
the businesses operate, the key risks which the
Group faces (together with the actions and plans
which are in place to mitigate against these),
corporate and organisational structure, financing
principles and legal and regulatory issues.
John Hirst joined Ultra as Non-Executive Director
on 1 January 2015. On appointment, he
received a full induction pack explaining Ultra’s
governance framework, policies and procedures.
He had induction meetings with the Executive
Directors, Company Secretary & General
Counsel, HR Director, external audit
engagement partner and head of internal audit.
He will also undertake a programme of visits to
the Group’s businesses where he will meet with
the management teams of these businesses. 
The Company Secretary & General Counsel
annually presents to the Board on corporate
governance. The Board is briefed on significant
changes in the law or governance codes
affecting their duties as Directors. Experts
present to the Board on specialist areas, such as
pensions and tax. Specific training is arranged for
Directors as and when appropriate. The Directors
are able to call on independent professional
advice at anytime should this be necessary in
order for them to carry out their duties. 
Board evaluation
The Chairman commissions externally-facilitated
annual Board evaluations. Board evaluations run
on a two year cycle. One year, the effectiveness
of the Board and its Committees is evaluated.
The next year, individual Director’s performance
is evaluated.
In 2014, Mr Telfer of Auxesis Consulting Ltd
undertook an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Board and its Committees. The evaluation
was conducted through a questionnaire with
follow up discussions. A report was prepared for
the Board on the results of the exercise and Mr
Telfer attended a Board meeting at which the
report was discussed. The Board and its
Committees were considered to be fully effective,
and the action points, illustrated in the table
above, were identified.
Mr. Telfer has considerable experience of
working at board level. He was the Human
Resources Director of the Company up until
June 2004 (when he left the Company to set up
his own consultancy) and so was able to
facilitate the evaluation from a position of
having a good understanding of the Company
and its culture. He provides a valuable insight
into the Company’s challenges and needs and is
able to assess the Board and its Committees in
the context of the Company’s development.
Annual re-election of Directors
All the Directors will stand for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting on 30 April 2015
except for Chris Bailey who, after ten years in
tenure, will retire. In 2014, the Board appointed
a new finance specialist Non-Executive Director,
John Hirst. His appointment took effect on 
1 January 2015. John will seek election at the
Annual General Meeting and will replace Chris
as the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Conflicts of interest
The Company has in place procedures for
managing conflicts and potential conflicts of
interest. The Company’s Articles of Association
also contain provisions to allow the Directors to
authorise conflicts or potential conflicts of
interest so that a Director is not in breach of his
or her duty under company law. If Directors
become aware of a conflict or potential conflict
of interest they should notify in line with the
Company’s Articles of Association. Directors
have a continuing duty to update any changes
to their conflicts of interest. Directors are
excluded from the quorum and vote in respect
of any matters in which they have a conflict of
interest. No material conflicts were reported by
Directors in 2014.
Internal controls
The Directors carry out an annual review of the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
systems. This covers the ways in which identified
strategic, operational and financial risks are
managed. Particular attention in the year was paid
to business continuity planning and improving
information security management. Further, as part
of this assessment of internal controls the Directors
have considered the implications of the
termination of the Oman Airport IT contract and
have concluded that the control environment
continues to operate effectively, and that the
Company’s risk management procedures remain
appropriate. In light of this experience, the
Directors will review the application of the risk
management procedures to ensure that any
required enhancements are captured as part of a
continuous improvement.
Ultra’s internal controls are designed, and have
evolved over time, to meet the Group’s particular
needs and the risks to which it is exposed.
However, no controls can provide absolute
assurance against material errors, losses or fraud.
The key features of the internal control system
that operated during the year are described in
the Audit Committee report on pages 62 to 64.
Risk management
Risk assessment and management is not treated
as a separate function within Ultra. It is assessed
and managed as an integral part of all of Ultra’s
management and control processes. The key
features of the risk management system are
described in the Audit Committee report on
pages 62 to 64. 
Financial reporting systems
The Group has a well-established process for
collecting financial information from operating
businesses and for consolidating this at
Divisional and Group level.
Financial results for operating businesses, each
Division and the whole Group are provided to
the Board monthly and presented at every
scheduled Board meeting. Ten scheduled Board
meetings are held each year. When a scheduled
Board Meeting is not held in the month, the
Directors receive the following information: a
summary financial report for the Group
comprising consolidated financial information
and business financial information; summary
financial reports from each of the businesses;
and a shareholder analysis summary report on
Ultra. The Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director explain the significance of any major
impacts on the financial performance and draw
the Board’s attention to any significant trends or
deviations from budget revealed by forecasts of
future performance.

Shareholder communication
Commitment to dialogue
The Board is committed to high-quality dialogue
with shareholders. The Executive Directors lead
in this respect. The Senior Independent Director
and other Non-Executive Directors are available
to meet with shareholders on request.
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director
offered to meet the small number of shareholders
who voted against the resolutions to re-appoint
the Directors at the 2014 Annual General Meeting
to understand their reasons. These shareholders
had voted against the resolutions because their
voting guidelines prevented them voting in
favour of a Board that was not made up of a
majority of independent Non-Executive Directors.
However, the shareholders emphasised their
confidence in the Board.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman has
also led a shareholder engagement exercise on
the remuneration policy, details of which can be
found in the Remuneration report on page 65.
Annual programme
A full programme of engagement with
shareholders, potential investors and analysts is
undertaken each year by the Executive Directors.
Ultra organises focused events and/or site visits
to provide greater insight into the strengths and
potential of its extensive portfolio of specialist
capabilities. These range from introductory
briefings on the Group as a whole to
presentations on specific areas of capability.
Visits and presentations in the year included a
presentation in London to shareholders and to
analysts at Bletchley Park in November 2014. At
this event the Directors gave presentations on the
new acquisitions – Forensic Technology Inc and 
3 Phoenix Inc. The briefing also covered updates
on Sonar and Cyber capability. In addition, Ultra
invited investors and members of the financial
community to the Farnborough Airshow where 
a significant proportion of the Group’s products
and capabilities was exhibited.
Meetings are held with institutional investors
and financial analysts after the release of the
interim and full year financial results, at which
detailed briefings are given. These briefings can
also be found on the Investors’ section of the
Group’s website, together with copies of all
regulatory announcements, press releases and
copies of the published full year and interim
accounts and reports.
The Board is regularly updated by the
Company’s stock broker on analysts’ and major
shareholders’ views on the Company. The Board
receives a report at each meeting on any
changes to the holdings of the Company’s main
institutional shareholders.
All shareholders are invited to attend the Annual
General Meeting where they have the
opportunity to meet with Directors and to ask
questions. Voting at the Annual General
Meeting is conducted by way of a show of
hands. Proxy votes lodged for each Annual
General Meeting are announced at the meeting
and published on Ultra’s website. Electronic
communication with shareholders is preferred
wherever possible since this is both more
efficient and environmentally friendly. However,
shareholders may opt to receive hard copy
communication if they wish.
Shareholder analysis
The majority of Ultra’s shares are held by
institutional shareholders. The Chairman, 
Chief Executive and other members of the
Executive Team have significant holdings in the
Company, including shares awarded through
share option or long term incentive schemes.

Board Committees
Ultra has established three Committees of the
Board (the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees), to which certain key responsibilities
have been delegated. The detailed terms of
reference of each Committee are available from
the Investors’ section of the Group website. The
responsibilities of each Committee are in line with
the recommendations of the Code. The
membership of the Audit and Remuneration
Committees comprises the three independent
Non-Executive Directors – Chris Bailey, Sir Robert
Walmsley and Martin Broadhurst. Chris is the
Chairman of the Audit Committee and Martin is
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The membership of the Nomination Committee
comprises the three independent Non-Executive
Directors and Douglas Caster, with Chris as
Chairman of the Committee. Summaries of the
key activities of each Committee are given in the
following paragraphs.
Audit Committee
The Committee met four times during the year. It
is responsible for overseeing the Company’s
internal financial controls and risk management;
recommending the half and full year financial
results to the Board; and monitoring the integrity
of all formal reports and announcements relating
to the Company’s financial performance. Full
details of the activities of the Audit Committee
during 2014 are given on page 62.
Nomination Committee
Role
The function of the Nomination Committee is to
keep under review the structure, size and
composition of the Board, and to make proposals
to the Board regarding the appointment of new
directors and Board Committee Chairmen. The
Board’s policy on diversity is described on page 57.
The terms of reference (which are reviewed
annually by the Nomination Committee) are
available on the Company’s website
(www.ultra-electronics.com).
During 2014 the Committee met twice. A
search firm, The Inzito Partnership, was engaged
to identify potential candidates for the position
of Non-Executive Director and, following the
retirement of Chris Bailey at the 2015 Annual
General Meeting, Chair of the Audit
Committee. The search firm does not have any
other connection with the Company. The
selection criteria required the candidate to: be a
qualified accountant; have recent and relevant
financial experience; have experience in
corporate finance matters; have experience in
dealing with investors and analysts; and have
the time capacity to take on the role. The list of
shortlisted candidates included male and female
applicants. The curriculum vitaes of the
shortlisted candidates were considered by the
Nomination Committee and members of the
Nomination Committee were invited to attend
the interviews. Following this process, upon the
recommendation of the Nomination Committee,
the Board appointed John Hirst as a Non-Executive
Director effective on 1 January 2015. He will be
appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee,
subject to election at the 2015 Annual General
Meeting. John comes with: a strong background
in strategy, knowledge of the public/private
sector and regulatory/governance issues; and
experience in international operations.
Ultra’s succession planning process is described
in detail on page 46.
Remuneration Committee
Role
The Committee met four times during the year.
It is responsible for formulating and
recommending to the Board the remuneration
policy for Executive Directors and Chairman of
the Board. Full details of the activities of the
Remuneration Committee during 2014 are
given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on
page 65, comprising the Directors Remuneration
Policy Report and the Annual Report on
Remuneration. Both sections of the report will
be presented for approval by the shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of going concern
Ultra’s banking facilities amount to £300m in
total, together with a £15m overdraft. They
were established in two tranches.
The first tranche comprises £100m of revolving
credit, denominated in Sterling, US dollars,
Canadian dollars, Australian dollars or Euros.
This facility was signed in December 2012 and
expires in December 2017. The facility is
provided by a group of five banks.
The second tranche provides a further £200m of
revolving credit in the same currencies. This was
signed in August 2014 with seven banks and
expires in July 2019. Both facilities have the
same covenants. 
The Group has a ‘shelf’ facility with Prudential
Investment Management Inc. This agreement
gives the Group access to the US private
placement market on a bilateral basis. The facility
is non-committed but is for up to $195m. At the
year-end $70m of loan notes had been issued,
which will mature in 2018 and 2019.
As well as being used to fund acquisitions, the
financing facilities are also used for other
balance sheet and operational needs, including
the funding of day-to-day working capital
requirements. The US dollar borrowings also
represent natural hedges against assets
denominated in that currency. The Group’s
banking covenants have all been met in 2014
with a comfortable margin. The approved Group
budget for 2015 and strategic plan for later
years give confidence that the Group will
continue to meet these covenants. Details of
how Ultra manages its liquidity risk can be
found in note 23 – Financial Instruments and
Financial Risk Management.
Though global macro-economic conditions
remain uncertain, the long-term nature of
Ultra’s business and its positioning in attractive
sectors of its markets, taken together with the
Group’s forward order book provide a
satisfactory level of confidence in respect of
trading in the year to come.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that
Ultra has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus, they continue to adopt a going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the annual
financial statements. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 61
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required to
prepare the Group financial statements in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and Article 4 of the
International Accounting Standards Regulation
(“IAS”) and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law).
Under company law, the Directors must not
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss
of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently
• Make judgments and accounting estimates
that are reasonable and prudent
• State whether applicable UK Accounting
Standards have been followed subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements
• Prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Company will continue in
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements,
International Accounting Standard 1 requires
that Directors:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies
• Present information, including accounting
policies, in a manner that provides relevant,
reliable, comparable and understandable
information
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance
with the specific requirements in IFRSs are
insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’s financial position
and financial performance
• Make an assessment of the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are sufficient
to show and explain the Company’s transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and
financial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge,
taken as a whole:
• the financial statements, prepared in
accordance with the relevant financial
reporting framework, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit or loss of the Company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation;
• the annual report and accounts are fair,
balanced and understandable and provide the
information necessary for shareholders to
assess the Company’s performance, business
model and strategy; and
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business
and the position of the Company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation,
together with a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties that they face.
In accordance with Section 418 of the
Companies Act 2006, each Director in office at
the date the Directors’ report is approved,
confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought
to have taken as a Director in order to make
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
The Annual Report on pages 1 to 79 was
approved by the Board of Directors and
authorised for issue on 27 February 2015 and
signed on behalf of the Board by:

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review The Company is committed to ensuring that we
have robust and effective risk management and
control processes. As Chairman of the Audit
Committee, I am pleased to present our report
detailing the role and responsibilities of the
Committee and its activities during the year that
support this. The Board’s report on the systems
of internal control and their effectiveness,
together with the going concern statement, can
be found in the Corporate Governance section
on pages 52 to 61.
During the year, the Committee continued to
review the appropriateness of the Group’s
system of risk management and internal
controls, the robustness and integrity of the
Group’s financial reporting, along with both the
internal and external audit processes. 
A risk based approach is taken by the Company
in determining its internal audit plan, thereby
ensuring the plan is clearly linked to the
Company’s strategy and flexible enough to
highlight and address emerging risks. The focus
in 2014 was on compliance with the Company’s
Business Continuity and IT Disaster Recovery
Policies by all of the Company’s businesses. In
addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the
Company’s internal auditors, continued to work
with the businesses to ensure the Company’s risk
management procedures remain relevant to
changing business conditions.
In 2014, the significant issues at the forefront
of the Committee’s deliberations were:
valuation and impairment testing of goodwill
and intangible assets; and long term
accounting, in particular in respect of the Oman
Airport IT contract. The Audit Committee
received regular updates on the Oman Contract
from management throughout the year and a
presentation from the law firm representing the
Company’s joint venture subsidiary in its
discussions regarding certification and payment
for work completed.
At the Annual General Meeting in April, I will
retire from the Board and Chair of the Audit
Committee following ten years of service as a
Non-Executive Director of Ultra. John Hirst, who
was appointed to the Board with effect from
the 1 January 2015, will seek election as a
Director of the Company and if so elected, will
be appointed as the Chairman of the Audit
Committee. John has recent and relevant
financial experience as well as being an
experienced leader of large global private and
public sector organisations. 
Composition
The composition of the Committee is set out on
page 60. The Chairman of the Committee has the
relevant financial and accounting experience
required by the Code. The Chairman of the
Committee is supported in his role by the other
members of the Committee who have a wide
range of business experience and expertise, as
evidenced in their biographies on page 51.
Meetings and attendance
The Committee met four times during the year
under review. In addition to the Committee
members, regular attendees are: the Chairman
of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Group
Finance Director and the Marketing Director.
The Company Secretary & General Counsel acts
as Secretary to the Committee. Deloitte LLP is
the Group’s external auditor. To ensure full and
open communication, Deloitte was represented
at all Committee meetings, and the lead partner
from PwC attended those meetings at which
summary Internal Audit Reports were reviewed
by the Committee.
During 2014, the Committee Chairman met with
Deloitte and PwC in the absence of Executive
and Non-Executive Directors. In addition, the
Committee met with Deloitte without Executive
Directors present, where Deloitte reported on
their views of the Group’s financial management
process and any matters that they thought
should be brought to the Committee.
In terms of the effectiveness of the Committee,
an externally facilitated evaluation was carried
out (see page 58) by way of questionnaire
which was circulated to the Board. The role of
the Committee, its skills mix and oversight of
financial management, reporting and audit was
considered to remain effective.
Role
The Committee’s main responsibilities include
the following: 
• Scrutinising the Group’s annual and interim
financial statements and accounts and
reporting to the Board on the significant
financial reporting issues and judgements made 
• Reviewing the content of the Annual Report 
& Accounts and advising the Board whether,
taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information
necessary for shareholders to assess the
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy
• Reviewing the scope and effectiveness of the
external audit process, including the external
auditors’ appointment, fees and independence
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the internal
audit function and the Group’s system of
internal control, including financial reporting,
and the processes for monitoring and
evaluating the risks facing the Group.
The Committee has written terms of reference
which includes all matters indicated by the
Code. These terms of reference are reviewed
and approved by the Board annually and are
available on the Company’s website
(www.ultra-electronics.com).
The Board is kept fully informed of the
Committee’s work and the minutes of each
Committee meeting are circulated to Board
members.
Internal controls and risk management
The Committee reviews the Company’s systems
of internal controls and risk management and
their effectiveness as well as continued
improvements to these systems and resolution of
any control issues identified. Clear terms of
reference set out the duties of the Board and the
Board Committees, with delegation of operating
responsibility to management clearly described in
the Group Operating Manual. Financial reporting
systems are comprehensive and include monthly
reporting cycles. Monthly finance reports are
prepared by all businesses containing actual
financial performance measures for the most
recent month and year to date. These are
compared with budget, forecasts and the prior
year. These monthly reports are reviewed by the
relevant Divisional Finance Director, Group
Finance Director, members of the Executive Team
and the Board. Financial information is uploaded
monthly by all businesses to BPC, the Group’s
consolidation and reporting system, which is
collated by the Head Office finance team and
reconciled to the businesses’ monthly reports.
When preparing and reviewing financial
information, the businesses do not work to a
materiality threshold. All variances judged to be
significant are investigated and explained.
Every 6 months, Divisional Control Review
(“DCR”) meetings, which are attended by the
Group Finance Director, each Divisional Finance
Director and PwC, are held. At the DCR meetings,
the internal controls processes and issues for each
business are discussed. These include:

Audit Committee Report
...as Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am 
pleased to present our report detailing the 
role and responsibilities of the Committee 
and its activities during the year.
Chris Bailey Chairman of the Audit Committee • Results from the Senior Accounting Officer
review and any tax audits
• Self-assessment against the Group 
Operating Manual
• Outstanding internal and external audits
• Segregation of duties and IT access audits
• Compliance with the Group’s Information
Security Policy
Summary results from these reviews are included in
the Internal Controls Improvement Status Report,
which is presented to the Committee twice a year.
Effective and on-going monitoring and review are
essential components of sound systems of risk
management and internal control. Ultra’s financial
reporting and internal control systems are
intended to allow the Board to consider whether
the systems are aligned with the Company’s
strategic objectives and help to determine risks
including, but not limited to, principal risks and
uncertainties facing the Company. The Company’s
principal risks are set out on pages 36 to 39. The
Committee confirms its view that it has received
sufficient, reliable and timely information from
management in the last financial year to enable it
to fulfil its responsibilities. The Board maintains an
internal audit process, carried out by PwC, to
review financial and information systems control
procedures throughout the Group. All significant
business units are audited at least once every 
2 years, while other businesses are audited on a 
3 year cycle. In addition, all newly acquired
individually operating businesses are audited
within a year of their acquisition date. The lead
partner of PwC reports directly to the Chairman
of the Committee and presents the findings of his
team twice annually to the Committee. Progress
reports on follow-up remedial actions are
reported regularly to the Committee. PwC
confirms whether appropriate action has been
taken to address the risks when they next visit
the business concerned.
The Managing Directors and Presidents, Finance
Directors and Vice Presidents of Finance of each
business are required to give a formal written
representation to the Board each year
confirming that they accept responsibility for
maintaining effective internal controls and that
they have disclosed full details of any fraud or
suspected fraud within their business.
As part of the ongoing assessment of internal
controls and risk management the Committee has
considered the implications of the termination of
the Oman Airport IT contract and has concluded
that the control environment continues to operate
effectively. Whilst the Committee considers the
Company’s risk management procedures to
remain appropriate, in light of this experience the
Committee will review the application of the risk
management procedures to ensure that we
capture any required enhancements.
The Board accepts overall responsibility for
reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the
Group’s internal controls at least annually and has
performed a specific assessment for the purposes
of this Annual Report. The Board confirms that
the risk management and internal control
systems have been in place for the year under
review and up to the date of approval of this
Annual Report & Accounts. With the assistance
of the Committee, all significant aspects of
internal control for 2014 have been reviewed and
internal procedures amended where necessary.

The Committee’s terms of reference External auditors
The performance, effectiveness and independence
of the Company’s auditors, Deloitte, are reviewed
annually by the Committee. The Committee
considered the questions contained in a
questionnaire issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland in October 2007 to
assess performance, effectiveness and
independence and concluded that Deloitte had
been sufficiently transparent and incisive and the
audits had been effective. The Committee
concluded that Deloitte was both independent
and objective and that the reappointment of
Deloitte as external auditor should be
recommended to the shareholders. Accordingly, 
a resolution to reappoint Deloitte will be put to
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The senior audit partner employed by Deloitte
on the Ultra audit is subject to a strict policy of
regular rotation such that there is a change in
this role at least once every five years. This is in
accordance with professional practice
guidelines. The current senior audit partner’s
tenure commenced in 2011. Deloitte was
appointed in 2002. The Committee considers
that for an organisation of the size and
complexity of Ultra, the tendering of external
audit must be well planned to ensure that the
Group complies with best practice corporate
governance as well as ensuring the Group
receives a high quality, efficient and effective
external audit service. On this basis, the
Committee considers it would be appropriate to
conduct an external audit tender no later than
2023 (in line with applicable regulations and the
Code) at which point Deloitte would be
precluded from being Ultra’s external auditors.
There are no contractual obligations that restrict
the Committee’s choice of external auditors.
The auditor’s engagement letter and the scope of
the year’s annual audit cycle is discussed in
advance by the Committee, ensuring that any
changes in circumstances arising since the
previous year are taken into account. With respect
to non-audit assignments undertaken by Deloitte,
the Company has a policy to ensure that the
provision of such services do not impair Deloitte’s
independence or objectivity. The policy is that:
• Non-audit services are restricted to regulatory
reporting, consultancy services associated with
financial restructuring, responding to new
reporting requirements, due diligence
assessments of potential acquisitions and minor
consultancy work. In connection with acquisition
due diligence work and certain consultancy
work, it is the Board’s view that the auditor’s
familiarity with the Company’s accounting
practices and the techniques that are involved in
the Company’s long-term contracting activities
serves them well in carrying out such work.
• When considering the use of the external
auditors to undertake non-audit work,
consideration must be given to the provisions
of the Financial Reporting Council Guidance
on Audit Committees with regard to the
preservation of independence and objectivity.
• The external auditors must certify to the
Company that they are acting independently.
• In providing a non-audit service, the external
auditors should not:
– audit their own work
– make management decisions for the Company
– create a mutuality of interest
– find themselves in the role of advocate for 
the Company.
• The Group Finance Director has authority to
commission the external auditors to undertake
non-audit work where there is a specific
project with a cost that is not expected to
exceed £50,000. Any individual assignments
with an estimated fee in excess of £50,000
must be referred in advance to the Chairman
of the Committee for his approval. All 
non-audit work has to be reported to the
Committee at its next meeting.
• Before commissioning non-audit services, the
Group Finance Director or the Chairman of
the Committee, as appropriate, must ensure
that there is no issue as regards independence
and objectivity and that other potential
providers are adequately considered.
The effectiveness of the external audit process is
assessed by the Committee, which meets
regularly throughout the year with the audit
partner and senior audit managers. Key to the
overall effectiveness of the process is that each
of the Company and the Auditor make the other
aware of accounting and financial reporting
issues as and when they arise, and this exchange
is not limited to the period in which formal audit
and review engagements take place.
This general approach is supported by a formal
feedback request process whereby each of the
businesses in the Group are requested to feedback
comments on the audit process, the performance
of the auditors and any recommendations for the
audit process going forward. A debrief meeting is
then held with Deloitte to discuss the results of the
feedback and agree on any measures for
improvement of the audit process. 
The Committee believes that sufficient and
appropriate information is obtained from the
feedback request to form an overall judgment on
the effectiveness of the external audit process.
The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of audit and
non-audit services are shown in note 6 to the
Financial Statements.
The Group has a policy on employment of
former employees of external auditors. This
requires that any such employment is considered
on a case by case basis and takes into account
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
on such appointments. Such appointment
requires approval by a combination of the Group
Finance Director, Audit Committee and Board,
depending on the seniority of the appointment.
Fraud
The internal audit process carried out by PwC,
described on page 63, and the Group’s internal
control framework help to protect the Group
against fraud. Regular business reviews take
place at all businesses, in which detailed balance
sheet and cash flow reviews are carried out by
the relevant Divisional Managing and Financial
Directors. In addition, the Group Finance
Director and Group Chief Operating Officer
review the performance of the businesses with
the Divisional team monthly and directly with
the businesses at least twice a year. Significant
differences between forecast and reported
financial results are highlighted and require
explanation by the business unit concerned. The
Group Chief Executive and Group Marketing
Director also attend such Divisional/Business
reviews as the case requires. The internal control
framework that is in place is supplemented by
the external audit process which represents a
second independent review of controls and
procedures, with selective transaction testing of
higher risk areas. There is a fraud reporting
process in place. Any reports of fraud would
immediately be investigated and the situation
reported at the next Board meeting. 
Whistleblowing
An independently hosted Employee Hotline is
used to provide a process for reporting ethical
concerns. Employees are informed of this process
through posters (which are translated into local
languages) and through the Group intranet
(which is accessible by all employees). Employees
can report ethical dilemmas or other similar
concerns they may have via this external
Employee Hotline and can remain anonymous if
they wish. Employee concerns are forwarded to
the Chairman of the Audit Committee or, in the
case of issues covered by US security legislation,
to the Chairman of the Security Committee of
either Ultra’s Special Security Agreement
company or Ultra’s Proxy Board company, as
appropriate. During 2014, two reports were
submitted (none in 2013) which were
investigated and dealt with appropriately. 
Anti-bribery
Ultra has robust anti-bribery policies and
procedures in place. All Directors and employees
are required to sign Ultra’s code of conduct on
anti-bribery and commit to act in accordance with
the code. Within 1 week of joining Ultra, Directors
and employees undertake anti-bribery training.
Further anti-bribery training is given to targeted
groups throughout the year. The Group intranet
contains a statement from the Chief Executive
regarding compliance with Ultra’s anti-bribery
policies. Compliance with the code of conduct on
anti-bribery is closely monitored by a requirement
for Ultra businesses to submit monthly business
performance reports confirming compliance with
the code and reporting any breaches.

Remuneration Report
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear shareholder
As the recently appointed Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to
present the Remuneration Report, prepared by
the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”)
and approved by the Board, for the financial year
ended 31 December 2014. It has been prepared
in accordance with Schedule 8 of The Large and
Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts
and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in
August 2013 and has been divided into the
following three sections:
1. this Annual Statement, which summarises
the major decisions on, and any substantial
changes to, Directors’ remuneration;
2. the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Report, which sets out Ultra’s policy on the
remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive
Directors; and
3. the Annual Report on Remuneration,
which discloses how the Remuneration Policy
will be implemented in the year ending 31
December 2015 and how it was implemented
in the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Committee is seeking to make a number of
minor changes to the Directors’ Remuneration
Policy Report, and accordingly, a binding vote to
approve the new three year Directors’
Remuneration Policy Report will be proposed at
the forthcoming 2015 AGM. The annual
advisory vote on the Annual Report on
Remuneration will be also tabled.
Remuneration policy for 2015
Following my appointment as Chairman of the
Committee and a review of the Remuneration
Policy in light of best and market practice, the
Committee proposes to make a number of minor
changes to the Remuneration Policy. Reflecting a
comprehensive strategic review, the Company is
realigning its capabilities to better position itself
to enhance the marketing effectiveness and
make the most of its extensive technology
offerings. As such, the Committee considers it
timely to introduce selected non-financial
incentive measures within the Directors’ annual
bonus plan to a maximum of 25% of the 100%
of salary maximum annual bonus potential. 
In addition, and consistent with best practice,
the Committee is proposing to extend and
expand its incentive clawback provisions and
introduce dividend equivalent provisions into the
policy (the LTIP rules currently permit the
payment of dividend equivalents although the
provision has not been operated to date).
Finally, although not part of the Committee’s
remit, the Non-Executive Director fee policy will,
subject to shareholder approval, be amended to
introduce a separate responsibility fee for
serving as Senior Independent Director.
Performance and reward during 2014
2014 was a challenging year: revenue and
underlying operating profit* were £713.7m
(2013: £745.2m) and £118.1m (2013: £121.7m)
respectively; underlying earnings per share* were
123.1p (2013: 127.1p); operating cash flow* was
£83.1m (2013: £79.0m); and total shareholder
return was 8% (2013: 14%). Reflecting this, no
annual bonus was payable for 2014 (no bonus
was paid for 2013) and the 2012 LTIP awards
which had been due to crystallise in 2015 based
on three year TSR and EPS performance to 
31 December 2014 will not vest as a result of
performance targets not being met.
In light of these results, the Non-Executive
Directors (including the Chairman of the Board)
declined a fee increase for 2015.
Shareholder engagement
Our voting result at the 2014 AGM was
97.99% in favour of the Directors’
Remuneration Policy Report and 99.56% in
favour of the Annual Statement and Annual
Report on Remuneration.
The Committee continues actively to seek
shareholder views on our Remuneration Policy
and is mindful of the concerns of shareholders
and other stakeholders. As such, we carried out
a consultation in December 2014 with all of our
major shareholders as well as the IA and ISS on
the proposed changes to the Remuneration
Policy Report. 
In conclusion, the Board firmly considers that
the Remuneration Policy continues to be aligned
with the strategic goal of the Group in adding
to shareholder value and supporting the long
term success of the Company.

*see footnote on page 132 The policy described in this section, which was originally approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, contains a number of minor
amendments for which shareholder approval will be sought at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. In summary, the amendments are: (i) extending and
expanding incentive clawback provisions; (ii) introducing a strategic/personal element to the annual bonus; (iii) introducing dividend equivalents to LTIP
awards; and (iv) introducing a separate fee for acting as Senior Independent Director. The proposed changes, subject to shareholder approval, will
become effective from the 2015 Annual General Meeting and will apply from 1 January 2015.
Policy overview
The Group’s Remuneration Policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling Ultra to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre,
whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments. The remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers is aligned with corporate objectives
and the interests of shareholders. The linkages between each element of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages with the Group’s objectives and the
interests of shareholders are set out in the following information.

Maximum potential
While there is no defined
maximum salary, it is the
Committee’s policy to set pay for
Executive Directors at industry
competitive levels taking market
capitalisation and annual sales
into account. Annual salary
increases take into account: 
(i) underlying performance of
the individual; (ii) underlying
performance of the business; 
(iii) underlying annual salary
increases within the overall
Group; (iv) any changes to the
scope of the role in terms of size
or complexity; and (v) underlying
salary increases for similar
industry roles
It is recognised that annual
salary increases may also include
a ‘catch up’ element over and
above the factors listed above to
increase the salary towards or to
a competitive industry level
where the Executive Director
was appointed with a salary
significantly below the
competitive level
Annual salary increases for
Executive Directors will not
normally exceed the average
increase awarded to other
Company UK based employees

Notes to future policy table:
(1) A description of how the Company intends
to implement the policy in 2015 is set out in
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
(2) The Remuneration Policy described above
provides an overview of the structure that
operates for the most senior executives in the
Group. Lower levels of incentive operates for
employees below executive level, with
remuneration driven by market comparators
and the impact of the role. Long-term
incentives are reserved for those anticipated
as having the greatest potential to influence
the Group’s earnings growth and share price
performance, although as the Committee is
aware of the benefits which wider employee
share ownership can generate, all employees
are encouraged to participate in the AESOP
and Savings Related Share Option Scheme in
the countries in which they are offered. 
(3) The choice of the performance metrics
applicable to the annual bonus scheme
reflect the Committee’s view that any
incentive compensation should be
appropriately challenging and largely tied to
financial performance. The TSR and EPS
performance conditions applicable to the LTIP
(further details of which are provided on
page 71) were selected by the Committee on
the basis that:
• TSR aligns the performance objectives of the
Executive Directors (TSR is one of the
Group’s Key Performance Indicators) more
closely with the interests of the shareholders;
• TSR is an entirely objective measure of
relative performance;
• The use of TSR and EPS reflects the metrics
most commonly used by other quoted
companies;
• TSR reduces the complexity and cost of
calculating the vesting result; and
• The EPS underpin ensures an appropriate
level of profit growth is maintained by the
Group.
(4) All employee share plans do not operate
performance conditions.
(5) As highlighted above, Ultra has a share
ownership policy which requires the
Executive Directors to build up and maintain
a target holding equal to 100% of base
salary (125% for the Chief Executive). Details
of the extent to which the Executive Directors
had complied with this policy as at 
31 December 2014 are set out on page 74.
(6) For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this
amended Directors’ Remuneration Policy,
authority was given to Ultra to honour any
commitments entered into with current or
former Directors (such as, but not limited to,
the payment of a pension or the
vesting/exercise of past share awards) that
have been disclosed to and approved by
shareholders in previous Remuneration
Reports. Details of any payments to former
Directors will be set out in the Annual Report
on Remuneration as they arise.
ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS
The Executive Directors are
eligible to participate in the
Company’s HMRC approved 
All-Employee Share Ownership
Plan (“AESOP”) and the Savings
Related Share Option Scheme
on the same terms as other
employees
To encourage employee share
ownership and increase
alignment with shareholders
Under the AESOP , UK
employees are offered the
opportunity to buy shares up to
the prevailing HMRC limits per
annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust
until the maturity date or until
they leave Ultra
Under the Savings Related
Share Option Scheme,
employees are entitled to save
up to the prevailing HMRC
limits or the lower limit set by
Ultra per annum from net pay
towards the purchase of
options to buy Ultra shares
Under the AESOP up to the value of
£1,500 per annum from pre-tax pay
Under the Savings Related Share
Option Scheme, up to £1,200 per
annum from post-tax pay 
n/a Remuneration scenarios for 
Executive Directors
The charts below show how the composition of
the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages
varies at three performance levels, namely, at
minimum (i.e. fixed pay including pensions and
taxable benefits), target and maximum levels,
under the policy set out in the table overleaf.
The charts show the proportion of the total
package comprised of each element.
Director recruitment policy
The Nomination Committee normally considers
both internal and external candidates before any
new appointment is made. New Executive
Directors are provided with remuneration
consisting of base salary, short-term incentive,
long-term incentive and other benefits.
Salary
Ultra’s policy is to set pay for Executive Directors
at industry competitive levels taking market
capitalisation and annual sales into account. It is
recognised that a new appointee may not have
as much experience as someone at a competitive
level and may therefore be offered a salary
below competitive levels but at a level that is
sufficient to attract the person. In exceptional
circumstances, the Committee may exercise its
discretion to offer an above industry competitive
level salary in order to attract the best person.
Short-term incentive
Short-term incentives are offered in line with
those paid to other Executive Directors.
Maximum opportunities will be in line with
current plan maximums for existing Directors
(i.e. 100% of salary p.a.).
Long-term incentive
Long-term incentives are offered in line with
those paid to other Executive Directors.
Maximum opportunities will be in line with
current plan maximum for existing Directors (i.e.
up to 125% of salary p.a. or 150% of salary
p.a. in exceptional circumstances). 
Other benefits
Other benefits are offered in line with those
paid to other Executive Directors.
Buy outs
To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make
an award to buy-out incentive arrangements
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing
so, the Committee will take account of all relevant
factors including any performance conditions
attached to these awards and the time over which
they would have vested or been paid. Ultra may
make use of the flexibility provided in the Listing
Rules (LR 9.4.2) to make awards if appropriate.
Where possible, incentives will be bought out on a
like-for-like basis with respect to vesting/payment
dates, currency (i.e. cash versus shares) and the
use of performance targets.
Non-Executive Directors
The approach to the recruitment of 
Non-Executive Directors is to pay an annual fixed
fee, after considering existing Non-Executive
Directors fee levels, market levels and expected
time commitment. In deciding whether to
accept any fee increase the Non-Executive
Directors consider Company performance.
Executive Director service contracts
The Group’s policy is to ensure that the
Executive Directors’ service contracts have a
notice period of one year, which the Committee
considers appropriately reflects both current
market practice and the balance between the
interests of the Group and each Executive
Director. The following table provides more
information on each Director’s service contract:
Date of Notice 
Name contract period
M. Anderson 1  Apr 2012 12 months
R. Sharma 21 Apr 2011 12 months
M. Waldner 1 Jul 2013 12 months
No Executive Directors have provisions in their
contracts for compensation on early termination
other than for the notice period.
External appointments of Executive Directors
The Chief Executive is not permitted to accept
any external appointment as a Non-Executive
Director. Other Executive Directors may accept
not more than one external appointment as a
Non-Executive Director. Up to 50% of any time
spent undertaking such external duties can be
taken as additional unpaid leave with the
remainder being treated as annual holiday.
Executive Director exit policy
Ultra may terminate an Executive Director’s
contract early with contractual notice or by way
of a payment in lieu of notice, at its discretion.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice
will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payments in lieu of notice will equate to the
basic salary and benefits payable during the
notice period or, if notice has already been
given, the remainder of the notice period.
Payment in lieu of notice will be made by way of
a lump sum or by phased instalments over the
notice period. Where payments are phased, if an
employee gains employment during the notice
period, payments would be reduced. There is no
contractual entitlement to annual incentive
payments in respect of the notice period. An
annual bonus may be payable with respect to
the period of the financial year served although
it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the
normal payment date as defined by the bonus
scheme rules. 
Any share-based entitlements granted to an
Executive Director under the Group’s share plans
will be determined based on the relevant plan
rules. The default treatment under the 2007 LTIP
is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation
of employment. However, if a participant ceases
to hold office or employment because of death
or for any other circumstance, at the discretion of
the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be
applied. For good leavers, the Committee can
decide that awards will vest on the date they
would normally have vested had the participant
not ceased to hold office or employment.

Alternatively, the Committee can decide that
awards will vest on cessation. In both cases, the
award will vest subject to the satisfaction of the
relevant performance conditions at that time
and a pro rata reduction to reflect the period of
time from the date of grant of the award to the
date of cessation relative to the normal three
year vesting period. However, the Committee
can decide not to apply a pro rata reduction if it
regards it as inappropriate to do so in any
particular case.

Chris Bailey will retire as Non-Executive Director

There are no provisions in their contracts for
compensation on early termination.
How employment conditions elsewhere in
the Group are considered
Base salary increases take into account a
number of factors including the underlying base
salary increases within the overall Group. Pay is
only set centrally for Executive Directors,
Executive Team members, Divisional staff,
Business Managing Directors/Presidents, UK
Directors and Head Office staff. All other salaries
are set within the operating businesses. In all
cases there are two levels of approval. The
Remuneration Committee does not consult with
employees when setting the remuneration of
Executive Directors. It uses independent
comparison metrics to benchmark remuneration
with other companies. 
How shareholders’ views are taken 
into account
The Committee considers shareholder feedback
received in relation to the Annual General
Meeting each year. This, and any other feedback
received during the year, is then considered as
part of the Group’s annual review of the
Remuneration Policy. At the 2014 Annual General
Meeting, 99.56% of our shareholders voted in
favour of the Annual Statement and Annual
Report on Remuneration and 97.99% voted for
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Additionally
we carried out a consultation in December 2014
with all of our major shareholders as well as, the
IA and ISS on the proposed changes to the
Remuneration Policy Report and Executive
Director Remuneration.
Claw back and malus policy
Consistent with common practice when
clawback was first introduced, the Company
operated a clawback provision in the annual
bonus but not the LTIP . In addition, the trigger
was limited to misstatement of the accounts.
However, following a detailed review of practice
at Ultra and how this compared to best and
market practice, Ultra’s recovery provisions will
be amended to: introduce malus (i.e. the ability
to reclaim deferred remuneration prior to
payment/vesting) in addition to clawback (i.e.
the ability to reclaim amounts paid); extend the
provisions into the LTIP; and expand the triggers
to include misstatement, error in respect of the
calculation of a payment, where an individual
has (or would have) been dismissed for gross
misconduct and where there has been an
exceptional negative event.

Consistent with its policy of moving base salary levels for recent appointments towards market levels over time, Rakesh Sharma’s salary was increased to
£522,000 and Mark Anderson’s salary was increased to £248,000 from 1 January 2015. Reflecting Mary Waldner’s performance in the year, her base
salary was increased to £317,000 from the same date. Following the award of these increases, the Committee is satisfied that the base salary levels are
now within the relevant competitive ranges.
Directors’ pension entitlements
The Group will continue to operate a defined benefit pension scheme for Rakesh Sharma. Mary Waldner and Mark Anderson will continue to participate
in the defined contribution scheme, receiving annual company contributions of up to 18% of their salary.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
A minor amendment to the fee structure for Non-Executive Directors is proposed in the Remuneration Policy table. There will be an additional fee paid to
the Senior Independent Director equivalent to the additional fees paid to the Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
Annual bonus for 2015
The maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2015 will continue to be 100% of base salary. 
However, reflecting a comprehensive review, the Committee considers it timely to introduce selected non-financial incentive measures within the
Directors’ annual bonus plan. For 2015, a maximum 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of strategic non-financial measures (assuming
shareholder approval is obtained to amend the Remuneration Policy). No bonus will be paid in respect of the non-financial element of the bonus if the
Committee considers the Company’s financial performance to be unsatisfactory or there is an exceptional negative event during (or just after) the relevant
financial year. A maximum of 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target and a maximum of 60% payable for
achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target. As the Committee considers that commercial sensitivities restrict the disclosure of forward-looking
annual bonus targets, full retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Long term awards to be granted in 2015
Consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee intends to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth
125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other Executive Directors during 2015. As per last year’s grant, 20% of awards will vest at
median TSR ranking, increasing to 100% vesting for an upper quartile TSR ranking, measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding
investment trusts). In addition to the TSR target, there is an underpin requiring an average growth of EPS (after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on
financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition) of 15% over the three year performance period.

Annual bonus for year under review – Audited
Annual bonuses in relation to 2014 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets.
These targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board. They were adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of
“stretch” challenge and incentive to outperform. Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured. Please refer
to pages 24 and 25 for details. The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2014 were a maximum of 25% of salary (subject to the achievement of
£120.5m profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles on acquisition), and a maximum of 75% of
salary (subject to achieving an operating cash flow of £137m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure, purchase of long-term incentive
plan shares and taking account of movements in working capital).
The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows:
Actual Bonus
Threshold Maximum Achieved Payable
1
£’000 £’000 £’000 %
Underlying profit before tax 108,450 120,500 112,034 -
Operating cash flow 72,540 137,020 83,072 -
1
No bonus was payable in 2014 because in accordance with the bonus scheme rules, the operating cash flow was negatively adjusted to reflect working
capital performance throughout the year. In order for a bonus to be payable both profit and cash bonus criteria are required to be met.

Total defined benefit pension entitlements – Audited
Under the defined benefit scheme, a pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years. Where
pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service. With the Group’s
consent, Executive Directors may retire from age 55. After age 58, Group consent to early retirement is not required. The pension is reduced in the event
of early retirement. In the event of death-in-service, a spouse’s pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for
dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant. On the death of a retired Executive Director, a spouse’s pension of
50% of the Executive Director’s pension is payable. Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Executive Director’s pension above the Guaranteed
Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5% for service prior to 1 April 2008 and at 5%
thereafter, above which increases are at the Trustees’ and the Group’s discretion. The table below sets out the pension benefits earned by Executive
Directors for the year ended 31 December 2014:

Remuneration Policy
Annual Statement 
and Annual Report 
on Remuneration 76 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Remuneration Report (continued)
The role and composition of the Remuneration Committee
Role 
The role of the Committee is to: determine and agree with the Board the framework and broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors,
Chairman of the Board, and senior management reporting to the Executive Directors (the “Executive Team”); ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly
rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group’s overall performance with due regard to the interests of shareholders and to the financial and
commercial health of the Group; and ensure that contractual arrangements, including the termination of Executive Directors, are fair both to the
individuals concerned and to the Group. The Committee’s terms of reference include all matters indicated by the Code and are approved and reviewed by
the Board annually. The terms of reference are available on Ultra’s website (www.ultra-electronics.com).
Composition 
Chris Bailey was Chairman of the Remuneration Committee up to 26 November 2014 and Martin Broadhurst and Sir Robert Walmsley were members of
the Committee. On the 26 November 2014, Martin took over as Chairman of the Committee and Chris and Sir Robert were members of the Committee.
Sharon Harris continued to act as Secretary to the Committee. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Group HR Director also normally attend Committee
meetings by invitation, except where matters directly relating to their own remuneration are discussed, although they are not Committee members.
Advice 
Wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes is received from New Bridge Street, an Aon plc company. New Bridge Street was
appointed by the Committee after a tender process and, during the year, provided the Group with advice on the operation of Ultra’s LTIP and other share
schemes, remuneration benchmarking services and an annual update on market and best practice. During 2014, insurance broking services were also provided
to the Group by other subsidiaries of Aon plc which the Committee considers in no way prejudices New Bridge Street’s position as the Committee’s
independent advisers. Fees charged by New Bridge Street for advice provided to the Committee for 2014 amounted to £28,201 (excluding VAT). Pension
advisory services were provided to the Committee and the Group by Towers Watson. Fees charged by Towers Watson for advice provided to the Committee for
2014 amounted to £39,690 (excluding VAT). In addition, the Committee consults the Chief Executive with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages
offered to Executive Directors (other than in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package) and members of the Executive Team.
We strongly encourage shareholders to vote in favour of the two remuneration-related resolutions at the 2015 AGM. These resolutions ensure alignment
between business strategy and remuneration and are designed to be fair and balanced as between employees and shareholders.
This Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2015 and signed on its behalf by:

Strategic Report
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 Ultra is required to set out information which helps the shareholders assess how the Directors have
performed their duty to promote the success of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The
information that satisfies these requirements can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 36 to 39.

Future developments 
A review of the activities and future developments of the Group is contained in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 4 and 7.

The Directors are committed to maintaining a significant level of research and development expenditure in order to expand the Group’s range of
proprietary products. During the year a total of £157.1 million (2013: £130.4 million) was spent on engineering and business development of which 
£115.9 million (2013: £87.1million) was funded by customers and £41.2 million (2013: £43.3 million) by the Group.

Incentive Plan (representing 0.3% of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 December 2014).
Supplier payment policy
Individual operating businesses are responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions under which they conduct business transactions with their suppliers.
It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms, provided that the supplier is also complying with all relevant terms
and conditions. Trade payable days of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014 were 64 days (2013: 59 days) based on the ratio of Group trade
payables at the end of the year to the amounts invoiced during the year by suppliers.
Employment policy
It is the policy of Ultra to create a working environment in which there is no discrimination and all employment decisions are based entirely on merit and
the ability of people to perform their intended roles. Ultra aims to continue to build a workforce that is recruited from the widest possible talent pool.
Directors and their interests 
The Directors who served throughout the year and to the date of signing these financial statements, and their interests in the shares and share options of
Ultra at 27 February 2015 are listed on pages 74 and 75.

wide range of separate contracts placed by different Ultra businesses through different project offices and project teams. The Group also contracts with
numerous suppliers across the world and manages these arrangements to ensure that it is not over-dependent on a single supplier. This is normally
achieved through dual sourcing specialist components.

Risk
Oman contract termination
Refer to page 125 (critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty – assessment of contract
accounting); and page 63 (Audit Committee
report – significant judgements considered).
Subsequent to the year end the Oman contract
was terminated and hence there is significant
judgement as to:
• the value of recoverable work performed 
and therefore revenue recognition of £12m 
in the year;
• the required costs to deliver the remaining
contractual obligations;
• and the recoverabilty of contract balances and
associated costs of recovering these contract
balances leading to a £39m provision as
disclosed in note 36.
How the scope of our audit responded 
to the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over the
work performed on the contract and completeness
and accuracy of costs on the contract.
We have reviewed correspondence relating to
the contract termination, in addition to
understanding the events and circumstances
surrounding the termination. This included a
further visit to Oman post year-end to meet
with our local component auditor to provide
appropriate oversight of their work performed
and conclusions reached.
With regards to the work performed under the
contract, we have reviewed evidence from the
contract engineer, who reports on the
completion of effort under the contract.
To determine the remaining costs to deliver the
contract, we have considered the status of sub-
contractor contracts and invoices received to
date, in addition to committed spend for
completing all obligations under the contract.
We assessed the recoverability of contract
balances and associated costs of recovering
these contract balances through our review of
correspondence relating to the negotiations and
the likely timing of any receipt or agreed
settlement process.
Opinion on financial statements of 
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the
Corporate Governance report on page 60 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a
guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect
on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the
engagement team: Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 81
Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement (continued)
Risk
Revenue recognition
Refer to page 125 (critical accounting judgements
and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
– assessment of contract accounting); page 121
(accounting policies – revenue recognition); and
page 63 (Audit Committee report – significant
judgements considered).
Revenue recognition is a risk area, specifically 
in relation to:
• Significant long term contracts. Subject to
meeting certain criteria, Ultra Electronics
adopts long term contract accounting for a
number of its contracts. Revenue recognised
on this basis in the year was £387.1m. In
these circumstances, a number of judgements
are undertaken which specifically impact the
extent of revenue and profit recognised,
including: determing the total contract value;
estimating the costs to completion and within
this judgements relating to the provision for
the cost of mitigating technical risks and
meeting future milestones; and assessing the
percentage of contract completion at the
balance sheet date.
• Delivery of goods, due to the complex
contractual terms with regards to the transfer
of risk and reward that arise within the
Aerospace and Defence industry and therefore
whether revenue has been appropriately
recognised. The complexity is increased as
individual business units enter into different
contractual terms with different customers for
similar products.
How the scope of our audit responded 
to the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over long-
term contract accounting. 
To confirm that revenue and profit recognised to
date are based on the current best estimate of the
degree of work performed under the contract, we
selected a sample of contracts and reviewed the
contract risk registers and evidence for the
progress made against the contract such as
milestone completion to provide evidence over
the judgement taken when providing for the
cost of mitigating technical risks and meeting
future milestones. We also sought to verify the
costs to complete by agreeing to evidence of
committed spend, budgeted rates or actual costs
incurred to date.
We understood and challenged management’s
assumptions by referring to evidence including
signed contract terms and latest project status
reports, and discussed contract progress and
future risks with contract engineers. We also
assessed the reliability of management estimates
through consideration of the historical accuracy of
prior period management estimates. 
For each contract selected for testing, we made
enquiries as to any unusual contract terms or side
agreements separate to the original contract, in
addition to detail testing of billings and costs
incurred to date.
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls around
revenue recognition.
We reviewed contractual evidence to understand
how the specific terms in respect of the transfer
of risk and reward had been met.  Then we
performed a sample test of sales recognised either
side of the year end, and outstanding trade
receivables to substantiate whether the
appropriate terms of the relevant contracts had
been satisfied and that the risks and rewards
associated with the contract had passed to the
customer. We used external evidence, such as
shipping documentation or client acceptance
documentation to confirm that revenue had been
recognised in the appropriate period.

Risk
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Refer to page 125 (critical accounting judgements
and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
– goodwill impairment); pages 120 and 122
(accounting policies – intangible assets); and 
page 63 (Audit Committee report – significant
judgements considered).
The Group recognised £299.0m of goodwill and
£138.7m of acquired intangibles at 31 December
2014. There is a risk regarding the potential
impairment of the carrying value of these assets
given the judgements management are required
to make in respect of the assumptions used to
determine their recoverable amount. 
The key judgements include identification of
cash generating units, growth rates in future
cashflow forecasts both short term and longer
term, discount rates applied to these forecasts,
and determining the impact of reasonably
possible changes in these assumptions.
How the scope of our audit responded 
to the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over
monitoring the carrying value of goodwill and
acquired intangibles. 
Independently we identified and challenged
management’s assessment of the cash generating
units within the Group based on a review of the
cashflows internally reported by management,
and our understanding of the Group structure.
We challenged the assumptions used by
management in their impairment assessment by
using valuation specialists within the audit team
to benchmark the discount rate against
independently available data, together with
peer group analysis, our understanding of the
secured orders underpinning the Group’s
cashflow forecasts, and the historical
performance of the businesses.
Having audited the assumptions, we checked
that the impairment model had been prepared
on the basis of management’s assumptions 
and was arithmetically accurate. We challenged
the appropriateness of management’s
sensitivities based on our work performed on
the key assumptions, and recalculated these
sensitised scenarios.
Acquisition accounting
Refer to page 125 (critical accounting
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty – acquisition accounting); 
page 120 (accounting policies – business
combinations); and page 63 (Audit Committee
report – significant issues considered).
During the year, the Group entered into four
business combinations, being 3 Phoenix Inc.,
Forensic Technology WAI Inc., ICE Corporation Inc.,
and Lab Impex Systems. In aggregate, £104.5m
was paid in respect of acquisitions.
There is a risk that acquisitions are not
accounted for correctly in line with IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations’. The risk relates to the
assumptions and assertions used by
management to forecast future trading
performance to determine both the fair value of
acquired assets and future contingent
consideration payments.
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over
acquisition accounting. 
For the current year acquisitions, we made use of
our valuations specialists to support our review of
the acquisition accounting, and in particular the
valuation of acquired intangible assets identified.
We obtained calculations for the fair value
adjustments for these acquisitions and assessed
whether the period of assessment was correct as
well as confirming that the adjustment was
supported by actual trading data.
For contingent consideration, we agreed the
underlying data in the contingent consideration
calculation to signed sale and purchase
agreements and the trading performance for
the audited entity for the current period, and
approved budgets for future performance. We
assessed whether management’s treatment of
contingent consideration payment
arrangements for former owners, as either
additional purchase consideration or post-
acquisition remuneration, is appropriate.
For historical acqusitions we compared the
forecast contingent consideration positions to
the post year end trading results, approved
budgets and historical levels of settlement. We
recalculated the release of £8.4m of the balance
based on the audited financial results and
assessed whether management has disclosed
adequately the release of the provision in the
Consolidated Income Statement. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 83

Risk
Provisions
Refer to page 125 (critical accounting
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty – provisions); page 123 (accounting
policies – provisions); and page 63 (Audit
Committee report – significant issues considered).
There is judgement required in respect of
potential provisions required on long term support
arrangements and warranties in respect of
complex mission critical product manufacturing,
due to the products being bespoke to the
environment in which they are operating.
Provisions total £31.3m at 31 December 2014.
We have deemed the appropriateness and
completeness of provisions made by management
in respect of product warranties and other
provisions to be a risk for these reasons.
How the scope of our audit responded 
to the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over the
appropriateness and completeness of provisions. 
We recalculated and assessed management’s
estimates for the provisions in conjunction with
our understanding of the potential liability as set
out in contract terms.
In respect of warranties, we assessed the level of
provisioning by verifying the actual failure costs
incurred to date and the products in circulation
subject to a warranty. We used external evidence
to evaluate the adequacy of the warranty
provision, including sales data, credit notes raised
post year-end and contract terms together with
any correspondence with third parties in respect
of product failures and claims.
In response to other provisions, we circularised
the Group’s external legal advisors and reviewed
legal costs incurred in the year to confirm the
completeness of legal cases to which the Group
is party. Through external evidence including
submitted legal advice and discussion with
management, we sought to substantiate the
basis for the Group’s expections over likely
outcomes and their subsequent quantification of
the related provisions.
Pensions
Refer to page 125 (critical accounting
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty – pensions); page 122 (accounting
policies – pensions); and page 63 (Audit
Committee report – significant issues considered).
The Group operates five defined benefit pension
schemes, for which there is judgement in
determining the IAS 19 valuation as recorded at
the balance sheet date. At 31 December 2014,
these five schemes had a total net IAS 19 deficit
of £87.3m.
The valuation is based on a number of
assumptions on both a micro and a macro-
economic level as disclosed in the notes to 
the accounts.
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over the
accounting for defined benefit pension schemes. 
We included pension specialists within our audit
team to assess the appropriateness of the
assumptions through benchmarking to industry
data, and methodology used to value the
defined benefit pension schemes at the balance
sheet date.
In addition, we circularised the independent
actuary and investment managers responsible for
managing the pension fund to confirm the source
inputs into the pension valuation. This confirmed
the completeness of the pension assets and the
valuation for which we further agreed a sample
to publically available asset valuations.
The description of the risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered
by the Audit Committee discussed on page 63. With the exception of the Oman contract termination,
our risks are consistent with the 2013 year-end.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described
above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review 84 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or
influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the
results of our work.
We have used professional judgement in determining an appropriate materiality benchmark, this
includes consideration of alternative benchmarks.
On this basis, we determined materiality for the Group to be £6.2 million (2013: £8 million), which
represents 7% (2013: 9%) of adjusted underlying pre-tax profit, and 2% (2013: 2%) of equity.
Adjusted underlying pre-tax profit is defined as underlying pre-tax profit as presented by management,
after adding back amortisation of acquired intangibles. The Group has established a track record of
making acquisitions and hence we consider amortisation of acquired intangibles to be relevant when
considering our basis for determining materiality.
We agreed the materiality levels with the Audit Committee following the presentation of our Audit
Plan in September 2014 and further agreed that we would report to the Committee all audit
differences in excess of £124,000 (2013: £160,000) as well as differences below that threshold that, in
our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Following on from the Oman contract termination post year-end, we revisited our materiality and
concluded that it remained appropriate.
We further report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Our application of materiality
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including
Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that
assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 25 (2013: 21) locations;
the increase reflecting the acquisitions in the year. 14 (2013: 14) of these were subject to a full audit,
whilst the remaining 11 (2013: 7) were subject to either an audit of specified account balances or
specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of
material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations.
These 25 (2013: 21) locations represent the principal business units and account for 87% (2013: 87%)
of the Group’s net assets, 91% (2013: 91%) of the Group’s revenue and 91% (2013: 93%) of the
Group’s underlying operating profit. They also provided an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the 25 (2013: 21)
units was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than
Group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures
to confirm that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial
information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team follows a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the
Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the
significant overseas components locations at least once every three years. Every year, regardless of
whether we have visited or not, we include the component audit partner and other senior members of
the component audit team in our team briefing, direct the scope of their work for the purposes of our
Group audit, discuss their risk assessment and review documentation of the findings from their work

Matters on which we are required to 
report by exceptions
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures
of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance
Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in
our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our
knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual
report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses
those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’ s and the Parent Company’ s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

During the year the Command & Control Systems business moved from the Information & Power Systems division into the Tactical & Sonar Systems
Division and split into two units, Command & Control Systems and Security & Surveillance Systems. The MSI and AMI businesses moved from the
Aircraft & Vehicle Systems division into the Information & Power Systems division and Tactical & Sonar Systems division respectively. Prior year
comparators have been restated. Goodwill relating to the legacy DNE business has been reallocated between the Tactical Communication Systems
and EMS businesses during 2014. 13 Goodwill (continued)
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares
cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans, representing the best estimate of future performance. These plans,
which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU
over the next five years. The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum. Cash flows
beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross
margins. Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks
specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2014 varied between 10.8% and 13.7% (2013: 12.3% to 13.8%). Future revenues are based on orders already
received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates. Budget and
strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historical experience, available government spending data and management and industry
expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates. Longer-term growth rates, applied for
the ten year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%. Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the
sectors in which it operates. Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also
reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development
and available markets. A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultra’s products and expertise from a number of US government
agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to:
(i) reduce the post-2019 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil.
(ii) apply a 10% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows.
(iii) consider specific market factors.
Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to potential impairments at SOTECH, Airport Systems, AEP and Tactical Communications Systems.
Headroom for these businesses, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the value-in-use calculations, is as follows:
Tactical Communication Systems £32.3m, Airport Systems £4.9m, SOTECH £16.5m and AEP £8.3m. Consideration of specific market factors has
identified the following:
(a) in Tactical Communication Systems a material delay in bringing a key programme to market, combined with failure to secure sufficient business
with new and existing customers would result in impairment
(b) following the termination of the Oman Airport IT contract, the Airport Systems CGU is sensitive to the ability of the remaining business to win
sufficient new customers over the medium term; and
(c) the SOTECH CGU is sensitive to the ability to successfully expand the business into new geographic areas and market sectors.
Accordingly if assumption (ii) was extended further, the level of reduction to forecast operating profits required to indicate impairment is as follows:
Tactical Communication Systems 60%, Airport Systems 14%, SOTECH 43% and AEP: 15%.
Following a review of the performance of our businesses in the Middle East, a potential indicator of impairment was identified for the Blue Sky
Group CGU, and an impairment review was undertaken. The value-in-use of the Blue Sky Group CGU was lower than the carrying value of the
CGU’s net operating assets and consequently an impairment charge of £7.4m has been recorded in the year. The pretax discount rate used during
this assessment was 10.8%. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of goodwill for the Blue Sky Group CGU as at 31 December 2014
is £nil. As set out in note 2, the £7.4m impairment charge has been included as part of the non-underlying operating results of the Group. Blue Sky
Group is within the Aircraft & Vehicle Systems operating segment.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
The reduction in placement of US service contracts particularly impacted the ProLogic business. During the prior year the value-in-use of the ProLogic CGU
was lower than the carrying value of the CGU’s net operating assets and consequently an impairment charge of £44.2m was recorded in administrative
expenses in 2013. As set out in note 2, the £44.2m prior year impairment charge was included as part of the non-underlying operating results of the
Group. ProLogic is within the Information & Power Systems operating segment.

Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group
mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned
by international credit rating agencies. 
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counter parties and customers, the customers are
mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships. The Group has a small number
of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding. These customers are considered to have low credit risk. As set out in note 36, the Oman
Airport IT contract has been terminated. Specific provisions, as set out above, have been recorded against the associated receivables balances. 
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Group’s
credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements (see note 23) net of any allowances for losses represents the Group’s
maximum exposure to credit risk.

23 Financial instruments and financial risk management
Derivative financial instruments
Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge
exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels
1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted (unadjusted) active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All of Ultra’s financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Liquidity risk
The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Group’s banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland. During the year there were two facilities in
place; one provides £100 million of revolving credit and expires in December 2017 and a second, which was put in place in August 2014 to replace
the previous £90 million facility, provides £200 million of revolving credit which expires in July 2019. Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US
dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs. A further £15 million overdraft is
available for short-term working capital funding. 
All bank loans are unsecured. Interest was predominantly charged at 1.00% (2013: 1.45%) over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had available £177,956,000 (2013: £163,000,000) of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working
capital requirements. Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Group’s committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems (UETCS), participates in two Canadian programmes
that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products. Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allowed the Group to issue loan
notes up to a value of USD150 million and with a maturity date of up to 10 years. USD10 million of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity
date of July 2018 and a further USD60 million of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019. On 2 January 2014
the Group agreed an amendment to extend the private shelf agreement for a three year period. Consequently loan notes can now be issued up 
until 2 January 2017. The amendment also increased the size of the shelf agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue. As at 
31 December 2014 USD125 million remained available under the shelf agreement.
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities:

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the
borrowings disclosed in note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk
The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk. The currencies giving
rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2014, the net fair value of the Group’s currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately £756,000 (2013: asset
£6,487,000), comprising £2,842,000 assets (2013: £7,533,000) and £3,598,000 liabilities (2013: £1,046,000). The loss on derivative financial
instruments included in the Group’s consolidated income statement for the period was £7,243,000 (2013: profit £1,470,000).

Net investment hedges
At the year end the Group had net investments in US companies where the associated foreign currency translation risk is hedged by external
borrowings in US dollars. The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as
effective hedges.
Interest rate risk
The Group has USD70 million of long term fixed rate debt with an interest rate of 3.60%. This was entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of
fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Group’s policy. 
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities were as follows:

Market risk sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk
During 2014 the Group’s net borrowings were predominantly at floating interest rates. The Group has estimated the impact on the income
statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2014. There is no significant difference between the
amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.

24 Government grants and loans
The Group through its Canadian subsidiaries Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems (UETCS) and Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems
(UEMS) participates in three Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative (SADI), the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect
of certain eligible research and development project costs. Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided to UETCS and reimbursed at
favourable rates of interest over the period 2016 to 2030. Up to $8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over
the period 2020 to 2033. The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and
the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year. The fair value of the loans have been calculated using a market interest rate
for a similar instrument applicable at the time the agreements were signed.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec (IQ) research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and
development of certain specified new products. Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified
projects. This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made. As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ
programme has been included in the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £9.5 million (2013: £3.47 million) relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015. The rate of 20% has been used to calculate the deferred tax
balances at 31 December 2014 as this rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date.

Warranty provisions are based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. Such costs are generally incurred within two
years after delivery. Contract related provisions will be utilised over the period as stated in the contract to which the specific provision relates.
Contract related provisions also include contingent consideration, dilapidation costs and provisions associated with the Oman Airport IT contract
termination (see note 36). Dilapidations will be payable at the end of the contracted life which is up to fifteen years. Contingent consideration is
payable when earnings targets are met: £8,364,000 of the provision was released in the year when the 2014 GigaSat earn-out target was not met.
As at 31 December 2014 the remaining contingent consideration provision is £3,276,000 (2013: £7,679,000), payment of which is contingent on
earnings targets for the Forensic Technology and 3Phoenix acquisitions through until December 2016, and for contingent payments relating to the
ICE WheelTug certification. 27 Share capital and share options

market price on the five days before the grant less 10%. The vesting period is two years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of three
months from the date of maturity, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
A Savings-Related Share Option Scheme is open to all Canadian employees and provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price
on the five days before the grant less 10%. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the
date of maturity, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
A Savings-Related Share Option Scheme is open to all UK employees and provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on

3. Executive Share Option Scheme
The Executive Share Option Scheme provides share options for nominated employees in the UK, US and Canada. The purchase price is set at a 
mid-market price on the date of grant. This is an unapproved scheme and vesting is unconditional. Options vest after three years and lapse after
seven years from the date of grant.
At 31 December 2014, share options outstanding under the Executive Share Option Scheme were as follows:

The Group recognised total expenses of £1,783,000 (2013: £1,859,000) in relation to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions. Expected
volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The weighted average share price during the year was £18.03. The fair value of
options granted during the year was £1,725,239 (2013: £1,869,986). 27 Share capital and share options (continued)
The Group’s equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value for all
schemes other than the LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:

For the 2011, 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the
most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition. The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions:

Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was £4.44 (2013: £4.51).
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options was 3.7 years (2013: 3.8 years).

Some UK employees of the Group are members of the Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme which was established on 1 March 1994. The
scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1/60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
The scheme was closed to new members in 2003. A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2013. The Group also operates two defined contribution
schemes for overseas employees. In addition to these schemes, the Group’s Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has
three defined benefit schemes and the Swiss business of the acquired Forensic Technology group has a defined benefit scheme.
Defined contribution schemes
The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was £4,696,000 (2013: £4,916,000).
Defined benefit schemes
All the defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2014 using the ‘projected unit’ method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is
administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company. Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the scheme’s
membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company. The Trustees are also
responsible for the investment of the scheme’s assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death. Members who leave service before
retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.
Active members of the scheme pay contributions via salary sacrifice and the Company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular
actuarial valuations. The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the
accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk; inflation risk; investment risk and longevity risk. The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and
manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies. The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a
number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme
was at 6 April 2013. The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2016. These actuarial valuations are
carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence. This contrasts with
these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2013 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2014 by a qualified independent actuary. The figures in the
following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows:
UK Canada Switzerland UK Canada
2014 2014 2014 2013 2013
Discount rate 3.65% 3.65% 1.50% 4.45% 4.45%
Inflation rate – RPI 3.05% 3.05% 1.40% 3.40% 3.40%
Inflation rate – CPI 2.05% 2.05% 1.40% 2.40% n/a
Expected rate of salary increases 3.30% 3.30% 1.00% 3.90% 3.90%
Future pension increases (pre 6/4/08) 2.85% 3.05% 1.40% 3.10% 3.40%
Future pension increases (post 6/4/08) 1.90% n/a n/a 2.00% n/a
For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values. Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on
the level of the total obligation. For the UK scheme, a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.15% and a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate to
3.55% would increase the scheme’s liabilities by 1.8% and 1.9% respectively. If the members’ life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme
liabilities would increase by 3.6%. The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 19 years (2013: 19 years). 
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners. Due to the size of the scheme the
mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely:
Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA/105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002
Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA/105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set
out below:
2014 2013
Current pensioners (at 65) – males 22 years 22 years
Current pensioners (at 65) – females 24 years 24 years
Future pensioners (at 65) – males 24 years 24 years
Future pensioners (at 65) – females 26 years 26 years

3 Phoenix Inc.
On 18 February 2014, the Group acquired the entire share capital of 3 Phoenix Inc. (“3Pi”) for cash consideration of £46.0m. A further sum,
estimated at the time of acquisition as £1.4m (discounted), is payable if certain earnings targets are met for the years ending 31 December 2014,
2015 and 2016. This contingent consideration has been recorded against goodwill in accordance with IFRS 3. Additional amounts of up to £6.0m
will be payable subject to performance and retention of certain members of staff over the next three years and will be expensed to the income
statement as incurred, in accordance with IFRS 3. 
3Pi is a leading supplier of specialist sonar, radar, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance products and solutions. The company has a 10 year
track record of delivering critical real-time sensor and processing systems, primarily to the US Navy, but also to commercial customers. 3Pi is a bolt-on
acquisition to Ultra’s existing Tactical & Sonar Systems division, with which there are a significant number of internal and external synergies.

The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business totalling £59.6m 
(2013: £62.6m). 
The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations
that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as set out in note 36, the Oman Airport IT contract has been terminated. There is significant
uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of negotiations regarding this event. The Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims
which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either
individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position. 
36 Post balance sheet events – Oman Airport IT contract termination
Confirmation of the termination of the Oman Airport IT contract was received on 9 February 2015. The termination event related to conditions already
in existence at the balance sheet date and consequently the termination is considered to be an adjusting post balance sheet event for 2014 in
accordance with IAS 10. There is significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of negotiations with the Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Transport
& Communications, over the timing of receipt of any agreed settlement, or whether agreement can be reached without the need to enter a formal
arbitration or judicial process. Consequently, a number of significant judgements and estimates are required with respect to matters arising due to the
termination event. Revenue has been recognised, in accordance with group policy, to the extent of work performed that it is probable will be
recovered at the time. Trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts have been assessed for recoverability and allowances made for estimated
irrecoverable amounts. Specific provisions have been booked to cover estimated legal costs and all known liabilities where the group has assessed it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Material items have been disclosed separately within the
financial statements. Disclosure is provided on the consolidated income statement and in note 2 regarding the £46.9m termination cost, comprising
the £37.2m provision charge booked against contract receivables balances (see note 19) and other termination provisions of £9.7m (see note 26). 118 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc

Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Statement of accounting policies
In respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements
A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently across the Group throughout the current and
preceding year, is set out below:
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The financial statements have also
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations.
Adoption of new and revised Standards
The following IFRIC interpretations, amendments to existing standards and new standards have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted
the reported results or the financial position:
• IAS 27 (Revised) Separate Financial Statements
• IAS 28 (Revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
• Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Amendments to application guidance on the offsetting of financial assets and 
financial liabilities
The following standards were also adopted in the current year and have had the impact as set out below:
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 10 replaces the parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that dealt with consolidated financial statements and SIC-12
Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 changes the definition of control such that an investor has control over an investee when a) it has
power over an investee; (b) it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (c) has the ability to use its power
to affect its returns. All three of these criteria must be met for an investor to have control over an investee. Previously, control was defined as the power
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The adoption of IFRS 10 had no impact on the
consolidation of entities held by the Group.
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers. IFRS 11 deals with
how a joint arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control should be classified and accounted for. Under IFRS 11, there are only two types
of joint arrangements – joint operations and joint ventures. The application of IFRS 11 did not have an effect on these consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 12 is a new disclosure standard and is applicable to entities that have interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and/or unconsolidated
structured entities. In general, the application of IFRS 12 has resulted in more extensive disclosures in the consolidated financial statements (see
accounting policies note and note 34).
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial
statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: enhancing disclosures about the Transfers of Financial Assets, enhancing disclosures about
offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities and disclosures about the initial application of IFRS 9
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group, except for:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – This will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers – This will potentially revise the timing and amount of revenue recognition on some of the Group’s
contracts. The Group is assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements. IFRS 15 is effective from 1 January 2017.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivatives and assets held for sale which are measured
at fair value.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the statement on Corporate
Governance on page 60. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries)
made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company: 
• has the power over the investee; 
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three
elements of control listed above. 
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statements of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests.
Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 120 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements
Basis of consolidation (continued)
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’ s accounting policies. 
All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in
full on consolidation.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of
the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference
between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in
equity and attributed to owners of the company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of
the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and
liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary
are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant
assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the
fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under FRS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the
cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
Proxy Board
Certain Group companies in the US undertake work of importance to US national security; consequently activities are conducted under foreign
ownership regulations which require operation under a Proxy Agreement. The regulations are intended to insulate these activities from undue foreign
influence as a result of foreign ownership. The entities that are operated under the management of a Proxy Board are Special Operations Technology Inc
(“SOTECH”), ProLogic Inc (“ProLogic”) and Advanced Tactical Systems Inc (“ATS”).  
The Directors consider that the Group has control over the operating and financial policies and results of these entities, therefore, they are consolidated
in the Group consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group
to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with 
IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively; and 
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
are measured in accordance with that standard. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the
acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a
business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted
retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional
information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that
existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends
on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and
its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent
reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39, or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain 
or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity is remeasured to its acquisition date fair
value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that
have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that
interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports
provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see
above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above. Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is
recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 121
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included in determining
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control
over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Investments in
associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Sales of goods are normally recognised when
goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from contracts to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contracts in the same way as for long-term
contracts. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract
costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Revenue from long-term contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on long-term contracts (see accounting policy
‘Long-term contracts’). 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Long-term contracts
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the
contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to
the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and
incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer, or when it is considered probable that the customer will
approve the variation and the amount of revenue arising from the variation.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it
is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at the actual exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that
date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the
income statement.
The trading results and cash flows of overseas undertakings are translated into sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, using the
average rates of exchange during the relevant financial period. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the
rates ruling at the year-end. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening balance sheets and results are classified as equity and
transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the
closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling
denominated assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred, except where they relate to qualifying assets, in which case they
are capitalised.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the expenditure towards which they are intended to contribute,
to the extent that the conditions for receipt have been met and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received.
Government assistance provided in the form of below market rate of interest loans are treated as government grants. The benefit of the below market
rate of interest is calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loan and is matched against the related
expenditure. The fair value of the loan is calculated using prevailing market interest rates. 122 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
Retirement benefit costs 
The Group provides pensions to its employees and Directors through defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The schemes are
funded and their assets are held independently of the Group by trustees.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations
being carried out at each balance sheet date. The actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised
outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the
average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Any internally generated intangible asset arising from development activities is recognised only if an asset is created that can be identified, it is probable
that the asset created will generate future economic benefit and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets
Costs associated with producing or maintaining computer software programmes for sale are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly
associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, that will generate economic benefits exceeding
costs beyond one year and that can be measured reliably, are recognised as intangible assets. Capitalised software development expenditure is stated at cost
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset.
Acquired computer software licences for use within the Group are capitalised as intangible assets on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring
to use the specific software.
Patents and trademarks are stated initially at historical cost. Patents and trademarks have definite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination whose fair value can be reliably measured are separated from goodwill and amortised over their
remaining estimated useful lives.
Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine
the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so
that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for
the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, except for goodwill.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is shown at original historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected
useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years
Short leasehold improvements over remaining period of lease
Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of
the relevant lease.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 123
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Rentals under operating leases, where the Group acts as either lessee or lessor, are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the
payments are not made on such a basis. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of
the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis and including an appropriate proportion of overheads incurred in bringing
the inventories to their present location and condition) and net realisable value. Provision is made for any obsolete, slow moving or defective items.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is
objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in-hand, call deposits and bank overdrafts, where there is right of set off. Bank overdrafts are presented as
current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Assets held for sale
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This
condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must
be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their fair value.
Loans and overdrafts
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs where there is a facility commitment. In these
circumstances issue costs are deducted from the value of the loan and amortised over the life of the commitment. Where there is no facility
commitment, issue costs are written-off as incurred. Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for on an
accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market related conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the share option plans and a stochastic model for awards made under the 2007 Long-Term
Incentive Plan.
The credits in respect of equity-settled amounts are included in equity.
Provisions
Provisions, including property related provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of
a past event, and where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of repair and rectification of products under warranty, based on known exposures and historical occurrences.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to
affected parties. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 124 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
Ultra uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate
and interest rate movements. Ultra does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities and measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Changes in their fair
values are recognised in the income statement and this is likely to cause volatility in situations where the carrying value of the hedged item is not
adjusted to reflect fair value changes arising from the hedged risk. Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met, hedge accounting may be used
to mitigate this income statement volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting will not generally be applied to transactional hedging relationships, such as hedges of forecast or committed transactions. However,
hedge accounting will be applied to translational hedging relationships where it is permissible under IAS 39. When hedge accounting is used, the
relevant hedging relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or
decrease in the fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent
that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement. Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. For cash flow hedges of forecasted future transactions, when the hedged item is recognised
in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged
items result in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Income statement
Additional line items are disclosed in the consolidated income statement when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Group’s 
financial performance.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and after the share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items
When items of income or expense are material and they are relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance, they are disclosed
separately within the financial statements. Such exceptional items include material costs or reversals arising from a restructuring of the Group’s operations,
material creation or reversals of provisions, and material litigation settlements. 
Non-statutory performance measures
In the analysis of the Group’s operating results, earnings per share and cash flows, information is presented to provide readers with additional
performance indicators that are prepared on a non-statutory basis. This presentation is regularly reviewed by management to identify items that are
unusual and other items relevant to an understanding of the Group’s performance and long-term trends with reference to their materiality and nature.
This additional information is not uniformly defined by all Companies and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other
organisations. The non-statutory disclosures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent statutory measure. Information for
separate presentation is considered as follows:
• Contract losses arising in the ordinary course of trading are not separately presented, however losses (and subsequent reversals) are separately disclosed
in situations of a material dispute which are expected to lead to arbitration or legal proceedings.
• Material costs or reversals arising from a significant restructuring of the Group’s operations are presented separately.
• The amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions and impairment of goodwill are presented separately.
• Other matters arising due to the Group’s acquisitions such as adjustments to contingent consideration, payment of retention bonuses, acquisition costs
and fair value adjustments for acquired inventory made in accordance with IFRS 13 are separately disclosed in aggregate.
• Furthermore, IAS 37 requires the Group to discount provisions using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current assessment of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the liability, this discount unwind is presented separately when the provision relates to acquisition contingent consideration.
• Derivative instruments used to manage the Group’s foreign exchange exposures are ‘fair valued’ in accordance with IAS 39. This creates volatility in the
valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time. This has minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but
can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates, consequently the gain or loss is presented separately.
• The defined benefit pension net interest charge arising in accordance with IAS 19 is presented separately.
• The Group is cash-generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business. It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure
of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth. For this, the Group uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations,
as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments. Management believes that
using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product
development and other intangibles, would result in an under-reporting of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.  Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 125

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
When applying the Group’s accounting policies, management must make a number of key judgements involving estimates and assumptions concerning
the future. These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including historical experience, that may differ significantly
from the actual outcome. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include:
CONTRACT REVENUE AND PROFIT RECOGNITION
A significant proportion of the Group’s activities are conducted under long term contract arrangements and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 11
Construction Contracts.
Revenue and profit on such contracts are recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date of the
particular contract and are calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and expected costs. When the contract outcome cannot be
reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to match costs until such time as this can be reliably estimated. Expected costs are calculated after taking
account of the perceived contract risks related to performance not yet proven. 
Owing to the complexity of some of the contracts undertaken by the Group the cost estimation process requires significant judgement and is carried out
using the experience of the Group’s engineers, project managers and finance and commercial professionals. Because of the level of judgement required,
cost estimates are reviewed and updated on a regular basis using the Group’s established project management processes. Some of the factors that will
impact upon cost estimates include the availability of suitably qualified labour, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of
materials, the impact of change orders and the performance of sub-contractors.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where services are rendered, sales are recognised when the stage of completion of the services and the related revenue and costs can be measured reliably. 
Where goods are delivered under arrangements not considered to fall under the scope of IAS 11 Construction Contracts, revenue is recognised when
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Group accounts for its post-retirement pension plans in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income
statement in the period in which those benefits have been earned by the employees. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in
which they arise and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the scheme liabilities as reduced by the fair value of
the scheme assets.
The main assumptions used in determining the defined benefit post retirement obligation include the discount rate used in discounting scheme
liabilities, the inflation rate, the expected rate of salary inflation, the expected rate of future pension increases, expected returns on scheme assets and
future mortality assumptions. For each of these assumptions, there is a range of possible values. Relatively small changes in some of these variables can
have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
The valuation of pension scheme assets and liabilities at a specific point of time rather than over a period of time can lead to significant annual
movements in the pension scheme deficit as calculated under IAS 19, but has no impact on short-term cash contributions since these are based upon
separate independent actuarial valuations.
Details of the pension scheme assumptions and obligation at 31 December 2014 are provided in note 31.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets
requires the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome. These estimates and judgements cover future growth rates,
expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. 
GOODWILL
Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating
units (CGUs). These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash flows and long-term growth rates of the CGUs. Further details
on these estimates are provided in note 13.
INCOME TAXES
In determining the Group’s provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will
be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made. 
OMAN AIRPORT IT CONTRACT TERMINATION
Confirmation of the termination of the Oman Airport IT contract was received on 9 February 2015. The termination event related to conditions already in existence
at the balance sheet date and consequently the termination is considered to be an adjusting post balance sheet event for 2014 in accordance with IAS 10. There
is significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of negotiations with the Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Transport & Communications, over the timing of
receipt of any agreed settlement, or whether agreement can be reached without the need to enter a formal arbitration or judicial process. Consequently, a number
of significant judgements and estimates are required with respect to matters arising due to the termination event. Revenue has been recognised, in accordance
with group policy, to the extent of work performed that it is probable will be recovered at the time. Trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts have
been assessed for recoverability and allowances made for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Specific provisions have been booked to cover estimated legal costs
and all known liabilities where the group has assessed it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Material items
have been disclosed separately within the financial statements. Disclosure is provided on the consolidated income statement and in note 2 regarding the £46.9m
termination cost, comprising the £37.2m provision charge booked against contract receivables balances (see note 19) and other termination provisions of
£9.7m (see note 26). 126 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc

Statement of accounting policies for the Company accounts
A summary of the Company’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and preceding year in the
separate financial information presented for the Company, are set out below:
Basis of accounting
The Company accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. No
profit and loss account is presented for the Company, as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s retained profit for the
year is disclosed in note 48.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are shown at original historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Taxation
UK Corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements. These arise from
including gains and losses in tax assessments in different periods from those recognised in the financial statements. A net deferred tax asset is regarded
as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Retirement benefit costs
The Company provides pensions to its employees and Directors through defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The schemes are
funded and their assets are held independently of the Group by trustees.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account for defined benefit schemes is the estimated regular cost of providing the benefits accrued in the
period adjusted to reflect variations from the cost. The regular cost is calculated so that it represents a substantially level percentage of current and
future pensionable payroll. Any difference between the amount charged to the profit and loss account and contributions paid to the pension scheme is
shown as a separately identifiable liability or asset in the balance sheet.
Certain employees and Directors participated in the UK defined benefit scheme operated by Ultra Electronics Limited. Paragraph 9(b) of FRS 17 allows
for a defined benefit scheme to be accounted for as a defined contribution scheme where there are multi-employers and one employer is unable to
identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. The Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme has
been accounted for on this basis. The deficit in the scheme at 31 December 2014 was £85.7 million (2013: £85.2 million). Further disclosures in relation
to this pension scheme are given in note 31 to the Group financial statements. Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an
expense as they fall due.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the statement on Corporate
Governance on page 60.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at the actual exchange rates at the date of the transactions (or, where
appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date (or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward
exchange contract). Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain
or loss in the profit and loss account.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate
of shares that will eventually vest. Further disclosure in relation to share-based payments is given in note 27 of the Group financial statements.
Related parties
The Company has taken the FRS 8 (revised) exemption from disclosure of transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries. Remuneration of the
Directors is provided in the audited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 71 to 74.
Loans and overdrafts
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs where there is a facility commitment. In these
circumstances issue costs are deducted from the value of the loan and amortised over the life of the commitment. Where there is no facility commitment,
issue costs are written-off as incurred. Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for on an accruals basis
in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled
in the period in which they arise.

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Andrew Duff
Chairman
U U To read more on our objectives, 
strategies and business model 
go to page 6
After my first year as Chairman, I am pleased  
to report that 2014 has been another year of 
sales and earnings growth for Elementis. Since 
becoming Chairman I have enjoyed getting to 
know the Group through visits to our various 
sites around the globe, meeting our people and 
engaging with the management team and my 
fellow directors. I have found the Group to be 
well managed, with a clear strategy and people 
around the world who are hardworking, talented 
and enthusiastic about the Group and its 
prospects. 
In 2014, Group sales were $790.4 million, an 
improvement of 2 per cent over the previous 
year, largely driven by the further progress 
achieved in Specialty Products while Chromium 
and Surfactants delivered sales and cash 
generation in line with their respective strategies. 
Group operating profit* for the year was  
$150.1 million compared to $146.6 million in  
the previous year, whilst the Group’s operating 
margin* remained stable at 19 per cent. Diluted 
earnings per share* for the year improved by  
8 per cent to 24.8 cents. 
The Group is recording a number of pension, 
tax and legacy items under the heading 
‘Exceptional items’ in this year’s income 
statement. These items are discussed more fully 
in the Finance report on page 12. After taking 
account of these items, Group operating profit 
for the year was $156.4 million, compared to 
$144.9 million in the previous year, and diluted 
earnings per share was 37.7 cents, compared  
to 23.0 cents in 2013.
Balance sheet
One of the Group’s core strengths is its strong 
balance sheet, supported by positive cash  
flow generation. In 2014 this was once again 
demonstrated with the Group’s net cash 
position increasing from $54.1 million at the end 
of 2013 to $64.2 million at the end of 2014. This 
was achieved despite financing a robust capital 
expenditure programme and an additional one 
time UK pension contribution. Under our current 
dividend policy, this increase in net cash results 
in a similar increase in the special dividend. 
Once again the deficit on Group retirement 
plans, under IAS 19, improved in 2014, going 
from $99.3 million at the end of 2013 to $65.8 
million at the end of 2014. The improvement was 
largely the result of favourable asset returns and 
Company contributions.
Dividends
The Board is continuing with the dividend  
policy introduced in 2012, which is to pay 
approximately one third of earnings, before 
exceptional items, each year in a combination of 
interim and final dividends. In addition, a special 
dividend is paid each year of up to 50 per cent 
of the net cash balance at the end of the year, 
provided there are no immediate investment 
plans for that cash. Consequently, the Board is 
recommending a final dividend for 2014 of 5.75 
cents per share (2013: 5.50 cents) and a special 
dividend of 6.95 cents per share or $32.1 million 
(2013: 5.86 cents or $27.1 million). These will be 
paid on 22 May 2015, in pounds sterling at an 
exchange rate of £1.00:$1.5429 (equivalent to a 
sterling amount of 8.2313 pence per share), to 
shareholders on the register on 24 April 2015. 
This brings the total dividends for the year to 
15.40 cents per share (2013: 13.93 cents), 
representing an increase of 11 per cent over  
the previous year.

Health, safety and the environment
Since becoming Chairman, it has been 
gratifying to learn that the Group is achieving 
high standards of performance, compared  
to the industry, in this important area of our 
business and has developed a culture 
throughout the organisation that recognises  
that zero incidents must be the ultimate goal.  
As such, lessons learned from even the most 
minor incidents are used to continuously 
improve our processes and activities, ensuring 
that the protection of our employees and the 
environment remains a high priority.
Board changes
As previously announced, Ian Brindle and  
Kevin Matthews retired as Board members on 
15 December and 31 October 2014 respectively. 
Both Ian and Kevin were key members of  
the Board since their appointments in 2005. 
Kevin served as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee from April 2008 to September 2013, 
while Ian served as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, Senior Independent Director and, 
more recently, Chairman of the Board. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank both of them 
for their dedication and support during their 
tenure as Board members.
To replace Ian and Kevin, I am delighted to 
welcome Nick Salmon and Steve Good to the 
Board as from 20 October 2014. Both Nick  
and Steve have impressive backgrounds as 
successful executives and directors and I look 
forward to working closely with them in support 
of the Group’s continuing success.
 
Governance
The Board considers that it has applied all  
the principles and provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code (2012 version) in 2014, with 
one exception on audit tenders explained on 
page 28. Further information about this and 
other aspects of our governance arrangements 
are set out in the Corporate governance report 
on page 28.
People
The Group’s continued success is due in no 
small part to the hard work, dedication and skill 
of its people and I would therefore like to give 
them my sincere thanks on behalf of the Board.
 
Outlook
As the new Chairman, I have inherited a Group 
with a clear and ambitious strategy that focuses 
on profitable growth, attractive returns on capital 
and shareholder value. These are all themes 
that I wholly support and the Board is fully 
engaged in helping the Group to deliver on this 
strategy. The quality of our existing businesses, 
combined with its strong cash flow generation 
and balance sheet, ensures that we have both 
the platform and the flexibility to make progress 
and to pursue profitable opportunities, both 
organic and inorganic as they arise.

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information David Dutro
Group Chief  
Executive
Dear Shareholders,
Once again, it is my privilege to report that 
Elementis has delivered another year of solid 
financial performance. The Group’s strategy is 
centred on creating its own growth opportunities 
based upon its strong and diverse market 
positions. This has been pivotal in enabling us  
to deliver a fifth consecutive year of EPS* growth, 
a further improvement in our year end net cash 
balance and a material increase in the total 
dividend. This progress has been achieved 
despite uneven regional and market segment 
growth, which further validates our strategy  
and underlines the resilience of Elementis. 
We remain resolute in our commitment to 
outperform the market and deliver profitable 
growth across all stages of the economic cycle 
and we have continued to invest to achieve that 
objective. While our global capability enables  
us to develop and leverage solutions for our 
customers around the world, our local presence 
allows us to truly understand our customers  
and their specific needs. 
2014 highlights:
• Another strong financial performance:
 – 5th consecutive year of EPS* growth.
 – Stable operating margin* at 19 per cent. 
 – Strong cash flow from operations saw  
net cash increase by $10.1 million. 
 – Final dividend increased by 5 per cent.
 – Special dividend paid for the 3rd 
successive year and increased by  
19 per cent.
• Specialty Products:
 – North America coatings up 7 per cent, 
driven in part by sales of innovative 
products from the newly commissioned 
decorative coatings facility.
 – Asia Pacific coatings up 5 per cent  
with sales and profits from Chinese 
manufactured organoclays reaching  
their highest levels to date.
 – Good international sales growth from 
Hi-Mar, our recently acquired US based 
defoamer business.
• Chromium:
 – Optimising product and sales mix to 
produce stable earnings and cash flow.
 – Cash generation was 117 per cent of 
operating profit*.
• Maintaining a strong focus on improving our 
excellent health and safety performance.
Consistent with our strategic focus on growth, 
Specialty Products introduced new products, 
expanded its geographic presence and made 
further investments to serve our customers’ 
growing demand. As a result of these  
initiatives we:
• Achieved a record level of new products  
as a percentage of sales, with new products 
accounting for 9 per cent of total revenue  
in the Specialty Products business.
• Opened a new sales office in Houston, 
Texas, led by a new business director and 
sales team in order to focus more intensely 
on oilfield customers.
Elementis has delivered another year of solid 
financial performance. The Group’s strategy  
is centred on creating its own growth opportunities 
based upon its strong and diverse market 
positions. This has been pivotal in enabling  
us to deliver a fifth consecutive year of EPS* 
growth, a further improvement in our year end  
net cash balance and a material increase in the  
total dividend.”

• Prepared Watercryl, our recently acquired 
coatings additives company in Brazil, to 
begin exporting throughout Latin America, 
which included the installation of a 
comprehensive ERP system.
• Expanded the scope of the New Martinsville 
project to broaden its product range 
capabilities for US decorative coatings.  
All 3 phases of construction are now 
successfully completed and customer 
approvals are ramping up quickly.
• Our manufacturing facility in Livingston, 
Scotland, achieved certification for RSPO 
(Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil) and 
CGMP (consumer good manufacturing 
practices), further differentiating and 
protecting our line of proprietary personal 
care products.
The Specialty Products business provides  
high value functional additives used in coatings, 
oilfield and personal care applications that 
improve the physical properties and performance 
of our customers’ products or production 
processes. The business provides a strong 
growth platform with its balanced geographic 
exposure across both mature and emerging 
economies, strong technology base and strategic 
market diversification. Specialty Products has  
a significant technical service and application 
support presence in its chosen markets that  
is built on long term relationships of trust, 
collaboration and technical expertise. We help 
our customers improve the performance of their 
products, lower costs or improve regulatory 
compliance by introducing additives that 
represent a low percentage of the formula  
cost but are critical to product performance. 
Our differentiated, innovative product offering  
is supported by excellent process technology 
and tightly held manufacturing know how.  
The majority of our new products are covered 
by intellectual property and, with over 2,500 
products in our portfolio, the business is well 
positioned to be the industry’s “one stop 
solution provider”.
The strategy of our Chromium business is 
focused on reducing cyclical fluctuations and 
consistently delivering predictable and therefore 
higher quality earnings and cash flow. The 
business operates at consistently high rates of 
capacity utilisation and serves a diverse number 
of customers, geographies and applications, 
allowing it to quickly shift products and 
resources towards market segments and 
regions with the greatest opportunities.
As the only locally based manufacturer of 
chromium chemicals, the business is able to 
provide its North American customers with a 
differentiated and highly valued closed loop 
delivery model which offers them significant 
advantages and benefits. This model would be 
extremely difficult for a non-domestic supplier  
to replicate and therefore provides a long term 
competitive advantage. The business has a 
significant proportion of its chromium chemicals 
sales in North America and 65 per cent of its 
sales were to customers in the region during  
the year.
Regardless of the overall global economic 
conditions, Elementis will continue its focus  
on driving continuous improvement in the areas  
we can control, including sustainable operating 
improvements, market share gains, the 
introduction of innovative new products and 
expansion into new geographic markets. We  
are positive about our future, due in large part  
to the hard work, ingenuity and unbounded 
energy of the global Elementis team. Every  
day, throughout the year, our people deliver  
the quality and service that builds customer 
loyalty and market strength. Although economic 
uncertainties in Europe and evolving dynamics 
in the oilfield sector remain evident, the current 
year has started on a solid footing and we  
are confident that the Group will make further 
progress in the coming year. We are fully 
committed and well positioned to maintain  
our record of delivering profitable growth and 
industry leadership and would like to thank  
our shareholders and customers for their 
continued confidence and support.

is the core of our growth strategy and  
has the following key characteristics:
U U Operating in diverse and highly

Ultimately, the strategy of the Company is to 
operate its portfolio of manufacturing assets  
and exploit its proprietary technologies and 
know how to supply products and services

Our businesses
Group performance Specialty  
Products Key facts
• We accounted for 66 per cent of Group sales 
and 66 per cent of Group operating profit*  
in 2014.
• We are based in 28 locations around the 
world, in North and Latin America, Europe 
and Asia, and our sales are broadly split 
between North America, Europe and Asia.
• We have over 900 employees globally,  
13 manufacturing facilities, 3 research 
centres of excellence (including a process 
development facility), 5 technical service 
centres and 11 dedicated sales offices.
• Our top 10 customers account for less than 
22 per cent of total sales.
• In each key segment, the business has many 
competitors from multinationals to smaller 
privately owned businesses.
What we do
• We provide high value functional additives  
to the industrial and decorative coatings, 
oilfield drilling and personal care markets  
that improve the flow characteristics and 
performance of our customers’ products  
or production processes.
• We have significant expertise in the science 
of rheology which, in its simplest form, 
means our technology imparts thickness  
and viscosity control. For example, paint 
without rheological additives would have  
the consistency of water but paint with our 
additives is smooth, homogeneous and  
has a controlled, even spread on a surface.
• The same requirements for rheological 
additives exist in personal care products, 
such as creams and lotions, and in oilfield 
drilling applications, providing viscosity 
control to thicken and suspend solids  
in drilling formulations and to stabilise 
stimulation packages used in the  
drilling process.

Key product applications
• Industrial coatings: protective applications  
in automotive, containers, furniture, flooring, 
marine, plastics and construction.
• Decorative coatings: homes, offices and 
similar environments.
• Oilfield: drilling and fracturing fluids utilised  
in oil and gas extraction activities.
• Personal care: antiperspirants, nail polish, 
mascara, make-up, eye shadow, lipsticks, 
creams, lotions and suncare products.
• Construction: concrete, plasters, mortars, 
renderings, stuccos, flooring systems  
and building adhesives.
Key sector drivers
• Industrial coatings: increasing demand from 
customers for high performance coatings 
that enhance their products and exposure  
to higher growth emerging markets.
• Decorative coatings: regulatory trend 
towards low VOC and increasing consumer 
sophistication in emerging markets.
• Oilfield: exposure to shale oil and gas  
and extreme drilling.
• Personal care: increasingly sophisticated 
consumer demand and emerging market 
development.
2014 Performance
Sales in 2014 were $519.7 million compared  
to $502.8 million in the previous year, which is  
an increase of 3 per cent. Currency movements 
had no material impact on sales for the year as  
a whole, although euro exchange rates had a 
positive influence for the first 9 months of 2014 
but this was offset in the final 3 months when the 
value of the euro declined against the US dollar. 
Overall pricing during the year was relatively 
stable and therefore higher volumes were the 
main driver of the improved sales. 
• In North America, sales of coatings additives 
improved by 7 per cent compared to the 
previous year. The business experienced 
good sales growth throughout the year due, 
in part, to new innovative products introduced 
into the decorative coatings market, utilising 
the recently completed facility in New 
Martinsville, US, and solid industrial activity 
from the underlying economy.
• In Europe, coatings additives sales improved 
by 2 per cent over the previous year as the 
business made good progress despite a 
more challenging economic environment. 
The period saw a marked reduction in 
demand in the final 3 months of the year as 
European economic concerns resurfaced. 
Overall, the business continued to benefit 
from strong customer relationships, new 
product sales and additional sales into  
the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
• Sales of coatings additives in Asia Pacific 
improved by 5 per cent as the business 
benefited from its strong position in China 
and expanding sales in the rest of Asia 
Pacific, driven by a differentiated product 
offering, exemplary customer service  
and high quality technical support.
• In Latin America, coatings additives sales 
were 3 per cent lower than the previous  
year as good progress in expanding  
sales outside Brazil was offset by weak 
underlying economic activity and adverse 
currency movements.
Following a slow start to the year that was 
impacted by poor weather in North America, 
Oilfield sales returned to robust growth in the 
second half of the year with sales for the final  
6 months 9 per cent higher than the same 
period last year. This brought the full year result 
to within 3 per cent of the previous year with 
robust activity evident in shale, deep offshore 
and seasonal Canadian drilling.
In Personal care, sales were 8 per cent higher 
than the previous year with particularly strong 
growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, where 
commercial resources were recently added  
to further expand the geographic presence of 
the business. This attractive growth rate was 
achieved despite a temporary downturn in 
European demand during the final 3 months  
of the year, due to renewed concerns about  
the European economy.
Operating profit* for the year was similar to the 
previous year at $98.5 million. There were no 
material changes in raw material and energy 
costs during the year, but the start-up effects  
of the recent investments in the coatings 
additives plant in New Martinsville had a short 
term dampening effect on operating margin*, 
which ended the year at 19.0 per cent 
compared to 19.7 per cent in the previous year.

2014 Performance
Sales in Surfactants in 2014 were $67.1 million 
compared to $72.2 million in the previous year, 
which is a reduction of 7 per cent with volumes 
lower by 11 per cent. This is consistent with the 
Group’s strategy of utilising more of the Delden 
facility to produce higher margin additives for 
the Specialty Products business and hence 
gradually reduce the volume of surfactants 
produced and sold. 
Operating profit* in 2014 was $4.9 million 
compared to $5.6 million in the previous year, 
consistent with the lower sales volumes, while 
average selling prices improved by 3 per cent  
in response to higher raw material prices. 
Currency movements had no material impact  
on sales and operating profit, despite the fact 
that the majority of the business is transacted  
in euros, because the average euro/US dollar 
exchange rate was at a similar level in both years.
2014 Performance
Consistent with the strategy of delivering stable 
earnings and cash flow, sales in Chromium in 
2014 were 1 per cent higher than the previous 
year at $216.5 million, with similar volumes sold in 
each year. Currency movements had no material 
impact on sales or operating profit as the majority 
of the business is transacted in US dollars.
Following a slow start to the year due to  
adverse weather conditions, sales in North 
America finished the year 14 per cent higher  
than the previous year. Strong demand for 
refractory grade oxide and chromic acid for 
timber treatment were the key drivers of the 
improvement, while chrome sulphate sales into 
leather tanning were relatively stable, having 
shown a weaker trend in previous periods. As  
the strategy also includes the optimisation of 
Chromium’s flexible operating base in North 
America, utilising a relatively fixed manufacturing 
output, higher sales in North America naturally 
resulted in lower sales in both Europe and Asia 
Pacific, where markets have generally been more 
challenging. In 2014, 65 per cent of Chromium’s 
sales were in North America, compared to 57  
per cent in 2013.
Operating profit* for 2014 was 6 per cent higher 
than the previous year at $58.3 million and 
benefited from an enhanced sales mix, due  
to the trends already described, while 
improvements in the overall cost base offset 
marginally lower average selling prices.

Group results
Group sales in 2014 were $790.4 million compared to $776.8 million in  
the previous year, an increase of 2 per cent with no material impact from 
currency movements. Sales in Specialty Products improved by 3 per cent 
on higher volumes while, in line with their respective strategies, sales in 
Chromium were relatively stable and in Surfactants reduced by 7 per cent.
Group operating profit* was $150.1 million compared to $146.6 million  
in the previous year, with no material impact from currency movements,  
and Group operating margin* was stable at 19 per cent in each year.
Currency hedging
Although a large proportion of the Group’s business is transacted in  
US dollars, the Group also transacts in other currencies, in particular 
euros, pounds sterling and Chinese renminbi. In order to reduce earnings 
volatility from these currency exposures, the Group takes out cash flow 
hedges each year where these are readily available. In 2014, overall 
currency movements were such that the net impact of these hedge 
transactions was a credit to operating profit of $1.9 million, while in  
2013 there was no material impact.
Central costs
Central costs are those costs that are not identifiable as expenses of a 
particular business and comprise expenditures of the Board of directors 
and the corporate office. In 2014 central costs* were $11.6 million, which 
was lower than the previous year by $1.6 million due to a reduction in the 
cost of variable compensation plans and other central provisions which 
offset an increase of $0.6 million due to currency movements.
Exceptional items
A number of items have been recorded under ‘exceptional items’ in the 
2014 Consolidated income statement by virtue of their size and/or one 
time nature, in order to provide a better understanding of the Group’s 
results. The net impact of these items on the Group profit before tax  
for the year is a credit of $6.3 million. The before tax items fall into  
3 categories, as summarised below.

Central costs – (0.4) 3.3 2.9
Total 4.9 (1.9) 3.3 6.3
Post employment benefits – net credit of $4.9 million
In the Netherlands the arrangement with the previous insurers of the 
defined benefit pension scheme came to an end on 31 December 2014 
and the Group has contracted with a new industry wide pension fund  
for 2015 onwards. As a result, the plan will in future be accounted  
for as a defined contribution plan. Consequently, a deficit amount of  
$4.1 million relating to the original plan has been reversed in 2014 and  
the resulting credit recorded as an exceptional item. More details on this 
can be found later in this report. In addition, a legacy provision of $0.8 
million relating to a 2005 claim made by a group of pensioners in the 
Netherlands has also been reversed and credited to Group profit because 
the matter has now been settled. The total amount of $4.9 million has 
been allocated between Specialty Products and Surfactants in a manner 
that is consistent with how fixed costs in the Netherlands are allocated 
between these two businesses.

12 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Finance report Environmental provisions – charge of $1.9 million
The Group’s environmental provisions are calculated on a discounted 
basis, reflecting the time period over which spending is estimated to take 
place. As a result of a decline in the underlying market interest rates that 
are utilised in the discount rate calculation, it was concluded that the 
discount rate applied to future spending should be further reduced.  
This resulted in a charge of $1.9 million in 2014 which was allocated 
between Chromium and central costs based on the properties to  
which the spending relates.
Other adjustments – net credit of $3.3 million
The liquidations of a number of legacy subsidiaries no longer involved  
in Group activities resulted in one time credits totalling $3.3 million being 
recorded in Group profit.
Taxation – net credit of $53.5 million
Tax related items that result in a net credit of $53.5 million have also been 
recorded as exceptional items. The net credit arises from the recognition  
of UK advance corporation tax credits amounting to $42.0 million with an 
additional credit of $12.3 million in respect of UK tax assets. The surplus  
ACT arose in respect of tax paid under the prior imputation system, which 
allowed for ACT credits to be offset against mainstream UK tax liabilities.  
The ACT not previously used under that imputation system had been written 
off at the time when there was no UK corporation tax liability anticipated in 
the foreseeable future. It is now the Board’s view that taxable profits will  
arise in the UK in the future and, as such, surplus ACT previously written  
off should now be recognised as a tax asset. Offsetting these credits is the 
tax cost associated with the pre-tax exceptional items listed above.
Other expenses
Other expenses are administration costs incurred and paid by the Group’s 
pension schemes, whose members are primarily former employees of 
legacy businesses. Total costs were $1.9 million in 2014 compared to  
$2.0 million in the previous year, reflecting the stable nature of this  
cost category.

Discount unwind on provisions (1.9) (1.8)
(6.3) (8.6)
Net finance costs declined by $2.3 million in 2014 to $6.3 million, mainly  
due to a decline in the financial cost of pension deficits and a reduction in 
interest on bank borrowings. Net pension finance costs were lower than  
the previous year largely because, under IAS 19, the charge is based on  
the deficit value at the beginning of the year and the opening deficit in 2014 
was approximately 28 per cent lower than it was in 2013. Finance cost of 
borrowings largely relate to amortised arrangement and commitment fees 
on unutilised borrowing facilities, as the Group is in a net cash position, and 
came down as a result of the refinancing of the Group’s main borrowing 
facility in the second half of 2013. Average borrowings in the year and 
borrowing rates were also marginally lower than the previous year. Discount 
on provisions relates to the annual time value of the Group’s environmental 
provisions, which are calculated on a discounted basis.

The tax credit of $27.2 million (2013: charge $27.6 million) includes  
a significant UK exceptional tax credit of $54.3 million. Before this 
exceptional tax credit and the tax charge of $0.8 million in relation to 
exceptional items, the tax charge was $26.3 million (2013: $29.4 million) 
and represents an effective tax rate of 18.5 per cent (2013: 21.6 per cent). 
The decrease in tax rate results from certain additional and permanent  
tax benefits arising from both overseas tax allowances as well as changes 
in the geographic mix of profits. 
Earnings per share
Note 9 to the Consolidated financial statements sets out a number of 
calculations of earnings per share. To better understand the underlying 
performance of the Group, earnings per share reported under IFRS is 
adjusted for items classified as exceptional.
Diluted earnings per share, before exceptional items, was 24.8 cents 
compared to 23.0 cents in the previous year, with the improvement  
due mainly to an increase in operating profit, lower finance costs and  
a reduction in the tax rate. Basic earnings per share was 38.1 cents 
compared to 23.3 cents in 2013 and included 13.0 cents (2013: nil) 
relating to exceptional items as described earlier in this report.
Distributions to shareholders
During 2014 the Group paid a final dividend in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2013 of 5.50 cents per share (2013: 5.32 cents) and a 
special dividend of 5.86 cents per share (2013: 4.79 cents). An interim 
dividend of 2.70 cents per share (2013: 2.57 cents) was paid on 3 October 
2014 and the Board is recommending a final dividend for 2014 of 
5.75 cents per share and a special dividend of 6.95 cents per share,  
both of which will be paid on 22 May 2015.

previous year end, largely due to production and purchasing patterns 
towards the end of the year. Consequently creditor balances also 
increased by a similar amount. Trade debtor balances declined by 
$4.8 million over the same period, consistent with lower sales in the  
final three months of 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. In 
combination, these changes resulted in the working capital cash inflow  
of $4.3 million for the year. Capital expenditure in 2014 was similar to the 
previous year at $34.9 million, while total depreciation for the year was 
$25.4 million, including $3.6 million relating to amortisation of intangibles. 
$11.2 million was invested in the year in growth projects in Specialty 
Products (2013: $12.6 million), of which $8.0 million related to the third 
phase of our new decorative additives facility in New Martinsville, US,  
and $2.4 million related to plant upgrades in Asia Pacific. Investments  
in plant maintenance and productivity across the Group totalled  
$23.7 million in 2014, compared to $21.8 million in the previous year.
Pension deficit payments in 2014 were $22.7 million higher than the 
previous year at $49.5 million and the increase included an additional one 
time payment to the UK Scheme of $15.2 million and additional payments 
to the US Scheme of $4.7 million. Going forward, total contributions in 
2015 are expected to be in the range $25–$30 million. Interest and tax 
payments totalled $13.3 million in 2014 compared to $14.6 million in the 
previous year, of which $12.0 million (2013: $12.3 million) related to tax 
payments. This level of tax outflow represents a relatively low rate of cash 
tax (8.5 per cent ) and is a result of the Group being able to access certain 
overseas tax credits. Utilisation of these credits is close to an end and 
therefore it is expected that the rate of cash tax will increase going 
forward. The recognition and expected utilisation of the aforementioned 
ACT and tax assets is not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s cash tax rate. Dividends paid in 2014 were $6.4 million higher 
than the previous year at $64.7 million and represents the payment of the 
final and special dividends for 2013 and the interim dividend for 2014, all 
of which were higher than in the previous year. Acquisition spending in 
2014 was $4.1 million and represented the purchase of a minority interest 
in a majority owned business in China, while spending in 2013 of $32.8 
million related to the acquisition of Hi-Mar in the US.

Group equity increased by $98.6 million in 2014 (2013: $64.7 million) 
consistent with the profit for the year, dividends paid and changes in 
pension liabilities. Intangible fixed assets declined by $9.1 million due 
mostly to a currency translation cost of $6.6 million and amortisation 
charges of $3.6 million. Tangible fixed assets increased by $9.1 million in 
the year, largely as a result of capital spending for the year exceeding the 
depreciation charge by $13.6 million, while currency translation reduced 
the year on year balance by $5.5 million. Working capital decreased by 
$6.3 million, with an increase in Specialty Products’ inventories of 
$10.5 million to assist stock availability being offset by an overall increase 
in trade and other payables of $10.9 million and reduced trade and other 
debtors of $4.8 million. Net tax liabilities decreased by $57.9 million, driven 
by the recognition of UK advance corporation tax credits and deferred tax 
assets. Movements in provisions and retirement benefit obligations are 
discussed elsewhere in this report. Net cash increased by $10.1 million  
as described in the previous section.

Provisions
The Group records a provision in the balance sheet when it has a present 
obligation as a result of past events, which is expected to result in an 
outflow of economic benefits in order to settle the obligation. The Group 
calculates provisions on a discounted basis. At the end of 2014 the  
Group held provisions of $35.0 million (2013: $38.1 million), consisting  
of environmental provisions of $31.7 million (2013: $34.9 million) and  
self insurance provisions of $3.3 million (2013: $3.2 million). In 2014 
environmental provisions reduced by $3.2 million as a result of spending 
of $5.1 million (2013: $5.2 million) and favourable currency movements  
of $1.3 million (2013: unfavourable $0.3 million). These were partly offset 
by increases in the provision due to a time value of money charge of  
$1.9 million (2013: $1.8 million) and a structural charge of $1.9 million  
to reflect a change in the underlying discount rate. This latter charge is 
treated as an exceptional item in the Group results as described earlier  
in this report. The self insurance provision represents the Group’s  
estimate of its liability arising from retained liabilities under the  
Group’s insurance programme.

UK plan
The largest of the Group’s retirement plans is the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme (“UK Scheme”) which had a deficit under IAS 19 of 
$28.4 million at the end of 2014, compared to $66.1 million at the end of 
2013. The UK Scheme is relatively mature, with approximately two thirds 
of its gross liabilities represented by pensions in payment, and is closed  
to new members. The deficit under IAS 19 declined in 2014 due mainly  
to a positive return on assets of 13 per cent (2013: 7 per cent) and deficit 
contributions from the Company of $41.9 million (2013: $21.4 million). 
These more than offset the financial cost of the liabilities of $35.6 million 
(2013: $30.6 million) and other liability adjustments of $70.7 million 
(2013: $26.9 million). Deficit contributions in 2014 were made as part of 
the current funding agreement, which was concluded with the trustees of 
the scheme following the triennial valuation exercise as of 30 September 
2011, and included an additional one time payment of $15.2 million. Other 
liability adjustments included the impact of a fall in real corporate bond 
yields during the year by 60 basis points (2013: decline of 20 basis points). 
The next triennial valuation exercise will be completed during 2015, based 
on a valuation as of 30 September 2014. Early indications are that the 
deficit value at that date is in line with that anticipated by the current 
funding agreement. Under that agreement the Company has agreed to 
make the following contributions in pounds sterling in order to bring the 
funding deficit to zero:

US plans
In the US, the Group reports 2 post retirement plans under IAS 19: a 
defined benefit pension plan with a deficit value at the end of 2014 of 
$23.7 million (2013: $15.6 million); and a post retirement medical plan with  
a liability value of $7 .4 million (2013: $7 .5 million). The US pension plan is 
smaller than the UK plan and is closed to future accruals. In 2014 the overall 
deficit value increased by $8.0 million (2013: decreased by $28.2 million) 
due to the anticipated financial cost of the liabilities of $5.6 million (2013: 
$5.1 million) and actuarial increases of $16.9 million (2013: decrease of  
$11.5 million). Other liability increases consisted mostly of a revision to 
mortality assumptions costing approximately $5.8 million and a decline  
in real corporate bond yields of 55 basis points (2013: increase of 80 basis 
points). These increases in the liability were offset by positive asset returns 
of 7 per cent (2013: 22 per cent) and employer contributions of $7 .8 million 
(2013: $2.9 million).
Other plans
In the Netherlands, the Group operated an insured defined benefits  
pension plan as is customary in that country. On 1 January 2015 the Group 
contracted with an industry wide pension fund in the Netherlands to provide 
pension benefits for its employees as they relate to future accruals. This 
fund has a number of other participant companies and risks are shared 
across all of the participants. As such the fund is unable to provide the 
information required in the future to allow the Group to account for the plan 
benefits as a defined benefit scheme under IAS 19. Consequently, going 
forward the Group will account for these benefits as though the plan was  
a defined contribution scheme, in accordance with IAS 19, recording future 
contributions by the Group as an operating expense. Under this method  
of accounting the Group will no longer record any asset or liability relative  
to this plan and hence has recorded an income statement credit in 2014  
of $4.1 million in order to reverse the liability that would have been shown  
at 31 December 2014 had this change in accounting not been made. This 
credit has been recorded as an exceptional item in 2014 and is referred  
to in the earlier section of this report that covers this topic. A liability of 
$3.7 million was recorded in the Group balance sheet as of 31 December 
2013 in relation to these pension benefits.
Other liabilities at 31 December 2014 amounted to $6.3 million 
(2013: $6.4 million) and relate to pension arrangements for a relatively small 
number of employees in Germany and certain legacy benefits in the UK.
Key performance indicators
The Group maintains a standard set of key performance 
indicators (“KPIs”) against which each business reports  
on a monthly basis. The principal financial KPIs are listed 
below. The Group’s main non-financial KPIs relate to our 
health, safety and environmental performance. These  
KPIs are recordable incidents, lost time accidents and 
environmental incidents which are described more  
fully in the Corporate responsibility report. 
Our short term incentives include targets against the 
annual operating plan for profit before tax, operating profit 
and average trade working capital to sales ratio.
Our long term incentives include targets against EPS and 
total shareholder return which are a subset of the Group’s 
financial KPIs.
1. Operating profit/operating margin
Operating profit is the profit derived from the normal operations of 
the business. Operating margin is the ratio of operating profit, before 
exceptional items, to sales. The Group achieved an operating profit* 
of $150. 1 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: 
$146.6 million before exceptional items). The Group’s operating 
margin* was 19 per cent compared to 19 per cent in 2013.
2. Average trade working capital to sales ratio
The trade working capital to sales ratio is defined as the 12 month 
average trade working capital divided by sales, expressed as  
a percentage. Trade working capital comprises inventories,  
trade receivables and trade payables. It specifically excludes 
prepayments, capital or interest related receivables or payables, 
changes due to currency movements and items classified as other 
receivables and other payables. The Group’s 12 month average 
trade working capital to sales ratio at 31 December 2014 was 
21 per cent (2013: 20 per cent).
3. Return on operating capital employed
The return on operating capital employed (“ROCE”) is defined  
as operating profit before exceptional items divided by operating 
capital employed, expressed as a percentage. Operating capital 
employed comprises fixed assets (excluding goodwill), working 
capital and operating provisions. Operating provisions include self 
insurance and environmental provisions but exclude retirement 
benefit obligations. The Group’s ROCE was 42 per cent for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: 43 per cent).
ROCE for the Group including goodwill was 22 per cent in 2014 
(2013: 22 per cent).
4. Contribution margin
The Group’s contribution margin, which is defined as sales  
less all variable costs, divided by sales and expressed as  
a percentage, in 2014 was 38 per cent (2013: 37 per cent). 
5.  Operating cash flow
The operating cash flow is defined as the net cash flow from operating 
activities less net capital expenditure but excluding income taxes paid 
or received, interest paid or received, pension contributions net of 
current service cost and exceptional items. In 2014 the operating cash 
flow was $144.4 million (2013: $143.9 million).

The risk management framework at Elementis is well defined internally with an established programme  
of activities to monitor and manage the Group’s principal risks.
Below is a summary of risk management activities carried out throughout the year.
Structure Implementation
The Board is responsible 
for overseeing the creation 
of value for shareholders, 
while ensuring that the 
Group’s processes are  
in compliance with 
applicable laws and 
regulations, and of a high 
standard as regards 
business conduct, ethics 
and its health, safety and 
environmental 
performance.
The Board defines 
strategic direction in 
conjunction with the 
management team and 
monitors the performance 
of the businesses in  
all material aspects  
of their operation.
The Board sets the risk 
culture and levels of 
appetite and tolerance  
for risk.
U U Regular review of 
principal risks at Board 
meetings through CEO, 
Finance Director and 
business reports and 
presentations.
U U Receipt and review  
of incident notification 
reports as soon as 
these are published 
following notifiable 
group wide HSE 
incidents/near misses.
U U Review and approval  
of annual Group 
insurance programme.
U U Formal risk review 
process at least 
annually.
U U Review and approval 
of annual and 3 year 
business plans, as well 
as review of updated 
forecasts during  
the year.
U U Review accuracy, 
consistency and 
integrity of financial 
reports.
U U Oversee work of the 
internal auditors and

financial information 
including related tax, 
legal and compliance 
matters.
U U Regular review of 
business performance 
and material risks  
and the Group’s  
ability to deliver its  
operating plans.
U U More in-depth review 
of risk at least twice  
a year:
 – Review of the 
Group’s business 
continuity plans with 
simulation/scenario 
testing and training  
at corporate and  
site level.
 – Review and 
comprehensive risk 
assessment of the 
Group’s risk register.
U U Review and 
assessment  
of new business  
and investment 
opportunities.
U U Recommend and 
implement changes/
updates to corporate 
policy and standards  
as necessary.
U U Advise on setting  
HSE objectives and 
targets, initiate training 
programmes and assist 
with the communication 
of risk and safety 
awareness.
U U Manage and monitor 
process and hazard 
management 
programmes, property 
survey programme,  
as well as corporate 
compliance programme.
Management is responsible 
for all business activities  
and delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives and 
annual operating plans and 
ultimately shareholder value. 
This requires identifying 
both opportunity and risk 
and leveraging these to the 
Group’s advantage.
The management of risk  
is integrated into the general 
management function 
which means all layers  
of management have  
a responsibility for 
identifying, assessing and 
communicating risk upwards 
in the chain of management.
To support this approach, 
the Group has risk 
management policies, 
procedures and controls  
in place. In addition, a 
programme of compliance 
audits and property surveys 
exists, as well as the Internal 
Audit programme.
The Audit Committee 
supports the work of the 
Board and is responsible 
for ensuring the integrity  
of financial information  
and processes, as well  
as the protection of  
Group assets.
Its focus is on financial, 
operational and 
compliance risks and 
controls (see also Audit 
Committee report on 
pages 32 to 34).
Our business takes HSE 
very seriously and our 
Manufacturing Council, 
chaired by our Global 
Director of HSE & Process 
Safety, holds monthly 
meetings to review this key 
aspect of our business.
This network of  
HSE professionals is 
responsible for sharing 
knowledge and best 
practice, reviewing  
policies and procedures, 
and advising on all 
process, personal and  
behavioural safety matters,  
including process hazard  
reviews and behavioural  
safety training.

Risk management report
Finance report 
continued The risk management framework at Elementis and examples of our 
approach to risk management are set out opposite. Our risk management 
process follows an Enterprise Risk Management model comprising the 
following steps:
1.  Risk identification and communication.
2.  Risk evaluation and prioritisation.
3.  Risk management analysis and discussion (consideration of all  
options for prevention/mitigation/ treatment/transfer).
4.  Risk strategy resourcing and implementation.
5.  Monitoring, review and updating of the risk management process.
The management of risk is a responsibility that is incorporated into the 
general management function and shared between the different levels  
of management, at the site, business and corporate level. Certain risks  
or risk areas are managed by more specialised teams or functions. Legal 
and compliance risks, for example, are managed at a corporate level by  
the General Counsel. Finance and treasury risks tend also to be managed 
at corporate level. Supply chain and commercial risks are usually managed 
at business team level unless escalation is necessary. Operational and HSE 
risk management is a shared responsibility at both site and corporate level. 
Risk communication, for example, in connection with our products is 
managed by our Global Product Stewardship and Quality teams. Our  
flat management structure and risk culture mean that risk issues are 
communicated to the business leadership and management teams 
promptly, with defined procedures for ensuring that the Board is 
appropriately notified of important risk issues and developments.
As well as the day to day responsibilities for risk management, there are 
formal risk review programmes operated throughout the year. The Specialties 
and Chromium business leadership teams meet separately at least twice a 
year and during one of their meetings a formal risk review exercise is carried 
out. This assessment looks at the major risks facing the business (strategic, 
financial, operational, hazard and compliance), their likelihood of occurrence, 
severity of impact and mitigation controls (to reduce likelihood as well as 
financial impact). The output from these reviews is consolidated into a Group 
risk register comprising business risks (which include supply chain and 
operations/HSE risk assessments) and risks from corporate functions (legal, 
finance, IT, HR and governance). The management team then carries out  
an annual risk review in one of its two formal risk review meetings each year, 
focused on the Group risk register and risk maps. Benchmarking and other 
best practice materials are used to support its review process. The output of 
management’s annual review is submitted to the Board which carries out its 
risk oversight review in December and the output is the table of principal risks 
disclosed on pages 18 and 19.
Strategic risks are usually discussed at management and Board level and 
programmes of meetings and agenda scheduling mean any developments 
concerning principal risks can be flagged and discussed as and when the 
need arises, without having to wait for the next formal review meeting. In 
addition to risk discussions at regular Board meetings and its formal risk 
review in December, the Board schedules discussion of specific topics at 
intervals throughout the year so that more focus can be given to certain 
aspects of the business.
Financial and treasury risks are well managed throughout the Group,  
with clear delegated authorities supported by policies and procedures.  
The internal audit function plays an important role in ensuring the 
effectiveness of financial, operational and compliance controls. However,  
in recent years, our internal audit service provider has also broadened  
the scope of its assurance services. Last year, for example, it carried out  
a cyber-phishing exercise to test the effectiveness and resilience of IT 
security controls. More information about the role of internal audit is given  
in the Audit Committee report on page 34.
One of the key areas of focus of our risk management activities is our HSE 
performance. At Elementis, safety and environmental compliance is a high 
priority and, as a chemicals manufacturer, our facilities are subject to many 
regulations and are managed to a high standard. Of our 18 operating 
facilities, 8 have achieved ISO 9001 certification, 5 have achieved ISO 
14001 certification, 3 have achieved OHSAS 18001 certification and our 
other sites are managed to similarly high standards. We also strive to go 
beyond regulatory requirements. For example, our main chromium facility  
in Castle Hayne, North Carolina, has achieved the comprehensive 
performance based criteria to be accredited in the STAR programme.  
This accomplishment is the highest recognition level under OSHA’s 
voluntary protection programme which recognises employees and 
employers who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.
The paragraphs below provide additional commentary on the table of 
principal risks. The risks disclosed have remained largely unchanged from 
previous years, with the general risk profile remaining fairly stable and no 
new material risks identified. This is despite a thorough risk review process, 
with reference to industry benchmarking. The risks inherent in our business 
and the environment in which we operate are well known to management 
and risk reviews carried out in recent years looked at our major risks going 
as far back as 10 years ago.
The principal risks comprise a broad top 25 risk grouping, analysing the risk 
profile for each (whether it is increasing, decreasing or stable, by reference 
to probability and severity of impact pre and post mitigation controls). The 
composition of this broad grouping is fairly stable. However, below this top 
25, new risks have been identified last year and there have also been some 
changes in risk evaluations and profile, reflecting new or improvements to 
mitigation controls implemented.
Of the risks shown in the table of principal risks below, the risk profile  
for 3 risks increased in 2014 over the previous year: regulation, IT incident  
and tax scrutiny. The requirements of EU REACh regulations and the 
proliferation of the UN Globally Harmonised System hazard communications 
standard are described in the Corporate responsibility report on page 25. 
The increasing prominence of cyber risks around the globe led to the  
higher risk score. This is discussed below. The inclusion of tax risk and  
the increasing risk trend indicated reflect the current political climate both  
in the UK and internationally as regulators look to increase the scrutiny of 
corporate tax affairs. It is the policy of Elementis to comply fully with all 
applicable tax laws. This is discussed below.
The risk having the highest potential impact on the Group financially  
is the global economic environment and a key factor against this is our  
broad geographic presence, mitigating the impact of economic changes  
in any one country. Customer service, innovation and delivering tailored, 
differentiated solutions remain the cornerstone of our strategy and this 
helps us to stay competitive. Another market risk worth commenting on 
briefly is the volatility of activity in the oil and gas industry. This risk needs  
to be put into a proper context. Our oilfield business, which supplies drilling 
additives to the global oil service companies participating in conventional 
offshore and onshore drilling including shale oil and gas drilling, accounted 
for about 9 per cent of the Group’s sales in 2014. One of our strategic goals 
over the medium to longer term is to increase the size of this business but 
we recognise that, notwithstanding the excellent long term trends in the 
global energy sector, the performance of our oilfield business is exposed,  
to some extent, to volatility from wider macro factors, such as geo-political 
risk or general industry destocking cycles. However, like other parts of the 
Specialty Products business, the oilfield business enjoys diversification  
as we supply products to multiple segments that operate under different 
economic drivers: cold climate, deep water, high temperature/high pressure 
drilling and shale oil and gas drilling.
Supply chain risk continues to receive appropriate attention as our ability  
to supply customers can be affected by disruptions due to economic 
uncertainties or caused by severe weather patterns. Our businesses have 
worked hard over recent years to improve the resilience of our supply 
chains in relation to the availability of key raw materials, including working  
on business resilience and continuity with our supply chain partners and 
taking action to broaden our supplier base.

We are aware of the significance of cyber or IT risks and, at Elementis,  
our IT strategy is focused on protecting our people, assets and enterprise. 
Our security controls include: 
• Policies and procedures. 
• Staff awareness and training.
• Risk management and compliance.
• System management and protection. 
• Information management and protection. 
• Process management. 
• Continuous assessments and monitoring.
As well as IT penetration tests, we have carried out cyber-phishing 
exercises both to improve our monitoring techniques and to raise 
awareness among our employees. 
Our approach to taxation is to ensure that profits earned in the countries  
in which economic activities are undertaken are properly subject to tax in 
accordance with the tax legislation that applies in each jurisdiction. We aim 
to fully comply with the requirements of each of the relevant tax authorities 
and to ensure that we deal with these authorities in an open and 
transparent manner.

Elementis recognises that 
corporate responsibility (“CR”)  
is a fundamental part of the 
Company’s business activities, 
which is why the Chief Executive  
is responsible at Board level  
for all CR matters.

Since September 2009 the Company has been a member of the 
FTSE4Good index, a leading global responsible investment index, which 
demonstrates the Company’s commitment to CR and that its activities 
and aspirations are aligned with the principles of the UN Global Compact 
on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Above is an 
illustration of the Company’s CR framework. 
During 2014, Elementis achieved a silver rating from EcoVadis which is  
a leading global sustainability accreditation programme for supply chain 
partners. The rating puts Elementis in the upper quartile of 150 participants 
in the benchmark. Assessments in the programme ranged from HSE  
to employment and human rights, as well as anti-bribery and corruption 
policies and wider business, supply chain and procurement practices.
In addition, Elementis received 1 of only 4 inaugural UK awards made  
by the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”). The CDP works with some  
of the largest corporations in the world to help them ensure that an effective 
carbon emissions/reductions strategy is made integral to their businesses. 
The benchmarking last year was split into 10 sectors and Elementis was 
categorised in the materials sector with 23 other companies including  
mining and chemicals companies. Our responses, which were analysed  
by First Carbon Solutions as part of the CDP verification process,  
resulted in a disclosure score of 89 with a performance band of B,  
placing us overall in 7th position out of 24 companies. 
Elementis continues to participate in the Repasack programme which  
takes back and recycles used paper bags from trade and industry. Our 
participation in 2013 was certified last year to have saved approximately 
13,000 kg of resources. In addition, over 1,000 kg of greenhouse gas 
emissions were avoided.
Business conduct and ethics
People
It is our people who remain our most valuable asset and are a key 
differentiator between Elementis and its competitors. The long term success 
of the Group depends on the passion, attitude, commitment and work  
ethic of all our employees around the world. 
Elementis sets high expectations for all its global employees and these are 
set out in the Group’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code  
of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is supplemented by policies, processes 
and guidelines covering a wide range of compliance matters, such as 
anti-bribery and corruption, conflicts of interest, fair business practices and 
compliance with local laws and regulations. Comprehensive whistleblowing 
procedures are supported by an anti-retaliation policy. All employees are 
required to undertake training on the Code of Conduct and certify that they 
understand and agree to be bound by its provisions. The Board and 
management team consider the Code of Conduct to be critical to the 
Group’s continuing success and in how it meets its corporate responsibilities. 
Our training programme on the Code of Conduct is translated into six 
languages and supported with interactive online training to help employees 
stay up to date with their responsibilities under the Code of Conduct.
Policies are updated as necessary and new ones implemented to take 
account of the changing business environment with associated training 
provided. In 2014, a number of policies were updated including the Global 
anti-corruption policy and a new Group computer usage standard 
incorporating a new social media policy and revised information security 
policy. Online training on the information security policy was delivered to  
over 1,300 members of staff. 
20 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Corporate responsibility report Diversity
Elementis continues to be fully committed to equality of opportunity.  
Our policy of non-discrimination applies throughout the Group and to  
all aspects of our employment practices, except as it relates to a person’s  
ability or potential in relation to the needs of a job. A summary of our 
employment policies appears on page 55 of the Directors’ report. Our  
total workforce (including contractors and temporary workers) numbers in 
excess of 1,300 in three regions (41 per cent in the Americas, 25 per cent in 
Europe and 34 per cent in Asia). In terms of gender diversity, out of our total 
workforce (excluding contractors and temporary workers) as at the year end, 
993 were male (76 per cent) and 314 were female (24 per cent). Of these 
female employees, 45 (14 per cent) held managerial positions and 39  
(12 per cent) held an executive management position (within the four tiers 
below Board level). At Board level 6 directors were male and 1 was female 
and at senior manager level (as defined under the prescribed regulations)  
19 were male. The Group does not consider targets or quotas to be 
appropriate for increasing the percentage of women in management 
positions, although it recognises the benefit of having women represented  
in all layers of management. Staff turnover across the Group for 2014 was  
7 .0 per cent (2013: 6.4 per cent – restated).
 
Human rights
Elementis supports the principles of the UN Global Compact which includes 
those on fundamental human rights. These are applied in our employment 
policies as well as to our business practices in relation to customers and 
suppliers, such as the right to privacy, safety and to be treated fairly, with 
dignity and respect. Our employment and business practices are supported 
by Group policies, including our anti-harassment policy and grievance 
procedures, and our Code of Conduct. Elementis prohibits the use of  
child and forced labour and is committed to the principles of freedom of 
association, equality of treatment and non-discrimination. Over 40 per cent 
of our employees are union members and over a fifth are subject to collective 
bargaining agreements. 
Customers, suppliers, supply chain, biodiversity and quality
Each of our businesses is customer centric – solving immediate problems 
today and working collaboratively to anticipate future needs. This intense 
customer focus keeps our technical service organisation best in class  
and feeds our innovative product development process with valuable and 
differentiated programmes. We track our performance with metrics, for 
example, the percentage of sales from new products which improved by  
32 per cent from 2013 to 2014. We continue to develop and nurture close 
customer relationships through our key account business process and 
participation in trade shows and industry forums, as well as conducting 
numerous group workshops, training seminars and hosting collaborative 
laboratory sessions to work with customers on a one on one basis.
We have continued to address questions from our customers on social 
responsibility and environmental awareness programmes and have 
successfully completed a number of surveys and informal audits. As well as 
our participation in the EcoVadis programme, we became a member of the 
Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and our facility in Livingston, 
Scotland, achieved the rigorous standards required to be certified to handle 
palm oil derivatives via an audited mass balance system, whereby a specific 
volume of sustainable palm oil derivatives enters the supply chain and is 
traced throughout. 
Our membership of RSPO means Elementis is committed to protecting and 
conserving the rich biodiversity found in tropical palm forests by using palm 
oil sourced from sustainable palm plantations that are responsible and 
responsive to the issues of soil degradation, biodiversity, local peoples  
and land rights.
The Livingston facility, which is the primary manufacturing site for our 
Personal care business also achieved Good Manufacturing Practice (2012) 
certification last year from the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients 
(EFfCI). In achieving the EFfCI certification Elementis is affirming our 
commitment to quality, safety and innovation for the personal care industry.
Training worldwide for all procurement members continues to ensure 
compliance and adherence to our Purchasing Code of Practice and 
anti-corruption policy. Suppliers are likewise expected to affirm their 
conformity to international labour laws, social and environmental responsible 
legislation and best practices. Conflict minerals continue to be absent  
from our supply chain. 
Use of natural products within our supply chain increased from $17 .1 million 
in 2013 to $17 .7 million last year representing a rise of 4 per cent on top  
of the 8 per cent increase achieved in 2013. 
21 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Health, safety and environment
The health and safety of our employees, contractors and visitors, as well  
as the preservation of the environment, remains a key area of focus for the 
Board and management. Biodiversity is protected wherever possible by 
reducing the potential for significant damage to sensitive species, habitats 
and ecosystems. The Group also recognises a shared responsibility globally 
for conserving natural resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Group’s health, safety, and environmental (“HSE”) management 
programmes conform to international standards and include documented 
policy and procedures, internal and external auditing, risk assessments, 
management systems for employee and contractor training, incident 
investigation and response, management of change, emergency planning 
and risk mitigation. The effectiveness of these programmes, as well as  
overall performance, is continually evaluated through management reviews 
to ensure they are current with regulatory requirements and industry  
best practices. 
Health and safety performance
The Group’s priority is to strive to eliminate accidents and injuries within  
the workplace. We seek to achieve this by maintaining our strong focus  
on and commitment to safety design, a safe environment, setting and 
communicating safety standards, training, coaching safe behaviours  
and developing a safety culture.
The Group’s priority is to strive to eliminate accidents and injuries within  
the workplace. We seek to achieve this by maintaining our strong focus  
on and commitment to safety design, a safe environment, setting and 
communicating safety standards, training, coaching safe behaviours  
and developing a safety culture.
One of our additive reactors was impacted by an operating incident which 
resulted in some isolated equipment damage. The engineering and safety 
systems operated according to plan and there were no injuries. A number  
of enhanced safety initiatives were implemented following the incident and 
the HSE leadership team has used the experience as a learning opportunity 
to further improve our process safety management controls. 
The Group uses recordable incidents as its principal measure of safety 
performance. Recordable incidents (as defined by the US Occupational 
Safety & Health Administration) are basically work related injuries and 
illnesses that require medical treatment beyond first aid, work restrictions  
to normal duties or time away from work. To monitor performance and 
trends among more serious injuries and illnesses, the Group also records 
lost time accidents (“LTAs”) that require greater than 3 days away from work 
not including the day of incident. The number of recordable incidents across 
the Group in 2014 was 12 (2013: 12). Of the 12 recordable incidents only  
2 required days away from work greater than 3 days (2012: 3). Of particular 
note is our hectorite mine in Southern California which now has an 
outstanding record of 23 years without a LTA and 10 years without a 
recordable incident. Our facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, has also achieved 
the distinction of reaching 11 years without a recordable incident.
As well as the total number of recordable and LTAs, the Group uses  
the overall recordable incident rate as a performance indicator. The total 
recordable incident rate in 2014 was 0.92 per 200,000 hours worked (2013: 
0.95). Within the chemical industry, this sustained performance of Elementis 
is comparable to companies that are generally viewed as having ‘industry 
best’ safety performance (based on data for the American Chemistry 
Council — Responsible Care® members, who achieved 0.73 in 2013), and is 
significantly better than the general chemical industry in the US (2.00 in 2013 
based on the latest data available from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics).

Recordable incident rate
Elementis applies the same high safety standards to on-site contractors 
who are required to comply with the same safety practices and procedures 
expected of our employees. In 2014, contractors suffered only 1 recordable 
injury (2013: 5) across all manufacturing locations which equated to an 
incident rate of 0.49 per 200,000 hours worked (2013: 2.35).
Health and safety initiatives
During 2014, our health and safety leadership team has continued to  
focus on reducing the risks associated with handling and manufacturing 
hazardous chemicals by promoting the use of industry recognised process 
safety programmes. These include process hazard analysis (“PHA”) and 
mechanical integrity inspections and are conducted as a predictive and 
preventative exercise to reduce the likelihood of incidents. A formal 
procedure for incident reporting and investigation (including near miss 
reporting) exists and is a key management tool used for recognising unsafe 
conditions and behaviours, and for communicating globally any investigative 
findings and corrective actions. In addition, site leadership communicates 
current safety concerns and reinforces commitment to safety by a variety  
of means. A good example is through safety stand-downs – meetings 
where employees and management take time during the workday to 
address pertinent safety issues. In these stand-downs, anyone can raise  
a safety concern. The issues are discussed and site management and 
employees then work collaboratively to develop appropriate action plans.

Corporate responsibility report
continued Environmental performance
Minimising the impact of our operations on the environment, complying 
with all applicable laws and contributing to a more sustainable future 
remain the focus of our efforts. 
Elementis records and categorises environmental incidents into tiers 
based on the severity or actions taken by regulatory authorities. Tier 3 
incidents are those that have an impact on the environment and require 
reporting to an external authority and where enforcement action is likely. 
Tier 2 incidents have a minor impact and require notification but are likely 
to result in minimal or no action by the authorities. Tier 1 incidents require 
no external reporting and are recorded internally and investigated so that 
continual improvements can be made to reduce the likelihood of future 
Tier 2 and Tier 3 incidents. 
In 2014, Elementis had 1 Tier 3 and 0 Tier 2 incidents (2013: 0 Tier 3  
and Tier 2). The reason for classifying the 2014 incident as Tier 3 was due 
to the omission of the waste water treatment tanks from the environmental 
operating permit at our site in Charleston, West Virginia. The site was 
issued a consent order by the West Virginia Department of Environmental 
Protection requiring the addition of the tanks to the permit.
Environmental impact
Elementis monitors key environmental statistics for each manufacturing 
facility. Water and energy consumption, air emissions, effluent discharges 
and solid waste disposal will all vary according to production output – 
which is a function of demand, as well as changes in fuel and production 
processes. However, they are also affected by changes in product mix 
and plant efficiencies related to operational requirements, and special 
events (planned and unplanned). 
As is standard practice in the chemical industry, emission values may be 
calculated from energy use or based on representative sampling, as well 
as continuous monitoring.
Energy consumption
Depending on the location and requirements of the manufacturing sites, 
principal offices and laboratories, Elementis consumes energy from several 
sources (electricity, steam, natural gas, LPG, coal and oil). For comparison 
purposes, energy consumption is converted into consistent energy units, 
Gigajoules (“GJ”). Elementis seeks wherever practicable to improve its 
energy efficiency in the plant and equipment used as illustrated in the 
examples of energy saving initiatives described below. Energy consumption 
is shown below.

Examples of 2014 energy initiatives that have improved  
energy efficiency
Newberry Springs, California – Replacement of a boiler with a high 
efficiency unit saving 35 per cent of gas used for heating water.
East Windsor, New Jersey – Implementation of a building optimisation 
system in the technical centre and management headquarters. Energy 
usage is monitored throughout the building and linked to an energy 
management system, which will reduce energy costs through a rapid 
response to demand programme.
Livingston, Scotland – Upgrade of existing insulation within the 
manufacturing process reducing thermal losses, as well as replacing two 
air compressors with new units that are approximately 10 per cent more 
energy efficient.
Hsinchu, Taiwan – Replacement of a boiler with a higher efficiency unit.
Songjiang, China – Installation of internal cooling coils in two reactors  
to improve process efficiency by reducing cooling time.
Delden, Netherlands – Continuation of a 4 year energy efficiency initiative. 
Current improvements made include to process ventilation and through 
an operational excellence initiative. In 2015, the nitrogen compressor unit 
will be replaced and a planned investment in the boiler plant room in the 
next 2 years will bring substantial energy savings. 
Other global initiatives include replacing old lights with lower energy, 
longer life LED (light emitting diode) lights, installing variable speed drives 
on large electric motors, and improved operating practices to minimise 
the time equipment is idle. 
23 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Greenhouse gas emissions
Elementis reports greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for its global operations as Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the requirements of The Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
The principal GHG due to operations at Elementis locations is carbon dioxide. GHG emissions have been converted into carbon dioxide equivalent 
(“CO
2
e”) using official data provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”). GHG emissions are reported for all 
18 manufacturing sites, the principal offices and laboratories, as well as a site undergoing closure procedures in Eaglescliffe, UK. A number of much 
smaller sales offices have been excluded because the level of CO
2
e emissions was deemed not to make a material contribution to the total. 
Elementis is providing 2 intensity ratios: tonnes CO
2
e per tonne of production and tonnes CO
2
e per kWh of energy consumed. Over a period of years  
both of these indicators should give a reliable indication of energy efficiency improvements including cleaner fuels consumed. The energy reduction 
programmes at the manufacturing sites (see above) should lead to a reduction in GHG emissions.
 
These ratios are subject to variations due to changes in the mix of products manufactured, volumes and energy efficiency improvements. GHG emissions 
are shown below.

emissions decreased by 6,891 tonnes CO
2
e. The total for Scope 1 
emissions in 2014 was effectively unchanged, however, the year on year 
production output increased, giving a Scope 1 intensity ratio of 0.53 
tonnes CO
2
e per tonne of production (2013: 0.55 t/t). The total Scope 2 
emissions reduced by 8 per cent largely as a result of our Livingston 
facility changing its purchasing of electricity such that 100 per cent was 
from renewable sources (mostly hydro and wind energy). Elementis has 
incorporated this saving of over 4,000 tonnes CO
2
e in the Scope 2 
emissions shown above.
The Group continues to use cleaner energy sources such as natural gas 
which represented almost 95 per cent of energy required for combustion 
(with coal being just under 5 per cent). A significant change planned for 
2015 is in China where our organoclay sites at Changxing and Anji will 
switch from using coal to biomass comprising renewable organic 
materials, such as bamboo and wood powder, and combustible waste  
as an energy source.
Other emissions to air
Emissions of the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen and volatile organic 
compounds (“VOCs”) arising from the Group’s operations are controlled  
to comply with regulatory permits. As the volumes are not considered  
to be significant, they are not reported separately here. Any emission  
to air above regulatory permitted levels would be reported as an 
environmental incident.
Discharges to water
The Group’s production activity generates process effluent that is 
routinely tested to ensure that the quality meets strict permit limits prior  
to discharge. Typical analysis includes chemical and biological oxygen 
demand and total suspended solids. The volumes of these discharges are 
not considered to be significant and are not reported here. However, any 
discharge to water above regulatory permitted levels would be reported 
as an environmental incident.
Water consumption
Water is a valuable resource and the Company recognises the global 
need to conserve it. Water consumption is minimised where possible  
by treatment and recycling. 
Water consumption is related to production output, product mix, plant 
utilisation and cleaning activities. The net result in 2014 was a 5 per cent 
reduction (see below).

Solid and liquid waste
As part of our commitment to sustainable development, Elementis seeks 
to reduce the quantity of all types of waste. The first concern is to reduce 
the amount of waste that is classed as hazardous. Beyond that non-
hazardous waste is minimised and recycled. Non-hazardous waste is 
predominantly the inert residue from the chromate kiln operations, which 
is deposited in permitted impoundments and licenced landfill sites 
adjacent to the manufacturing facilities.
Hazardous waste was reduced in 2014 (see table opposite). A particular 
reason for the lower figure in 2014 was that improved maintenance 
processes in Chromium resulted in a reduction in kiln refractory 
replacements in the year.

The gangue clay from the hectorite mine (the unwanted material that is 
associated with the hectorite clay) provides a good example of recycling 
and reducing the impact on land. Residual clay is recovered from the 
discharge water and blended back into the process with the hectorite  
ore feedstock. Tailings with minor clay content are sold for use as liner for 
recreation ponds, fish rearing lakes and some agricultural applications. 
Selling overburden and optimising stockpile height has the additional benefit 
of reducing the overall area impacted at the mine. The Livingston site has 
taken some of this waste hectorite clay and supplied it for agricultural use 
(to adjust soil pH) and waste bentonite clay as a landfill liner. The 
2 organoclay sites in China are planning to recycle clay from residue.
R&D and sustainability
Our R&D efforts continue to support and contribute to a more sustainable 
future with the global R&D team driving its research towards:
• Reduction in the use of materials that contribute to greenhouse gases.
• Development of new biodegradable products for use in aqueous 
environments.
• Expanded use of bio-based materials in our products.
• Facilitating the migration of all coatings to aqueous solutions from 
solvent based systems.
The development and introduction of new polymers for rheological 
additives used in decorative coatings have allowed for use of these 
additives at much lower levels than current market standards. These  
high efficiency products effectively contribute to the reduced dependence 
in the coatings industry on petroleum derivatives. 
Further reduction in dependence on petroleum derivatives was achieved 
through the implementation of organic solvent recycling in new processes. 
New products that incorporate high levels of bio-based ingredients were 
also introduced in our Personal care and Surfactants product lines.
Product stewardship
Ensuring our products are safe for intended use, transport and to people 
and the environment throughout the product’s entire life cycle remains a 
priority for Elementis, as well as contributing to a more sustainable future. 
The Group’s activities in 2014 continued to be centred on complying with 
the global REACh regulatory requirements for our products during 2014, 
as well as the United Nations GHS (Globally Harmonised System) hazard 
communications standard which continues to be implemented around  
the world. The Group continued to invest resources in its regulatory 
compliance software system, the Wercs, which helps to automate 
compliance and prepare the business for further implementation of  
GHS as it and other new REACh regulations proliferate across the globe.
EU REACh regulations will require a major registration effort up to 2018 
with significantly more substances being registered than were seen in the 
combined 2010 and 2013 REACh registration cycles. In 2014, the Group 
began its programme to comply with the 2018 EU REACh cycle of 
registration in order to optimise resources and control costs while 
ensuring full compliance by the June 2018 deadline.
During 2014, the Group began to provide GHS compliant safety data 
sheets and labels for US products and will continue this programme  
into 2015 to meet the 1 June 2015 OSHA deadline. In addition, a more 
robust internal product stewardship audit programme, begun in 2013, 
was fully integrated across our European businesses in 2014. This audit 
programme will be further extended to our Asia operations in 2015. 
The Group has also expanded its enhanced export control management 
system to its European business last year, to ensure compliance with  
the extensive and strict export regulations of both the US and EU.  
This programme is being extended to our Asia operations in 2015.  
Key components of this system include strong internal written policies, 
proactive external auditing of the Group’s freight forwarders and export 
brokers, monitoring of US and EU trade sanctions and careful review  
of all new customers against both US and EU ‘denied parties’ lists.
A growing component of our product stewardship programme has  
been to focus on and support other areas of our business in relation  
to sustainability initiatives. As mentioned above, we have been working  
in partnership with organisations such as EcoVadis and RSPO to assess 
the sustainability of our supply chain.
Community
Our community programme remains centred on encouraging and 
supporting employees to be active in their communities through volunteer 
work or fundraising. The Group understands the need to work with local 
communities and be a responsible neighbour.

10 11 12 Chairman’s letter
The governance arrangements at Elementis play a critical role in how  
our businesses are managed and our ability to deliver value to all our 
stakeholders. Your Board is committed to strong governance and controls 
that help our businesses to grow sustainably and operate in a responsible 
manner. At the centre of our governance structure are the Board, Board 
committees and the management team. 
Despite the changes to the Board over the past year, its role has remained 
much the same. The Board is responsible for defining strategy and the 
priorities of the Company on the one hand, while on the other management, 
led by our Chief Executive, is responsible for executing strategy and the 
attainment of set objectives and priorities, with the Board and Board 
committees providing support, guidance and exercising oversight. 
Oversight means: (i) monitoring and reviewing management and financial 
performance, (ii) ensuring resources are made available to the businesses 
and that appropriate governance and risk management systems and 
controls are implemented throughout the Group, (iii) setting high standards 
for how we conduct our business activities globally, and (iv) reporting to  
our shareholders on how the Board has preserved and generated value 
both in the year being reported on and over the longer term. 
Effective governance starts with people – setting the right expectations, 
leading by example, doing the right thing and cultivating a culture of trust 
and responsibility. The Board operates within a framework of applicable 
laws and regulations that includes the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the “Code”). The role and responsibilities of Board committees are set  
out in defined terms of reference and the management team obtains its 
authority from service and employment contracts, role and responsibility 
specifications, delegated authorities from the Board (through the Board’s 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision as well as specific direction 
from the Board). The expectations and values set by the Board and 
management team are supported by our Group Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics which sets out in writing our values and the standards we expect 
of our employees and third party contractors. This document, together  
with other Group policies, govern how we conduct our business and the 
standards and responsibilities expected of all our employees. Further  
details on this can be found on our website at: www.elementisplc.com.
I am confident that our governance arrangements at Elementis will continue 
to evolve, due both to the Board’s recent refreshment programme and the 
revised Code which applies from this year, and consequently your Board 
and the management team will be in a good position to create and deliver 
further value, as we build on our strong foundation for sustainable growth 
and the long term success of the Company.
Statement of compliance
The Board is of the view that it has applied fully throughout 2014 all of the 
provisions of the Code (2012 version) with the exception of Code Provision 
C3.7 and otherwise intends to comply with the provisions of the new  
Code (2014 version) during 2015. Code Provision C3.7 requires FTSE 350 
companies to put the external audit contract out to tender at least every 
10 years. As our external auditors, KPMG, were first appointed in June 
2004 a tender process should have been initiated last year. However, owing 
to the Board and therefore the Audit Committee refreshment programme 
and in line with the Financial Reporting Council’s guidelines for transitional 
arrangements for audit tenders to coincide with the audit engagement 
partner’s 5 year rotation, the directors decided to defer a tender but  
agreed to keep this position under review. This is discussed further  
in the Audit Committee report on page 33.
The sections that follow describe how the Board has applied the principles 
and provisions of the Code.

 Chairman of Committee
Board independence
The Board considers all the non-executive directors to be independent  
in character and judgement throughout 2014 and is satisfied that each 
director exercises independent judgement. The directors are required  
at all times to avoid conflicts of interest, act for a proper purpose and in 
the best interests of the Company, consistent with their statutory duties.  
No individual or group dominates decision making. 
Board operation
The Board has a formal programme of activities that are undertaken  
at scheduled meetings throughout the year and this is supplemented  
by ad hoc meetings, conference calls or other Board events, as  
and when appropriate. 8 formal meetings were held in 2014 and the 
attendance records of the directors are shown in the table above. The 
Board is supported in its activities by Board committees that have been 
delegated specific responsibilities as set out in their terms of reference 
and a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board allows certain 
decisions to be delegated to the executive directors. The schedule of 
matters reserved to the Board includes: approval of strategic and annual 
operating plans; approval of financial statements, acquisitions and 
disposals; risk compliance and management programmes, as well  
as insurance arrangements; major non-recurring projects and major 
capital expenditures; and major legal settlements and litigation.  
The Board reviews the business, financial and operational (“HSE”) 
performance of the Group at each of its formal meetings, including 
major business initiatives, threats and opportunities, as well as progress 
on product innovation and new customers. More information about  
the Board’s oversight role in risk management and concerning internal 
controls can be found in the Risk management and Audit Committee 
reports, respectively, on pages 16 and 32. 
At least one of its meetings each year is held in the technical centre and 
management headquarters near Princeton, New Jersey, US, where both 
business leadership teams as well as the management team are based, 
which allows non-executive Board members to meet managerial staff at 
levels below the Board. In addition, a programme of site visits is planned 
to enable the Board to see different operating locations around the globe.
To assist the Board in carrying out its duties, information of an 
appropriate quality is issued in a timely manner ahead of Board and 
committee meetings. If there are any unresolved matters concerning 
Board decisions, of which there were none in 2014, these would be 
recorded in the minutes of meetings. 
Compliance with the Code
Board composition
As identified on page 26, the Board comprises 2 executive directors  
(Chief Executive and Finance Director) and 5 non-executive directors 
(including the Chairman and Senior Independent Director). The Chairman 
is responsible for leadership of the Board, while the Chief Executive is 
responsible for running the Group’s businesses. The roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive are separate, clearly defined and well understood  
by the Board, such that no individual has unfettered powers of decision. 
The Chairman is supported by the Senior Independent Director who is 
available to shareholders if the normal channels for raising any concern 
prove to be ineffective or inappropriate. 
The Chairman’s role is to lead and manage the Board and to set the style 
and the tone in which the Board operates. This includes ensuring that 
there is a forum for constructive discussion and challenge, for an open, 
frank and informed exchange of views, as well as creating a framework 
and the conditions to enable the Board as a whole, and its individual 
directors, to contribute effectively in the performance of their role. Such  
a framework and conditions include access to information, support and 
development opportunities, understanding the views of shareholders,  
and maintaining constructive relationships between executive and 
non-executive members of the Board.
Information about the executive directors’ service contracts and the 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment with the Company 
(including remuneration and fee levels) is set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report. All non-executive directors are appointed for  
3 year terms that can be renewed by mutual agreement, subject  
to annual re-election by shareholders, satisfactory performance  
and meeting independence requirements. 
Board diversity
It is the Board’s policy that appointments should be made on the basis  
of qualification and merit. However, the Board considers that diversity, 
including gender diversity, is an important factor in Board effectiveness 
and supports the Code’s principles and provisions on gender diversity.  
It is the Board’s policy that in any recruitment process the retained  
adviser is committed to ensuring that female candidates are included  
in any long list presented for consideration and this was the case in 
respect of all 3 Board appointments made last year. In relation to the 
recommendations of the Davies Review into ‘Women on Boards’, the 
Board has not set a minimum target for the percentage of the Board  
to be female.
The Board has completed its refreshment programme and considers  
that its composition contains the appropriate balance of qualifications, 
skills, experience and personal attributes necessary to take the  
Company through its next stage of development. Gender diversity  
below Board level is discussed in the Corporate responsibility report. 
Information about the Board’s recruitment processes is described  
in the Nomination Committee report on page 31.
29 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information A programme exists to ensure new directors receive appropriate induction 
tailored to their needs. For the 3 new directors, the induction programme 
included: meeting the management team, other senior executives and 
business leaders; meeting the internal and external auditors; meeting the 
Company’s joint corporate brokers; meeting major shareholders (where 
appropriate); and undertaking a programme of site visits. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and may take independent professional advice, as appropriate, 
at the expense of the Company. Directors are given the opportunity 
throughout the year to undertake training and attend seminars to keep 
their skills and knowledge up to date, and receive internal briefings on 
technical and/or other regulatory developments that they need to be 
made aware of. The Company Secretary supports the Chairman in 
ensuring that the Board and Board committees operate within the 
governance framework adopted and that communication and information 
flows within the Board and its committees and between management  
and non-executive directors are effective. 
Board evaluation
The Board carried out a questionnaire based evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its committees and individual directors (including any training 
needs) in its meeting in September. The questionnaire was designed in-house 
and feedback from the evaluation was discussed which concerned mainly 
Board composition and operation following the refreshment programme,  
the Group’s strategy and growth plans, management development and 
succession plans, risk management and the review of incentive remuneration. 
Following this evaluation, the Board considers that each director continues  
to perform effectively and demonstrates appropriate commitment to his/her 
role. Shareholders are therefore asked to support the election/re-election  
of all directors at the AGM. 
The Board did consider involving an external third party to assist in its 
evaluation process but decided this would be more appropriate in 2015 
following the reconstitution of the Board. The last external evaluation  
took place in 2012. 
Communications with shareholders
The Company maintains a programme of activities throughout the year  
to ensure there is effective communication with shareholders, analysts 
and the financial press that include stock exchange announcements, 
investor meetings, the Annual Report and updates on the corporate 
website. The AGM gives institutional and private shareholders the 
opportunity to speak with the directors and the Chairmen of the Audit  
and Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions. 
It is our practice to ensure the Board receives regular feedback from 
shareholders following meetings with management in results and other 
investor roadshows. Analysts’ forecasts and research reports about the 
Company and the wider chemicals sector, as well as presentations and 
reports from the Company’s joint corporate brokers, are provided to all 
directors on a timely basis, helping non-executive directors to develop  
a clear understanding of the views of major shareholders. The Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director are available for contact by shareholders 
at any time.
From time to time, where appropriate, the Chairman and, in connection 
with remuneration proposals, the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee will organise a programme of meetings with major 
shareholders to update them on any significant developments in business 
strategy, corporate governance matters or consult them on proposals  
for executive remuneration. The Chairman met with a number of major 
shareholders in June shortly following his appointment and will be 
undertaking another programme of shareholder visits in March, with  
the Senior Independent Director, to give major shareholders a further 
opportunity to express their views to the Board leadership.
In addition, major shareholders were consulted by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee towards the end of last year on proposed 
changes to remuneration policy. These changes are explained in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on page 35 which also describes the 
Board’s policy and approach to executive remuneration. 
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
The Company maintains liability insurance for the directors and officers  
of the Company and its subsidiaries. Since 2008, the directors of the 
Company have been in receipt of an indemnity from the Company in 
respect of any liability or loss that may arise out of, or in connection with, 
the execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities as directors  
of the Company, or of any subsidiary, to the extent permitted under the 
Companies Act 2006. Copies of these indemnities, which continue to 
remain in place, are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and will be available for inspection  
at the AGM.

Shareholders may find the biographical information provided on  
page 26 useful to help them understand how a director’s background or 
experience influences the contribution he or she makes to the operation 
and effectiveness of the Board. This will also assist shareholders in 
assessing the skills and experience of the Board, as a whole, when 
determining how to vote on certain resolutions at the AGM. The 
information should also be read in conjunction with the Notice of  
Meeting accompanying this Annual Report proposing the election/

and programme of work, resourcing, performance and effectiveness, independence and objectivity and making recommendations  
for their dismissal or changes. 
The following is a description of the work of the Committee to show how it has discharged its responsibilities in 2014:
February Reviewed in combination with KPMG’s audit report the 2013 Annual Report (and associated press release accompanying the 
preliminary results statement), management representation letter to the auditors, internal control and going concern statements, 
litigation and compliance reports (including whistleblowing) and the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the auditors; 
considered the year end tax report; approved the description of the work of Committee in the Annual Report and recommended 
to the Board the approval of the Annual Report as well as the reappointment of KPMG; met KPMG without management 
present; and considered a proposal from management on non-audit services without KPMG being present.
June Reviewed the half year report from PwC including reporting arrangements and a benchmarking study on the internal audit function; 
discussed and confirmed that PwC had access to the Chairmen of the Committee and Board, and meets the former without 
management present at least twice a year; considered the Committee’s activities, the resources available to it and also training 
needs of and undertaken by Committee members; considered the FRC’s consultation on going concern and risk management 
statements; and received and discussed KPMG’s audit strategy and plan for 2014.
July Reviewed in combination with KPMG’s H1 review report the 2014 interim results announcement (incorporating a management 
report and condensed financial statements and notes), management representation letter to the auditors and the half year litigation, 
compliance and tax reports, as well as the half year going concern statement; reviewed KPMG’s amended letter of engagement 
and proposed fees and delegated their approval to the Finance Director; discussed an update on the Company’s anti-bribery and 
corruption programme; confirmed that KPMG did not require a meeting without management present; and considered and 
approved a policy for the recruitment of audit staff.
December Reviewed update report from KPMG on their audit plan; discussed EU rules on audit rotation and restrictions on non-audit 
services, as well as UK audit tender rules; considered and approved amendments to the Committee’s terms of reference; periodic 
review of the Group’s treasury policies and delegated authority limits; carried out an annual review of the internal audit programme; 
received PwC’s H2 report; approved the re-appointment of PwC as internal auditors and agreed fees and a programme of work  
for 2015; and held a meeting without management being present. 
32 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Audit Committee report Audit rotation/tender, reappointment, objectivity and independence
Financial Reporting Council guidelines a year ago suggested that the 
Committee would not need to undertake an audit tender process before 
2018 (being within 5 years of the last partner rotation). However, that 
position has been revised by the Competition and Markets Authority 
Order which, under transitional rules, requires the Committee to complete 
a tender before 17 June 2016. The EU also introduced new laws last year 
on mandatory audit rotation which suggests that our auditor must be 
rotated by 17 June 2016, although national governments may be able  
to modify the rotation requirement to one of a compulsory tender. The 
Committee discussed these issues in December and decided that it 
would be carrying out a tender process before June 2016.
Following the review of KPMG’s effectiveness, the Committee is 
recommending to the Board that KPMG be re-appointed as the 
Company’s auditors at the AGM. 
The Committee considers the auditor’s objectivity and independence  
at least twice a year. It receives reports from KPMG on its internal quality 
control and independence rules, and keeps under review the level of 
non-audit services KPMG provides. 
The Committee is of the view that the auditors are objective and 
independent notwithstanding the level of non-audit services provided.  
The Company’s policy on non-audit services is more fully set out below. 
Non-audit services 
In 2014, non-audit services of $0.6 million from KPMG were approved by 
the Committee (2013: $0.6 million). These services consisted mainly of tax 
advisory services in relation to the US, UK, Netherlands, Germany, China, 
Taiwan and Brazil. KPMG’s knowledge of the business meant it could 
provide these services cost effectively and the safeguards explained 
previously mean the Committee does not consider the provision of these 
services to affect the auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
The Company’s policy on non-audit services contains guidance on the 
types of non-audit work that the external auditors may be considered for. 
This guidance is in addition to other specified factors that must be taken 
into consideration, such as the expertise and resources of the firm, whether 
the services could risk jeopardising audit independence and the fee relative 
to the audit fee. Examples of services that the external auditors may and 
may not be allowed to perform under the policy can be found on the 
Company’s website: www.elementisplc.com. 
Under our policy, the Finance Director may approve individual engagements 
where the fee is up to 15 per cent of the Group’s audit fee for the previous 
year, provided that the total non-audit fees in the year do not exceed  
50 per cent of that Group audit fee. Decisions above these thresholds  
must be referred to the Committee for determination.
Significant accounting issues 
The primary areas of accounting judgement considered by the Committee 
in relation to the 2014 financial statements are listed below:
•  P r o vi s i ons 
The Committee reviewed the latest estimates for future spending 
relating to the Group’s environmental provisions recorded in the 
Consolidated balance sheet. These included some adjustments when 
compared to estimates used at the previous year end, based on a 
report from a third party adviser. The Committee also reviewed the 
discount rate used in calculating the provision balances and concluded 
that the rate should be reduced from the previous year’s rate due  
to a decline in US borrowing rates.
•  Assumptions used to value pension scheme liabilities 
The Committee reviewed the assumptions used to value the  
liabilities of the UK, US and Dutch defined benefit pension schemes, 
as well as the US post retirement medical plan, which the Group’s 
actuarial advisers for each plan considered to be appropriate given  
the characteristics of each plan. They noted that, as a result of  
a change in pension provider in the Netherlands, the Dutch plan  
would be accounted for under IAS 19 as a defined contribution  
plan going forward.
•  E x cep t i ona l i t e m s 
The Committee reviewed a number of items recorded in the 
Consolidated income statement which it considered should be 
separately disclosed because of their size, nature and incidence, 
thereby providing the reader with a better understanding of the 
financial information presented. It concluded that these items should 
be shown separately in the Consolidated income statement under  
a column headed ‘Exceptional items’. Further details of these items  
are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated financial statements.
•  T a x ati o n 
The Committee reviewed the underlying assumptions to the Group’s 
2014 tax rate and, in particular, noted the exceptional tax credit relating 
to legacy UK advance corporation tax and the related deferred tax 
assets. The Committee noted that the basis for recognising these 
credits arose from an increase in the level of UK profitability and a 
consequent improvement in the likelihood that these legacy credits 
would be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Audit effectiveness
As Chairman of the Committee I meet with the audit partner frequently, 
including for both audit planning and review meetings. The Committee 
meets the audit partner and the senior manager at all four of its formal 
meetings but it is the Finance Director and finance teams who have most 
exposure to the audit team. 
To help the Committee carry out a formal review of KPMG’s performance, 
a questionnaire based evaluation is undertaken towards the end of  
each year end audit cycle by members of our finance team globally. The 
questionnaire used is the template produced by KPMG’s Audit Committee 
Institute which considers comprehensively different aspects of the audit 
process. Another way in which audit effectiveness can be monitored by 
the Committee is Audit Quality Inspection reports published by the FRC.
 
The Committee considers the auditor’s performance to be satisfactory 
and that the audit is effective as measured against their letter of 
engagement and the scope of services agreed. 
33 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Internal control and risk management system
The Committee’s formal remit includes reviewing the effectiveness of the 
internal control, compliance and risk management systems. During 2014, 
this formal review was undertaken by the Board who retain ultimate 
responsibility for risk management – see Risk management report for 
further details. The focus of the Committee’s work when it reviews internal 
audit reports is mainly on financial, operational and compliance risks. PwC, 
who provides an outsourced internal audit function, plays a significant role 
in the Group’s internal control process.
The Committee’s priorities are to monitor and keep under review our 
internal control and risk management system which is designed for the 
purposes of preventing material financial loss and fraud, safeguarding the 
value of assets (including reputation) and ensuring compliance with laws, 
regulations and Group policies. 
The Group’s internal control and risk management system is only designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and therefore the Board can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material mis-statement or loss. The Board is of 
the view that an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks faced by the Group was in place throughout the financial 
year under review and up to the date that this Annual Report was approved. 
No significant internal control failings or weaknesses were reported last year 
so none is disclosed here.
Set out below is a summary of the key features of the Group’s internal 
control system.
Control environment
The Group has policies and procedures that set out the responsibilities  
of business and site management, including authority levels, reporting 
disciplines and responsibility for risk management and internal control.  
In addition, annual compliance statements on internal control are  
certified by each operating division.
Risk identification and review
A formal risk review process exists for the identification, evaluation  
and monitoring of risks. See separate Risk management report.
Financial reporting
The Group operates a comprehensive financial reporting system including 
forecasts, consolidation and monthly reporting. Board reports include  
full management accounts, comprising monthly and year to date profit 
and loss statements, cash flow statements and balance sheet, with 
segmental and individual business performance analyses, as well as 
relevant performance indicators. Actual monthly results are monitored 
against budget, forecasts and the previous year’s results. Any significant 
variances are investigated and acted upon as appropriate. As well as 
monthly management accounts, each operating division prepares an 
annual and a 3 year operating plan which is approved by the Board. 
Thereafter a formal re-forecasting exercise is undertaken 3 times a year.
Investment appraisal
There are clearly defined investment guidelines for capital expenditure.  
All investment expenditure is subject to formal authorisation procedures, 
with major proposals being considered by the Board.
 
Internal audit programme
An internal audit programme is proposed by PwC in consultation with  
the Finance Director and approved by the Audit Committee each year, 
setting out a programme of audits over the course of the next 12 months. 
The programme covers the monitoring of the effectiveness of internal 
controls and the design of processes to test the effectiveness of controls. 
Controls assurance
The controls assurance framework at Elementis is threefold:
• Board leadership supported by an open and transparent culture  
of ‘no surprises’, good governance and compliance. This means 
knowing and understanding the businesses, quality interactions 
between the Board, management and business leadership teams 
(including a regular programme of presentations and reports  
to the Board, as well as operational site visits).
• Internal and external audit programme, regular litigation and 
compliance reviews with the General Counsel and a programme  
of compliance audits, regulatory inspections, environmental  
reviews and property surveys by external specialists.
• Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in which all employees are 
given training on and are required to self-certify compliance with, 
supplemented by an online compliance training programme,  
an anti-bribery and corruption policy, which contractors are  
also required to sign up to, whistleblowing arrangements and  
an anti-retaliation policy. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board and Committee understand the governance requirements  
for the Annual Report, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and that ‘fair’ should mean reasonable and impartial, 
‘balanced’ should mean even handed in terms of being positive and 
negative and ‘understandable’ should mean simple, clear and free  
from jargon or unnecessary clutter.
The Board and Committee consider the Annual Report for 2014, taken  
as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, with appropriate 
signposting and emphasis being made, throughout the various sections, 
to assist shareholders understand the information and disclosures 
contained within them.

Audit Committee report
continued Following a review with a recently refreshed Board, our objective  
is to ensure that executive compensation is designed to incentivise 
behaviour and performance that will deliver sustainable growth and  
value over the longer term, with a closer and more transparent link 
between performance targets and strategy, and structural changes  
to bring policy in line with best practice.
The Committee has determined that the policy should achieve closer 
alignment with the interests of shareholders by making performance 
related pay a greater proportion of overall total pay, having a longer term 
focus, and with a more significant share based element. The Committee 
will continue to set stretching targets as it historically has done.
Key findings of review
The Committee was assisted in its review by New Bridge Street,  
its retained adviser, and concluded that the overall structure of our 
remuneration policy has worked well, but recognised that several  
areas needed to be addressed:
• The current annual bonus opportunity is behind UK FTSE 250  
market levels and significantly below comparable US peers and  
the LTIP provision is also below US peers. This is particularly relevant 
for Elementis given that: (i) the current Chief Executive and both 
Business Presidents are nationals of and based in the US, and  
(ii) the Committee desires to have the potential flexibility to structure 
appropriate packages for new senior executives (where recruited 
from the US), with a higher proportion of variable pay if necessary. 
Addressing this matter is a priority for the Committee.
• Supporting investors’ desire for greater alignment through share 
ownership, more incentive pay should be delivered in shares,  
with more deferral, a stronger share ownership requirement  
and a post-vesting holding period for LTIP awards.
• Legacy defined benefits pension arrangements need to be fully 
transitioned to defined contribution arrangements.
• Other aspects of our remuneration arrangements require updating  
to comply with best practice such as a review of the operation  
of our recovery and withholding (clawback) provision.
Key changes to remuneration policy
The remuneration policy that follows in the next part of this remuneration 
report reproduces the current policy (in its entirety) which was approved 
last year and incorporates the changes that are being proposed.  
A summary of the changes are set out below.

Chairman’s annual statement on remuneration
Introduction
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ remuneration report for  
2014 which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee  
(the “Committee”) and approved by the Board.
As reported last year, the Committee decided to review executive 
remuneration in two stages because of the Board refreshment 
programme that was underway and the importance of ensuring 
remuneration is linked to strategy and the risk profile of the Company.  
The refreshment process, which is now complete, resulted in 3 new 
directors being appointed last year, including the Chairman of the Board, 
as well as 2 non-executive directors who also became members of  
the Committee. Two of the early priorities of the refreshed Board and 
Committee have been to carry out a strategy review and conclude  
the review of incentive pay, both of which have been done. 
This means that changes to variable pay are being proposed to complete 
the proposals on fixed pay that were approved by shareholders at last 
year’s AGM. Subject to a successful shareholder vote at this year’s AGM, 
it is not intended that shareholders will be asked to approve another 
remuneration policy before 2018. It is worth pointing out that the last 
review, prior to the current 2 stage review, was carried out more than 
5 years ago and remuneration practices have developed considerably 
since then, such as the introduction of bonus deferral, post-vesting 
holding periods for long term incentives and recovery and withholding 
provisions. Presenting a revised remuneration policy for approval at the 
2015 AGM allows the Committee to incorporate these new best practice 
features, as well as make the changes proposed. 
The revised remuneration policy, if approved, will be effective from the 
date of approval and apply to the 2015 bonus scheme and LTIP awards. 
Background to the proposed changes
Under the leadership of our management team, Elementis has established 
itself as one of the leading global specialty chemicals companies, 
delivering a total shareholder return of more than 450 per cent over  
the last 5 years and generating strong profits and free cash flow.
Elementis has benefited from extending its geographic footprint and 
broadening its end markets, thereby creating a more complex and resilient 
business despite ongoing variable economic conditions. The Group has 
been successful in recent years in leveraging its key strengths to deliver 
shareholder value, making a number of important strategic decisions 
along the way that have enhanced its profitable growth, the sustainability 
of its operations and margins, as well as the strength of its balance sheet. 
The Board is confident that the Group will continue to make progress.
For the next phase of our development as a successful specialty 
chemicals company, it is essential that the executive reward policy  
takes account of the Company’s complexity and global presence, that it 
appropriately rewards our current high calibre senior management team 
and remains fit for purpose within the context of risk management and 
succession planning. In this regard it is essential that the policy contains 
adequate flexibility, with appropriate safeguards for shareholders, and one 
that is capable of attracting future talent where necessary (including in the 
US market where more than half of our operating facilities are located).
35 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Directors’ remuneration report Shareholding guidelines:
Increased from 100 per cent to 200 per cent of basic salary. From 2015 
no vested share awards may be sold, other than to meet tax liabilities,  
until the required level has been reached.
The Committee consulted with its major shareholders, the IMA and ISS  
on the proposed changes to remuneration, took on board their views  
and made changes accordingly.
2014 overview
As a result of another resilient financial performance in challenging global 
market conditions, the executive directors will receive bonus payments 
equal to 50.00 per cent (2013: 55.91 per cent) of their basic salaries.
Under the LTIP, the performance period for the 2012 awards ended in 
2014 and the percentage that will vest (in June 2015) under the EPS and 
TSR conditions is 68 per cent and 62 per cent respectively, delivering  
a total reward outcome of 65 per cent (2013: 100 per cent). Elementis 
delivered shareholder return over the 3 year period of 105 per cent, 
compared to 39 per cent from the companies in the FTSE All Share Index 
(excluding investment trusts). EPS growth (on a like for like basis) over  
the same period was more than 30 per cent. 
The Committee believes that this reward outcome is justified based on  
the Company’s performance over the period and demonstrates that the 
Committee has and will continue to set performance targets under both 
the short and long term incentives which it considers to be meaningful 
and appropriately stretching.
2015 policy implementation
The following summarises the application of our remuneration policy in  
the current year (some of which may be subject to shareholder approval  
at the AGM):
• In line with the existing policy, the Committee awarded David Dutro 
and Brian Taylorson each a salary increase of 3 per cent with effect 
from January 2015, which is in line with the increase for the US,  
UK and European workforces.
• The annual bonus scheme will generally operate on the same basis 
as in 2014 (up to the proposed limits for the current directors and 
incorporating the new provisions described above), except for  
a few adjustments. 
 (i)  The existing 75:25 weighting in respect of the EPS and average 
working capital (AWC) metrics will be adjusted to 80:20 and the 
EPS metric will be replaced with PBT (defined as Group profit 
before tax before any exceptional items). The Committee discussed 
the appropriateness of maintaining EPS as the profit based 
measure for short term performance and has decided that PBT 
would be a better measure of trading performance. This thinking 
follows a review of market practice on the most common metrics 
used and the trend by FTSE 350 industrial companies to utilise a 
profit based measure rather than EPS for the short term incentive, 
while retaining EPS under the long term incentive. 
 (ii)  In line with previous practice, targets for the new PBT metric  
will be set at threshold, plan and stretch levels, with threshold 
normally being the prior year result and plan and stretch targets  
set at levels considered to be appropriately challenging. Due to 
commercial sensitivity, it is the Committee’s normal practice to only 
disclose these bonus targets retrospectively which it will continue 
to do. Bonus accrual remains unchanged and would be 0 per cent 
and 100 per cent at threshold and stretch, respectively, with 
straight line vesting in between. 
Chairman’s annual statement on remuneration (continued)
Annual bonus scheme:
• Maximum limits: Increased from current 100 per cent of basic salary 
to 150 per cent and 125 per cent for the CEO and Finance Director, 
respectively, for the duration of the 3 year policy in the case of 
current directors. A higher limit of up to 200 per cent of basic salary 
may apply for new recruits to provide flexibility to attract high calibre 
talent, if required. 
• Bonus metrics and accrual: For profit related performance measures, 
targets will be set at threshold, plan and stretch level and the rate at 
which any bonus will accrue shall be determined by the Committee 
each year when reviewing annual business plans and approving 
bonus scheme targets which may include quantifiable non-financial 
metrics/targets.
• Bonus deferral: 50 per cent of any bonus paid must be awarded in 
shares and deferred for 2 years. Deferred shares will be met from 
recycled shares held by the Elementis Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (“ESOT”). 
• Recovery and withholding (clawback): Triggers include errors, 
mis-statement and gross misconduct (dismissal for cause). The  
new provisions would apply from 2015 awards, for 3 years following 
when bonus is earned (cash bonus paid) and be incorporated into 
the rules of the bonus scheme. Recovery/withholding will be drafted 
as flexibly as possible to ensure its effective operation and may be 
made through withholding deferred annual bonus awards or future 
vesting of incentive payments (including a reduction of unpaid 
bonuses or unvested share awards including deferred share awards) 
or to seek recovery of sums already paid or transferred to the 
employee from their personal funds.
• Deferred shares would accrue dividends (in cash or further shares) 
during the 2 year deferral period and be paid in the normal manner  
to the registered holder (if it is held in the ESOT) for further remittance 
to a beneficial owner as appropriate. For conditional awards and 
options, dividends would be paid when shares are delivered.
• Deferred shares are only forfeitable in the event of dismissal  
for cause.
Long term incentive plan (“LTIP”)
• Grant levels will be increased to 175 per cent of basic salary for  
both the CEO and the Finance Director. The new policy limit of  
175 per cent will apply to current directors for the duration of the  
3 year policy. A new higher limit of up to 250 per cent of basic  
salary is introduced for new recruits to provide flexibility to attract 
high calibre talent and this will be the shareholder approved limit 
under the amended LTIP rules. 
• Post-vesting holding period of 2 years: Shares may not be sold when 
awards vest other than sufficient to meet tax and social security 
liabilities. The balance of shares would be held under the ESOT. 
• Recovery and withholding (clawback): Features and operation  
to apply on a similar basis as described for the bonus scheme.
• Dividends: As for deferred shares under the bonus scheme. In the 
case of nil cost options, dividends will only accrue on vested shares 
to the extent they are paid during the 3 year vesting period. 
• A separate resolution to approve changes to the LTIP rules will be 
proposed at the AGM. These will include the change to the individual 
limit and in respect of the new withholding and recovery, dividend 
and post-vesting holding period provisions.
Pension:
The only change concerns the value of annual benefit (cash salary 
supplement) payable to the Finance Director from 1 December 2015 
which is a reduction from 74 per cent to 30 per cent of his basic salary,  
to bring this legacy arrangement more in line with market practice.
36 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Directors’ remuneration report
continued The Committee has considered the above changes carefully and is 
satisfied that changes to incentive opportunity for current directors will 
ensure that packages remain fair and market competitive. The flexibility 
afforded by higher incentive plan limits for recruitment purposes is in the 
best interests of the Company and therefore shareholders. We have 
strengthened alignment with shareholders through the introduction of a 
robust recovery and withholding provision both in the annual bonus and 
the long term plan, a higher share ownership requirement, deferred share 
bonus element and a holding period for vested LTIP awards. 
We are committed to structuring our remuneration policy in line with UK 
market practice even if, quantum wise, there may be a need to compete 
for senior executive talent in other markets, such as in the US.
Your directors were very pleased to receive a significant level of support 
for our Remuneration report from shareholders at last year’s AGM (for 
both our remuneration policy and the rest of the remuneration report).  
On behalf of the directors, I thank you for your continuing support. 
Signed on behalf of the Board by:
Andrew Christie
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
24 February 2015
 (iii)  Under the AWC condition, it is proposed that the single target 
structure introduced last year will be retained for 2015. The reason 
for doing so is because the Committee considers that current  
AWC performance levels are already strong relative to industry 
benchmarks and the focus should be on growing revenue and 
operating profit while ensuring that existing AWC performance 
levels are maintained. As with last year, the single target means 
achievement of the target would result in that component of bonus 
opportunity subject to the AWC condition vesting in full, subject to 
a PBT over-ride, such that AWC is not triggered unless PBT at plan 
is met. The actual AWC target will also be disclosed retrospectively. 
• LTIP awards (up to the proposed 175 per cent limit for current 
directors) to be made (after the 2015 AGM) will be subject to  
the same mix of challenging EPS and TSR based performance 
conditions (split 50:50) as the awards made in 2014. The Committee 
reviewed both metrics and considers them to be appropriate. In  
the case of the EPS targets, these remain appropriately challenging 
based on internal growth plans, but the Committee will continue to 
be keep the EPS range under annual review to ensure it continues  
to remain appropriate.
• The revised pension benefit limit will be applied to Brian Taylorson 
from 1 December 2015 when his current arrangements expire.
Link between strategy and remuneration
Ultimately, our principal strategic objective is to deliver a superior 
shareholder return on a sustainable basis. The policy changes being 
proposed should achieve closer alignment with the interests of 
shareholders by making performance related pay longer term,  
and with a more significant share based element. 
The Company’s main financial KPIs are: operating profit, operating and 
contribution margin, AWC to sales ratio, ROCE and operating cash flow. 
The selection of PBT and AWC metrics in the annual bonus scheme 
ensures that the focus is on trading performance and the drivers of longer 
term value: profitability and cash generation. With regards to long term 
performance targets, EPS growth or ROCE targets may be used under 
our current policy and these are aligned with the long term shareholder 
value creation and efficient growth of the Company. The Committee has 
considered whether a ROCE measure should be utilised but concluded 
that rather than adopt both EPS and ROCE, or replace EPS with ROCE,  
it would retain the existing EPS and TSR metrics to keep matters simple 
and to provide better consistency and transparency in performance 
measurement over time. The Committee considers that the main drivers 
of ROCE over a 3 year period are EPS, capital investment, working capital 
and cash flow, and 3 of these elements are already captured in the annual 
bonus and LTIP plans, while capital investments are reviewed on a case 
by case basis. The relative TSR condition ensures that there is clear 
alignment between shareholders and executives. 
Summary
The changes bring our policy in line with market best practice and achieve 
greater alignment between management and shareholder interests. The 
Committee will continue to set meaningful performance targets that are 
appropriately challenging for both short and long term incentives.

Effective date and duration of remuneration policy
This part of the Directors’ remuneration report (the “Remuneration policy report”) sets out the remuneration policy for the directors of the Company that 
is being put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM. Subject to receiving majority shareholder support, this Remuneration policy report will be 
effective from the date of approval at the AGM on 22 April 2015. 
Link between policy, strategy and structure
Our remuneration policy is principally designed to attract, motivate and retain the executive directors and business presidents to execute effectively  
our corporate and business strategies in order to deliver our annual operating plans and sustainable year on year profitable growth, as well as to 
generate and preserve value for our shareholders over the longer term, without encouraging excessive levels of risk taking. The principles and values 
that underpin our remuneration strategy are applied on a consistent basis for all our Group employees. It is our policy to reward all employees fairly, 
responsibly and by reference to local market practices, by providing an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration. 
The Committee’s policy is to adequately reward the directors if they meet or exceed the targets set under the variable components of their  
remuneration packages. 
The remuneration structure for executive directors is made up of 2 elements: fixed remuneration (consisting of basic salary, benefits (including for 
example non-contributory health insurance and life assurance) and pension provision), and variable remuneration (annual bonus scheme and long term 
share incentives). 
Policy table
The information in the table below sets out the remuneration policy for the different elements that make up total remuneration applying to directors.

Annual salary increases that are broadly in line with the local workforce (in percentage of salary terms), subject  
to Committee approval. 
Increases beyond the average of those granted to the local workforce (in percentage of salary terms) may be awarded  
in certain circumstances, such as where there is a material change in responsibility or experience of the individual, to 
recognise exceptional performance over a sustained period or a significant increase in the complexity, size or value of  
the Company.
Where new joiners or recent promotions have been placed on a below market rate of pay initially, a series of increases 
above those granted to the local workforce (in percentage of salary terms) may be given over the following few years 
subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Salaries are normally reviewed in December and any changes are effective from 1 January in the following year.
Maximum 
potential value
There is no prescribed maximum for salary increases. The Committee will be guided by the general increase for the  
local workforce and/or broader workforce as a whole, as well as the circumstances listed above.

SAYE/savings based schemes are subject to individual limits. These are $2,000 per month in the US and in the  
UK up to the HMRC prescribed limit (£500 per month). 
Other benefits: the Committee will determine the level of benefit as it considers appropriate, taking into consideration  
local market practice.
Annual bonus scheme
Purpose  
and link to 
Company's 
strategy
To incentivise the senior management team to exceed the annual operating plans approved by the Board at the start  
of each financial year.
To ensure that a significant proportion of an executive’s total remuneration is based on corporate/business financial 
performance that is linked to the Company’s annual operating plan.
To enable incentive pay to help build and maintain meaningful executive shareholdings thereby providing 
greater long term focus.
How it 
operates in 
practice
An annual bonus is earned based on over performance against selected performance measures which are linked to  
the Company’s key performance indicators, or the achievement of strategic and/or operational objectives.
Bonus payments are paid following the approval of full year results. Payments are based on salaries at the time  
of payment. 
Bonus deferral element: 50 per cent of any cash bonus payable must be awarded in shares and deferred  
for 2 years. Dividends to accrue to deferred share award holders (or holders of conditional share awards). 
Deferred shares or conditional awards are forfeitable for gross misconduct (dismissal for cause). 
The Committee may seek recovery and/or withholding of bonuses paid that are later found to have been 
based on performance that was mis-stated or incorrectly calculated, or where the amount of any bonus  
may have been reduced or withheld due to reasons of gross misconduct. Recovery and withholding 
provisions will apply from awards made in 2015 and apply for a period of 3 years following payment of any 
bonus. Detailed provisions are incorporated into the rules of the various schemes which govern the terms  
of a bonus payment and or the making of any deferred share or conditional award. 
Maximum 
potential value
Chief Executive 150 per cent of basic salary.
Finance Director 125 per cent of basic salary.
A higher annual bonus limit of 200 per cent of basic salary may apply for new recruits.
39 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Annual bonus scheme (continued)
Framework 
used to assess 
performance
The performance measure(s) will be based mainly on financial performance although the Committee reserves 
the right to select other qualitative or non-financial targets (including the basis of their measurement) as it 
considers to be appropriate and which are aligned to the Company’s strategic objectives for the year ahead.
The financial element of the bonus may include (but are not limited to) the Company’s key performance 
indicators which include:
• Profit before tax or other measures of profitability.
• Group average trade working capital to sales ratio expressed as a percentage (“AWC”) or other cash 
flow indicators.
Targets for financial metrics are set relative to the annual operating plan, taking into account general GDP 
factors, external market data, current and past performance of the business, together with any organic or 
acquisitive growth plans.
For any profit related metric, targets will be set at threshold, plan and stretch levels and the amount payable 
for threshold performance shall be determined by the Committee each year when reviewing annual bonus 
plans and approving bonus scheme targets.
The Committee keeps performance metrics under review on an annual basis to ensure they continue to 
remain appropriate and has the discretion to introduce new metrics or remove existing ones and amend their 
relative weightings. As a result, the performance metrics and weightings may vary in line with the Company’s 
evolving strategy during the life of the policy. The profit related element of annual bonus shall not be less 
than 50 per cent of the overall bonus opportunity.
Long term incentives
Purpose and 
link to 
Company's 
strategy
The LTIP is the sole long term incentive mechanism and is intended to align the interests of the executives with the Group’s 
long term performance, business strategy and broader interests of shareholders.
When granting awards under the LTIP the Committee generally takes into consideration the need to motivate and retain the 
executive directors and other participants.
The number of options/conditional shares awarded, up to the maximum limit, is based on the average mid-market closing 
price of a share on the date preceding the date of award.
How it 
operates in 
practice
Nil cost options or conditional shares are awarded annually. Options are exercisable 3 years from, and within 10 years of, 
the date of award. Share awards vest on the 3rd anniversary of the date of award. 
A post-vesting holding period of 2 years will apply to annual awards granted from 2015.
For US participants (e.g. the CEO) the award of conditional shares may be structured in the form of restricted 
stock units in order to comply with US tax rules on deferred compensation particularly in view of the holding 
period being introduced. 
Recovery and withholding provisions similar to those described in respect of annual bonus payments but 
relating to the vesting of LTIP awards will apply from 2015 awards. 
Dividend rights: dividends will accrue during the 3 year performance period in respect of LTIP awards to the 
extent that they vest. In the case of awards structured as nil cost options, dividends payable would only be 
paid when the options are exercised and when the employee becomes the beneficial owner of the shares.
Tax rules mean US participants will generally exercise and sell at least part of any options/shares that vest on the date  
of vesting, in order to meet tax liabilities. This will continue to be our practice for options/shares not subject to the  
holding period.
Awards are subject to the achievement of challenging performance conditions and normally subject to continued service 
over the vesting period. 
Remuneration policy report (continued)

Directors’ remuneration report
continued Long term incentives (continued)
Maximum 
potential value
For the current Chief Executive and Finance Director, the maximum award is limited to 175 per cent of their 
basic salaries at the time of the award.
A higher limit of 250 per cent of basic salary may apply to annual awards made to new recruits.
Framework 
used to assess 
performance
Awards are subject to achievement of financial (EPS, ROCE or any other relevant company financial KPI) and/or relative TSR 
performance conditions measured over 3 financial years beginning with the financial year in which the award is made. TSR 
will be measured against the constituents of a broad equity index, or a bespoke group of appropriate comparator companies. 
In determining the target range for any financial measures that may apply, the Committee ensures they are challenging by 
taking into account current and anticipated trading conditions, the long term business plan and external market data. For any 
financial performance condition, threshold vesting will start from 0 per cent and for any relative TSR performance condition, 
threshold vesting will start at 3.85 per cent. In both cases this will increase on a straight line basis with 100 per cent vesting  
for achieving the stretch targets, which for the TSR performance condition will require at least upper quartile performance.
Pension
Purpose  
and link to 
Company's 
strategy
To aid retention and remain competitive in the marketplace.
To provide appropriate retirement benefits commensurate with local market practice, seniority of the role and tenure with 
the Company.
How it 
operates in 
practice
Policy for new recruits is a contribution to a non-company pension scheme and/or cash in lieu.
The policy for the current Chief Executive and Finance Director is set out below.
Group Chief Executive
David Dutro receives an annual salary supplement of 20 per cent of his basic salary as part of his contractual entitlement 
and as a US employee he also participates in 2 defined contribution schemes being: (i) a US 401(k) Plan, which is similar  
to a money purchase scheme, and (ii) a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the ‘Defined Contribution plans’).  
The latter plan mirrors the 401(k) Plan except it allows for contributions in respect of pensionable remuneration over an 
annual compensation limit set by the US Internal Revenue Service (2013: $255,000). The employer match under these  
two plans includes a regular match of up to 4 per cent of total pensionable remuneration and a supplemental match  
of up to 4 per cent, based on age and length of service.
Finance Director
Up until 30 November 2015 when his current arrangement expires, Brian Taylorson will receive a single annual salary 
supplement which broadly matches the value of his previous pension provision. After that date the annual salary 
supplement will be reduced to 30 per cent of basic salary, in line with the level for new recruits.
Maximum 
potential value
The policy for new executives is for a company contribution of up to 30 per cent of salary. 
Under the policy the maximum for the CEO is 20 per cent of his salary and up to 8 per cent of pensionable remuneration 
depending on the amount of personal contributions made into the Defined Contribution plans.
The maximum for the Finance Director, until 30 November 2015 as per the previous approved policy, is a salary 
supplement of 74 per cent of his salary. Thereafter, the annual salary supplement will be 30 per cent of his basic salary.
Legacy arrangements exist for existing employees.
41 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Share ownership guidelines
Purpose  
and link to  
Company's 
strategy
To align an executive’s interests with those of shareholders and to encourage executives to participate and share in the 
long term success of the Group.
How it 
operates in 
practice
Executive directors are expected to build up a shareholding in the Company that is equal in value to  
200 per cent of their basic annual salaries.
Shares vesting from share awards, or transferred pursuant to an exercise of any option, granted under  
any share incentive or employee share saving scheme may not be sold (other than to meet a tax liability)  
until the above shareholding level has been met.
The Committee monitors compliance with these guidelines and can make changes to them from time to time.
Non-executive Chairman and directors’ fees
Purpose  
and link to 
Company's 
strategy
To attract individuals with the relevant skills, knowledge and experience that the Board considers necessary in  
order to maintain an optimal mix that ensures the effectiveness of the Board as a whole in carrying out its duties  
and responsibilities.
How it 
operates in 
practice
Non-executive directors’ fees are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors, having regard to fees paid  
to non-executive directors in other UK quoted companies and the time commitment and responsibilities of the role. 
In the case of the Chairman, the fee level is determined by the Committee. As well as taking into consideration the above 
factors, the Committee sets the fee at an appropriate level necessary to attract a role holder qualified to effectively lead  
the board of a company of a similar size and prestige as Elementis.
Fees will be reviewed annually with changes taking effect from 1 January in the following year. 
Fees are payable in cash and non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any pension, bonus or share 
incentive schemes. No individual is allowed to vote on his/her own remuneration.
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting
The performance metrics that are used for annual bonus and long term 
incentive plans are drawn from a suite of Company KPIs monitored by  
the Board that are closely linked to the financial KPIs on page 15.
PBT (defined as reported Group profit before tax, before any 
exceptional items) is a clear measure of the Company’s trading 
performance and AWC encourages the most efficient use of working 
capital and ensures earnings are turned into cash. These metrics are 
aligned with the Company’s objectives and strategy. 
With regards to long term performance targets, EPS growth or ROCE 
targets may be used and these are aligned with the long term levels of 
shareholder value creation and growth of the Company. A relative TSR 
condition ensures that there is clear alignment between shareholders  
and executives. 
Where appropriate, targets are set based on sliding scales that take 
account of internal planning and external data. Only modest rewards  
are available for delivering performance at threshold levels or above with 
maximum rewards requiring out performance of our challenging plans 
approved at the start of each year.
The intended targets for awards to be granted under the long term 
incentive plan in 2015 are consistent with the policy set out in the policy 
table and are set out in the Annual report on remuneration on page 47. 
The Committee considers the EPS targets to be appropriately challenging 
based on internal growth plans, but will continue to keep this EPS range 
under annual review to ensure it continues to remain appropriate.
The Committee does not incorporate corporate or business performance 
in environmental, social and governance matters when setting targets  
in the variable parts of remuneration. The safety and environmental 
performance of Group businesses is accorded high importance and the 
Committee considers that management should aspire to achieving high 
standards in both safety and environmental performance without the need 
for incentives. Governance standards are set by the Board as a whole.

Key Key
The table above illustrates the potential pay opportunities for executive directors under 3 different scenarios for 2015. The CEO’s remuneration  
has been converted into pounds sterling using the average exchange rate for 2014 ($1.65:£1.00).
1.  Fixed: Comprises fixed pay being the value of salary, benefits and pension (benefits and for the CEO employer’s matching contribution  
to Defined Contribution plans are included at their 2014 level).
2.  On target: The amount receivable assumes performance in which 50 per cent of annual bonus is payable and 50 per cent of long term incentive 
awards vest. 
3.  Maximum: the maximum amount receivable should all stretch targets be met and vesting under both the annual bonus scheme and LTIP  
is 100 per cent.
When valuing the LTIP options under the ‘On target’ and ‘Maximum’ scenarios, no account of any share price appreciation is taken into account.
Differences in executive remuneration policy compared  
to other employees 
The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider  
Group when setting the remuneration policy for executive directors. The 
Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader 
Group and, in particular the employees based in the US, UK and Europe, 
when determining salary increases for the executive directors.
The same principles and values behind the design of remuneration  
for the executive directors and business presidents apply to other  
senior managers and employees throughout the rest of the Group, with 
modifications to reflect local market practice and the level of seniority and 
ability to influence Group performance. Overall, the remuneration policy 
for executive directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than 
for other employees. This ensures that there is a clear link between the 
value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the 
executive directors given it is the executive directors who are considered 
to have the greatest potential to influence shareholder value creation.
Reward scenario analysis
The level of variable pay varies by level of employee within the Group and 
is informed by the specific responsibilities of each role and local market 
practice as appropriate.
How the views of employees are taken into account
The Group does not actively consult with employees on executive 
remuneration. The Group has a diverse workforce operating in 9 different 
countries, with various local pay practices, which would make any cost 
effective consultation impractical. However, as noted above, when setting 
the remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee takes into 
account the pay and employment conditions for other employees in the 
Group. This process ensures that any annual increase to the basic pay  
of executive directors is not out of proportion with that proposed for  
other employees.
43 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Recruitment policy
For executive director recruitment and/or promotion situations, the Committee will follow the policy outlined below:
Element Policy
Basic salary Basic salary levels will be set in accordance with the Company’s remuneration policy, taking into account the experience 
and calibre of the individual (e.g. typically around market rates prevalent in companies of comparable size and complexity) 
or salary levels may be set below this level (e.g. if the individual was promoted to the Board). Where it is appropriate to offer 
a below market rate of pay initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be given over the following 
few years subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Benefits New directors may be entitled to benefits such as life assurance, private medical health insurance, cover for dental costs, 
accidental death and disablement, long term disability and provision of either a company car (for business and personal 
purposes) or a car allowance, or any other appropriate benefit. 
Where necessary the Committee may approve the payment of reasonable relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment  
for a maximum period of 12 months. 
Pension A company contribution into a pension plan and/or cash supplement of up to 30 per cent of salary. 
Legacy pension arrangements for promotees which may include defined benefit or US style arrangements may continue  
to operate on their existing terms.
Annual bonus The annual bonus would operate as outlined for current executive directors but to aid recruitment where necessary  
the maximum bonus opportunity is 200 per cent of basic salary. Bonus will be pro-rated for the proportion of the year 
served. Depending on the timing and responsibilities of the appointment it may be necessary to set different performance 
measures and targets initially. 
Long term 
incentives
Awards under the LTIP will be granted in line with the policy outlined for the current executive directors on an annual basis 
but to aid recruitment where necessary the maximum award is 250 per cent of basic salary. 
An award may be made shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in a prohibited period). For an 
internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at the 
date of grant. In addition, if the grant of awards for that individual precedes his or her appointment as a Board director  
for that financial year, the Committee’s policy would include flexibility to top up awards for that year (subject to the overall 
individual salary limit) based on the executive’s new salary.
Buy out 
awards
In the case of an external hire, if it is necessary to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be forfeited 
on leaving the previous employer), this would be provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares) and timing  
and expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards may be granted using the Company’s LTIP (up to the individual limit) or outside of the LTIP  
if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
Remuneration policy report (continued)
44 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Directors’ remuneration report
continued Finance Director 
The maximum amount that would be payable to Brian Taylorson for 
payment in lieu of notice by the Company for any reason other than for 
cause is an initial lump sum of 50 per cent of his basic salary and other 
benefits described below and up to a further 50 per cent payable in a 
lump sum after 6 months, subject to the Committee being satisfied that 
reasonable efforts to secure a new position have been made during the  
6 months following termination. Other benefits comprise: (i) the sums  
that would normally be payable to him in respect of his pension benefits 
pro-rated according to notice period being given/served, (ii) the cost of 
providing private medical insurance for him, his spouse and any children 
under 21 for the 12 months following termination and (iii) his monthly car 
allowance for a 12 month period.
The above summary only addresses contractual rights to payments in  
lieu of notice, or during the relevant director’s notice period, and may not 
reflect any settlement or compromise sums which are separately agreed 
at the point of termination.
Committee discretion with regard to incentive plans
For any outstanding LTIP awards these are governed by rules of the  
plan and only in limited circumstances is discretion permitted. In such 
circumstances, the Committee retains the use of discretion in its 
administration of the LTIP as contained in the plan rules.
In the specific event of loss of office any discretion exercised would 
depend on the circumstances at that time and the performance achieved 
during the performance period. In the event of the death of an executive 
director and an award has not yet vested the Committee, acting in its 
absolute discretion, may determine vesting from maturity rather than  
date of death. If an executive director ceases employment due to injury,  
ill health, disability, redundancy within the meaning of UK legislation or  
its overseas equivalent, transfer out of the Group/sale of business or 
retirement with employer’s consent (a “Good Leaver” event) and an award 
has not yet vested the Committee acting in its absolute discretion may 
allow early vesting at the date of cessation rather than at date of vesting. 
All such awards would still be subject to performance conditions, which 
the Committee may not waive, as well as pro-rating for time which the 
Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, may waive in part or in full if it 
considers acting fairly and reasonably it is appropriate to do so.
Similar provisions apply in the event of a change of control, with 
performance measured up to the date of the relevant event and  
normally scaling back pro-rated for time.
It is the Committee’s policy to exercise these discretions in a way that 
would be in the best interests of the Company and depending on the 
individual circumstances of each case. 
If an executive director resigns or is dismissed LTIP awards lapse  
and the Committee has no discretion under the rules.
Outside board appointments
The Company’s policy is to support an executive should they wish to take 
on an external board appointment, provided that there is no conflict of 
interest and the role does not interfere with the executive’s commitment  
or duties. If an executive does take on an external appointment they  
may retain any fees paid and will be restricted generally to only one  
such external appointment.
Service contracts
Executive directors’ service contracts contain a termination notice period 
not exceeding 12 months.
Name Date of contract Notice period
David Dutro, CEO 16 January 2007 12 months
Brian Taylorson, Finance Director 5 June 2005 12 months
Policy on payment for loss of office
For the existing executive directors, the terms covering termination were 
agreed at the date their contracts were made. The Finance Director is 
required, however, to mitigate his loss in the event of loss of office by 
making efforts to secure a new position. Payments in lieu of notice to  
both the Chief Executive and Finance Director may be reduced or ceased 
if each secures a new position. In the case of the Chief Executive, the 
payments will only be ceased if his salary in his new position is equal to  
or more than his salary on termination; if not his monthly payments will  
be reduced by the gross salary earned by the Chief Executive in his  
new position each month. 
For any new appointments, it is the Company’s policy to follow current 
market practice and preclude the inclusion of any payment (benefits, 
bonus or pension) other than basic salary in the calculation of termination 
payments (being 1 year’s salary) and a notice period of 12 months. 
Payments will be phased on a monthly basis over the remaining notice 
period and the Committee’s position is to ensure a director mitigates  
the loss to the Company. 
Termination payments
Group Chief Executive 
The maximum amount payable under David Dutro’s contract is  
basic salary during his notice period (12 months) and any bonus he  
may be eligible to receive for the period he was employed, subject  
to performance. 
Alternatively the Company may pay compensation in lieu of the notice 
period of a lump sum of 50 per cent of his basic salary, with up to a 
further 50 per cent payable in 6 monthly instalments after 6 months  
(in both cases pro-rated for the actual notice period). This would apply  
if the Company terminates his contract for any reason other than for 
cause or if he invokes a ‘good leaver’ reason for terminating his contract 
(i.e. upon a change of control in which the successor company is not 
bound to honour his service contract). 
45 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information The Company operates an annual cash bonus scheme in which 
participation and payments are made subject to the discretion of the 
Committee. However, under his service contract, the Chief Executive  
may be eligible to receive a bonus relating to the Company’s financial 
performance during his 12 month notice period, provided all performance 
conditions have been met. Where the Committee has any discretion, its 
policy is to exercise any discretion in the Company’s best interests and 
depending on the individual circumstances of each case. 
Following the introduction of bonus deferral requirements, the rules  
of the annual bonus scheme will be amended to incorporate the  
deferral requirement as well as recovery and withholding provisions  
as summarised in the remuneration policy table. The rules will include  
a discretion for the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, to waive 
deferral on the occurrence of a Good Leaver event. 
Under the amended rules of the LTIP, the holding period will apply to  
all participants who receive awards unless the Committee determines 
otherwise in its discretion, for example for awards made to below Board 
level participants. The holding period will expire on the earlier of 2 years 
and the date of specific events, such as a Good Leaver event or a change 
of control, although the Committee does have a discretion to end the 
holding period for any other reason. This discretion will not be applied  
in a way that creates adverse tax consequences for US participants.
For US participants, grants under the LTIP and Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan will be treated as “restricted stock units” so as to result in deferral  
of US income taxation until the shares are delivered to the participants. 
However, US social security tax will apply to the value of the grants at 
vesting (but not again on delivery of the shares). In order to avoid adverse 
US tax consequences, certain of the LTIP and Deferred Share Bonus  
Plan rules otherwise applicable to the holding/deferral period have been 
modified for US participants (e.g. delivery of shares will result from any 
separation from service of the Company and its affiliates regardless of 
Good Leaver status).
Legacy matters
Once adopted, this Remuneration policy report will apply from the date  
of approval by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. However, legacy awards  
or other commitments, including those made prior to 27 June 2012 but 
not modified or renewed after that date, to current or former directors  
may still be paid notwithstanding that they have only been incorporated  
by reference and not been fully described in this Remuneration policy 
report. These legacy awards and commitments comprise the LTIP  
awards made in 2013 and 2014, as more fully described in the Annual 
report on remuneration.
Non-executive directors’ terms of appointment
Non-executive directors are appointed for a 3 year term, subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. For non-executive directors who have served 
for 9 years or more, they may be appointed for a further year at a time. 
Each letter of appointment provides that the director’s appointment can 
be terminated by the Company on 6 months’ notice on any grounds 
without claim for compensation. 
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any pension, 
bonus or share incentive schemes. No individual is allowed to vote on  
his/her own remuneration.

The Committee encourages dialogue with the Company’s shareholders 
and would consult with major shareholders ahead of any significant future 
changes to remuneration policy. Major shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies were consulted on the changes summarised in  
the ‘Chairman’s annual statement on remuneration’.
Remuneration policy report (continued)
46 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Directors’ remuneration report
continued This Annual report on remuneration shows how the Company’s policies 
and practices on directors’ remuneration will be applied in 2015 and  
how they were applied in relation to payments in respect of the financial 
year ended 2014. This report and the Chairman’s annual statement  
on remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the  
2015 AGM.
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2015
This first section of the Annual report on remuneration describes how the 
Committee intends to implement the remuneration policy for the financial 
year ending 31 December 2015.
Basic salaries
The Committee considered carefully salary increases for 2015 and it was 
decided to award David Dutro and Brian Taylorson with a salary increase 
of 3 per cent which is in line with the levels of increases across the Group 
as a whole. 
Salary as at
1 January 2015
Salary as at
1 January 2014 Increase
David Dutro $875,500 $850,000 3%
Brian Taylorson £338,215 £328,364 3%
Pension and benefits
For the year to 31 December 2015, David Dutro will continue to participate 
in the pension arrangements and receive the same benefits as for 2014  
as set out in the Remuneration policy report.
As explained in last year’s Annual Report, Brian Taylorson will receive an 
annual salary supplement of 74 per cent of his basic salary in lieu of any 
other pension benefits until 30 November 2015 following his 60th birthday 
after which this salary supplement will reduce to 30 per cent of his basic 
salary. His other benefits for 2015 will be the same as that for 2014 as  
set out in the Remuneration policy report.
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity will be 150 per cent of basic salary  
for David Dutro and 125 per cent of basic salary for Brian Taylorson.
 
Any bonus will be payable dependent on the achievement of PBT (defined 
as reported Group profit before tax, before exceptional items) (80 per cent) 
and AWC targets (20 per cent). For the PBT condition, the targets are set at 
threshold, plan and stretch level, with threshold being previous year actual 
and the plan and stretch targets set at a level considered to be sufficiently 
challenging above the prior year out-turn. Bonus accrual is linear between 
threshold and stretch.
The AWC condition has a single target figure which results in 100 per cent 
of the bonus subject to that condition vesting, except that the AWC 
condition would only be operative if the PBT target at plan level has  
been met. 
Bonus payments are based on salaries at the time of payment.
The Committee considers that the targets themselves are commercially 
sensitive and therefore plans to disclose them only on a retrospective  
basis in next year’s Directors’ remuneration report.
All employee share plans
Executive directors will be entitled to participate in any all employee  
share plans on the same terms as any other eligible employee.

For the year to 31 December 2015, the CEO’s and the Finance Director’s 
awards will be 175 per cent of their basic salaries.
The performance targets that are intended to apply to the awards to be 
granted in the current year are the same as for 2014 as set out below.
For the EPS condition, the chart shows that awards will vest on a linear 
scale from 0 per cent to 100 per cent for average annual EPS growth of 
RPI + 4 per cent to RPI + 10 per cent, respectively. For the TSR condition, 
the chart shows that awards will vest on a linear scale from 3.85 per cent 
to 100 per cent for median to upper quartile performance, respectively. 
The TSR condition will be measured against the companies comprising 
the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment trusts).

This section shows the performance targets set in respect of the 2014 annual bonus scheme, the level of performance achieved and the resultant 
payments to directors. The bonus targets were tested against the full year results and the full year bonus payment will be paid in February/March 2015. 
The maximum full year bonus opportunity was 100 per cent of basic salary.

the 2014 bonus scheme rules.
Directors’ share based awards
Determination of 2012 LTIP awards
The awards made in 2012, shown in the table opposite headed Directors’ share and scheme interests, have a vesting date of 27 June 2015.  
The performance conditions (EPS and TSR, split 50:50) relate to performance over the 3 financial years ended 31 December 2014. Under the EPS 
condition, all of the awards subject to that condition would have vested in full if EPS grew during the 3 financial years ended 2014 by an average  
of RPI + 10 per cent p.a. or more. Under the TSR condition, all of the awards subject to that condition would have vested in full if the Company’s  
TSR performance (against the FTSE All Share index excluding investment trusts) in the 3 financial years ended 31 December 2014 was at or above 
upper quartile. Over the performance period, the Company’s EPS grew by 31.7 per cent (versus 37.6 per cent needed for full vesting) and its TSR 
performance was 105 per cent which placed it at the 35th percentile of companies in the FTSE All Share index. Accordingly, 64.86 per cent of  
the 2012 awards, subject to continued employment, will vest on 27 June 2015. For the purpose of the calculation of the LTIP component of the  
total remuneration figure in the table on page 49, the awards have been valued using the average mid-market closing share price for the 3 months 
period from 1 October 2014 to 31 December 2014. 
LTIP awards granted in the year
LTIP awards made in 2014 are set out in the table below and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions (split 50:50) over the 3 years  
to 31 December 2016. The vesting schedule and the performance conditions are the same as for the awards to be made in 2015 as shown  
on page 48.

  For David Dutro this equates to 150 per cent of basic salary and for Brian Taylorson this equates to 174 per cent of his basic salary. The share price used to 
determine the number of awards granted was 286.50p being the average mid-market closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant.
Details of awards in savings based share schemes are shown in the table opposite.
Sourcing shares for our share plans
Employee share plans comply with the Investment Association (previously ABI) guidelines on dilution which provide that overall issuance of shares 
under all plans should not exceed an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital over any 10 year period, with a further 
limitation of 5 per cent in any 10 year period on discretionary plans. Based on the number of awards that remain outstanding as at the year end,  
the Company’s headroom for all plans is 4.6 per cent and for discretionary plans 4.0 per cent of issued share capital.

A.  Savings based share options schemes are not subject to performance conditions. David Dutro’s options are held under the US sharesave scheme and would 
ordinarily vest on the second anniversary of the grant date and expire 3 months thereafter. During 2014 he was granted 9,523 savings based options. The option 
price shown is based on the mid-market closing share price on the date of grant, giving a face value of £23.1k. The options granted to Brian Taylorson during 2014 
are 3 year options held under the UK SAYE scheme and would ordinarily vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and expire 6 months thereafter. The option 
price shown is based on the average mid-market closing share price for the 5 days preceding the date of grant, giving a face value of £18k. Further details on these 
schemes are show in Note 24 to the ‘Consolidated financial statements’ on page 90.
B.  LTIP awards are subject to performance conditions. The same EPS growth and relative TSR performance conditions apply in respect of the awards made in 2012, 
2013 and 2014, as described in the Remuneration policy report. These options ordinarily vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and would expire on the 
tenth anniversary.
C.  Interest in shares, including of connected persons.

  David Dutro retained 12,502 shares in 2014 (2013: 4,929) following the exercise of savings based share options granted in 2012, the remaining 642 shares lapsed 
due to currency movements between the grant and exercise dates. The price on the date of exercise was 252.10 pence per share resulting in a notional gain of 
c. £6.5k. In addition, he exercised and sold 451,350 shares granted under the LTIP in 2011 which vested in full at a price of 277.60 pence per share, with a pre-tax 
gain of c. £1.25m.
2
  Brian Taylorson retained 43,778 shares (2013: 68,904) following the exercise of 43,778 shares granted under the UK SAYE scheme in 2009. The price on the date of 
exercise was 255.5 pence per share resulting in a notional gain of c. £96.3k. In addition, he exercised and sold 343,951 shares granted under the LTIP in 2011 which 
vested in full at a price of 277.60 pence per share, with a pre-tax gain of c. £0.95m.

  Shares shown are held from the beginning of the year up until the dates of their retirement.

  Guideline holding at 31 December 2014 was 100 per cent of salary but is changing to 200 per cent of salary from 2015.
51 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information The market price of ordinary shares at 31 December 2014 was 261.8 pence (2013: 268.9 pence) and the range during 2014 was 227.6 pence  
to 297.8 pence (2013: 210.2 pence to 275.0 pence). 
 
As at 24 February 2015, the Trustee of the Company’s ESOT held no shares (2013: nil). As executive directors, David Dutro and Brian Taylorson,  
as potential beneficiaries under the ESOT, are deemed to have an interest in any shares that become held in the ESOT. 
As at 24 February 2015, no person who was then a director had any interest in any derivative or other financial instrument relating to the 
Company’s shares and, so far as the Company is aware, none of their connected persons had such an interest. Between 31 December 2014  
and 24 February 2015 there was no change in the relevant interests of any such directors nor, so far as the Company is aware, in the relevant 
interests of any of their connected persons.
Other than their service contracts, letters of appointment and letters of indemnity with the Company, none of the directors had an interest in any 
contract of significance in relation to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries at any time during the financial year. 
Retirement benefits
The table below shows the breakdown of the retirement benefits of the executive directors, comprising employer contributions to defined contribution 
plans, benefits under defined benefit schemes and salary supplements paid in cash. 
The amount shown for David Dutro under defined contribution plans reflects total employer contributions in 2014. The amounts paid under these plans 
were £52,206 (2013: £47,460) equivalent to 6.0 per cent (2013: 6.0 per cent) of his total pensionable remuneration in 2014. The payment of a salary 
supplement is explained in the Remuneration policy report on page 41. In addition, as a US salaried executive director, David Dutro participated in the 
Elementis Career Reward Retirement Plan (“ECRRP”) for US employees. On 1 May 2006, the plan was frozen (closed to future accruals). The ECRRP  
is a cash balance retirement plan which falls under the category of defined benefit pension plans in the US. As the plan is closed to future accruals, 
participants’ account balances are no longer credited with contributions, however, interest is credited each year at the US Treasury 30 year bond rate. 
David Dutro’s accrued benefits under this plan are also shown in the table. David Dutro’s normal retirement date under all his pension arrangements  
is 65. The normal pensionable retirement age under the DB scheme for Brian Taylorson is 60.

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Other information about the Committee’s membership and operation
Committee composition
The Chairman and members of the Committee are shown on page 26, 
together with their biographical information. 8 meetings were held during 
2014 and the attendance records of Committee members are shown on 
page 29. All meetings were also attended by the Chairman of the Board 
and the Senior Independent Director, to ensure that all non-executive 
Board members were kept fully informed on the operation and work  
of the Committee. Both executive directors also attend meetings by 
invitation, as appropriate, although they are not present when their own 
remuneration arrangements are discussed or, if they are, they do not 
participate in the decision making process. 
Terms of reference
A full description of the Committee’s terms of reference, which was 
reviewed and revised last year, is available on the Company’s website  
and the following is a summary of its responsibilities:
• Determining the levels of remuneration for the Chairman  
and executive directors and keeping these under review.
• Making awards under the annual bonus scheme and LTIP,  
including setting performance targets.
• Monitoring and making recommendations on the design,  
structure and level of remuneration for all senior executives,  
ensuring that these are appropriately linked to the Group’s  
strategy and aligned with the Board’s risk profile.
Evaluation, training and development
On an annual basis the Committee’s effectiveness is reviewed as part of 
the evaluation of the Board. Following the evaluation last year, there were 
no major issues to report. 
During 2014 Committee members attended various external seminars on 
the latest developments on executive remuneration and all Board members 
received briefings from the Company Secretary and the Committee’s 
remuneration advisers throughout the year, to keep them updated on 
topical matters and developments relating to executive remuneration. 
Remuneration advisers
The Committee’s external advisers are New Bridge Street (“NBS”) who 
were appointed after a tender in 2008. This was reviewed again in 2013  
and as a result they were retained as advisers. The Committee is satisfied 
that there is no over reliance on NBS, who have no connection with the 
Company other than as remuneration advisers. Total fees paid to NBS in 
2014 amounted to c. £44,000 for advisory services mainly in connection 
with the review of executive remuneration and the Directors’ remuneration 
report for compliance with regulations.
Auditable sections of the Directors’ remuneration report
The sections of the ‘Annual report on remuneration’ that are required  
to be audited by law are as follows: Remuneration payable to directors  
for 2014 and Retirement benefits; and tables headed LTIP awards  
granted in the year, Directors’ share and scheme interests and  
Directors’ retirement benefits.

Biographical information about each director as at the year end is  
shown on page 26.
The interests of directors in the share capital of the Company are set

Employment policies and equal opportunities
The Group is an inclusive and equal opportunity employer that relies on 
HR specialists throughout its worldwide locations to ensure compliance 
with all applicable laws governing employment practices and to advise  
on all HR policies and practices, including for example recruitment and 
selection, training and development, promotion and retirement. 
Elementis policies seek to create a workplace that has an open 
atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect. Harassment or discrimination 
of any kind based on race, colour, religion, gender, age, national origin, 
citizenship, mental or physical disabilities, sexual orientation, veteran 
status, or any other similarly protected status is not tolerated. This 
principle applies to all aspects of employment from recruitment and 
promotion, through to termination and all other terms and conditions  
of employment. 
It is Group policy not to discriminate on the basis of any unlawful criteria 
and its practices include the prohibition on the use of child or forced 
labour. Employment policies are fair and equitable and consistent with  
the skills and abilities of the employee and the needs of the business. 
Employees are free to join a trade union or participate in collective 
bargaining arrangements. 
It is also Group policy, for employees who have a disability, to provide 
continuing employment under normal terms and conditions, where 
practicable, and to provide training, career development and promotion, 
as appropriate.
Elementis supports the wider fundamental human rights of its employees 
worldwide, as well as those of our customers and suppliers, and further 
details are set out in the Corporate responsibility report.
Employee communications and involvement
The Group has processes in place for communicating with all its 
employees. Employee communications include information about  
the performance of the Group, on major matters affecting their work, 
employment or workplace and to encourage them to get involved  
in social or community events. 
As is common practice, the Company operates savings based share 
option schemes in the US and UK to encourage employees to become 
shareholders and share in the success of the Group. Further details of 
these schemes are set out on page 90.
Going concern 
The directors have assessed the Group as a going concern, having given 
consideration to the factors likely to affect its future performance and 
development, the Group’s financial position and the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group, including the Group’s exposure to credit, 
liquidity and market risk and the mechanisms for dealing with these risks.
The Group’s net cash position at the year end of 2014 was $64.2 million 
and it has access to a syndicated revolving credit facility of $100 million, 
which expires in October 2018. There is a mechanism in the agreement 
for the facility to be increased by a further $100 million subject to  
other terms. 
Under this principal borrowing facility, the Group performs covenant tests 
for net debt:EBITDA ratio, interest cover and net worth. No breaches in 
the required covenant tests were reported during the year. The Group  
also uses various short and medium term forecasts to monitor anticipated 
future compliance and these include stress testing assumptions to identify 
the headroom on these covenant tests. 
The directors are satisfied that, after evaluating the covenant compliance 
modelling and the trading of the businesses, the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future 
as going concerns. For this reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these financial statements. 
Share capital
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares, as set out in 
Note 7 to the Parent company financial statements on page 96. All of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank equally in all 
respects. The rights attached to them, in addition to those conferred on 
their holders by law, are set out in the Company’s articles of association 
(the “Articles”). Other than those specific provisions set out in the Articles, 
there are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on the 
exercise of voting rights attached to them. From time to time the ESOT 
holds shares in the Company for the purposes of various share incentive 
plans and the rights attaching to them are exercised by independent 
trustees, who may take into account any recommendation by the 
Company. As at 31 December 2014 the ESOT held no shares in the 
Company (2013: nil). A dividend waiver is in place in respect of all  
shares that may become held by the ESOT.

Directors’ report Political donations 
The Group made no political donations during the year (2013: nil). 
 
A resolution is being proposed at the 2015 AGM to obtain authorisation 
from shareholders for the Company and its subsidiaries to make political 
donations or incur political expenditure up to a maximum annual limit of 
£50,000. Information about this proposal is explained in the Notice of 
Meeting accompanying this Annual Report.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Since 2008 Brian Taylorson, who is Finance Director and a trustee of  
the Elementis Group Pension Scheme, has been the only director who  
is in receipt of a conflict authorisation from the Company. The conflict 
authorisation enables him to continue to act as a trustee notwithstanding 
that this role could give rise to a situation in which there is a conflict of 
interest. The conflict authorisation is subject to annual review by the Board 
and was renewed during 2014 for another year. The terms of the conflict 
authorisation have remained unchanged since 2008 and details can be 
found in the 2012 Annual Report which is available from:  
www.elementisplc.com.
Other information
Information about financial risk management and exposure to financial 
market risks are set out in Note 21 to the Consolidated financial 
statements on page 79.
Annual General Meeting
The eighteenth AGM of the Company will be held on Wednesday  
22 April 2015. The Notice of Meeting is included in a separate  
document sent to shareholders.

Directors, Articles and purchase of shares
The directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK legislation and by  
the Company’s Articles. Rules about the appointment and replacement  
of directors are also set out in the Articles. 
The Board has the power conferred on it by shareholders to purchase  
its own shares and is seeking renewal of that power at the forthcoming 
AGM within the limits set out in the Notice of Meeting. 
Significant agreements – change of control
There are few significant agreements which the Company is party to  
that take effect, alter or terminate in the event of change of control of the 
Company. The Company is a guarantor under the Group’s $100 million 
revolving credit facility and, in the event of a change of control, any lender 
among the facility syndicate, of which there are four with commitments 
ranging from $20 million to $30 million, may withdraw from the facility  
and that lender’s participation in any loans drawn down are required  
to be repaid. 
Under David Dutro’s service contract with the Company compensation  
is payable to him equivalent to one year’s basic salary if he terminates his 
contract upon a change of control, provided that the Company has not 
first obtained a written agreement to be bound by his service contract 
from any successor in a change of control. There is no specific change of 
control provision in Brian Taylorson’s service contract with the Company.
The rules of the Company’s various share incentive schemes set out the 
consequences of a change of control of the Company on the rights of  
the participants under those schemes. Under the rules of the respective 
schemes, participants would generally be able to exercise their options  
on a change of control, provided that the relevant performance conditions 
have been satisfied and, where relevant, options are not exchanged for 
new options granted by an acquiring company.

Auditors
A resolution to appoint KPMG LLP as auditors of the Company will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 22 April 2015. Details 
about this proposal are set out in the Notice of Meeting accompanying 
this Annual Report.
Each director in office at the date of this Directors’ report confirms that:  
(a) so far as he/she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of  
which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and (b) he/she has taken  
all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
56 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Directors’ report
continued The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
consolidated and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare consolidated and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law  
they are required to prepare the Consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit  
or loss for that period. In preparing each of the consolidated and parent 
company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• For the Consolidated financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
• For the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
company financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position  
of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration 
report and Corporate governance report that complies with that law and 
those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors, all of whom are shown on page 26, confirm that to the  
best of their knowledge:
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.
• The management report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

57 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Directors’ responsibility statement Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Elementis plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 set out on pages 60 to 96. In our opinion: 
 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of  
the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material mis-statement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements,  
the risks of material mis-statement that had the greatest effect on  
our audit were as follows: 
Environmental provisions ($31.7 million)
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee report), page 64 (accounting policy)  
and page 76 (financial disclosures).
• The risk – As a chemicals company, the possibility of legal 
proceedings and environmental issues are inherent within the 
business. Elementis has numerous operating and legacy sites 
worldwide with provisions recognised for the future cost of the 
environmental issues. The amounts involved are potentially significant 
and future cash flows are uncertain whilst the application of 
accounting standards to determine the amount of liability to 
recognise or release, if any, for individual issues requires judgement. 
• Our response – Our audit procedures included, correspondence  
with the Group’s external consultants on the current situation  
and risks regarding all identified significant environmental issues.  
We obtained confirmation of the qualifications of the consultants.  
We inspected the consultants’ reports documenting the forecast 
future cash flows with regard to these issues. We compared the 
Company’s discount rate with external market data and assessed  
the unwinding of the provision recognised in finance costs.  
A sample, selected using statistical sampling methodology, of the 
cash flows incurred in the year relating to the provisions were agreed 
to the underlying documentation. We considered the consistency  
of forecast cash flows with previous estimates by comparing the 
most recent actual cash flows with the prior year external report.  
In addition, we inspected the Group litigation and compliance  
reports and held discussions with the Group’s internal counsel for all 
significant issues. We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures 
detailing significant provisions and contingent liabilities adequately  
disclose the potential liabilities of the Group.
Post retirement benefits ($65.8 million)
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee report), page 64 (accounting policy) 
and page 85 (financial disclosures).
• The risk – Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’s 
post-retirement defined benefit schemes and small changes in 
assumptions and estimates used to value the Group’s net pension 
deficit would have a significant effect on the results and financial 
position of the Group. 
• Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, testing a 
sample of the UK and US schemes’ membership data to the source 
documentation. We inspected the actuarial reports received by the 
Group and with the support of our own actuarial specialists, we then 
challenged the key assumptions applied to those data to determine 
the group’s net deficit, being the discount rate, inflation rate and 
mortality/life expectancy. This included a comparison of these key 
assumptions against externally derived data. Cash flows and funding 
arrangements have been agreed to the underlying documentation, 
whilst asset values have been agreed to external confirmations.  
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of IAS 19.
Tax asset recoverability ($56.4 million)
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee report), page 67 (accounting policy) 
and page 77 (financial disclosures).
• The risk – The group has now recognised significant tax assets  
in respect of Advance Corporation Tax and UK tax losses. There  
is inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future taxable profits 
which support the extent to which tax assets are or are not 
recognised. The recoverability of these amounts is determined  
by the existence of future taxable profits.
• Our response – Our audit procedures included inspecting the 
group’s taxable profit forecasts and assessing the assumptions  
in the forecasts. We used our own tax specialists to assist us in 
assessing the recoverability of the Advance Corporation Tax and  
tax losses against the forecast future taxable profits, taking into 
account the Group’s tax position, the amount and timing of forecast 
taxable profits, and our knowledge and experience of the application 
of relevant tax legislation. This included assessing the Group’s  
tax structures and confirming the official clearance received from  
HM Revenue and Customs, where relevant. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope  
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set  
at $7.0 million. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark  
of Group profit before taxation of $148.2 million (of which it represents  
4.7 per cent).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified 
mis-statements exceeding $0.35 million, in addition to other identified 
mis-statement that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 139 reporting components, we subjected 11 to audits 
for Group reporting purposes and 29 to specified risk focused audit 
procedures. The latter were not individually financially significant enough 
to require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but did present specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed.
58 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Elementis plc only The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following 
percentages of the group’s results:
Number of 
components
Group 
revenue
Group profit 
before tax
Group total 
assets
Audits for Group 
reporting purposes 11 92% 101% 85%
Specified risk focused 
audit procedures 29 0% -4% 8%
Total 40 92% 97% 93%
The remaining 8 per cent of total group revenue, 3 per cent of group profit 
before tax and 7 per cent of total group assets is represented by 99 of the 
reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 
2 per cent of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total 
Group assets. For the remaining components, we performed analysis at 
an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were 
no significant risks of material mis-statement within these.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from $0.4 million to $4.5 million, 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the 
components. The work on 9 of the 40 components was performed by 
component auditors and the rest by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team visited 2 component locations in the year. Video 
and telephone conference meetings were also held with these component 
auditors and all others that were not physically visited. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed 
in more detail, and any further work required by the Group audit team  
was then performed by the component auditor.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements. 
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which  
we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based  
on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency  
with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
mis-statement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that  
they consider that the annual report and financial statements  
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address  
matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made;
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 55, in relation to  
going concern; 
• the part of the Corporate governance statement on pages 28 to 30 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the 10 provisions of the 
2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement  
set out on page 57, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a  
true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website  
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely  
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published  
on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a,  
which are incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should  
be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report,  
the work we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Consolidated cash flow statement
for the year ended 31 December 2014 1 Accounting policies
Elementis plc is a company incorporated in the UK. The Group financial 
statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU (“adopted IFRS”). The Company has elected to prepare its 
parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.  
These are presented on pages 93 to 96.
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis 
except that derivative financial instruments and financial instruments held for 
trading or available for sale are stated at their fair value. Non-current assets 
held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. The preparation of financial statements requires the application 
of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, revenues and costs and related disclosures at the balance 
sheet date. The accounting policies set out below have been consistently 
applied across Group companies to all periods presented in these 
consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The rationale for adopting this basis is discussed in the Directors’ report  
on page 55.
Reporting currency 
As a consequence of the majority of the Group’s sales and earnings 
originating in US dollars or US dollar linked currencies, the Group has 
chosen the US dollar as its reporting currency. This aligns the Group’s 
external reporting with the profile of the Group, as well as with internal 
management reporting.
Critical accounting policies 
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgements 
or estimates and potentially result in materially different results under 
different assumptions or conditions. It is considered that the Group’s 
critical accounting policies are limited to those described below. The 
development of the estimates and disclosures related to each of these 
matters has been discussed by the Audit Committee.
( a )  P ro vis i ons 
   A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
   A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group  
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. 
In accordance with the Group’s environmental policy and applicable 
legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of 
contaminated land is recognised when the land is contaminated. 
Provisions for environmental issues are judgemental by their nature 
and more difficult to estimate when they relate to sites no longer 
directly controlled by the Group.
(b)  Pension and other post retirement benefits 
  In respect of the Group’s defined benefit schemes, the Group’s net 
obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned  
in return for their service in the current and prior periods, that benefit  
is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any 
plan assets is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the 
balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates 
approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. Pension and 
post retirement liabilities are calculated by qualified actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. Following the introduction of the revised 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits standard, the net interest on the defined 
benefit liability consists of the interest cost on the defined benefit 
obligation and the interest income on plan assets, both calculated  
by reference to the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit 
obligation at the start of the period.
   Any difference between the expected return on assets and that 
achieved is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
together with the difference from experience or assumption changes. 
The Group recognises all such remeasurements in the period in which 
they occur through the statement of comprehensive income. The 
Group also operates a small number of defined contribution schemes 
and the contributions payable during the year are recognised as 
incurred. Due to the size of the Group’s pension scheme assets  
and liabilities, relatively small changes in the assumptions can have  
a significant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement 
and on the pension liability recorded in the balance sheet.
 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements  
of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period. IFRS 10 Consolidated 
Financial Statements introduces new principles for control which focus  
on whether the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with entities and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over those entities. The Group’s consolidation scope 
and the accounting treatment of its investments in other entities was 
unaffected by the adoption of IFRS 10.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during a period are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Group adopted IFRS 3 (revised), Business Combinations, for 
business combinations where the acquisition date was on or after  
1 January 2010. This measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the  
fair value of the consideration transferred, the recognised amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination 
is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the 
acquiree, less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. Acquisition costs are accounted for as an expense  
in the period incurred.  For acquisitions that were made by the Group 
between its initial adoption of IFRS in 2005 and 31 December 2009 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the acquired. Transaction costs, other than those 
associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group 
incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised  
as part of the cost of the acquisition.
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, the Company has  
not restated business combinations that took place prior to the date  
of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004. As a consequence the Scheme  
of Arrangement entered into in 1998 whereby the Company acquired 
Elementis Holdings Limited and applied the true and fair override to 
account for the transaction as a merger has not been restated under IFRS.
64 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2014 Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and 
expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in 
the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Foreign currency 
(a)  Foreign currency transactions 
  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised  
in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value  
are translated at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value  
was determined.
(b)  Financial statements of foreign operations 
  The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill  
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated  
at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues  
and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average  
rates of exchange ruling for the relevant period. Exchange differences 
arising since 1 January 2004 on translation are taken to the translation 
reserve. They are recognised in the income statement upon disposal  
of the foreign operation. The Group may hedge a portion of the 
translation of its overseas net assets through pounds sterling and Euro 
borrowings. From 1 January 2005, the Group has elected to apply net 
investment hedge accounting for these transactions where possible. 
Where hedging is applied, the effective portion of the gain or loss on an 
instrument used to hedge a net investment is recognised in equity. Any 
ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement. 
Associates 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, 
but not control over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s share of the post-acquisition  
total recognised gains and losses and the net assets of associates on an 
equity accounted basis. Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its 
investment in an associate, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil 
and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that 
the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Freehold land is not 
depreciated. Leasehold property is depreciated over the period of the 
lease. Freehold buildings, plant and machinery, fixtures, fittings and 
equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight 
line basis. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
assessed at the reporting date. No depreciation is charged on assets 
under construction until the asset is brought into use. 
Estimates of useful lives of these assets are:
B ui l di ng s  1 0 – 5 0 y e a r s
Plant and machinery  2–20 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  2–20 years
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment  
is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the 
future economic benefits embodied within it will flow to the Group and  
its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day to day servicing  
of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement 
as incurred.
Management regularly considers whether there are any indications  
of impairment to carrying values of property, plant and equipment. 
Impairment reviews are based on risk adjusted discounted cash flow 
projections. Significant judgement is applied to the assumptions 
underlying these projections which include estimated discount rates, 
growth rates, future selling prices and direct costs. Changes to these 
assumptions could have a material impact on the financial position  
of the Group and on the result for the year.
Intangible assets
( a )  G o o d w ill 
  All business combinations since the transition to IFRS on 1 January 
2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect 
of business acquisitions that have occurred since the transition  
date, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the 
consideration given and the fair value of net identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. In respect of acquisitions 
prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, 
which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and tested annually  
for impairment. Changes to the assumptions used in impairment 
testing could have a material impact on the financial position of the 
Group and of the result for the year.
(b)  Research and development 
  Expenditure on research is recognised in the income statement  
as an expense as incurred. Expenditure on development where 
research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production  
of new or substantially improved products and processes is capitalised 
if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible  
and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. 
Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of materials, direct labour 
and an appropriate proportion of overheads less accumulated 
amortisation. Other development expenditure is recognised in the 
income statement as an expense as incurred.
(c)  Other intangible assets 
  Other intangible assets are stated at cost or when arising in a business 
combination, estimated fair value, less accumulated amortisation.
( d )  A m or t is at i on 
  Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless  
such lives are indefinite. On this basis there is no amortisation of 
intangible assets relating to brand. Goodwill is systematically tested  
for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets, 
comprising customer lists, trademarks, patents and non-compete 
clauses, are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range 
from 5–10 years.
Impairment 
The carrying amount of non-current assets other than deferred tax is 
compared to the asset’s recoverable amount at each balance sheet date 
where there is an indication of impairment. For goodwill, assets that have 
an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for 
use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. An 
impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset 
or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement.
65 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated  
to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the 
other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A cash generating unit is the 
smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that  
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or  
groups of assets. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Leased assets 
Leases which result in the Group receiving substantially all of the risks  
and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as finance leases.  
An asset held under a finance lease is recorded in the balance sheet and 
depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. 
Future instalments net of finance charges are included within borrowings. 
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge, 
which is allocated to each period to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining liability and charged to the income statement 
and reduction of the outstanding liability. Rental costs arising from 
operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the period  
of the lease.
Investments 
Investments comprising loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Government grants 
Grants against capital expenditure from government and other bodies are 
shown separately in the balance sheet. Such grants are released to the 
profit and loss account over the same period for which the relevant assets 
are depreciated.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price, less estimated costs of 
completion and selling expenses. Cost, which is based on a weighted 
average, includes expenditure incurred in acquiring stock and bringing it to 
its existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories 
and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads 
attributable to manufacture, based on normal operating capacity.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are non interest bearing and are stated at their nominal 
amount which is the original invoiced amount less provision made for bad 
and doubtful receivables. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based  
on the ageing of receivables and historical experience. Individual trade 
receivables are written off when management deem them no longer  
to be collectable.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset  
(a disposal group), is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will 
be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, 
it is available for immediate sale and is highly probable within one year.  
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal 
groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss.  
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business  
that represents a separate major line of business or geographic area  
of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, 
that has been disposed of has been abandoned or that meets the  
criteria to be classified as held for sale.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that  
are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is equal to the fair value  
at inception), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds, net 
of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is 
recognised over the terms of the borrowings using the effective interest 
rate method.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are non interest bearing borrowings and are initially 
measured at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Share capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares and share 
options are recognised as a deduction from equity. When share capital 
recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, 
including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from 
equity. Repurchased shares by the Company are classified as treasury 
shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure  
to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The Group does not hold  
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as 
trading instruments. Due to the requirement to measure the effectiveness 
of hedging instruments, changes in market conditions can result in the 
recognition of unrealised gains or losses on hedging instruments in the 
income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The 
gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately  
in the income statement. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge 
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the 
nature of the item being hedged. The fair value of forward exchange 
contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being  
the present value of the quoted forward price.
66 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued (a)  Cash flow hedges 
  Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on 
the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging 
reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
(b)  Fair value hedges 
  Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge  
of the variability in a fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the 
derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement. The 
carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair 
value that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally 
carried at cost or amortised cost) and any gains or losses on 
remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement 
(even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves).
Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group  
is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal,  
to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal 
retirement date. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are 
recognised if the Group has made an offer encouraging voluntary 
redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the  
number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
Revenue 
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and 
rebates. Revenue is recognised in the income statement only where there 
is evidence, usually in the form of a sales agreement, that the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
and where the collectability of revenue is reasonably assured.
Exceptional items 
The Group presents certain items separately as ‘exceptional’. These  
are items which in management’s judgement, need to be disclosed by 
virtue of their size and incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper 
understanding of the financial information. The determination of which 
items are separately disclosed as exceptional items requires a degree  
of judgement.
Other expenses 
Other expenses are administration costs incurred and paid by the  
Group’s pension schemes, which relate primarily to former employees  
of legacy businesses. 
Finance income and finance costs 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and 
changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value taken to the 
income statement. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using  
the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest expense  
on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, dividends on 
preference shares classified as liabilities, foreign currency losses and 
changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value taken to the 
income statement. All borrowing costs are recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.
Income tax 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except  
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the 
taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable  
in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that 
affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to  
the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner  
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable  
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an estimation of current  
tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences 
which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments. 
The Group operates in a number of countries in the world and is subject  
to many tax jurisdictions and rules. As a consequence the Group is 
subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can 
require several years to conclude. Management’s judgement is required  
to determine the total provision for income tax. Amounts are accrued 
based on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law and 
likelihood of settlement. However the actual tax liabilities could differ from 
the position and in such events an adjustment would be required in the 
subsequent period which could have a material impact. Tax benefits are 
not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable. 
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material  
tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full 
recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through 
negotiation. This evaluation requires judgements to be made including  
the forecast of future taxable income.
Share based payments 
The fair value of equity settled share options, cash settled shadow  
options and LTIP awards granted to employees is recognised as an 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options/awards.  
The fair value of the options/awards granted is measured using a binomial 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
options/awards were granted. The amount recognised as an employee 
expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options/awards 
that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving 
the threshold for vesting.

New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are 
not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2014, and have not 
been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements, but 
that become mandatory for the Group’s 2015 financial statements are  
as follows:
Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions – Amendments  
to IAS 19 
The amendments introduce a relief that will reduce the complexity  
and burden of accounting for certain contributions from employees  
or third parties.
The Group has not yet determined the potential impact of this new 
interpretation on the 2015 financial statements.
2 Operating segments
Business segments
The Group has determined its operating segments on the basis of those 
used for management, internal reporting purposes and the allocation  
of strategic resources. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8,  
the Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Board of directors.  
The three reportable segments, Specialty Products, Surfactants and 
Chromium, each have distinct product groupings and, with the exception 
of Surfactants which shares a common management structure with 
Specialty Products, separate management structures. Segment results, 
assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment  
and those that may be reasonably allocated from corporate activities. 
Presentation of the segmental results is on a basis consistent with those 
used for reporting Group results. Principal activities of the reportable 
segments are as follows:
Specialty Products –  Production of rheological and other specialty 
additives, compounded products and colourants.
Surfactants – Production of surface active ingredients.
Chromium – Production of chromium chemicals.
Inter-segment pricing is set at a level that equates to the manufacturing 
cost of the product plus a commercially appropriate mark up.
Unallocated items and those relating to corporate functions such as tax 
and treasury are presented in the tables below as central costs.

The Group has continued its separate presentation of certain items as exceptional. These are items which, in management’s judgement, need to  
be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information. 
Post employment benefits 
In the Netherlands the arrangement with the previous insurers of the defined benefit pension scheme came to an end on 31 December 2014 and  
the Group has contracted with a new industry wide pension fund for 2015 onwards. As a result, the plan will in future be accounted for as a defined 
contribution plan. Consequently, a deficit amount of $4.1 million relating to the original plan has been reversed in 2014 and the resulting credit recorded 
as an exceptional item. In addition, a legacy provision of $0.8 million relating to a 2005 claim made by a group of pensioners in the Netherlands has also 
been reversed and credited to Group profit because the matter has now been settled.
Environmental provisions 
The Group’s environmental provisions are calculated on a discounted basis, reflecting the time period over which spending is estimated to take place. 
As a result of a decline in the underlying market interest rates that are utilised in the discount rate calculation, it was concluded that the discount rate 
applied to future spending should be further reduced. This resulted in a charge of $1.9 million in 2014. 
Other adjustments 
The liquidations of a number of legacy subsidiaries no longer involved in Group activities resulted in one time credits totalling $3.3 million being 
recorded in Group profit.
Taxation – net credit of $53.5 million
Tax related items that result in a net credit of $53.5 million have also been recorded as exceptional items. The net credit arises from the recognition of 
UK advance corporation tax credits amounting to $42.0 million with an additional credit of $12.3 million in respect of further UK tax assets. The surplus 
ACT arose in respect of tax paid under the prior imputation system, which allowed for ACT credits to be offset against mainstream UK tax liabilities. The 
ACT not previously used under that imputation system had been written off at the time when there was no UK corporation tax liability anticipated in the 
foreseeable future. It is now the Board’s view that taxable profits will arise in the UK in the future and, as such, surplus ACT previously written off should 
now be recognised as a tax asset. Offsetting these credits is the tax cost of $0.8 million associated with the pre-tax exceptional items listed above.

The tax charge on profit represents an effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 18.5 per cent 
(2013:  21.6 per cent). As a Group involved in overseas operations, the amount of profitability in each jurisdiction, transfer pricing regulations and local 
tax rate changes, will affect future tax charges.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products $327.9 million and Elementis Surfactants $3.1 million.  
 There is no goodwill associated with Elementis Chromium.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of  
the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, 
growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates  
that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. In order to stress test the results over a wider 
range of conditions, management has expanded its testing to include discount rates based on a variety of equity risk premiums and different capital 
structures that reflect the potential variability of risk within the CGUs. In this exercise a range of discount rates from 7.0 per cent to 8.5 per cent (2013: 
10.2 per cent to 16.0 per cent) was used.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and 
extrapolates cash flows for the following seventeen years based on estimated growth rates of 0–2.5 per cent. The rates do not exceed the average  
long term growth rate for the relevant markets and also take into account potential, future capacity limitations for the Chromium business. Changes  
in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. The results of the impairment testing 
using the assumptions discussed show that there is no indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The brand intangibles represent the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the Deuchem, Fancor, Watercryl and Hi-Mar acquisitions.  
The Group considers these to have significant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate  
to assign these assets an indefinite useful life. Brand intangibles are tested annually for impairment using similar assumptions to the goodwill testing. 
The remaining intangible assets comprise of the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and non-compete clauses, which are being amortised  
over periods of 5–10 years.

Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued 21 Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Credit risk.
• Liquidity risk.
• Market risk.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group’s  
risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to  
monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and  
the Group’s activities.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and 
reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in its 
oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results  
of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation and 
arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s customer 
base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk. No single customer 
accounts for a significant proportion of the Group’s revenue.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. 
The Group’s review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, 
which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark 
creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The  
main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component 
established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined 
based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through a treasury policy that imposes graduated limits on the amount of funds that can be deposited  
with counterparties by reference to the counterparties’ credit ratings, as defined by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. Management does not expect  
any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity  
is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group’s funding policy is to have committed borrowings  
in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period. At the year end the Group had  
$118.1 million (2013: $121.0 million) of undrawn committed facilities, of which $100.0 million expires after more than one year. 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value  
of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. All such transactions 
are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective 
functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the US dollar and the Euro. The Group hedges up to 100 per cent of current and forecast trade 
receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency. The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most  
with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
79 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 21 Financial risk management (continued)
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily  
US dollar, but also Euro and GBP. This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into. In respect of other monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign 
currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances. The Group’s investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US dollar 
denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of a subsidiary’s net assets.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest profile.  
The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Group’s borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
Other market price risk 
Equity price risk arises from available for sale equity securities held within the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations. In respect of the US 
schemes, management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations. The primary goal of  
the Group’s investment strategy is to maximise investment returns, without excessive risk taking, in order to meet partially the Group’s unfunded benefit 
obligations; management is assisted by external advisors in this regard. In respect of the UK scheme, the investment strategy is set by the trustees  
and the Board is kept informed.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sale requirements; such contracts are not 
settled net.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development  
of the business. The Board monitors the return on operating capital employed (“ROCE”) both including and excluding goodwill, as defined on page 15.   
The Group’s target is to achieve a ROCE (including goodwill) in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. 
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Group’s savings related share option schemes. At present, employees, 
including executive directors hold 0.3 per cent (2013: 0.3 per cent) of ordinary shares, or 1.7 per cent (2013: 2.0 per cent) assuming that all outstanding 
options vest or are exercised.
Current dividend policy is to pay a progressive dividend of approximately one third of earnings per share before exceptional items. Additionally if the 
Group finishes the year in a net balance sheet cash position, and there are no immediate investment plans for that cash, the Group may recommend  
an additional special dividend of up to 50 per cent of the net cash amount. These dividend policies remain under review to ensure that they remain 
appropriate to the circumstances and strategy of the Group.

Basis for determining fair values
The Group measures fair values in respect of financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 13, using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects  
the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:
Level 1: Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs.
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
Derivatives (level 2)
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is 
estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract 
using a risk-free interest (based on government bonds).
Non-derivatives financial liabilities (level 2)
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the  
reporting date.
Trade and other receivables, Trade and other payables (level 3)
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the 
reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an 
adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows:
2014
per cent
2013
per cent
Borrowings 1.0–2.8 1.8–2.4
The Group categorises its trade and other receivables and payables, excluding derivatives, within level 3 and all other financial instruments, including 
cash, loans and derivatives within level 2. At both 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 there was no difference between the carrying value  
and fair value of financial instruments.

The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits for the majority of employees 
and executive directors. At 31 December 2014 the main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands were of the defined benefit type, the benefit being 
based on number of years of service and either the employee’s final remuneration or the employee’s average remuneration during a period of years 
before retirement. The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance 
sheet. In the Netherlands the arrangement with the previous insurers of the defined benefit pension scheme came to an end on 31 December 2014 and 
the Group has contracted with a new industry wide pension fund for 2015 onwards. As a result, the plan will in future be accounted for as a defined 
contribution plan. Details of an exceptional credit of $4.1 million relating to this change can be found in Note 5.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post retirement medical benefit (“PRMB”) scheme in the US. The entitlement to these benefits is usually 
based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period. 
Other employee benefit schemes included in the table below relate to 2 unfunded pension schemes and a long term service award scheme in Germany 
and a special benefits programme for a small number of former employees of the Eaglescliffe plant.

All equities, bonds and liquidity funds have quoted prices in active markets. Other assets include insured annuities, an insurance fund and various swap products.
Within the UK pension scheme, the current asset allocation is approximately 46 per cent in a liability matching fund consisting of gilts (fixed interest and index 
linked), bonds, cash and swaps and 54 per cent in an investment fund that includes various equity and equity like funds. The aim of the trustees is to manage 
the risk relative to the liabilities associated with the scheme’s investments through a combination of diversification, inflation protection and hedging of risk 
(currency, interest rate and inflation risk). The US scheme currently has over 70 per cent of its asset value invested in a range of equity funds designed to  
target higher returns and thus reduce the pension deficit, with the balance invested in fixed income bonds and cash. The strategy is that as the deficit reduces,  
a greater proportion of investments will be made into liability matching funds. The Dutch scheme is fully insured with 2 registered insurance companies  
who guarantee the accrued nominal benefits, thus removing the downside risks to the Group, and who also decide the investment strategy. The assets  
in the plan currently consist mainly of government bonds.

The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 3.65 per cent (2013: 4.45 per cent) per annum and a health care cost trend of  
6.5 per cent (2013: 6.5 per cent) per annum for claims pre age 65 reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2020 (2013: 4.5 per cent). Actuarial valuations 
of retirement benefit plans in other jurisdictions have either not been updated for IAS 19 purposes or disclosed separately because of the costs involved 
and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.
At 31 December 2014, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations for the major schemes was as follows:
UK: 14 years
US: 12 years
The Netherlands: 19 years
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increased/decreased by 0.5 per cent Decreased/increased by 8 per cent
Rate of inflation Increased/decreased by 0.5 per cent Increased/decreased by 5 per cent
Rate of salary growth Increased/decreased by 0.5 per cent Increased/decreased by 1 per cent
Rate of mortality Increased by 1 year Increased by 4 per cent
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement of the defined obligation following a change in a particular assumption in isolation, 
assuming no other changes in market conditions. 
89 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 24 Share based payments
The Company has several share incentive schemes for certain directors and employees of the Group.
A Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted in 2008 (amended in 2010) (“2010 LTIP”) for selected senior executives including the executive directors, 
business presidents and general counsel. Awards of nil cost share options or conditional share awards are normally made annually and the maximum 
value of any grant to an individual is 1.5 times the CEO’s basic salary. Awards vest after three years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance 
conditions over a 3 year period. Vested awards are then exercisable for up to 7 years, subject to the rules of the plan. For US participants  
(for tax reasons) the default practice is for options to be exercised at the date of vesting.
As explained in the Directors’ remuneration report (“DRR”) on pages 36 and 37, the Company will be submitting for shareholder approval at the 2015 
AGM proposed amendments to the rules of the 2010 LTIP. Further details can be found in the DRR as well as in the explanatory notes to the Notice  
of 2015 AGM accompanying this Annual Report. 
For other executives, shareholders approved at the 2012 AGM an approved and unapproved executive share option scheme (“2012 ESOS”). This 
scheme replaced the previous approved and unapproved executive share option scheme (“2003 ESOS”) which expired in 2013. The last awards made 
under the 2003 scheme were in 2012. Under the 2003 and 2012 ESOS, options are usually granted annually to purchase shares in the Company at  
an exercise price per share based on the Company’s average mid-market closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant with no 
discount applied. The number of options that are granted are based on a percentage of the participant’s basic salary. Options vest after 3 years and 
are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions. Vested options are then exercisable for up to 7 years, subject to the rules of the schemes. 
The Company also operates a 2008 UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is a save as you earn (“SAYE”) scheme, under which UK 
employees can enter into contracts to save currently up to a maximum of £500 per month with a bank or building society for a period of 3 or 5 years 
and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options. The savings limit was increased 
in 2014 from £250 per month following the Government’s announcement to raise the maximum savings limit. The option price is the average mid-
market closing share price over the 5 working days preceding the invitation date, discounted by 20 per cent. Options may be exercised typically within 
6 months following the end of the savings period. A similar scheme exists for US employees. Under the 2008 US Sharesave Scheme, US employees 
can enter into contracts to save up to a maximum of $2,000 per month with a bank or similarly approved institution, for a period of 2 years, and use the 
proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options. The option price is the average mid-market 
closing share price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15 per cent. Options may be exercised typically within 3 months following the end of the 
savings period. Options granted under the 2 savings based schemes are held subject to the rules of the schemes.
Options were valued (as shown in the table below) using the binomial option pricing model. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions  
used in the calculations are as follows:
2014 2013
Fair value per option (pence) 154.0 144.3
Expected volatility (per cent) 33.4 39.3
Risk free rate (per cent) 1.5 0.5
Expected dividend yield (per cent) 2.0 2.0
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 5 years. The expected life used 
in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. The Group recognised total expenses of $2.5 million (2013: $3.4 million) related to share based payment transactions during the year.

The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently 
participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme, up to a specified maximum amount. The maximum amount of the guarantee  
is that which is needed (at the time the guarantee is called on) to bring the scheme’s funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities, calculated in 
accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004. This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund (“PPF”) guarantee, as having  
such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

per share (2013: 5.50 cents) for the year ended 31 December 2014 and a special dividend of 6.95 cents per share (2013: 5.86 cents). The total dividend 
for the year, excluding the special dividend, is 8.45 cents per share (2013: 8.07 cents) and 15.40 cents per share (2013: 13.93 cents) including the 
special dividend.
The amount payable for the final dividend and special dividend, based on the anticipated number of qualifying ordinary shares registered on the record 
date, is $58.7 million.

remuneration report on pages 35 to 54.
29 Contingent liabilities
As is the case with other chemical companies, the Group occasionally receives notices of litigation relating to regulatory and legal matters. A provision 
is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that the probability of a material 
outflow is not remote, the Group would disclose a contingent liability. No contingent liability was considered to be reportable at 31 December 2014.

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Parent company statutory accounts 1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial 
statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with UK GAAP and under the historical cost accounting rules. Under 
section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from  
the requirement to present its profit and loss account. As permitted by 
FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures the Company has not disclosed 
transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted  
rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains 
and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments 
Investments in Group undertakings are included in the balance sheet at 
cost less impairment.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a 
liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised  
and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends  
that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the  
financial statements. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Company participates in the Elementis Group defined benefit pension 
scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the 
Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying 
assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis 
and as required by FRS 17, it has treated the scheme as if it were a 
defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the  
profit and loss account represents the contributions payable for the year.
Taxation 
Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting, in respect of all 
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. Advance corporation 
tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation tax is carried 
forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable within debtors  
as appropriate.
 
Share based payments 
The fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised as  
an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Where the Company 
grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it 
recognises in its individual financial statements an increase in the cost of 
investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based 
payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries’ financial statements, with 
the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. The fair value 
is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value 
of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due  
to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
In accordance with FRS 25, financial instruments issued by the  
Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet  
the following two conditions:
a)  They include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver 
cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or 
financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Company.
b)  Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s  
own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity 
instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed 
number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that the definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are 
classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes 
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in 
these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium 
account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part 
of interest payable and similar charges. Finance payments associated with 
financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders’ funds,  
are dealt with as appropriations in the reconciliation of movements in 
shareholders’ funds.
2 Profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
not presented its own profit and loss account. A loss of £2.2 million (2013: 
£2.3 million loss) is dealt with in the financial statements of the Company.

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 6 Retirement benefit obligations
The Company is a member of a multi-employer pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. Because the Company is unable  
to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”, the scheme 
has been accounted for as if the scheme was a defined contribution scheme. The net deficit in the scheme at 31 December 2014 was £18.2 million 
(2013: £39.9 million).
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 September 2014 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 December 2014 by a qualified 
actuary. The contribution for the year was £0.1 million (2013: £0.1 million).
Details of a guarantee given by the Company in respect of current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently participating in the pension 
scheme are set out in Note 10 in the Company’s financial statements.

10 Related party transactions
The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently 
participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme, up to a specified maximum amount. The maximum amount of the guarantee  
is that which is needed (at the time the guarantee is called on) to bring the scheme’s funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities, calculated in 
accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004. This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund (“PPF”) guarantee, as having  
such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

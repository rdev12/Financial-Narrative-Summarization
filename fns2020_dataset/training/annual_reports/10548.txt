Results 
The Group has achieved record results 
for the year ended 30 September 2012 
ahead of market expectations and has 
strengthened its position as a provider of 
Engineering Services to UK infrastructure.
Proﬁt before income tax was up 22% to 
£10.0m (2011: £8.2m) on Group revenue of 
£337.4m (2011: £352.8m). Adjusted earnings 
per share increased by 43% to 13.9p (2011: 
9.7p). Basic earnings per share increased 
by 259% to 7.9p (2011: 2.2p).
Results for the year are stated after charging 
exceptional costs of £1.1m (2011: £5.2m) 
and a loss of £2.4m from the discontinued 
operation, C&A Pumps Ltd, which was 
sold in November 2012 for a nominal 
consideration. These amounts have been 
excluded from the adjusted ﬁnancial results 
to show the underlying performance of the 
business. The exceptional costs in the 
period relate to the planned scale down 
of Specialist Building and the integration 
of our rail business following the acquisition 
of Amco.
It is particularly pleasing that Engineering 
Services revenue grew by 24% to £214.1m 
(201 1: £172.8m), with operating proﬁt prior to 
exceptional items and amortisation up 28% 
to £9.6m (201 1: £7 .5m), an increase in margin 
to 4.5% from 4.3%. Both our Nuclear and Rail 
businesses, which represent over 60% of 
our Engineering Services activity, performed 
strongly and have growing order books for 
both the new ﬁnancial year and beyond.
In Specialist Building, our focus on selective 
niche markets in the South, has delivered 
increased operating proﬁt of £2.1m (2011: 
£1.9m) prior to exceptional items and an 
improvement in margin to 1.7% from 1.1% 
on revenue of £123.1m (2011: £178.9m).
The Group has achieved record results 
for the year ended 30 September 2012 
ahead of market expectations.

Summary
/  The Group is successfully positioned 
as a provider of engineering services 
to key clients in the UK’s Energy, 
Environmental and Infrastructure 
markets, and has been reclassiﬁed 
on the London Stock Exchange as 
a Business Support Services company. 
/  Both our Nuclear and Rail 
businesses, which represent over 
60% of our Engineering Services 
activity, performed strongly. 
/  Our acquisition of Amco in February 
2011 has proved highly successful, 
delivering results ahead of our 
expectations and generating cash. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 09

Review of 
operations
Group 
overview
The Group's contracted order book at 
30 September 2012 stood at £331m (2011: 
£286m), a 16% increase from one year ago, 
with the Engineering Services order book 
up 31% to £235m (2011: £179m). 
The Group has reduced net debt to 
£5.5m (2011: £6.8m) comprising a loan 
of £7.5m (2011: £12.5m) and cash of 
£2.0m (2011: £5.7m). 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend 
at 2.10p per share, increasing the full year 
dividend by 5% to 3.15p (2011: 3.00p). 
The dividend will be paid on 4 March 2013 
to shareholders on the register as at 
1 February 2013. The dividend is 4.4x 
(2011: 3.2x) covered by adjusted 
earnings per share. 
Outlook
The Group is successfully positioned as 
a provider of engineering services to key 
clients in the UK’s Energy, Environmental 
and Infrastructure markets, and has been 
reclassiﬁed on the London Stock Exchange 
as a Business Support Services company. 
Last year, the Board declared its ambition 
to grow turnover to over £500m by 2014, 
through both organic growth and selective 
acquisitions, with targets that Engineering 
Services will account for at least 70% of 
Group revenue and that the Group operating 
margin will exceed 3%. These results and 
our strong forward order book demonstrate 
that the Group is well placed to achieve 
these targets. 
Our acquisition of Amco in February 2011 
has proved highly successful, delivering 
results ahead of our expectations and 
generating cash such that we have now 
repaid 50% of the £15m term loan taken out 
for the acquisition. Our reducing net debt 
and gearing of 61% (2011: 76%) together 
with our interest cover of over 16x provides 
the Group with funding ﬂexibility should 
further suitable acquisition opportunities 
be identiﬁed. 
Our Engineering Services operations continue 
to focus on securing further sustainable 
framework positions, concentrating on areas 
of non-discretionary spend. In Specialist 
Building, our businesses are delivering 
improved operating margins as they target 
the stable markets of High Quality Residential, 
New Build Affordable Housing and Retail in 
the South where the Group has particular 
expertise and experience. 
The Board believes our key markets 
and framework positions provide good and 
continuing opportunities through 2013 and 
beyond and that the Group is well positioned 
to deliver further proﬁtable growth.

Chief Executive’s review
Brian May, Chief Executive
The Group has made further progress in 
growing its Engineering Services business 
which focuses on supporting the maintenance 
and renewal of UK infrastructure increasing 
both revenue and operating proﬁt. Specialist 
Building has increased its operating margin 
in the year and is concentrated on 
sustainable markets in the South.
Engineering Services
Renew provides integrated engineering 
services nationwide focusing on the highly 
regulated markets of Energy, Environmental 
and Infrastructure. The Group concentrates 
on the renewal and maintenance of essential 
operational assets delivered through its 
multidisciplinary workforce employed 
by our strong local and independently 
branded businesses. 
Our strategy is delivering both strong 
ﬁnancial results and growth. Revenue 
in Engineering Services grew by 24% to 
£214.1m (2011: £172.8m) and now accounts 
for 63% of ongoing Group revenue and over 
90% of operating proﬁt. Operating margin 
increased to 4.5% (2011: 4.3%). 
The Engineering Services order book is 
growing strongly and is underpinned by 
62 frameworks, an increase of 22% in the 
year, of which 45 are for maintenance work. 
Non-discretionary orders account for 95% 
of the £235m (2011: £179m) order book 
which has grown by 31% in the year. 
Our order book in Energy grew by 51% to 
£124m (201 1: £82m), by 14% in Environmental 
to £33m (2011: £29m) and by 15% in 
Infrastructure to £78m (2011: £68m). 
It remains the Group's strategy to grow its 
Engineering Services both organically and by 
targeting earnings enhancing acquisitions in 
sustainable markets. The recent appointment 
of Paul Scott, Managing Director of our 
Nuclear business, as Engineering Services 
Director, will assist in developing our 
integrated offering to these markets. 
Our strategy is delivering both 
strong ﬁnancial results and growth.
A year of further progress

Review of 
operations
Group 
overview
Energy
Renew operates nationally in the nuclear, 
renewable and traditional power generation 
sectors where work concentrates on the 
critical planned and reactive maintenance 
and asset renewal programmes. Much 
of the work is delivered through our 
24 framework agreements.
In Nuclear, Renew operates across 
the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
(“NDA”) estate in high hazard reduction 
programmes, decommissioning and in 
operational asset care. We are strongly 
positioned with engagements on 9 licenced 
nuclear sites that command around 70% of 
the NDA’s £3bn annual expenditure. Within 
that budget, over 55% of the spend is allocated 
to Sellaﬁeld, where we have been active for 
over 60 years and where we are the principal 
provider of mechanical and electrical services. 
Our revenue at Sellaﬁeld grew by 12% 
in the last twelve months and has grown 
by over 150% in the last 7 years. All of 
our 2012/13 revenue budget in Nuclear 
is already secured in an order book that 
has grown by 51% to £109m (2011: £72m).
Operational asset care is vital to Sellaﬁeld 
which derives substantial revenue from 
spent fuel management and reprocessing. 
For the last 15 years we have carried out 
production operations support under the 
Multi Discipline Site Works framework. 
Since the year end, we have again been 
appointed as one of three participants to 
deliver work packages worth up to £280m 
over 4 years commencing in April 2013. 
During the year, we were also appointed 
as the sole mechanical and electrical partner 
to Stobbarts on the £58m Site Wide Asset 
Care framework which runs until April 2016. 
“ We are committed to the 
safety of our employees and 
those who work with us 
evidenced in the record 
reduction in the Group’s 
Accident Incidence Rate 
during 2012, now at its lowest 
ﬁgure in 7 years, a reduction 
of 87% over that period.”

Key Performance Indicators
The Directors have established a number of key performance indicators which 
they use to measure and monitor the performance of the Group in a number of 
different areas. 
The order targets have been established as part of the Board’s drive to improve the 
quality and sustainability of the Group’s workload and to support the reliability of ﬁnancial 
performance. The safety record improvement target is set annually and achievement of this 
target is an essential component of the bonus scheme for each Director and senior manager 
within the Group.
Energy continued
During the year, in high hazard risk 
reduction, we were appointed as sole 
participant to the 4 year £26m Bulk Sludge 
Retrievals Framework and we deliver a wide 
range of decommissioning tasks through 
the Decommissioning Framework Agreement 
which is secured until 2015. The Evaporator 
D programme is the UK’s largest current 
nuclear project where our mechanical and 
electrical services contract has recently 
been extended to provide over £50m of work 
through to completion in 2015. We are able 
to secure positions on these highly sensitive 
programmes due to the large number of 
our employees who carry the highest 
level of site security clearance.
Our predominant position on the site makes 
us a partner of choice on major programmes. 
A good example of this is our appointment 
as a Supply Chain Partner to Morgan Sindall 
which recently announced its appointment as 
preferred delivery partner for a potential £1. 1bn 
contract delivering a range of essential services 
at the Sellaﬁeld site, under the Infrastructure 
Strategic Alliance. These services will include 
the maintenance of steam and electricity 
generation, water supply, chemical storage 
and distribution, drainage networks and 
all transport infrastructure at the site.
The Group undertakes work at 8 other nuclear 
licenced sites across the UK including work 
on the 2 year decommissioning and demolition 
contract associated with a redundant Fuel 
Manufacturing Facility at Springﬁelds for 
Westinghouse. We continue to support the 
consortia involved in the Nuclear New Build 
programme where we provide skills in 
stainless steel fabrications.
We continue to provide support at some of 
the UK’s largest traditional power stations, 
where we provide maintenance services 
under 7 framework agreements. There 
are also increasing opportunities in the 
renewables market and we are active in 
investment programmes in biomass and 
hydro generation technologies where 
we are currently delivering initial works 
on two 3 year hydroelectric frameworks 
with Scottish Water and Welsh Water. 
Environmental
The Group has extensive expertise in water 
infrastructure development and operational 
maintenance, ﬂood alleviation, river and coastal 
defences and land remediation. A large portion 
of work in this sector is procured under long 
term framework agreements. 
In Water, we continue to work for 
Northumbrian Water under the 10 year 
AMP5 programme. In addition to carrying 
out works under the major waste water 
project framework we now have a position on 
7 non-discretionary maintenance frameworks 
which accounts for 80% of ongoing activity. 
In particular we have developed specialist 
skills in providing services to the existing trunk 
mains network both in cleaning and general 
maintenance. This shift in the proﬁle of our 
work in the Water sector has led to a doubling 
of our order book at the year end and an 
improvement in margins which we expect 
to build upon in 2012/13.
In Land Remediation, we extended 
our 16 year relationship with National Grid 
where we were reappointed to 3 remediation 
frameworks nationally. Also in the year we 
were appointed to the Environment Agency’s 
National Contaminated Land Remediation 
Contractors framework which runs to 2015. 
Ongoing work for the Environment Agency 
is delivered through 7 minor works and 
river maintenance frameworks for civil, 
mechanical and electrical services.
Infrastructure
The Group continues to access the rail, 
highways and industrial markets across 
the UK where work is underpinned 
by 17 framework agreements for the 
delivery of integrated civil, mechanical 
and electrical engineering services.
The majority of activity this year has been 
in Rail where we have seen a 23% increase 
in our order book to £7 4m (201 1: £60m). Our 
focus is on the renewal, refurbishment and 
maintenance of operational assets for clients, 
including our largest client Network Rail where 
we remain a leading provider of engineering 
maintenance works. These works include 
off-track renewal and maintenance of line 
side structures including tunnels, bridges and 
viaducts, mechanical and electrical installations 
and the delivery of a wide range of planned 
and reactive maintenance services. We have 
particular skills in managing complicated 
tunnel refurbishment projects and earlier 
this year completed our largest individual 
project at Ore Tunnel near Hastings.
During the year our existing Asset 
Management frameworks were renewed 
for up to 5 years and extended by a new 
framework appointment in Scotland. These 
frameworks, along with our established 
Buildings and Civils Delivery Partnership 
framework agreements, where we have 
seen increased spend, have reinforced 
our position with Network Rail as the only 
provider delivering these services nationally.
The recent McNulty Report recommends 
the devolution of responsibility so that 
decisions are made as close to customers 
and the market as possible. Network Rail 
has commenced implementation of these 
recommendations by appointing management 
responsible for the 10 operating routes. As the 
only national provider of off-track maintenance 
of existing assets, with 12 local depots spread 
across the country, these initiatives play 
to our strengths and we are well placed 
to support our key Rail client as these 
changes are implemented. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13

Group 
overview
Specialist Building
The Group’s Specialist Building activities are 
focused in the South targeting the High Quality 
Residential, New Build Affordable Housing and 
Retail markets. These niche markets, in which 
we have particular experience and expertise, 
provide sustainable opportunities for the 
future. Following our decision to withdraw 
from public sector building markets in the 
North, Specialist Building revenue reduced 
as expected to £123.1m (2011: £178.9m) 
whilst delivering operating proﬁts up 11% 
at £2.1m (2011: £1.9m) and increasing 
operating margin to 1.7% (2011: 1.1%), 
thereby justifying our strategy.
In High Quality Residential, the Group's 
activities are focused in and around London 
where the market remains strong with over 
£400m of current opportunities identiﬁed. 
Our experience in this sector as a leading 
quality provider, with particular skills in 
providing the temporary works engineering 
solutions to extend properties below ground, 
continues to prove a differentiator and 
provides opportunity for early involvement 
in schemes. 
In New Build Affordable Housing, the 
Group has recently been appointed to a 
new framework with Catalyst Housing where, 
as one of 7 providers, we will access up to 
an advertised £350m of projects over the 
next 4 years. The Group now has a position 
on 14 framework agreements with leading 
Housing Associations which provide 
access to a £700m annual market. 
In Retail, there remains good visibility of 
opportunities with new clients including 
Morrisons and Odeon Cinemas. We 
continue our 24 year relationship with 
Tesco and remain the preferred ﬁt out 
contractor for Cineworld.
People
We are committed to the safety of our 
employees and those who work with us 
evidenced in the record reduction in the 
Group’s Accident Incidence Rate during 
2012, now at its lowest ﬁgure in 7 years, 
a reduction of 87% over that period.
The strong ﬁnancial results demonstrate 
the skills and determination of all our 
employees. The success of the Group 
depends on our employees continued 
hard work and commitment, for which the 
Board would like to express its gratitude.
Summary
Renew provides engineering services to 
support the essential ongoing operations of 
critical UK infrastructure through experienced 
local delivery teams. The Group is focused 
on developing its maintenance, refurbishment 
and renewal activities in its target regulated 
sectors where sustainable revenue is 
generated through its core maintenance 
and renewal frameworks with major clients, 
many of which the Group has worked 
with for a number of years. 
Our recent success in key framework 
appointments in Nuclear, Rail and Water 
together with our strong list of future 
opportunities demonstrates that the 
Group is pursuing the right strategy, 
evidenced by our growing forward order 
book and our record ﬁnancial results.

Financial review
John Samuel, Group Finance Director
Results
Group revenue from ongoing operations 
was £337.4m (2011: £352.8m) with a proﬁt 
before tax of £10.0m (2011: £8.2m) prior to 
exceptional items and amortisation charges 
and the loss from the discontinued operation. 
A tax charge of £1.7m (201 1: £2.4m), resulted 
in a proﬁt after tax for the year of £8.3m 
(201 1: £5.8m) prior to exceptional items and 
amortisation charges and the loss from the 
discontinued operation. After tax, exceptional 
items and amortisation, the proﬁt for the 
year from continuing operations was 
£7.1m (2011: £1.4m).
Exceptional items
During the year, the Group incurred £1.1m 
of exceptional redundancy and restructuring 
costs. £0.6m of these relate to Specialist 
Building where further staff reductions have 
been made to align this business segment 
with the current trading environment. £0.5m 
relates to Engineering Services, primarily in 
respect of the integration of our rail businesses 
following the acquisition of Amco Group 
Holdings Limited. Additionally, £0.5m (201 1: 
£0.4m) of amortisation charges were incurred.
Discontinued operation
During the year, the Board decided to 
close the business of C&A Pumps Ltd. 
It had become increasingly difﬁcult for this 
small business to trade proﬁtably following 
changes to Water industry framework 
arrangements in AMP5. C&A has been 
accounted for as a discontinued operation 
in the year to 30 September 2012 and a loss 
of £2.4m, including £0.3m of redundancy 
costs and £1.0m of non-cash asset write 
downs including £0.8m of goodwill, 
has been incurred.
Cash 
In 2011, the Group arranged a £15m 
three year term loan to fund the acquisition 
of Amco, also using £7 .2m of its own cash 
resources. During the year, £5.0m of 
repayments have been made reducing 
the loan balance to £7.5m at the year 
end. Our cash balances stood at £2.0m 
(2011: £5.7m) at the year end after £1.9m 
of non-recurring outﬂows associated 
with the restructuring costs and the 
C&A closure. As a result, the Group’s 
net debt position as at 30 September 2012 
was £5.5m (201 1: £6.8m). The Group has 
complied with the covenants associated 
with this loan.
Working capital
As a result of the reduction in revenue 
in Specialist Building, amounts received 
in advance from construction contract 
customers reduced from £5.7m to £1.9m. 
As the balance of the Group’s revenue 
continues to shift towards Engineering 
Services, the positive working capital 
characteristics of Specialist Building have 
been diluted. This reduced level of activity 
in Specialist Building has also resulted 
in a reduction in the total quantum of 
current assets and current liabilities with 
trade debtors and trade payables each 
reducing by around £11m. 
Pension schemes
The IAS 19 valuation of the Lovell Pension 
Scheme, which was closed to new members 
in 2000, has resulted in a small deﬁcit of 
£0.6m (2011: £0.1m). In 2011, the Board, 
in conjunction with the Trustees of the 
Lovell Scheme, completed a buy-in of part 
of the pensioner liabilities of the scheme. This 
measure, which was completed without any 
further cash contribution to the scheme by 
the Group, has reduced the risks associated 
with those liabilities and, at the year end, the 
annuities purchased represented 35% of the 
scheme’s total liabilities. In accordance with 
the scheme speciﬁc funding requirements 
of the Pensions Act 2005 and, following the 
triennial valuation of the scheme which was 
carried out as at 31 March 2009, the Board 
has an agreement with the Trustees of the 
scheme on the level of future contributions 
which are currently approximately £3.0m 
per annum inclusive of costs. The next 
triennial valuation is being carried out as 
at 31 March 2012. Preliminary indications 
are that current levels of contributions 
will not change materially.
The Group has reduced its net debt by 19%.

Group 
overview
The IAS 19 valuation of the Amco Pension 
Scheme shows a surplus of £1.8m (2011: 
£1.1m). In accordance with the scheme 
speciﬁc funding requirements of the 
Pensions Act 2005 and, following the 
triennial valuation of the scheme which 
was carried out as at 31 December 2010, 
the Board has an agreement with the 
Trustees of the scheme on the level of 
future contributions which are currently 
£0.2m per annum inclusive of costs. 
The next triennial valuation will be 
carried out as at 31 December 2013. 
Due to the impact of actuarial losses 
measured in these schemes in the year, 
£2.6m (2011: £3.9m), net of deferred tax, 
has been charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income, reducing the 
Group’s net assets accordingly. 
Taxation
A deferred tax asset included in non-current 
assets of £2.9m (2011: £3.3m) is carried in 
the balance sheet, which principally results 
from the likely future utilisation of tax losses. 
A deferred tax liability related to the Amco 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme of £0.4m 
(2011: £0.3m) is shown in non-current 
liabilities. The remaining deferred tax liability 
of £0.6m (2011: £0.8m) relates to fair value 
adjustments arising on the Amco acquisition.
The UK tax charge on proﬁts for the year is 
£0.3m (2011: £nil). The deferred tax charge of 
£1.2m (2011: £1.6m) is attributable primarily to 
the deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes. The total 
tax charge for the year of £1.3m (201 1: £1.2m) 
represents an effective Group tax rate of 
15.5% (201 1: 46%). Only the £0.3m current 
year charge is payable.
The Group has material tax losses to carry 
forward and the rate of corporation tax 
payable in each of the next few years is 
expected to remain below the headline rate.
Distributable proﬁts
The distributable proﬁts of Renew Holdings 
plc stood at £11.2m (2011: £11.6m) enabling 
the Board to recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 
2.10p (2011: 2.00p) per share bringing the 
total for the year to 3.15p (2011: 3.00p), 
an increase of 5%.

Review of operations
In Specialist Building our work targets sustainable 
markets in the South which have good visibility of 
earnings. In these markets, our activities concentrate 
on opportunities where the Group has established 
expertise and extensive experience.
Specialist Building
How we target the Specialist Building market
Our Specialist Building operations are focused on the High 
Quality Residential, New Build Affordable Housing and Retail 
markets in the South of England.

New Build Affordable Housing
Opportunity
In 2010 the Government announced its 
commitment to deliver approximately 
80,000 homes through the Affordable 
Homes Programme. The South has been 
allocated over 50% of the Affordable 
Homes Programme investment of £1.8bn 
where the majority of work will be 
undertaken for Housing Association 
clients.
7
Our response
The Group is a leading provider with 
extensive expertise in delivering new build 
affordable housing schemes in the South 
where most of the work is undertaken for 
repeat clients in this market. We deliver new 
build contracts for Housing Association 
clients under 14 framework agreements, 
accessing a £700m annual spend.
Retail
Opportunity
The UK retail market continues to 
experience signiﬁcant changes. 
Opportunities for work in this sector 
remain with the expansion and 
refurbishment of large supermarket 
and leisure developments.  
Our response
We have extensive expertise in the retail 
market with over 50 years’ experience of 
undertaking projects for large retail clients.
We deliver design and build through 
to refurbishment and restoration, with 
experience in fast track and innovative 
delivery programmes. We have strong 
relationships with blue chip clients in the 
retail sector where there continues to be 
strong demand. 
High Quality Residential
Opportunity
The High Quality Residential market in 
London, where work is undertaken for 
high net worth individuals, continues 
to be largely unaffected by the economic 
downturn. Space restrictions in the 
South and the complex nature of 
developments, which can include 
features such as underground car 
stacking systems and swimming pools, 
mean this market has high barriers to 
entry with specialist engineering and 
temporary works skills required. 
Our response
We are recognised as a leading quality 
provider with expertise in new build, ﬁt out and 
refurbishment of prestigious private residential 
projects in and around London. Our particular 
skills in listed and historic buildings, and 
challenging structural works provide a 
differentiator in this market. Our in-house 
specialist temporary works design and 
engineering capabilities are able to provide

Corporate social responsibility continued
Committed to acting as a responsible business 
Consideration of the impact of our operations 
is especially important when we work within the 
community. We work hard to ensure our operations 
are carried out in a respectful manner. 
Safety
Our environmental initiatives are wide 
ranging and encourage our employees 
and subcontractors to adopt sound 
environmental understanding and 
practices through a mixture of training 
and awareness programmes.
Our subsidiary businesses are accredited 
to the ISO 14001 standard which 
demonstrates a commitment to monitoring 
the impact of their operations on the 
environment. Environmental targets 
include minimising waste to landﬁll, 
reducing our carbon footprint, increasing 
our environmental awareness and 
continually improving environmental 
and sustainability management. 
Sustainable solutions are integral to the 
design process and can help towards 
achieving environmental objectives. VHE, 
alongside National Grid, recently won the 
Sustainability Award at Ground Engineering 
Magazine’s 2012 awards for delivering the 
UK’s ﬁrst multi-site Hub and Cluster project 
in Partington, Manchester. The innovative 
scheme remediated contaminated waste 
from four former gas manufacturing sites in 
the North-West using a single site which 
provided substantial cost savings for 
National Grid. 
Environment and sustainability
The safety of our employees, suppliers 
and those affected by our activities remains 
the Group’s priority. Whilst the target is to 
achieve zero accidents, we continued to 
make progress towards this during the year 
alongside the development of a responsible 
safety culture. In 2012, we achieved a record 
reduction in the Group’s Accident Incidence 
Rate which is now at its lowest ﬁgure for 
7 years, an improvement of 87% over 
the period. 
The Renew Safety and Environmental 
Management Group co-ordinates safety 
activity across the Group. Our businesses’ 
initiatives reﬂect the unique characteristics 
and challenges of the markets in which they 
operate. One of the most challenging is 
nuclear where the Group has operated for 
more than 3 years since a lost time event at 
Sellaﬁeld, including over 3 million man hours 
of operations.
Group safety initiatives include cross project 
safety audits, tool box talks and warning 
card systems. Behavioural safety 
management schemes, such as VHE’s 
Prevention of Unsafe Conditions and Acts 
scheme, allow anonymous reporting of 
conditions or situations which could lead to 
an incident. Amco’s STOP, LOOK and 
THINK, Whiteboard and “You said, we did” 
campaigns continue to contribute to the 
ongoing improvement of employee safety 
culture. Walter Lilly and Amco present 
annual safety awards which help to raise 
awareness across the businesses.  Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 31

Employment and training
We work hard to ensure our activities leave 
a positive impact on local communities. 
Britannia has been working closely with 
School Sports Gloucestershire to provide 
after school sports activities, including 
handball and athletics, for up to 30 local 
children a week. 
Shepley Engineers continues to support the 
Calvert Trust on a range of projects. The 
Lake District charity provides outdoor 
activity adventure holidays for all ages and 
abilities. This year saw the creation of a 
zipwire challenge and the construction of a 
new wheelchair accessible path. Seymour, 
as part of a team from Northumbrian Water, 
provided materials and labour to support a 
renovation project at “The Cave” Community 
Arts Centre in South Shields.
Allenbuild’s approach to establishing and 
maintaining excellent relationships within 
the local communities included supporting 
the Lynton Road Community Group with a 
donation towards its annual street summer 
party held earlier this year. 
Many of our businesses participate in 
fundraising events for their chosen charities. 
In the South a team of colleagues from 
Walter Lilly along with friends and family 
successfully completed this year’s 26.2 mile 
Shine London event, Cancer Research UK’s 
nighttime walking marathon. Also for the 
second year running Walter Lilly took part in 
the Cyclothon UK event at Brands Hatch, a 
12 hour endurance challenge raising money 
for a variety of charitable causes.
Seymour supports its local hospice and 
lifeboat station undertaking many 
fundraising activities in the year. Amco took 
part in Breast Cancer Campaign’s “Wear it 
Pink” day with employees pledging to wear 
pink for a day and Shepley Engineers works 
with West Cumbria’s “Hospice at Home” as 
well as pledging support to other local 
Cumbrian causes in the year. During the 
year VHE held events to raise funds for The 
Pippa Jones Little Treasure Trust. 
Many other charities were supported 
throughout the year including the British 
Heart Foundation, the Guide Dogs, the 
Royal National Lifeboat Institution and 
Ilkley Candlelighters.
Community engagement and charitable giving
Our businesses provide training 
and employment opportunities from 
apprenticeship schemes and scholarships 
to work experience in partnership with 
local communities.
Walter Lilly and Seymour are licensed training 
providers to the Engineering and Construction 
Industry Training Boards for their Supervisory 
Management Training and Development 
programmes. In the year Amco introduced a 
Graduate Training Programme approved by 
the Institute of Civil Engineering and a 
Supervisory Management Development 
Programme. Both programmes currently have 
a number of trainees registered. 
Working in the nuclear industry, Shepley 
Engineers continues to invest signiﬁcantly in 
its craft apprenticeship training programme 
which supports over 40 trainees. Shepley 
currently employs over half of the apprentices 
on site at Sellaﬁeld. As part of the 2014 
Commonwealth Games Athletes’ Village 
contract, VHE provided a number of modern 
apprenticeships through the Community 
Beneﬁt Scheme, implemented by Glasgow 
City Council, to maximise the opportunities 
for securing training and employment in 
the area, and has subsequently added an 
additional 3 new apprentices to its core 
delivery team. Amco’s engineering business 
units continue to invest heavily in graduate 
recruitment and craft apprenticeship 
schemes to ensure that the traditional 
electrical and mechanical engineering 
skills base is maintained for the future.
Walter Lilly provides work experience 
opportunities for local schools in the Croydon 
area and currently sponsors 8 Loughborough 
University students. In the North-East, 
Seymour extended its relationship with St. 
Hild’s Specialist Engineering School, 
providing work placement in collaboration 
with Hartlepool College of Further Education 
and Construction Skills. Allenbuild has seen 
success through its mentor and trainee 
programme “Achieve with Allenbuild”, which 
provides placements, trainee positions 
and employment. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 32
The Directors present their report and the audited accounts for the year ended 30 September 2012.
Principal activities
For the year ended 30 September 2012 the principal activity of the Group was as contractors in Engineering Services and Specialist 
Building. The main activities are carried out in the United Kingdom with some development activities in the USA. More details of these 
activities, the year’s trading and future developments are contained in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the 
Review of Operations and the Financial Review. A list of the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group as at 30 September 2012 
appears on page 75.
Results and dividends
The Group proﬁt for the year was £4,741,000 (2011: £1,305,000). The Directors recommend the payment of a ﬁnal dividend on the 
Ordinary Shares of 2.10p (2011: 2.00p) giving a total for the year of 3.15p (2011: 3.00p).
Business review
Information that fulﬁls the business review requirements applicable to the Group can be found in this report, the Chief Executive’s Review 
and the Review of Operations and is incorporated into this report by cross reference.
Key performance indicators
The Directors have established a number of key performance indicators which they use to measure and monitor the performance of 
the Group in a number of different areas. These measures are set out in the tables below. Operating proﬁt margin is a major performance 
indicator and the Board has set a target to sustain this over the next few years. The order targets have been established as part of the 
Board’s drive to improve the quality and sustainability of the Group’s workload and to support the reliability of ﬁnancial performance. 
The safety record improvement target is set annually and achievement of this target is an essential component of the bonus scheme for 
each Director and senior manager within the Group.

Principal risks and uncertainties
This Annual Report contains certain forward looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith, based on the 
information available to them up to the time of approval of this report. Actual results may differ to those expressed in such statements, 
depending on a variety of factors. These factors include customer acceptance of the Group’s services, levels of demand in the market, 
restrictions to market access, competitive pressure on pricing or additional costs, failure to retain or recruit key personnel and overall 
economic conditions.
A risk inherent in the contracting industry occurs in the nature, timing and contractual conditions which exist at the time of contract 
procurement. To mitigate these risks, the Group has a system of pre-contract and pre-tender risk assessment whereby senior 
management, including the Executive Directors where appropriate, review and advise on speciﬁc issues arising in the contract 
procurement process. The Group also seeks to limit its risks by specialising in certain markets where it has extensive experience 
and a particular skills base.
Derivatives and other ﬁnancial instruments
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits and obligations under ﬁnance leases. 
The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to provide ﬁnance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other ﬁnancial 
instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the period 
under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments shall be undertaken. The main risks arising from the Group’s 
ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest bearing assets comprise cash and bank deposits and earn interest at ﬂoating rates. The Group’s bank loan and overdraft facility 
bear interest at ﬂoating rates.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure availability of operating funds by maintaining an appropriate cash balance in both current and deposit 
accounts and, when necessary, to establish appropriate levels of borrowing facilities to provide short-term ﬂexibility.
Foreign currency risk
As a result of the investment in operations in the United States, movements in the US dollar/sterling exchange rate could materially affect 
the Group’s and the Company’s balance sheet. As at 30 September 2012, £9,506,000 (2011: £11,501,000) of the Group’s net assets are 
denominated in foreign currency. The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments in its management of foreign currency risk.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial assets are bank balances, cash, amounts recoverable on contracts and trade receivables, which represent 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to ﬁnancial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its amounts recoverable on contracts and trade receivables.
Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit 
rating. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s management 
based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Payment of creditors
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships with its suppliers and sub-contractors and has established the following 
payment policy:
(a) agree payment terms in advance of any commitment being entered into;
(b) ensure suppliers are made aware of these terms by inclusion of the terms of payment on the order or contract; and
(c)  ensure that payments are made in accordance with the terms of the contract or order providing that the presented documentation 
is complete and accurate.
The Group’s average creditor days during the year were 42 days (2011: 40 days).
Donations
Charitable donations made by the Group during the year amounted to £34,606 (2011: £38,492). 
The Group made no political donations during the year (2011: £nil). Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 34
Employees
The Directors recognise the need for communication with employees at every level. All employees have access to a copy of the Annual 
Report and Accounts which, together with staff brieﬁngs, internal notice-board statements and newsletters, keeps them informed of the 
Group’s progress. The Group produces a quarterly in-house publication, Renews, which provides information to its employees about the 
activities and performance of the Group.
The Group continues to be committed to the health, safety and welfare of its employees and to observe the terms of the Health and 
Safety at Work Act 1974, and all other relevant regulatory and legislative requirements.
It is the policy of the Group that there shall be no discrimination or less favourable treatment of employees, workers or job applicants in 
respect of race, colour, ethnic or national origins, religious beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, disability, political beliefs, age or marital status. 
Full consideration will be given to suitable applications for employment from disabled persons, where they have the necessary abilities 
and skills for that position, and wherever possible to re-train employees who become disabled, so that they can continue their employment in 
another position. Renew and its subsidiaries engage, promote and train staff on the basis of their capabilities, qualiﬁcations and experience, 
without discrimination, giving all employees an equal opportunity to progress within the Group.
Health and safety management
B W May continues as the designated Board Director of Health and Safety with Group responsibility for safety and environmental 
management. Health, safety and environmental management issues and reports are reviewed at every Group Board meeting with 
the Head of Department in attendance when necessary.
The Executive Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, discusses and progresses policy, legislative changes, best 
practice, training needs, inspections, audits (internal and external), performance measurement and statistical information. All topics are 
discussed with a speciﬁc focus on improvement. 
Control at business level remains with subsidiary Managing Directors who are required to appoint a Director who is responsible for safety 
and environmental matters. Health, safety and environmental issues are discussed as the ﬁrst agenda item at monthly Board meetings. Each 
business safety and environmental meeting encourages open communication between all employees and is a key part of the Group’s efforts 
to gather and disseminate good practice for inclusion in business-based management systems. Minimum safety and environmental standards 
are contained within bespoke business Safety and Environmental Management Systems. This system is based on Group activities and 
provides speciﬁc standards, procedures, information, forms and advice which accommodate changes in legislation expected during the 
coming ﬁnancial year. Management advice is provided by the Group Health, Safety and Environmental Department consisting of the Group 
Health, Safety and Environmental Director, an administrator and regional Group Safety and Environmental Advisors. 
Certain Group companies employ their own specialist advisors who liaise directly with the Group HSE Director on common issues. 
The Group maintains its membership with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and locally based construction safety groups. 
All safety and environmental department personnel hold membership with the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health. Attendance 
on the ﬁve day Construction Industry Training Board Site Safety Management Training Scheme continues to be a requirement for all 
construction management personnel, with a two day refresher required every ﬁve years. A one day Directors and Senior Managers course 
is available internally and is used to introduce new systems and detail changes to construction legislation. Short duration ‘tool box talks’ 
and ‘safety brieﬁngs’ are used to enhance the knowledge and competence of supervisory management. 
Group policy requires each business to report and record all injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences, regardless of severity. An incident 
database is maintained to collate this information and provide statistical data allowing performance to be measured and determine system 
amendment and future training requirements. A system of Safety and Environmental Alerts ensures lessons learnt and changes to working 
practices are rapidly transmitted to our workforce, businesses and their contractors. The Accident Incidence Rate (“AIR”) for the year ended 
30 September 2012, measured on the standard base line of 100,000 persons at work, is a key area where the Group measures its performance.

The Directors present the Directors’ Remuneration Report (the “Remuneration Report”) for the ﬁnancial year ended 30 September 2012.
As an AIM listed company, Renew is not required to prepare the Report in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”). However, the Directors recognise the importance and support the principles of the Regulations and 
would normally seek to follow them to the extent considered relevant for an AIM listed company. The Auditor is not required to report to 
the shareholders on the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Remuneration Committee
On his appointment as a Director on 1 June 2011, David Forbes assumed the Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee which also 
comprises Roy Harrison and John Bishop. The Committee held 4 meetings during the ﬁnancial year to discuss remuneration arrangements. 
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference include:
(a)   to determine and agree with the Board the framework and policy for the remuneration packages, including bonuses, incentive 
payments and share options or share awards, of the Executive Directors and members of the Executive Management;
(b)   to review and approve the design of all share incentive plans and performance related pay schemes for approval by the Board 
and shareholders as applicable;
(c)  to determine targets and awards made under share incentive plans and performance related pay schemes;
(d) to determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for each Executive Director and other senior executives; and
(e)  to ensure contractual terms and payments made on termination are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded. 
Non-executive Directors do not have any personal interest in the matters to be decided by the Committee other than as shareholders, 
nor any potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in the running of the Company. 
The Executive Directors and other senior personnel may be invited to attend meetings when appropriate to provide advice. However, 
no Director is present or takes part in discussions concerning his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy is that the remuneration package of the Executive Directors should be sufﬁciently competitive to 
attract, retain and motivate Directors to achieve the Company’s objectives, without making excessive payments. The remuneration and 
employment terms of the Executive Directors are determined by the Committee by comparison with salaries paid and terms agreed with 
Directors in similar companies in the same sector and of a similar size and after a review of the performance of the individual.
It is the aim of the Committee to reward Executive Directors competitively and on the broad principle that they should be in the range of 
median to upper quartile of remuneration paid to senior management of comparable public companies. For guidance, the Committee 
refers to published survey data. The Board determines the terms and conditions of non-executive Directors. 
There are four main elements to the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other senior executives:




Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee, and adjusted where the Committee believes that adjustments 
are appropriate to reﬂect performance, changed responsibilities and/or market conditions.
Other beneﬁts for Executive Directors include car allowances and certain medical cover for the Director and immediate family. 
The Company also has a permanent health insurance policy to provide cover for the Executive Directors.
Annual bonus awards
The Company provides a bonus incentive scheme for Directors and senior executives of the operating companies, linked to the 
performance of the business for which they are responsible. All performance criteria are subject to approval by the Remuneration 
Committee before payment is made.
Equity incentive plans
In 2011, the Remuneration Committee of the Company had been concerned that the existing Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share 
Option Scheme (“ESOS”) was failing to achieve its primary objectives, being the retention and motivation of senior management. 
Part of the reason for this was that only a part of the value of the share being issued (the excess of the value at the date of exercise over 
the value at the date of grant) could be used as a potential reward or incentive. This meant that, given normal dilution limits, the potential 
rewards available to management were modest for a company of the size of Renew Holdings plc. Consequently the level of dilution 
required to deliver these incentives was disproportionately large.

Equity incentive plans continued
The Remuneration Committee believes that long term incentive plans, which deliver shares at no cost to the participants but subject to 
more challenging performance criteria, are a more effective motivational and retention tool than a traditional share option scheme under 
which market value options are granted. 
As a result, the Remuneration Committee proposed to replace the ESOS with a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”), at the Annual General 
Meeting held on 25 January 2012 and the proposal was passed by shareholders. The LTIP has been designed so as to comply with ABI 
guidelines in all material respects. No further options will now be granted under the ESOS which has been terminated save in respect of 
options previously granted under it. The performance criteria to be achieved by the Company in respect of the LTIP are as follows:
Vesting of one half of the Options is dependent on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the other 
half dependent on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a comparator group of 
companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations will be based on the average of the opening and closing share 
price over a 30 day period prior to the commencement and end of the performance period. The absolute TSR growth target will require 
the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to have grown by more than 25%. For TSR growth between 25% and 100%, 
the half of the Option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target will vest on a straight-line basis from nil vesting at 25% growth, 
to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There will be no vesting if TSR growth is 25% or less. There are 400,000 options outstanding under the 
LTIP which may be exercised between 2 March 2015 and 1 March 2022. The ESOS was approved at an Extraordinary General Meeting 
(“EGM”) held on 11 March 2004. There are 2,194,486 options outstanding under the scheme all of which have now vested and may be 
exercised between now and 25 November 2019. 
The Renew Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the “Renew SAYE”) was also approved at the EGM on 11 March 2004. There are 
no options outstanding under this scheme. The Company’s policy to grant options or awards under the above schemes is at the 
Remuneration Committee’s discretion as and when considered appropriate.
Pension arrangements
The Group has established individual stakeholder plans for each employee who elects to join into which the Group makes contributions; 
B May and J Samuel receive salary in lieu of pension contributions from the Company. Following the adoption of new Articles of 
Association at the AGM on 28 January 2009, the restriction on the retirement age of the Executive Directors was removed. 
Service contracts and letters of appointment
The Company’s policy is for all of the Directors to have twelve month rolling service contracts that provide for a twelve month notice 
period. The fees of non-executive Directors are determined by the full Board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
The non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension beneﬁts, share options or other beneﬁts. The Directors are indemniﬁed 
to the full extent permitted by Statute under the Articles of Association.
The service contracts of the Directors, who served during the year ended 30 September 2012, include the following terms:
Directors Executive/Non-executive Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period (months)
J Bishop Non-executive 1 September 2008 Rolling one year 12

Group 
overview Accounts
As an AIM listed company, Renew is not required to follow the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), as set out 
in the Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rules. The Directors, however, recognise the importance of, and accordingly support, the 
principles of good corporate governance as contained within the Code. The Directors normally seek to follow the Code to the extent 
considered relevant for an AIM listed company but are unable to achieve compliance with the Code in a number of areas this year, 
primarily because of the lack of independent non-executive Directors. These matters are explained in further detail in the sections below.
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the non-executive Chairman, one Executive Director and two independent 
non-executive Directors. Brief biographies of the Directors are given on pages 34 and 35.
The Company is not compliant with the requirement of the Code that more than half of the Board should be comprised of independent 
non-executive Directors because R Harrison is not regarded as independent due to the period in 2004/2005 when he acted as 
Executive Chairman. 
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly. Appropriate training, brieﬁngs and induction are available to all Directors on 
appointment and subsequently as necessary, taking into account existing qualiﬁcations and experience. New Directors are subject 
to election by shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM after their appointment. 
The Board met formally ten times in the year with all Directors in attendance. Committee meetings dealing with the daily business of 
the Company were held as necessary. The Board receives written and oral reports from the Executive Directors ensuring matters are 
considered fully and enabling Directors to discharge their duties properly. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s 
decision ensuring the maintenance of control over strategic, ﬁnancial and operational matters. 
In addition, procedures are in place for the Directors to seek independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Board committees
The Board operates with a number of Board Committees. J Bishop, the senior independent non-executive Director, acts as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and D Forbes, an independent non-executive Director, acts as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Nominations Committee is chaired by R Harrison. 
The Board delegates clearly deﬁned powers to its Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. Each of the Board’s Committees 
has carefully drafted terms of reference. 
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises all of the non-executive Directors, determines and agrees with the Board the framework 
and policy of executive remuneration packages, including bonuses, incentive payments, share options or awards and pension arrangements. 
Further information concerning the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 36 to 38. 
The Nominations Committee, which comprises the entire Board, monitors the composition of the Board and recommends the 
appointment of new Directors. The Nominations Committee, with all Directors present, has held two meetings during the year to discuss 
nomination matters.
The Nominations Committee terms of reference include:
(a)  to review the structure, size and composition of the Board;
(b) to consider succession planning for Directors and senior executives;
(c)  to identify and nominate, for approval by the Board, suitable candidates to ﬁll Board vacancies; and
(d)  to make recommendations to the Board on the contents of letters of appointment, Directors’ duties, re-appointment or re-election 
of Directors upon conclusion of a speciﬁed term or retirement by rotation.
The Audit Committee has held three meetings to consider Audit Committee business. The Audit Committee consists of all three non-
executive Directors. The Executive Directors are invited to attend Audit Committee meetings but at least two meetings are held each 
year with the external Auditor at which the Executive Directors are not present. The Audit Committee considers the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the risk management and control systems of the Group, and reports the results to the Board. It reviews the scope and 
results of the external audit, its cost effectiveness and the objectivity of the Auditor. The Audit Committee monitors the non-audit work 
performed by the Auditor to help ensure that the independence of the Auditor is maintained. The Audit Committee also reviews the interim 
statement, the preliminary announcement and accounting policies. 
The Board forms a General Purposes Committee from time it time as it deems necessary. This Committee comprises the two Executive 
Directors and considers individual business matters, which have been speciﬁcally delegated to it by the Board.

Internal controls
Throughout the ﬁnancial year ended 30 September 2012 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, the Group 
has fully complied with the relevant provisions of the Code and the Turnbull guidance. The Directors acknowledge that they have overall 
responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing and monitoring its effectiveness. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risks to which the Group is exposed and therefore provides a reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance against a company failing to meet its business objectives or against material misstatement or loss. Consequently, 
the Board conﬁrms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group and that 
it is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The Group operates a risk management process, which is embedded in normal management and governance processes. There is a system 
of self-examination of risk areas and controls by subsidiaries and departments within the Group. Where signiﬁcant risks are identiﬁed, the 
probability of those risks occurring, their potential impact and the plans for managing and mitigating each of those risks is reported. The 
Group operates a series of controls which include the annual strategic planning and budgeting process, short-term cash monitoring achieved 
by means of weekly forecasts which are compared against budget and previous forecasts, clearly deﬁned capital investment guidelines and 
levels of authority and a clear organisational structure within which individuals’ responsibilities are identiﬁed and monitored. These results and 
processes are monitored, updated, reviewed and considered by the Board. The Group has established a series of minimum standards in 
a number of ﬁnancial and operational areas with which each business within the Group must comply. Group management monitors and 
reviews compliance with these requirements on a periodic basis. Due to the size and nature of the Group, the Board does not consider that 
a separate internal audit function is necessary. For the last ﬁve years and including 2012, the Group has carried out a programme of internal 
audit conducted by the Group Commercial Director and by members of the various subsidiaries’ ﬁnance teams. This system of peer review 
promotes best practice as well as ensuring that Group minimum requirements as to procedures and internal controls are being complied 
with. The reports from these internal audits are made available both to the Board and to the external Auditor.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the budgets and forecasts prepared by the Group and its trading subsidiaries and consider that at the time 
of approving the ﬁnancial statements, there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the ﬁnancial statements.
Directors’ remuneration
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors, and information relating to the Directors’ remuneration and their 
interests in share options, is included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ indemnity
The Articles of Association provide that each Director or other ofﬁcer or Auditor of the Company shall be indemniﬁed by the Company against 
losses, costs and expenses he may sustain or incur in connection with the performance of his duties of ofﬁce, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Shareholder relationships
Members of the Board have dialogue with individual shareholders during the year. In addition to the Annual and Interim Report and 
Accounts, the Chairman addresses shareholders at the AGM and invites questions to any members of the Board. 
The AGM is normally attended by all Directors and provides an opportunity for communication with those shareholders attending. Notice 
of the AGM is given to shareholders at least 21 days in advance and separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate 
issue. Where resolutions at the AGM are dealt with by show of hands, the results of proxy votes for and against are still announced. 
Financial and other information about the Group is available on the Company’s website: www.renewholdings.com, from which 
shareholders can also access their shareholding details via a link to the website of Capita Registrars plc.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held on 30 January 2013, the Notice for which accompanies this report and accounts. The Notice contains special 
business relating to the renewal of the Board’s power to allot equity shares. Brief details of the purpose and effect of the proposed 
resolutions are enclosed with the Notice of AGM. 
Shareholders should complete the proxy form accompanying this document in accordance with the notes contained in the Notice of AGM.

1 Accounting policies 
Presentation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRSs”). The ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling since this is the currency in which the majority 
of the Group’s transactions are denominated.
Accounting estimates and judgements
In the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements the Board has made certain judgements and estimates which impact the measurement 
of various assets and liabilities in the Group balance sheet, the value of transactions recorded in the Group income statement and the 
movements in equity as shown in the Group statement of changes in equity. The actual ﬁnancial outcomes may ultimately differ from that 
which is indicated by these judgements and estimates. Estimates and judgements are reviewed by management and the Board on an 
ongoing basis and changes which may arise in them are reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements for the period in which such changes are made.
The Board has determined that the following areas are those in which estimates and judgements have been made and where material 
impacts could arise in the ﬁnancial statements were such estimates and judgements to be varied.
a) Accounting for construction contracts in accordance with IAS 11 “Construction Contracts” 
IAS 11 requires management to estimate the total expected costs on a contract and the stage of contract completion in order to determine 
both the revenue and proﬁt to be recognised in an accounting period. The Group has control and review procedures in place to monitor, and 
evaluate regularly, the estimates being made to ensure that they are consistent and appropriate. This includes reviewing the independent 
certiﬁcation of the value of work done, the progress of work against contracted timescales and the costs incurred against plan. 
b) Impairment of goodwill in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” 
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is tested annually for impairment by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable 
amount which is determined by an estimation of the value in use of the related cash generating unit to which the goodwill is attributed. 
The calculation of the value in use requires estimates to be made of the future cash ﬂows of the cash generating unit and the timescale 
over which they will arise. Estimated growth rates and discount factors are also used in the calculation to estimate the net present value 
of the cash ﬂows. More information is given in Note 9 to these ﬁnancial statements.
c) Accounting for the deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Beneﬁts”
Independent actuaries calculate the Group’s liability in respect of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. The actuaries make assumptions as to 
discount rates, salary escalations, expected returns on scheme assets, future pension increases, mortality rates applicable to members 
and future rates of inﬂation. These assumptions are made under the Board’s direction. The Board determines the appropriateness of 
these assumptions by benchmarking them against those used by other schemes and by taking advice from the independent actuaries. If 
the actual experience of the schemes is different from the assumptions used then the pension liability may differ from that shown in these 
ﬁnancial statements. More information is given in Note 24 to these ﬁnancial statements. 
d) Accounting for provisions in accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” 
The Group makes provisions where the Board determines that liabilities exist but where judgements have to be made as to the 
quantiﬁcation of such liabilities. A provision has been made for onerous lease contracts in respect of property leases where the Board 
has determined that the expected economic beneﬁts to be derived from the leases are less than the unavoidable cost of meeting the 
Group’s obligations under the lease contract. This could arise where the Group is the head lessee for a property lease contract where the 
property is not used by the Group and where the Group has not been able to sublet the property or has only been able to do so on terms 
which are less favourable than those of the head lease. 
e) Accounting for deferred taxation in accordance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes” 
The Group provides for deferred taxation using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax 
losses where the Directors believe that it is probable that future proﬁts will be relieved by the beneﬁt of tax losses brought forward. The 
Board considers the likely utilisation of such losses by reviewing budgets and medium term plans for each taxable entity within the Group. 
If the actual proﬁts earned by the Group’s taxable entities is different from the budgets and forecasts used then the value of such deferred 
tax assets may differ from that shown in these ﬁnancial statements.
(i) Basis of accounting and preparation
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the 
historical cost convention. In determining that the going concern basis is appropriate the Directors have reviewed budgets, including 
cashﬂow forecasts, and concluded that Group has adequate cash resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the EU. The Group has applied 
all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and International Financial Reporting Committee relevant to its operations 
and which are effective in respect of these ﬁnancial statements.
(ii) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. The results and net assets of 
undertakings acquired are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the acquisition method of accounting. 
The results of undertakings acquired/disposed of are included from/to the date the Group obtains/loses control.
(iii) Revenue
Revenue, which excludes intra-group revenue and Value Added Tax, comprises:


Notes to the accounts Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 50
1 Accounting policies continued
(iv) Construction contracts
Contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments to 
the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue and expenses are recognised 
in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is determined by surveys of work performed. 
Contract costs incurred that relate to future activities are deferred and recognised as amounts recoverable on contracts. When it is 
probable that the total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. To the 
extent that progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised proﬁts (less recognised losses) they are recognised as amounts due 
to construction contract customers.
(v) Segment reporting
The operating segments are based on the components that the Board, the Group’s principal decision-making body (the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (“CODM”)), monitors in making decisions about operating matters. Such components are identiﬁed on the basis of 
information that is provided internally in the form of monthly management account reporting, budgets and forecasts to formulate allocation 
of resource to segments and assess performance. Revenue from reportable segments is measured on a basis consistent with the income 
statement. Revenue is principally generated from within the UK, the Group’s country of domicile. Segment results show the contribution 
directly attributable to each segment in arriving at the Group’s operating proﬁt. Segment assets and liabilities comprise those assets and 
liabilities directly attributable to each segment. Group eliminations represent such consolidation adjustments that are necessary to 
determine the Group’s assets and liabilities. 
(vi) Intangible assets
a)     Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is tested for impairment annually, or on such other occasions that events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of unamortised 
goodwill which has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal. 
b)   Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The cost of intangible assets 
is amortised over their expected useful lives. These intangibles relate to customer relationships and contractual rights and are 
amortised over the period over which the Board has determined that future cash ﬂows are likely to arise from these relationships 
and rights.
(vii) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less provision for impairment if required. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land. Provision is made at rates calculated to write 
off the cost of each asset, less estimated residual value, evenly over its expected useful life as follows: 
Group occupied property
Freehold land     – no depreciation charge
Long leasehold land and buildings  – shorter of ﬁfty years and period of lease
Plant and vehicles   – three to ten years
Ofﬁce equipment   – two to seven years
(viii) Impairments
Goodwill arising on acquisitions and other assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life and are therefore not subject to amortisation, are 
reviewed at least annually for impairment. Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment 
whenever there is any indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of any asset is 
less than its carrying amount, a loss on impairment is recognised. Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less any 
costs which would be incurred in selling the asset and its value in use. Value in use is assessed by discounting the estimated future cash 
ﬂows that the asset is expected to generate. For this purpose, assets are grouped into cash generating units which represent the lowest 
level for which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed in future accounting 
periods. Reversals of other impairment losses are recognised in income when they arise. 
(ix) Inventories
Inventories comprise developments, land held for development and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads and excludes interest. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete slow 
moving and defective inventories.
(x) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at their fair value and then at amortised cost. 
(xi) Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair value and then at amortised cost.
(xii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash ﬂow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of 
less than three months, net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings within current liabilities in the balance sheet.

(xiii) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and where 
it is probable that an outﬂow will be required to settle that obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
(xiv) Leasing commitments
Assets held under ﬁnance leases, where substantially all the beneﬁts and risks of ownership of an asset have been transferred to the 
Group, are capitalised and are depreciated in accordance with the depreciation policy for the relevant class of asset or the lease term if 
shorter. The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement and represents a constant proportion of the 
balance of capital repayments outstanding. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease.
(xv) Deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial 
method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. 
Any increase in the present value of liabilities within the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt schemes expected to arise from employee service in the 
period is charged to operating proﬁt. The expected return on the schemes’ assets and the increase during the period in the present value 
of the schemes’ liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other ﬁnance income. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
in the Group statement of comprehensive income. Pension scheme surpluses, to the extent they are considered recoverable, or deﬁcits 
are recognised in full and presented on the face of the Group balance sheet. 
(xvi) Deﬁned contribution pension plans
Contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
(xvii) Taxation
The tax charge is composed of current tax and deferred tax, calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, except when they relate to 
items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the relevant tax is also dealt with in equity.
Current tax is based on the proﬁt for the year. Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial statements.
Deferred tax on such assets and liabilities is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
(xviii) Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The income statements of 
overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling throughout the ﬁnancial year. The balance sheets 
of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising 
from this policy and arising on the retranslation of the opening net assets are taken directly to reserves. All other exchange differences are 
taken to the income statement.
(xix) Financial instruments
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: trade receivables and ﬁnancial assets at fair value. The Board assigns ﬁnancial 
assets to each category on initial recognition dependant on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The categorisation of these 
assets is reconsidered at each reporting date at which a choice of categorisation or accounting treatment is available. All ﬁnancial assets 
are recognised whenever the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the ﬁnancial instrument. All such assets are initially 
recognised at fair value. Derecognition of such assets occurs when the Group’s right to receive cash ﬂows from the asset ceases or the 
rights and rewards of ownership have been transferred. All such assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Interest and other 
cash ﬂows which arise from holding a ﬁnancial asset is recognised in the income statement in accordance with IAS 39. Financial assets at 
fair value include assets classiﬁed as held for trading, and changes in fair value are recognised through the income statement. Trade 
receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with expected receipts which are not quoted in an active market and they arise when the 
Group provides goods or services. A ﬁnancial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective 
evidence that it is impaired. A ﬁnancial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have 
had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ﬂows of that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a ﬁnancial asset measured at 
amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying value amount, and the present value of the estimated cash ﬂows 
discounted at the original effective interest rate. All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Financial liabilities are 
recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the ﬁnancial instrument. All interest related charges are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement. Bank loans and hire purchase liabilities are entered into to provide ﬁnancing for the 
Group’s operations and are recognised as funds are received. Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
(xx) Share based payments
IFRS 2 “Share Based Payment” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value has been 
independently measured using either a Black-Scholes or a Monte Carlo valuation model as was deemed appropriate by the Directors for 
the relevant options’ conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Directors’ estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 52
1 Accounting policies continued
(xxi) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the 
proﬁt or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding in the 
period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the proﬁt or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.
(xxii) Rental income
Rental income from property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income, over the term of the lease.
(xxiii) Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in income or 
expense. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in income or expense, using the effective interest method. Finance expenses 
comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in income or expense. All borrowing costs are recognised in income or expense using the effective interest method.
2 Segmental analysis
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is responsible for the overall resource allocation and performance assessment of the 
Group. The Board approves major capital expenditure and its authority is required prior to the Group entering into any development 
projects. The Board assesses the performance of the Group and its progress against the strategic plan through monitoring of key 
performance indicators. The Board also determines key ﬁnancing decisions such as raising equity, all loan or bank borrowing 
arrangements and the granting of security over the Group’s assets. As such the Group considers that the Board is the CODM.
Operating segments have been identiﬁed based on the internal reporting information provided to the CODM. From such information Engineering 
Services and Specialist Building have been determined to represent operating segments. Following the identiﬁcation of the operating segments 
the Group has assessed the similarity of the characteristics of the operating segments. Given the different performance targets and markets 
operated within each operating segment it is not appropriate to aggregate the operating segments for reporting purposes and therefore both of 
the identiﬁed operating segments are disclosed as reportable segments. The information received by the CODM shows results both pre and 
post exceptional items. The Group had one customer which represented 21.4% of Group revenue. No other customer represented more than 
10% of the Group’s revenue.
These segments are:
Engineering Services, which comprises the Group’s engineering activities which are characterised by the use of the Group’s skilled 
engineering workforce, supplemented by specialist subcontractors where appropriate, in a range of civil, mechanical and electrical 
engineering applications and;
Specialist Building, which comprises the Group’s building activities which are characterised by the use of a supply chain of subcontractors 
to carry out building works under the control of the Group as principal contractor.

The Board has determined that certain charges to the income statement should be separately identiﬁed for better understanding of the 
Group’s results. 
During the year, the Group incurred £1,120,000 of exceptional redundancy and restructuring costs. £634,000 of these costs relate to 
Specialist Building where further staff reductions have been made to align the segment with the current trading environment. £486,000 
relates to Engineering Services, primarily in respect of the integration of our rail businesses following the acquisition of Amco Group 
Holdings Ltd. 
The Board has also separately identiﬁed the charge of £500,000 (2011: £404,000) for the amortisation of the fair value ascribed to certain 
intangible assets, other than goodwill, arising from the acquisitions of Seymour (C.E.C) Holdings Ltd and Amco Group Holdings Ltd.

The Group has available further unused UK tax losses of £61m (2011: £64m) to carry forward against future taxable proﬁts. The Group also 
has unused USA tax losses of $16m (£9.9m) (2011: $31m (£19.4m)) to carry forward against future taxable proﬁts in the USA. A substantial 
element of these losses relates to activities which are not forecast to generate the level of proﬁts needed to utilise these losses. A deferred tax 
asset has been provided to the extent considered reasonable by the Directors, where recovery is expected to be recognisable within the 
foreseeable future. The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of these losses amounts to £16.3m (2011: £21.7m).

Goodwill of £17,428,000 was acquired on the acquisition of Amco Group Holdings Ltd and was reviewed for impairment one year after the 
acquisition and then on an ongoing basis as required by IFRS 3. The impact of the review was to increase goodwill by £740,000 resulting 
in the restatement of the Group balance sheet as at 30 September 2011 (see Note 26). 
Amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets with a ﬁnite life are recorded within administrative expenses in the income statement. 
The amortisation policy is disclosed in the accounting policies and approximates to a period of 6 years. 
In order to test goodwill for impairment the Group performs value in use calculations by preparing cash ﬂow forecasts for each cash 
generating unit derived from the most recent ﬁnancial budgets and strategic plans approved by management going forward 3 years, 
and then extrapolates cash ﬂows based on conservative estimated growth rates which do not exceed GDP growth in the longer term 
according to management’s view of longer term prospects for each cash generating unit. The cash generating units are deemed to be the 
subsidiaries to which the goodwill relates. Management used growth rates deemed to be appropriate to each cash generating unit after 
reviewing the particular market conditions related to the sector in which the cash generating unit operates. The growth rates used range 
from +3% to +5%. The rate used to discount the forecast cash ﬂows is 8% as the Board considers the rate appropriate in the current 
ﬁnancial market as an approximation to the cost of funds to the Group. The calculation shows that there is substantial headroom, and the 
impairment calculations are not particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate applied. 
During the year, the Board decided to close the business of C&A Pumps Ltd which resulted in the write off of £808,000 of goodwill. 
C&A Pumps Ltd was sold on 14 November 2012 for a nominal consideration.  Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 58

The interest bearing assets accrue interest at prevailing market rates. Generally the Group holds deposits which are repayable on demand.
The sterling interest bearing liabilities accrue interest at a rate which is linked to the lender’s base rate or LIBOR.
The maturity of the ﬁxed rate ﬁnancial liabilities is disclosed in Note 17. The ﬁxed rate liabilities have a weighted average period of 3 years 
(2011: 2 years).  
Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
There are no material differences between fair value and the book value of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities.
Financial risks
The Group has exposure to a number of ﬁnancial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by the 
Group’s operational policies, guidelines and authorisation procedures which are outlined in the corporate governance statement. The key 
ﬁnancial risks resulting from ﬁnancial instruments are credit, liquidity, currency and market risk.

Group 
overview
19 Other ﬁnancial instruments continued
Financial risks continued
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss if a customer fails to meet its ﬁnancial obligations and results primarily from the Group’s trade and other 
receivables. The degree to which the Group is exposed to this risk depends on the individual ﬁnancial situation of each speciﬁc customer. 
The Group does not have any risk from a concentration of trade or other receivables in any customer or group of customers. The Group 
assesses the credit worthiness of every customer prior to entering into any contract and requires appropriate evidence of ﬁnancial 
capability on a case by case basis. The Group reviews trade and other receivables for impairment on a regular basis and information 
relating to the ageing of receivables is provided in Note 12. 
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due. The Board is responsible for 
ensuring that the Group has sufﬁcient liquidity to meet its ﬁnancial liabilities as they fall due and does so by monitoring cashﬂow forecasts 
and budgets. The Board has considered the cashﬂow forecasts for the next twelve months which show that the Group expects to operate 
within its working capital facilities throughout the year. 
The Board aims to maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure investor and market conﬁdence and to sustain the future of the business. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company as disclosed in Note 20 and reserves as 
disclosed in Note 21. The Group arranges loans and short term overdraft facilities and hire purchase facilities as the Board deems necessary. 
The Group does not have any derivative or non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities other than those disclosed in Notes 15 to 17 and the retirement 
beneﬁt obligations disclosed in Note 24. An analysis of the maturity proﬁle for ﬁnance lease liabilities is given in Note 17.
c) Currency risk
The only exposure of the Group to currency risk (i.e. exposure to gains or losses on foreign exchange which would be recognised in the income 
statement) is in respect of the unhedged portion of an inter-company loan. At 30 September 2012 the unhedged portion of the inter-company 
loan was $270,000 (2011: $1,520,000). The dollar closing exchange rate was $1.61: £1 (2011: $1.56: £1) resulting in a foreign exchange loss of 
£12,000 being charged to ﬁnance costs. Consequently, to the extent that the inter-company loan is not fully hedged, the income statement may 
be impacted by exchange rate movements. Exchange rate movement on translation of Lovell America, Inc’s net assets are charged to the 
cumulative translation adjustment within total equity. The exchange loss arising on the translation of Lovell America Inc’s net assets was 
£407 ,000. The total equity statement would be impacted by £58,000 for each $0.01 movement in exchange rates.
All functional currencies of the Group operations are denominated in sterling, with the exception of the US operations whose functional 
currency is the US dollar.
d) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Group’s income or the carrying amount of its holding of ﬁnancial 
instruments. The principal risk relates to interest rates where the Group’s risk is limited to the rates applying to its interest bearing 
short-term deposits and its bank loan. A reduction in market interest rates could lead to a reduction in the Group’s interest income 
and a reduction in its interest costs. Consequently a 1% decrease in market interest rates would reduce annual ﬁnance costs by 
£10,000 for every £1m of outstanding loan. 
The Group’s hire purchase ﬁnancial liabilities are all at ﬁxed rates of interest.

Share options
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
The Group operates a share option scheme, the Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme. The scheme has both an 
Approved and Unapproved element. The difference between the two elements is that the Approved scheme has the advantage of certain 
HMRC approved tax beneﬁts.
Both elements have the same general terms and conditions. Options issued under the scheme must be held for three years before they 
can vest and become exercisable. They must be exercised within ten years from the date of grant. 
Vesting of options is dependant on the achievement of certain performance criteria which are established by the Remuneration 
Committee at the point of grant. 761,904 of the options granted in the 2006 ﬁnancial year have vested. In respect of the options granted 
during the 2007 and 2008 ﬁnancial years, the performance criteria were not met and so 940,252 of previously granted options have 
lapsed. In respect of the options granted during the 2009 ﬁnancial year, 120,263 of the options have vested with 709,140 having lapsed 
due to the performance criteria not being met. All 1,312,319 options granted in the 2010 ﬁnancial year have vested. The scheme does not 
permit retesting of performance conditions and if the performance criteria are not achieved then the options will lapse.
The number of options in issue and their exercise price is given in Note 21. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 62

Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
At the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2012 the shareholders approved a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) which 
replaced the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme as the Directors believed that the LTIP was a more effective 
method of aligning executive and shareholder interests. 
On 2 March 2012, the Company granted options to subscribe for 400,000 ordinary shares pursuant to the LTIP. 
The options are exercisable at a nominal cost from 2 March 2015 subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria. 
Vesting of one half of the options is dependent on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the other half 
dependent on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a comparator group of 
companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations are based on the average of the opening and closing share 
price over a 30 day period prior to the commencement and end of the performance period. 
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to grow by more than 25%. For TSR 
growth between 25% and 100%, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target vests on a straight-line basis 
from nil vesting at 25% growth, to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There will be no vesting if TSR growth is 25% or less.

Share based payments reserve
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
IFRS 2 “Share Based Payment” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value has been 
independently measured by Baker Tilly, Chartered Accountants, using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
£30,000 has been credited (2011: £66,000 charged) to administrative expenses. There is no impact on net assets since an equivalent 
amount has been charged to the share based payments reserve. No options were exercised during the year. The value per option 
represents the fair value of the option less the consideration payable.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the share price since the Company listed on AIM in 2001.
The risk free rate of return has been derived from the Bank of England’s yield curve taking the spot rate for a maturity of 36 months. 
This period has been selected as being the minimum period over which the options could remain extant.

24 Employee beneﬁts: Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes
The Group operates two deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes, the Lovell Pension Scheme and the Amco Pension Scheme.
Both schemes have been closed to new members and to further beneﬁts accrual for several years.
IAS 19 “Employee Beneﬁts”
The Directors have adopted the accounting required by IAS 19 with effect from the transition date. The Directors have discussed the 
assumptions used in determining the actuarial valuations set out below with independent pensions advisors and have determined that 
they are appropriate. The Lovell scheme’s valuation at 30 September 2012 shows a deﬁcit of £569,000 based on the assumptions set out 
below. The Amco scheme shows a surplus of £1,820,000 on the assumptions used in its valuation which are similar to those used for the 
Lovell scheme except where the Directors, in consultation with the scheme’s advisors, consider it appropriate to vary them due to 
different characteristics of the Amco scheme and its membership proﬁle. The Directors have determined that it is appropriate to recognise 
this surplus as, having reviewed the rules of the Amco scheme, they are of the view that the employer, Amalgamated Construction Ltd, 
has an unconditional right to that surplus.
The following disclosures required by IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2012 carried out 
by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, Consulting Actuaries, in respect of the Lovell scheme and Capita Employee Beneﬁts (Consulting) Limited in 
respect of the Amco scheme using the following assumptions:

Inﬂation assumption (RPI) 2.7% 3.2%
Increases in deferred pensions 2.7% 3.2%
The mortality tables adopted for the valuation of the Lovell scheme are the Continuing Mortality Investigations PNA00 series with projected 
longevity improvements fully allowed for according to each member’s year of birth and with an additional allowance for future longevity 
improvements known as the medium cohort adjustment. The assumptions include adjustments to these tables based upon a postcode 
analysis of the membership. The Directors believe that this analysis provides a more reliable estimate of the mortality characteristics of the 
scheme’s membership. Under these assumptions, a 60 year old male pensioner is forecast to live for a further 25.6 years and the life 
expectancy of a male aged 60 in 2032 is 26.8 years. 
The mortality tables adopted for the valuation of the Amco scheme are the S1PA Mortality tables based on the mortality experience of 
pension scheme members with projected longevity improvements and with an additional allowance for future longevity improvements known 
as the long cohort adjustment. The Directors believe that this analysis provides a more reliable estimate of the mortality characteristics of the 
scheme’s membership. Under these assumptions, a 65 year old male pensioner is forecast to live for a further 23.6 years and the life 
expectancy of a male aged 65 in 2032 is 25.7 years.

During 2011, the Trustees of the Lovell scheme, in consultation with the Directors, used scheme assets to purchase annuities which match 
certain pension liabilities in a transaction known as a “buy in”. This asset provides protection against falls in gilt yields and risks in the 
performance of other asset classes.

Fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition 
In accordance with IFRS 3, the Board reviewed the fair value of assets and liabilities using information available up to 12 months after the 
date of acquisition. 
Retirement beneﬁt assets
The Directors reviewed the actuarial assumptions adopted by the previous Board of Amco and decided to adjust the assumptions used 
to value pension scheme liabilities. Additionally, more reliable estimates of the mortality characteristics of the scheme’s membership 
were adopted. These assumptions were set out in Note 24 of the Renew Holdings plc Annual Report 2011. The impact of this review 
was to increase goodwill and reduce the carrying value of the retirement beneﬁt assets by £2.2m after accounting for deferred tax. 
Accruals 
The Directors reviewed the expected ﬁnancial outcome in respect of contracts subsisting at the date of acquisition and accrued an 
additional £1.0m in respect of anticipated additional costs on one contract. The effect of this was to increase goodwill, accruals and 
deferred tax assets by a net £0.7m. These adjustments required the restatement of the Group balance sheet as at 30 September 2011.
Goodwill impairment review 
The Board also reviewed the goodwill arising on acquisition for impairment as required by IFRS3. No such impairment was identiﬁed.

A Accounting policies
(i) Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with UK applicable accounting standards under the 
historical cost convention. In determining that the going concern basis is appropriate the Directors have reviewed budgets, including 
cashﬂow forecasts, and concluded that Company has adequate cash resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future. 
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below:
(ii) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
(iii) Tangible ﬁxed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are recorded at cost or valuation for certain properties, less provision for impairment if required. Depreciation is 
provided on all tangible ﬁxed assets, other than freehold land. Provision is made at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset, 
less estimated residual value, evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold land   – no depreciation charge
Long leasehold land  – shorter of ﬁfty years and 
and buildings  – period of lease
Plant and vehicles  – three to ten years
Ofﬁce equipment  – two to seven years
(iv) Leasing commitments
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the proﬁt and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(v) Share based payments
FRS 20 “Share Based Payments” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value has been 
independently measured using either a Black-Scholes or a Monte Carlo valuation model as was deemed appropriate by the Directors for 
the relevant options’ conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Directors’ estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
(vi) Deferred taxation
The payment of taxation is deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting 
and taxation purposes. Full provision for deferred taxation is made under the liability method, without discounting, on timing differences 
that have arisen, but not reversed by the balance sheet date, unless such provision is not permitted by FRS 19 “Deferred Tax”.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. In accordance with FRS 
19 deferred tax is not provided for on:
a) revaluation gains on land and buildings, unless there is a binding agreement to sell them at the balance sheet date. 
b) gains on the sale of non-monetary assets, if the taxable gain will probably be rolled over; 
c) fair value adjustment gains to ﬁxed assets and stock to uplift prices to those ruling when an acquisition is made; and 
d) extra tax payable if the overseas retained proﬁts of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates are remitted in the future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for taxable losses relating to trading to the extent that those losses are expected to be recoverable 
within the foreseeable future.
(vii) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is 
covered by a forward exchange contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate. Exchange differences are taken to the proﬁt and 
loss account.
(viii) Deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme
The Company has adopted the requirements of FRS 17 “Retirement Beneﬁts”. The Directors have determined that it is not possible to 
allocate the assets and liabilities of the scheme between the various Group companies. Accordingly the scheme is not accounted for in 
the Company’s balance sheet. However, any increase in the present value of liabilities within the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme expected to arise 
from employee service in the period is charged to operating proﬁt in respect of the Company’s employees.
(ix) Deﬁned contribution pension plans
Contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans are charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
(x) Dividends
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
(xi) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks comprise land held for development and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes appropriate 
attributable overheads and excludes interest. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.

of the inter-company loan was $270,000 (2011: $1,520,000).

Share options
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
The Company operates a share option scheme, the Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme.
The scheme has both an Approved and Unapproved element. The difference between the two elements is that the Approved scheme has 
the advantage of certain HMRC approved tax beneﬁts.
Both elements have the same general terms and conditions. Options issued under the scheme must be held for three years before they 
can vest and become exercisable. They must be exercised within ten years from the date of grant. 
Vesting of options is dependant on the achievement of certain performance criteria which are established by the Remuneration 
Committee at the point of grant. 761,904 of the options granted in the 2006 ﬁnancial year have vested. In respect of the options granted 
during the 2007 and 2008 ﬁnancial years, the performance criteria were not met and so 940,252 of previously granted options have 
lapsed. In respect of the options granted during the 2009 ﬁnancial year, 120,263 of the options have vested with 709,140 having lapsed 
due to the performance criteria not being met. All 1,312,319 options granted in the 2010 ﬁnancial year have vested.
The scheme does not permit retesting of performance conditions and if the performance criteria are not achieved then the options will lapse.
Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
At the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2012 the shareholders approved a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) which 
replaced the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme as the Directors believed that the LTIP was a more effective 
method of aligning executive and shareholder interests.
On 2 March 2012, the Company granted options to subscribe for 400,000 ordinary shares pursuant to the LTIP.
The options are exercisable at a nominal cost from 2 March 2015 subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria.
Vesting of one half of the options is dependent on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the other half 
dependent on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a comparator group of 
companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations are based on the average of the opening and closing share 
price over a 30 day period prior to the commencement and end of the performance period.
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to grow by more than 25%. For TSR 
growth between 25% and 100%, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target vests on a straight-line basis 
from nil vesting at 25% growth, to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There will be no vesting if TSR growth is 25% or less.

Share based payments reserve
FRS 20 “Share Based Payment” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value has been 
independently measured by Baker Tilly, Chartered Accountants, using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
£30,000 has been credited (2011: £66,000 charged) to administrative expenses. There is no impact on net assets since an equivalent 
amount has been charged to the share based payments reserve. No options were exercised during the year. The value per option 
represents the fair value of the option less the consideration payable. 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the share price since the Company listed on AIM in 2001. The risk free rate of 
return has been derived from the Bank of England’s yield curve taking the spot rate for a maturity of 36 months. This period has been 
selected as being the minimum period over which the options could remain extant. 
Options granted under the Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme over the Company’s Ordinary shares at 30 September 2012 
were as follows:

The options granted on 7 June 2006 have vested in full. The options granted on 8 January 2007 and 3 December 2007 have lapsed. 
120,263 of the options granted on 26 November 2008 have vested with 709,140 having lapsed. The options granted on 25 November 2009 
have vested in full.
Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
Fair value has been independently measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP using a Monte Carlo model methodology. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
£36,000 has been charged (2011: £Nil) to administrative expenses. There is no impact on net assets since an equivalent amount has been 
credited against the share based payments reserve. No options were exercised during the year. The value per option represents the fair 
value of the option less the consideration payable.
The expected volatility has been calculated based on weekly historical volatility of the company’s share price over the three years prior to the 
date of grant. The risk free rate of return has been based on the yields available on three year UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
Options granted under the Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan over the Company’s Ordinary shares at 30 September 2012 
were as follows:

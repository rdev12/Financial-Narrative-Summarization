Chairman’s statement
The strength of our customer relationships and the quality of our
services have been, and will continue to be, key to our success.
David Malpas, Chairman
On behalf of the Board I thank all 
the Group’s employees, whose
enthusiasm, commitment and
professionalism have produced
another year of strong operational
and financial performance. The
strength of our customer
relationships and the quality of our
services have been, and will continue
to be, key to our success and are a
direct consequence of the quality of
our people.
Wincanton has reported another
period of financial and strategic
progress for the year to 31 March
2006. Group operating profit of
£42.0m (2005 : £39.3m) grew by 
6.9 per cent, profit before tax by 9.5
per cent and earnings per share by
17.8 per cent (in each case stated 
on an underlying basis which excludes
amortisation of acquired intangibles
and exceptionals). Group operating
profit, including these items was
£41.0m (2005 : £37.4m). Cash flow
performance was again strong, with
only a marginal increase in year-end
net debt to £60.6m, in spite of a 
near £38m outflow as a result of an
acquisition and a cash injection into
the Group’s pension fund.
The underlying strength of
Wincanton’s trading performance
and another year of good cash flow
generation have given the Board the
confidence to propose a full year
dividend of 12.54p per share. This
represents a 10.0 per cent increase
on the dividend paid last year.
Including this dividend the Group’s
annualised rate of dividend increase
since its demerger in May 2001 now
stands at 7.9 per cent per annum. These
dividend increases, combined with a
good share price performance, have
generated a T otal Shareholder Return
of 90.8 per cent since demerger. This
represents, as at 31 March 2006, an
out-performance relative to the FTSE-
250 of 26.4 per cent. 
In the five years since demerger,
Wincanton has strengthened its
position in the UK & Ireland and
established a platform for growth
across Continental Europe. The
Group’s full growth potential is yet 
to be realised, but solid progress is
being made towards our goal of
leadership in European supply 
chain services.
Our markets are fragmented, and
there are opportunities for further
consolidation through acquisition. 
In October 2005 we announced 
the purchase of the principal French
logistics activities of Premium
Logistics (‘Premium’). Premium
significantly strengthens our
operational capabilities in the important
French market. Our enlarged French
business now offers national
coverage from some 30 sites, giving
a substantially stronger and broader
business base from which we will be
able to serve both the French and
cross-border requirements of our
blue-chip customer base. Other
potential acquisitions are under
review as a means of accelerating
either the expansion of our service
offering or the further strengthening
of our European presence.
I take this opportunity of welcoming
Graeme McFaull to his new role as
Chief Executive. Graeme, who took
over from Paul Bateman in
December 2005, previously led our
operations in the UK & Ireland
through a period of very significant
growth and development. He has the
support of a highly experienced and
committed senior team and I am sure
that Wincanton will enjoy continuing
success under his leadership.
The Board also welcomes Jonson Cox
who has joined us as a non-executive
Director during the year and whose
contribution is much appreciated.
Peter Brown left the Board in
February 2006, and I thank him for 
his contribution to the Group over
many years.
Our markets remained challenging
and competitive in the year under
review. High levels of new business
activity nonetheless again enabled 
us to take market pressures and
contract losses in our stride and 
still show good net profit progress.
Annualised turnover from contract
wins and renewals totalled
approximately £385m compared 
to last year’s £250m.
Our operations in the UK & Ireland
reported underlying operating profit
of £37.8m, up 3.6 per cent on the
previous year. Fee pressure is evident
in certain of the more mature areas of
our activities but we continue to see
opportunities for growth across our
retail, manufacturing and industrial
“” Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 5
customer bases. The market for
supply chain services in the UK &
Ireland has become more polarised in
recent years, and Wincanton, as one
of the two leading operators, has
benefited from its greater scale and
the loss of market share by smaller
operators. This trend is expected to
continue to be of benefit to the Group
in the future. We also continue to
have confidence in the growth
potential of our portfolio of ancillary
services, which includes consultancy,
data records management, waste
recycling and fleet maintenance. 
Underlying operating profit in
Continental Europe grew by 7.1 per
cent, excluding our French acquisition,
and by 50.0 per cent, to £4.2m,
including our French acquisition. 
The progress in underlying profit 
was achieved in spite of the early
termination in February 2005 of the
key customer contract managed by
PGN, a jointly owned entity. This
contract, which remains subject to
arbitration proceedings, was an
important contributor to Continental
European profitability in 2004/05.
A more rapid and substantial
improvement in the profit
performance of Continental Europe
remains a key objective for us. There
is a high degree of operational
leverage in our asset base which, if
volume growth can be accelerated,
will have a positive effect upon
reported profit. Management teams
have been strengthened in a number
of countries, including the
recruitment of a new managing
Director in Germany, and the new
teams will be supported by higher
levels of investment in marketing and
business development. Raising the
brand awareness of Wincanton
across Continental Europe, improving
the performance of certain loss-
making activities and ensuring the
delivery of consistent service
excellence across borders will be key
to further performance improvement.
The Continental European businesses
remain fundamental to our strategy
and we are confident that, over time,
they will generate significant profit
and cash flow for the Group.
Our strategy of offering our customers
national, regional and Pan-European
services is generating enhanced
opportunities for growth. As a
consequence of successful acquisition
and the continuing organic growth of
existing operations, Wincanton 
has positioned itself as one of the
leading supply chain management
companies in Europe. We continue 
to see attractive potential, both
organically and through acquisition,
for Wincanton to consolidate and
develop this position as a European
industry leader. We have confidence
in the Group’s ability to build further
on the achievements of recent years.
Sustaining growth momentum in the
UK & Ireland and delivering more
satisfactory levels of profitability in
Continental Europe will bring many
challenges in 2006/07. Our objective
is nonetheless for the new year to be
another period of progress towards
realising our operational, financial and
strategic goals. We expect 2006/07 
to again confirm Wincanton’s ability
to generate value for shareholders
by adding value for customers.

Chief Executive’s Q&A
“”
Our people are the best in the industry. Their commitment 
to operational excellence drives the search for continuous
improvement which underpins our service delivery.
Graeme McFaull, Chief Executive
Q.
How do you see
Wincanton today?
A.
Wincanton is an excellent
business with a successful
past and an exciting future. It has
increased tremendously in scale,
geographic presence and service
complexity in recent years, without
losing sight of its core people values
and customer-focused culture.
We now have the scale and
geographic presence to serve our
customers across Europe but we
never put scale before customer
service. There are bigger, but not
better, companies in our sector.
Q.
What are Wincanton’s
strengths?
A.
Our people and our customers
are our greatest strengths.
Our people are the best in the industry.
Their commitment to operational
excellence drives the search for
continuous improvement which
underpins our service delivery. Their
creativity and talent for innovation
ensure the constant renewal and
development of our service offering.
Our people recognise that we are
only as good as today’s performance
and tomorrow’s new idea, and key to
everything is the customer.
These customers include Europe’ s
largest retailers and manufacturers.
We are growing our share of business
with these customers, working both
within and across country borders.
We work very hard to build and develop
these relationships. They have
become, in many cases, long-standing
partnerships which have been critical
to our past successes and they are
also the key to our future growth.
Q.
Will Wincanton’s 
strategy change?
A.
Our vision remains clear 
and unchanged. We will be
recognised as the premium operator,
the European leader in our sector.
Since becoming Chief Executive, 
I have visited all the countries in
which we operate, spent time with all
our management teams and met our
largest customers. I am now even
more firmly convinced that this goal 
is achievable. Stretching targets are
being set, across the business, as we
focus on the implementation of the
strategy that will deliver our vision.
We have achieved a lot in recent
years, and are already well-established
throughout much of Europe, but we
can and must make more rapid
progress. The pace of change is
accelerating in our industry and 
we must accelerate with it.
Q.
What changes will 
you make?
A.
T o succeed, we must combine
strength in national markets
with a regional and Pan-European
service offering. Our customers must
have confidence that Wincanton can
deliver industry-leading solutions 
and operational quality, consistently,
both nationally and across Europe.
The changes I have made since
becoming Chief Executive have been
made with this goal in mind.
In recent months I have re-organised
our internal management structures,
making them flatter, more flexible
and more responsive. A new
Operating Board has been created,
joining together our country and Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 7
sector managing Directors, ensuring
that we work as one business across
Europe. Our management teams 
in a number of national markets 
have been strengthened through
external recruitment.
Key value-driving functions, such 
as business development, human
resources and IT have been re-
oriented to give Group-wide focus 
in addition to support in national
markets. Customer and key account
planning processes are being
reinforced across the business and 
a series of new marketing initiatives
have been launched to continue to
raise awareness throughout Europe
of the Wincanton brand, our
capabilities and core values.
Research tells us that our customers
look to Wincanton for operational
excellence, an in-depth understanding
of their business, innovation and value.
These are the ‘Four Pillars’ of our
service offering. We must be ready to
continue to be flexible and anticipate
the changes that ensure that we will
meet, and exceed, the expectations 
of our customers in all these areas.
Q.
Do you see Wincanton
entering new geographic
markets?
A.
Our clear priority is to continue
to strengthen and expand our
current European presence. There is
great potential to build further on this
existing presence, which already
gives a highly-competitive platform in
what remains a fragmented market.
We see significant opportunity in
many of the existing EU member
states and are also looking actively,
often with existing customers, at
new opportunities in the countries
expected to join the EU in due course.
We monitor possible opportunities
beyond the EU but expect, at this
stage of Wincanton’s development,
to focus our efforts and resources 
on achieving our goal of European
leadership.
Q.
Is Wincanton considering
new sectors or services?
A.
Wincanton’s business
incorporates a large number 
of customer solutions, providing a
wide range of services across many
sectors of the economy. This
diversity is an important strength,
giving us balance and mix and the
opportunity to manage our
operations on a portfolio basis.
The portfolio today is very different
from the Wincanton of 10 years ago. 
I fully expect Wincanton’s portfolio in
10 years time to have evolved
significantly compared to the
Wincanton of today.
This means that we are constantly
reviewing new sectors, new
services, new technologies to
refresh and develop the portfolio,
based on our core business
competences of outsourcing and
supply chain management services.
Q.
Do you expect Wincanton 
to make further acquisitions?
A.
We have built a good track
record for making acquisitions
at sensible prices and integrating
them well. These acquisitions have
complemented our organic growth
and allowed us to accelerate our
strategic development.
There are many opportunities for
further consolidation in our market. 
At any one time we are likely to be
reviewing half a dozen potential
targets but we are very selective. We
do our homework on these potential
targets in detail and we do it well.
Acquisitions are not a strategic
imperative for Wincanton. There are
very attractive opportunities for good
organic growth in our existing
business. We will therefore only
make further acquisitions when we
have a high degree of confidence that
significant value can be added to
Wincanton relative to the entry price
for our investment.
Q.
Any final comments?
A.
Our success to date has been
based on adding value for
shareholders by adding value for
customers. We are very conscious of
our responsibilities to our stakeholders.
We take great pride in Wincanton’s
progress to date. I am personally
proud and excited to be leading
Wincanton into the next stage 
of its development.

Last year we said….
…creative solutions for our clients
This year…
We have been managing an
automated warehouse and transport
operations for Heinz for several
years and we were recently
awarded a further contract for
reworking activities and related
services. This includes repacking
goods for product promotions and
quality inspection work.
Heinz’s Warehousing & Distribution
manager said:’ Wincanton has
become an integral part of our
structure in ensuring the continued
success of Heinz and its brands.’
The Group’s existing presence across
Europe is a competitive advantage in
an industry which remains fragmented,
with large numbers of small
operators and a very limited number
of Pan-European service providers.
The European market is our core
geographic focus, our home market.
It is a market of 460 million
consumers. It has a substantial
manufacturing and retailing
infrastructure and significant national,
cross-border and international flows
of raw materials, finished products
and services. It is these supply chain
flows that we manage on behalf of
customers. This is a geographic
market in which we have a leading
presence and which offers substantial
opportunities for future growth.
We have a strong portfolio of
customers across Europe, including
many of the world’ s major retailers and
manufacturers. Maintaining and
enhancing supply chain efficiency is
business-critical to our customers. We
have a proven track record of growth
with these customers and we are now
able to serve their needs on a national,
regional and Pan-European basis. 
Changes in legislation, strategy,
technology and the economy lead 
to both tactical and strategic change
in the supply chain needs of our
customers. We continue to invest in
our people, our services, our systems
technology and our processes to
ensure that we offer the innovation,
operational excellence and value
which deliver the solutions to meet
these changing customer needs and
enable us to compete successfully 
in our chosen markets. 
Our strong profit and cash flow
performance gives us the financial
capacity to take advantage of new
opportunities. We actively consider
opportunities to expand our portfolio
of services and sector expertise, both
organically and through acquisition.
Acquisitions are also expected to
contribute to the further
strengthening and expansion of our
geographic presence across Europe. 
We serve a well diversified customer
base, deliver a wide range of
business-critical solutions and offer 
a Pan-European presence which is
already amongst the best in the sector .
We have a clear strategy which we
believe will generate further value for
shareholders by continuing to add
value for customers.
We look to the future with confidence.
2005/06 Summary
Wincanton made further encouraging
progress in the financial year to 31
March 2006. 
Our UK and Ireland operations, which
continue to generate most of the
profit and cash flow of the Group,
produced another solid operational
and financial performance. New
business activity levels remained
high and overall contract contribution
margins were stable, with fee
pressure in certain cases offset by
performance bonuses and higher
levels of gainshare elsewhere. A
substantial programme of contract
start-ups was successfully delivered.
In Continental Europe, we
significantly strengthened our 
French presence through acquisition
and made further profit progress
overall in spite of a disappointing
performance in certain operations. 
UK and Ireland: 
Performance highlights
Our businesses in the UK and Ireland
reported underlying operating profit
of £19.6m in the second half, an
increase of 3.2 per cent on the same
period last year and a 7.7 per cent
increase on the £18.2m reported in
the first six months of this financial
year, to give a full year underlying
operating profit of £37.8m, an annual
increase of 3.6 per cent. T urnover 
in the UK and Ireland increased by 
5.3 per cent, to £1,156.3m.
Growth with our retailer customer
base, particularly in DIY and general
merchandise, was again a key feature
of the year. Contract gains in the
period included a new direct import
centre for Argos, a Christmas relief
operation for Sainsbury’s and a 
home delivery platform for Comet.
Further expansion of other existing
relationships gave rise to gains with
customers such as B&Q, Morrisons
Solutions
Strategy
Wincanton’s strategic objective is to become the leading provider 
of European supply chain management services. Already challenging
for leadership in the UK and Ireland, we also aim to be amongst the
leaders in each of our chosen markets in Continental Europe. Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 9
and Woolworths. Contracts were
also renewed with long-standing
customers such as ACC, New Look
and WH Smith. Lower volumes at
certain shared user sites restricted an
otherwise strong retail performance.
Our portfolio of manufacturing
customers reported a higher profit
contribution on a slightly reduced
level of turnover. Co-packing services
were further expanded through
contract gains with Heinz and Procter
& Gamble. Our growing presence in
the drinks sector was reflected in a
new national warehousing and
distribution contract for SABMiller
and the award of a contract to
manage Britvic’s national primary
transport. Last year’s substantial gain
with GlaxoSmithKline, a 10-year
contract to design and operate a new
automated warehouse, was
successfully delivered. Profit
progress in this sector was held back
by continued weak trading in our
chilled consolidation operations in 
the first half of the year, although
performance improved materially 
in the second half. 
Our contract base of industrial
customers saw a marginal year-on-
year reduction in profit with a strong
performance within our petroleum
customer base failing to offset
several small year-on-year negatives,
including a reduced contribution 
from our fridge recycling activities
following the delayed implementation
of the WEEE Directive. Contract wins
included Shell Gas and First Milk.
Contract renewals included Dairy
Crest, Novartis, T exaco and Statoil. 
In terms of operational performance
we worked hard, and successfully, 
on behalf of long-standing customers
T exaco and T otal, to mitigate the
adverse effect on their operations 
of the major explosion at their
Buncefield depot.
In terms of ancillary services, the year
to 31 March 2006 was another good
year for Pullman Fleet Services.
Pullman delivered strong growth,
continuing to develop its national
network of vehicle maintenance and
assistance services both organically
and through in-fill acquisition. New
contracts were added with
customers such as Arla Foods,
Cemex, Sainsbury’s and T esco.
Consilium, our consulting operation,
produced another good performance.
The costs of increasing capacity in
our data records management
business in the year had a negative
effect on profit performance but
growth prospects remain
encouraging in this area.
Wincanton is a strong number two 
in a UK market which has become
increasingly polarised in recent years.
A number of our competitors have
either been sold, are in the process of
being sold, or are facing uncertainty
as to either their future ownership or
their ability to sustain critical mass. 
In certain instances this has created
short term pricing pressure, but has
generally created incremental
opportunities for Wincanton. 
The scale of our operations in the UK
and Ireland allows us to offer flexible
solutions combining both dedicated
and shared-user options and the
opportunity for customers to benefit
from reduced costs overall. We seek
to combine the benefits of scale
without the loss of the specialist
service focus or the closeness of
personal relationships which remain
critical to our customers. >
Wincanton has become
an integral part of our
structure in ensuring the
continued success of
Heinz and its brands.
Heinz’s Warehousing 
and Distribution manager
“” 10 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 
Business review continued
Last year we said… 
…ensuring consistency of
operational performance
This year…
Wincanton’s partnership with Procter
& Gamble in the UK received global
recognition in the customer’s internal
audit during 2005. The automated
warehouse at Thurrock was
reviewed in 14 areas. 
In 3 of the 14 areas, auditors
categorised the distribution centre as
a ‘Global Benchmark Site’, describing
the operations as ‘outstanding’ and
praising health and safety processes.
As a result of the close team culture
and level of integration between
Wincanton and P&G, auditors also
commented that it was ‘impossible 
to differentiate between contractor
and customer’.
Continental Europe: 
Performance highlights
Underlying operating profit growth 
of 50.0 per cent, including our French
acquisition, and of 7.1 per cent
excluding this acquisition, is indicative
of another year of change, investment
and strategic development in our
Continental European activities. 
The progress in underlying profit 
was achieved in spite of the early
termination in February 2005 of the
key customer contract managed by
PGN, a jointly owed entity. 
Underlying operating profit of £4.2m,
on turnover up 17.9 per cent to
£653.0m, is still some way below
what we believe to represent the
profit potential of these businesses.
Progress is nonetheless being
achieved in terms of brand awareness,
customer account management, the
consistency of our operational
standards and the strength and depth
of our senior management teams.
Operationally, our Continental
European activities are generally
strong and our business infrastructure
is capable of handling the higher
volumes that will deliver faster profit
growth. Investment in the year, for
example, to expand the capacity of
our Eisenach site, a key hub location
in our German transport network, is
indicative of our commitment to
ensure that the business continues 
to be well-positioned for the future.
There are also plans to expand the
capacity of our international freight
management facility at ´s-Heerenberg
on the Dutch-German border.
In terms of further strategic
development, the highlight of the 
year was the acquisition of Premium.
Our enlarged French business now
has a good national presence, an
enhanced portfolio of customers 
and both the operational capability
and credibility to serve the needs 
of potential new customers. The
integration process has gone well and
we are re-building the development
pipeline. Some early new business
wins, most recently a new distribution
centre for a major drinks company,
confirm our belief that the French
market will bring attractive
opportunities for future growth.
Profitability in our existing French
activities, based in Strasbourg, was
held back by the effect of fuel price
increases on our fleet operations. 
In France, as across the rest of
Continental Europe, our transport
activities are principally carried out
through sub-contractors. In certain
countries, however , we do operate our
own vehicles, generally small fleets for
specific customers, routes or regions.
Difficulties and delays in recovering
the full effect of the significant fuel
price increases in the year in respect 
of these fleets is estimated to have
reduced Continental European
profitability by approximately €1m.
Volumes were generally strong in our
German business, particularly in our
intermodal and freight management
activities. Container traffic on the
Rhine showed good year-on-year
growth, albeit with a weaker final
quarter as a result of low water levels.
The performance of our road network
was mixed, with good results in
certain depots offset by customer
loss elsewhere. The integration of
last year’s midiData acquisition with
our existing hi-tech network had a
positive effect on profitability. There
was also good growth across the
network with customers such as
Honeywell, Goodyear Dunlop and
JohnsonDiversey.

Adjusting capacity in anticipation of
future opportunity led us to invest in
the expansion of Eisenach, a key hub
in our network activities. It also led us
to terminate the lease on one of our
Hamburg sites, following customer
change. The closure costs of the
Hamburg operation are included
within the exceptional restructuring
charge further explained below.
Our Dutch operations reported a good
performance, particularly in
international freight management.
Gains and renewals in this area were
recorded with customers such as
Diolen and Rohm and Haas. Our
growing business in automotive
components showed further progress
with contract gains with Mitsubishi
and Pininfarina. For Pininfarina we 
are consolidating component supply
from 160 suppliers across Europe 
for just-in-time delivery into its
specialist manufacturing facilities in
T urin. The Dutch business also has
considerable expertise in complex
freight management into the former
Soviet republics, for example for
oilfield construction customers in
Central Asia, and there was good year-
on-year growth in this activity. 
Financial performance in Central and
Eastern Europe was down compared
to 2004/05. There was good progress
in the region, particularly in Poland,
with customers such as Numico,
Leroy Merlin and Exxon. Our
forwarding operation in Gdansk also
contributed well. New operations
commenced in the year included a
warehouse for Goodyear Dunlop in
Slovakia. Contract gains in Hungary
with customers such as Hipp, M-Real,
Henkel and Philips were not sufficient
in financial terms to offset prior-year
customer losses.
The financial performance of our
Spanish operations improved in
2005/06, following the closure of our
Valencia site last year, but further
action will be required to deliver 
a return to profitability. A new
management team in Spain is 
making good progress in addressing
the structural issues that have led to
continuing under-performance and
our focus on sales and business
development is beginning to produce
new business wins. We are actively
reviewing potential opportunities to
strengthen our presence in the
Spanish market.
Overall, the 2005/06 results for
Continental Europe showed 
progress strategically, operationally
and financially. Management
changes have been made in several
countries which, together with
increased investment in business
development and marketing, will
enable us to make more rapid and
substantial progress.
Wincanton Group: 
Consolidated results
Consolidated Group turnover of
£1,809.3m was 9.6 per cent higher
than in 2004/05. Underlying operating
profit increased by 6.9 per cent to
£42.0m, leading to a slight reduction
in accounting margin on turnover, to
2.3 per cent. 
Neither turnover growth nor
percentage margin on turnover are
key performance indicators for us. 
We measure the progress of the
Group principally in terms of growth 
in operating profit, cashflow and
return on capital. T urnover growth 
can nonetheless give a broad
indication of underlying business
momentum. Annualised turnover
from new business wins and contract
renewals totalled £300m in the UK >
We need to make sure we
are always ahead of the
game by having the right
capacity in place to meet
both short and long term
demand. Wincanton
already has a proven track
record with P&G,
managing our automated
UK distribution centre.

and Ireland and £85m in Continental
Europe, giving a Group total of £385m,
compared to last year’s £250m.
Approximately 70 per cent of the
annualised turnover from new wins
in the period came from existing
customers. This compares to last
year’s 85 per cent and confirms
again the importance of strong
customer relationships and a
diversified sector portfolio to both
Wincanton’s current performance
and its future growth potential.
Interest costs
The interest charge of £9.7m
represents a slight reduction on last
year’s £9.9m. Strong cash inflows
from operations were offset by cash
outflows relating to the acquisition 
of Premium. T owards the end of the
financial year the cash injection into
the pension fund was offset by the
proceeds from property disposals.
Average debt levels were therefore
similar to the previous year. The
average interest rate payable on the
Group’s borrowings in the year was
4.3 per cent. 
The interest charge for the year was
covered 4.3 times by underlying
operating profit.
Exceptionals 
Net exceptional restructuring costs 
of approximately £8.1m were offset
by net exceptional profits of £8.1m
arising from the disposal of a number
of surplus freehold properties. Net
exceptional costs included the final
phase of the move to our new 
head office in Chippenham and a
subsequent senior management
restructuring (£4.2m), the costs of
closure of a number of European
sites and operations, principally a 
site in Hamburg (£3.0m) and post-
acquisition restructuring costs in
France (£0.9m). Net exceptional
profits arose principally from the
disposal of five surplus freehold
properties in the UK.
Taxation
The tax charge of £10.1m on underlying
profits gives an accounting rate of tax
for the year of 31.3 per cent. The
overall tax rate was lower , at 26.8 per
cent, because the gains on property
disposals were offset by brought-
forward capital losses.
Wincanton operates in jurisdictions
across Europe, with corporate tax
rates that range from 12.5 per cent 
to 40.0 per cent. Brought-forward
trading losses in certain countries
may lead in due course to a further
reduction in the Group’s accounting
rate of tax.
Minority interests, earnings 
and dividends
A small number of the Group’s
activities are carried out through
companies in which there are
minority shareholdings. Wincanton
holds the majority controlling share in
these companies and therefore fully
consolidates the activities in the
Group’s results. The largest such
operation is RhineContainer BV , a
freight forwarding activity in the
Netherlands and Germany, in which
the Group has a 74.2% holding. The
profits attributable to minority
interests of £0.2m were lower than
last year’s £0.6m. 
Underlying earnings per share of 19.2p
represents a 17.8 per cent increase
on last year’s 16.3p per share.
The Board proposes a final dividend
of 8.6p which, together with the
>
Opportunities Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 13
Heading continued
interim dividend announced at the
half year, gives a total dividend for
2005/06 of 12.54p per share. This
represents a 10.0 per cent increase
on the full-year dividend for 2004/05.
On this basis, the full-year dividend
for 2005/06 is covered 1.53 times.
Cash flow and net debt
Underlying EBITDA (being underlying
operating profit plus depreciation and
amortisation) totalled £74.8m. This
inflow, plus a working capital inflow
of £4.0m gave rise to a total cash
inflow from operating activities of
£78.8m before capital expenditure
and exceptionals.
Gross capital expenditure of £40.3m
was higher than in recent years, at
approximately 123 per cent of the
£32.8m charge for depreciation. 
The total of £40.3m included some
£28.6m of expansion capital and
£10.9m of replacement capital.
Investments in expansion capital and
replacement capital last year totalled
£23.6m and £14.7m respectively.
The principal items of expansion
capital included the balance of the
investment in a new automated
warehouse for GlaxoSmithKline, 
the kitting-out of a new warehouse
for Argos in Corby and the
commissioning of a second recycling
machine at our waste management
centre in Billingham.
In evaluating growth opportunities,
either organic or through acquisition,
our focus is significantly weighted
towards cash flow return on
investment and return on capital
employed. All capital expenditure
proposals are subject to review and
approval at appropriate levels,
including the Wincanton Board. The
first-year results of approved projects
are subsequently ‘backchecked’
against projected returns. 
Gross capital expenditure was offset
by £24.0m of asset sales in the year,
principally the disposal of surplus
freehold properties referred to above.
Further surplus property disposals are
expected in the new financial year .
The Group also finances its growth
through operating leases, which in
our UK and Ireland operations, in
particular, are generally underwritten
by our customers under the terms of
our contracts. The Group’s annual
commitments under operating leases
are £93m, of which £55m arise in the
UK and Ireland. Across the Group
approximately 32 per cent of these
commitments were either fully or
partially underwritten by customers,
increasing to approximately 45 per
cent in the UK and Ireland. In
assessing the return on new projects
financed by operating leases the
Group attributes a memorandum
value to these underlying assets.
Other cash movements in the year
included £20.3m in respect of our
French acquisition, and the additional
payment of £17m into the Group
pension fund, further discussed below .
The net effect of these and other
cash flow movements was a slight
increase in year-end net debt, up
from £56.5m last year to £60.6m at
31 March 2006. The 31 March 2006
position is net of £29.8m of cash held
within our captive insurance
company to fund future insurance
claims (£33.5m at 31 March 2005).
The Group has therefore been able to
fund an infill acquisition and a cash
injection into the pension fund with
only a marginal increase in its net
debt position. We also propose a
double-digit percentage increase in >

Business review continued
Last year we said… 
…building momentum in
Continental Europe
This year…
In October 2005 Wincanton acquired
the principal French operations of
Premium Logistics. The acquisition,
when combined with Wincanton’s
existing Strasbourg-based activities,
gave Wincanton national coverage 
of the important French market, an
enhanced portfolio of customer
contracts and further strength and
depth of management resource. 
Annual revenue of the enlarged
French business is approximately 
€150 million. This represents a
substantially stronger and broader
business base from which
Wincanton can serve both 
the French and cross-border
requirements of its portfolio of blue-
chip customers and significantly
strengthens our operational
capabilities and customer portfolio 
in the important French market. 
the full-year dividend. This strong
cash flow performance is further
evidence of Wincanton’s ability to
generate significant liquidity from
both its operations and its asset base.
The Group’s committed banking
facilities were increased during the
year from £200m to £210m and the
facilities were amended to a fully
revolving basis with the maturity
extended to 2010, significantly
enhancing the flexibility of the
Group’s bank funding. £190m of this
committed facility was undrawn at 
31 March 2006. The Group also 
took advantage of low long-term
interest rates by raising $150m of 
7- and 10-year money in the US
private placement market. This
further extended the maturity of 
our committed borrowings on
attractive terms and gave a useful
diversification in our sources of
funding. The placement monies have
been swapped back into euros to
give a fixed cost of borrowings of
0.85 per cent over EURIBOR. In
addition to these committed facilities
the Group has available a range of
overdraft and leasing facilities. 
Through the year our borrowings are
drawn approximately two-thirds in
euros and one-third in sterling. The
Group has entered into an interest rate
cap to cover €100m of its potential
exposure to rising interest rates.
The interest rate and foreign
exchange positions of the Group are
subject to regular review. No
speculative trading is entered into
and all activities of the treasury
function are designed to support the
Group’s commercial operations.
Return on capital employed
Capital employed at 31 March 2006
was £122.9m, of which 35 per cent
related to our UK and Ireland
operations and 65 per cent to
Continental Europe. The return on
capital employed, at 34.2 per cent
represents an increase on last year’s
29.8 per cent. This rate of return is
believed to compare favourably with
the returns of our peer group.
Goodwill

and intangibles of £70.0m consists

Pensions
Following the results of the triennial
actuarial valuation of the principal
Wincanton pension scheme as at 
31 March 2005, the Group’s pension
policy and funding approach has been
subject to detailed review . A number of
changes to pension policy have been
considered and are currently subject
to consultation with employees. An
up-front injection of £40.0m in cash
to address the past service deficit of
the fund has been agreed with the
pension scheme trustees.
Incremental annual cash contributions
to further address the deficit, up
from £2.0m per annum to £8.0m 
per annum, have also been agreed.
£17.0m of the up-front contribution
was paid prior to the 2005/06 year end
and the balance of the payment was
made early in the new financial year . All
these incremental contributions are tax
deductible and will lead to a reduction
in the cash tax payable by Wincanton
in the future. Wincanton expects the
after-tax cost of the up-front
contribution to be substantially covered
by the proceeds of its programme of
disposal of surplus properties.
Following the up-front cash injection,
and subject to satisfactory
completion of the employee
consultation process, Wincanton
expects the actuarial deficit of the
pension scheme to be approximately
£70m. The principal issues that have
caused this increase in the deficit, 
up from approximately £15m as at 
31 March 2002, are investment
performance, lower bond yields and 
a change in assumptions to reflect
increased longevity. 
On an IAS 19 basis the pension fund
deficit of the scheme at 31 March
2006 was £116.3m. T aking account
of the up-front contributions made
just prior to and immediately after
the year end and the scheme
changes currently subject to
employee consultation, this deficit
would have been reduced to
approximately £73.0m.
Very careful consideration has been
given to the appropriate measures
required to respond to the growth in
the past service deficit and the costs
of future service accrual. It is believed
that both the steps being implemented
and those which remain subject to
consultation, which are facilitated 
by the strong cash flow generation 
of the Group, will address the deficit
prudently and progressively.
The currently low levels of bond
yields will increase the service cost
charged to operating profit for
pensions in 2006/07, partially offset
at the pre-tax level by the positive
effect on the Group interest charge 
of the up-front contribution and
investment returns.
PGN 
As explained in last year’s Annual
report, PGN, a jointly owned entity in
which Wincanton has a 50.0 per cent
stake, is in dispute with its sole
customer in respect of the early
termination of the contract. The
arbitration process, which includes
financial claims and counter-claims, 
is continuing, with the final outcome
unlikely to be known before mid-
2007. Wincanton’s share of the net
assets of PGN, which consist
principally of working capital, was
consolidated at £6.7m in the balance
sheet as at 31 March 2006. 
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS)
The Group has adopted IFRS in the
current financial year, as required by
the EU for all listed companies. The
Group published a full IFRS T ransition
statement in November 2005 to
explain the effect of the transition and
this is reproduced in note 31 to these
financial statements. The key areas
of impact for the Group of adoption
are, in common with most entities, 
in relation to jointly owned entities;
employee benefits (including
pensions); leases and share-based
payments. These are discussed in
detail in note 31 but in summary have
combined to reduce the comparative
underlying earnings of the Group for
the year ended 31 March 2005 from
17.5p to 16.3p and the net assets on
transition at 1 April 2004 from £25.6m
to £(3.7)m. The latter being primarily
the result of the recognition on the
balance sheet of the net pension
deficit of £25.7m, which is made up
of the IAS19 deficit of £69.9m offset
by the reversal of the SSAP 24
provision of £33.2m both net of
deferred tax. The adoption of IFRS
has had no impact on the cash flows
of the Group. 16 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 
Corporate responsibility
As in previous years, we have audited
all our UK and Ireland sites on SEE
issues. A number of the findings are
incorporated in this report.
Social 
As a service industry business 
social issues present both major
opportunities and risks to Wincanton.
Accordingly, the responsibility for all
such issues, policies and processes
lies with the Group HR Director who
is a Board member. 
Employees
The number of our employees has
grown over the past year to more
than 27,000 people, primarily driven
by the acquisition of Premium
Logistics in France in October 2005.
Of the total, some 21,600 work in the
UK where 15% of our workforce is
female and 10% come from ethnic
minority groups. 
We continue to place great importance
on all people-related issues and we
have well developed policies that are
applicable in all the countries in which
we operate. As always, developing
our people is critical and this year a
further 43,500 days of training were
completed. Our emphasis on
developing our management talent
continues and nearly 1,200 managers
have completed training and
development programmes. 
We launched a Home Computing
Initiative under the UK Government
scheme and over 2,000 of our people
participated in the scheme, purchasing
computers for domestic use. We
have also been recognised for the
quality of our Charity Payroll giving
scheme with a UK Government
award from Charities T rust. Our
people have this year raised over
£50,000 for local and national
charities and as part of Wincanton’s
support for T ransaid driver trainers
were sent to Nigeria. 
Health & Safety
Providing a safe working environment
for our people is always a priority for
Wincanton. This year has seen the
lost time accident rate continue to
reduce for the third year running in
Continental Europe and the sixth year
running in the UK and Ireland. 
Our Safety, Health & Environment
committee structure has been
reviewed and improved and good
progress has been made in aligning
minimum safety standards across the
UK& Ireland and Continental Europe.
Our key principles for Health &
Safety, which are established across
the UK & Ireland, are now being rolled
out into Continental Europe. 
We have been able to leverage the
strengths of our in-house specialists
to actively work with and advise the
Health & Safety Executive and trade
bodies such as the Freight T ransport
Association on matters affecting
national standards in the warehousing
and freight transport industries. 
Industrial relations
Our industrial relations skills,
particularly in the area of change
management, are a major asset to
the business, are well recognised by
our customers and help us to win and
renew business. Equally we
recognise that any industrial action 
or unrest could pose a risk to our
business and that of our customers,
so we work hard to ensure that such
risks are minimised.
We have established a European
Works Council that is the first 
of its kind within a UK business 
to encompass employee
representatives from those 
Central European counties recently
acceded to the European Union. 
This body aims to improve dialogue
and communications with our
employees and their representatives
on trans-national topics. 
Environmental 
Wincanton has maintained a high
standard of environmental
commitment over the years but we
believe that the risks to the business
need to be better understood. 
We are therefore currently
undertaking an environmental
examination and audit of our
activities and arrangements using
external advisors. 
Recycling
Environmental issues also provide 
a significant business opportunity 
for Wincanton. We have established
a national award winning recycling
business, first for fridges and more
recently for all Waste Electronic and
Electrical Equipment (WEEE). Last
T ransaid Nigeria
T wo Wincanton driver trainers spent
a week in Nigeria with T ransaid
training local commercial drivers, 
as part of a pioneering programme to
save the lives of pregnant mothers
and their children. Women in Nigeria
have a one in 40 chance of dying in
childbirth, compared to one in 7,000
in the UK and a lack of transport is
one of the main reasons for this. 
Wincanton continues to work to improve its understanding of the risks and
opportunities arising from Social, Ethical and Environmental (SEE) issues. 
We believe that the risks to the business from ethical issues are generally low 
whilst social and environmental issues present both risks and opportunities 
for us. These risks and opportunities are described in more detail below.  Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 17

contributor to the business. 
Our operations continue to meet and
exceed Government requirements
and we are engaged in the recycling
of significant tonnages of waste
materials either in our own right, 
or on behalf of our customers. 
Vehicles
Wincanton has almost 5,800 vehicles
that run over 500 million km for our
customers in the UK. We have
recently placed orders for the first
‘Euro 4’ standard vehicles that will be
delivered this year. Progressively we
expect these new vehicle standards
to result in improved carbon
emissions for our fleet. We have also
been trialling biodiesel fuels on our
transport operation for Air Products
and the results of this have been
encouraging; fuel efficiency has been
maintained with a significant
reduction in carbon emissions.
Driving
Wincanton employs around 8,000
drivers, one of the largest driver
workforces in the UK. This year we
have embarked on a major driver
training programme that has delivered
a 13.3% reduction in accidents and
we are achieving a performance
better than the national average. 
In support of this we aim to set
industry best practice for driver
recruitment, induction and ongoing
training. We will maintain our
standards through audits and
ensuring we have approved trainers,
mentors and assessors and for the
first time we are running a ‘Driver of
the Y ear’ competition in the UK. 
We believe that this programme is
good for everyone concerned and 
it is also providing a cost benefit to
the business.
Many of our drivers have participated
in the Freight Best Practice
Programme sponsored by the
Department for T ransport, and our
driver trainers are qualified under 
the Safe and Fuel Efficient Driving
T raining scheme. For example, on
one contract this has resulted in a 
7% reduction in fuel consumption
over a 12-month period.
Ethical 
Wincanton’s strategy is focused on
Europe and therefore we believe
that ethical issues pose a low risk to
the short- and long-term value of the
business. Our code of ethics is
published internally together with
our whistle-blowing policy and work
is being undertaken to ensure that
this is available and appropriate for
all our operations. This is the
responsibility of the Legal Director
and Company Secretary. 
WEEE recycling plant
In January Wincanton commissioned
its new state-of-the-art WEEE
recycling machine, in which it has
invested £4.5m. Capable of
processing up to 75,000 tonnes p.a.,
the equivalent of 826,500 washing
machines, 67m kettles or 536m
mobile phones the machine takes
waste electronic and electrical items
back to the basic material that can
be recycled.
Big T ruck Club
The ‘Big T ruck Club’ scheme is a new
road safety initiative that teaches
school children about the dangers that
heavy goods vehicles, as well as other
traffic, can present to pedestrians and
cyclists. The course provides a
valuable insight into road safety for
children and includes Wincanton
vehicles visiting schools to provide
children with a practical understanding
of road safety awareness. 18 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006

20 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 
The Directors present their Annual report and the audited financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
Principal activities
Wincanton is a contract logistics services business which designs,
implements and operates a range of supply chain management solutions.
Acquisition
In October 2005 the Group acquired Premium Logistics for £20.3m in cash.
Results and dividends
A review of the activities of the Group during the financial year and analyses 
of revenue and profit and an indication of likely future developments are
presented in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5 and the Business
review on pages 8 to 15, which are incorporated into this Directors’ report 
by reference. The Group profit attributable to shareholders for the financial
year amounted to £22.7m. An interim dividend of 3.94p per share was paid 
on 11 January 2006. Subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual General
Meeting (AGM) to be held on 20 July 2006, a final dividend of 8.60p per 
share will be paid on 11 August 2006 to those shareholders on the register 
of members of Wincanton plc at 14 July 2006. Under the requirements of
Adopted IFRS this dividend is not provided until declared and therefore a total
of £22.9m of retained profits have been added to reserves.
Policy and practice on payment of creditors 
The Group does not have a formal code that it follows with regard to payments
to suppliers. It agrees payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into
binding purchase contracts for the supply of goods and services. Its suppliers
are, in that way, made aware of these terms. The Group seeks to abide by
these payment terms when it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the
goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.
At the year end there were 54 days (2005: 56 days) purchases in the Group’s
trade payables.
Directors
The current Directors of the Company are shown on pages 18 and 19. Details of
corporate governance policy are set out on pages 21 to 23. Directors’ beneficial
interests in the Company’ s share capital as at 31 March 2006 and the date of this
report are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 24 to 27. At the
AGM, Wincanton plc will seek the election of J Cox who was appointed during
the year and re-election as Directors of A D Malpas and N Sullivan who are both
resigning under the rotation provisions of the Articles. The Company supports
their re-election.
Employees
The Group uses a number of ways to provide employees with information 
on matters of interest to them. These include an Annual report to employees
dealing with Group and segmental results, an intranet, a quarterly in-house
newsletter and briefing and consultative meetings.
In December 2005, a European Works Council was set up with the aim of
bringing together employee representatives from across Europe, so that 
they can be informed and consulted by management on the Group’s plans
and performance. Employee representatives are also able to meet their
colleagues from other countries, exchanging information about the Group and
working conditions across Europe.
The Group has established a variety of option schemes and share incentive
plans to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders and to
support Wincanton in the development of its business objectives. Grants of
options were last made in December 2005 under the Executive Schemes to
qualifying senior managers.
Wincanton is committed to a policy of equal opportunities in employment by
which the Group has and continues to:
• select, recruit, develop and promote the very best people basing its
judgement solely on suitability for the job;
• ensure that all applicants and employees receive fair and equal treatment
irrespective of sex, marital status, age, nationality, colour, race, ethnicity,
national origin, disability or gender reassignment;
• encourage diversity in its workforce, reflecting, where practicable, the
diversity of the working population;
• maintain a working environment free from sexual and racial harassment
and intimidation;
• ensure that all employment conditions and job requirements reflect its
commitment to equal opportunities.
Where people become disabled during the course of their employment,
every practical effort is made to retain their services, make adjustments and
to provide retraining if necessary. All employees are eligible for appropriate
training, career development and promotion and disabled people are not
treated any differently.
Political and charitable contributions
In accordance with its policy, the Group made no political contributions during
the year. Donations to charities amounted to £15,000 (2005: £28,000).
Share capital and reserves
Details of the authorised and issued share capital and reserves of the
Company are shown in note 23 to the accounts. 
Annual General Meeting 
At the AGM, the Directors of Wincanton plc will propose the following: 
to seek to renew the authority to disapply shareholders’ pre-emption rights 
in certain circumstances; to approve the Company’s power to buy back a
proportion of the Company’s share capital; to allow the Directors to allot
shares; and to approve the making of certain payments that may fall to be
classified as donations to political parties.
Substantial interests
At the date of this report, the Company has been notified by the following that
they hold a disclosable beneficial interest in 3% or more of the issued share
capital of the Company:
%
Legal and General Investment 3.97
AEGON UK plc 3.03
During the year the Company did not purchase any of its own shares, except
to meet its obligations to employees under the Share Incentive Plan. The only
own shares held throughout the year were 3.5m 10 pence shares held in the
Employee Benefit T rust, which represents 2.96% of the issued share capital.
Research and development
During the year the Group was active in the development of new products
and supply chain services to support current and future customer requirements.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Company and the Group overall have adequate resources to continue
operating for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, these financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985 and with corporate
governance best practice, separate resolutions for the re-appointment of
KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company and for the approval of their
remuneration are to be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
By order of the Board
C F Phillips, Secretary
Methuen Park, Chippenham, Wiltshire SN14 0WT
7 June 2006 agreed budget. The Board receives a monthly update on performance and
reviews significant variances on a monthly basis. All major investment
decisions are subject to post-completion reviews.
In line with agreed procedures, the Chairman has conducted interviews with
each Director and assessed their individual performance. The Chairman has
carried out an evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole and of
each Committee and led by the senior non-executive Director, the non-
executive Directors have assessed the performance of the Chairman. The
conclusions of those assessments have been presented to the Board by the
Chairman and the senior non-executive Director. The evaluation process is
designed to cover Board processes, the structure and capability of the Board,
strategic alignment, Board dynamics and the skills brought to the Board by
each Director.
The Board has approved a procedure for Directors to take, at the Company’s
expense, independent professional advice if necessary. In addition, the
Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary, who is charged by the Board with ensuring that Board procedures
are followed. Both the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary 
is a matter for the Board as a whole. The Company Secretary and HR Director
take joint responsibility for preparing and implementing an induction programme
for Board appointees, including guidance as to their duties, responsibilities
and liabilities as a Director of the Company and business familiarisation.
Business familiarisation involves Directors visiting sites in both the UK and
elsewhere in Europe giving the Directors the opportunity to meet senior
managers around the business. They also have the opportunity to discuss
organisational, operational and administrative matters. Every Director has
access to appropriate training as required subsequent to appointment. The
Company provides Directors and officers insurance cover, in line with normal
market practice, for the benefit of Directors in respect of claims arising in the
performance of their duties. 
The different roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged. 
A responsibility statement for each of those roles has been agreed with the
Chairman and Chief Executive respectively and adopted by the Board. The
non-executive Chairman is primarily responsible for the workings of the 
Board and ensuring that its strategic and supervisory role is achieved. The
Board is responsible for high-level decision making and approval of significant
expenditure and there is a formal listing of matters reserved for Board approval.
The Board has delegated appropriate responsibilities to the Chief Executive,
the Group Finance Director and the HR Director who are responsible for the
day-to-day running of the business, carrying out the agreed strategy and
implementing specific Board decisions relating to the operation of the Group.
Board Committees 
There are a number of standing Committees of the Board to which various
matters are delegated. The Committees all have formal T erms of Reference
that have been approved by the Board and that are available for inspection.
Brief details are set out below:
The Nomination Committee comprises D A Edmonds and G McFaull, under
the chairmanship of A D Malpas. The committee meets as necessary and is
responsible for considering and recommending to the Board persons who are
appropriate for appointment as Executive and non-executive Directors. There
is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new
Directors to the Board. This process involves the Nomination Committee
interviewing suitable candidates who are both proposed by existing Board
members and by an external search company. Careful consideration is given
Corporate governance
Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 21
Introduction
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
and supports the principles laid down in the revised Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (‘the Code’) as issued by the Financial Reporting Council
on 23 July 2003. This statement describes how the principles of the Code are
applied and reports on the Company’s compliance with the Code’s provisions.
Board of Directors
The Board currently has eight members, comprising the non-executive
Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, a further Executive
Director and four further non-executive Directors. All of the Directors bring
strong judgement to the Board’s deliberations. The Board is of sufficient size
and diversity that the balance of skills and experience is considered to be
appropriate for the requirements of the business. The non-executive Directors
are all independent of management and free from any business or other
relationship, including those relationships and circumstances referred to in
provision A.3.1 of the Code, that could materially interfere with the exercise
of independent and objective judgement. The Company considers that, on
appointment, the Chairman was independent (for the purposes of provision
A.3.1 of the Code) and furthermore the preceding comments regarding
freedom from business or other relationships also apply to him. The non-
executive Directors have each been appointed for a three-year term. The
senior non-executive Director is D A Edmonds. 
There was one appointment to the Board during the year; on 21 October
2005, J Cox was appointed as a non-executive Director. Also during the year
the Company entered the FTSE 250. At all times since then there has been a
majority of non-executive independent Directors on the Board, in compliance
with Combined Code provision A.3.2.
The biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 18 and
19. The Directors have all occupied, or occupy, senior positions in UK listed
companies (or, in the case of Dr W Hasselkus, German listed companies) and
have substantial experience in business. The non-executive Directors do not
participate in any of the Group’s pension schemes or in any of the Group’s
bonus, share option or other incentive schemes. All Directors must stand 
for election at the first AGM after they are appointed. The Articles provide 
that all Directors will stand for re-election at least every three years.
The Board is collectively responsible for the proper management of the
Company. The Board normally meets 10 times each financial year and has 
a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making, including the
approval of annual and interim results, annual budgets, material acquisitions
and disposals, material agreements and major capital commitments. The
Secretary maintains a record of attendance at Board meetings and Committee
meetings, further details of which are set out on page 22. The non-executive
Directors held separate meetings with the Chairman during the year without
the Executive Directors being present.
Board members are given appropriate documentation in advance of each
Board or Committee meeting. This normally includes a detailed report on current
trading and full papers on matters where the Board will be required to make
a decision or give its approval. Reports are presented to the Board periodically
on matters such as health and safety, pensions, insurance and treasury. 
Other specific business-related presentations are given when appropriate.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review, at least
annually, by the Board of medium-term plans and annual budgets for business
units. Each business unit reports monthly on its performance against its Corporate governance continued
to ensure that appointees have enough time available to devote to the role
and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is
maintained. When dealing with the appointment of a successor to the
Chairman, the senior non-executive Director will chair the Committee instead
of the Chairman. When the Committee has found a suitable candidate, the
chairman of the Committee will make a proposal to the whole Board and the
appointment is the responsibility of the whole Board following
recommendation from the Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee comprises J Cox, P G Cox, Dr W Hasselkus
and A D Malpas, under the chairmanship of D A Edmonds. It is responsible,
within a framework established by the Board overall, for setting the
remuneration of senior executives, including the Executive Directors and
senior management. It is also responsible for granting executive options,
long-term incentive plan awards, pension rights and any compensation
packages and determining the terms of any compensation package in the
event of early termination of the contract of any Director or senior executive.
It meets at least three times a year . Full details of its activities and of Directors’
remuneration are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 24 to
27. Those pages detail compliance with the legal requirements with regard to
remuneration matters. The Chairman of the Committee reports the outcome
of meetings to the Board.
The Audit Committee comprises J Cox, D A Edmonds, Dr W Hasselkus and 
A D Malpas under the chairmanship of P G Cox, who is the former Chief
Financial Officer and currently the Chief Executive of International Power plc
and, as such, he has the requisite recent and relevant financial experience.
The Committee is responsible for:
• reviewing the annual and interim financial statements before they 
are presented to the Board;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal control;
• agreeing internal and external audit plans;
• receiving reports from external auditors’ and from the Head of Internal
Audit and dealing with any significant control issues arising;
• monitoring and reviewing the external auditor’s independence and
objectivity and the effectiveness of the external audit process;
• making recommendations for the appointment, reappointment and
removal of the external auditors and approving their remuneration and
terms of engagement;
• developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the external
auditors to supply non-audit services, taking into account relevant ethical
guidance regarding the provision of such services by the external audit firm.
The Audit Committee also reviews the arrangements by which staff of the
Company may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in
matters of financial reporting or otherwise. The Committee’s objective is to
ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent
investigation of any such matters and for overseeing the appropriate follow-up
action, where required.
It is a specific responsibility of the Audit Committee to ensure that an appropriate
relationship is maintained between the Company and its Auditors. The
Company has a policy of controlling the provision of non-audit services by the
external auditors in order to maintain their independence and ensure that their
objectivity and independence are safeguarded. This control is exercised by
ensuring non-audit projects, where fees are expected to exceed £150,000,
are subject to the prior approval of the Chairman of the Audit Committee and
the Group Finance Director. If non-audit project fees are expected to exceed
£250,000 the prior approval of the Board is required. The Committee meets at
least three times each year. The Chairman of the Committee reports the
outcome of meetings to the Board and the Board receives the minutes of all
Audit Committee meetings.
The Audit Committee has met three times in the year and discharged 
its responsibilities as set out above through the matters considered at 
those meetings.
Attendance at meetings
The Company Secretary maintains a register of attendance of Directors at
Board and Committee meetings and the record of attendance during the year

22 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006  Shareholder relations
The Company is committed to maintaining good communications with
shareholders. Senior executives, including the Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director, have dialogue with individual institutional
shareholders in order to develop an understanding of their views. Although
the other non-executive Directors are available to major shareholders to listen
to their views, no such meetings have taken place during the year and, to that
extent, the Company has not complied with provision D1.1 of the code. T wice
a year general presentations are given to analysts and investors covering the
annual and interim results. The Company Secretary generally deals with
questions from individual shareholders. All shareholders have the opportunity
to ask questions at the Company’s AGM, which all Directors attend. At 
the AGM, the Chief Executive will give a statement on the Company’s
performance during the year, together with a statement on current trading
conditions. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees will be available to answer questions at the AGM. The Chairman
will advise shareholders on proxy voting details. In addition, the Group’s
website containing published information and press releases can be found 
at www.wincanton.co.uk.
Internal control
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and Auditors in connection
with the financial statements are explained on pages 28 and 29. The Board 
is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks
faced by the Group has been in place throughout the year which accords with
the T urnbull guidance on internal control. The Audit Committee has, as part 
of its review process, considered the Group’s system of internal control
throughout the year. The system of internal control is designed to manage
rather than eliminate risk of failure to meet business objectives, and can only
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The key elements of the control system are as follows:
• the Group has an organisational structure with established lines of
accountability as well as clearly defined levels of authority;
• the Group has issued manuals, including the Group’ s Code of Ethics, which
provide details of the key policies and procedures to be followed and the
overall environment in which the business is expected to operate;
• the Group has a system of control self-certification, that provides a
documented trail of accountability against the internal control policies 
and procedures. 
This process is facilitated by the Internal Audit Department who also provide 
a degree of assurance as to the operation and validity of the system of internal
control. These processes and systems continue to be extended to encompass
the sites and operations of the enlarged Group.
All types of risk applicable to the business are regularly reviewed. In addition, 
a formal risk assessment review is carried out on an annual basis to highlight
key risks to the business and to consider action that can reasonably and cost-
effectively be taken to reduce them. This review, which accords with the
Code, is considered by the Board. 
The Group’s Internal Audit Department is involved in the review and testing 
of the internal control system and of key risks across the Group in accordance
with the annual programme agreed with the Audit Committee and undertakes
from time to time ad-hoc assignments requested by senior executives or the
Audit Committee, the findings of which are discussed with the Audit Committee.
Compliance
The Directors consider that, with the exception of the one issue specifically
identified in this report, the Company has been in compliance with the
provisions of the Code throughout the year ended 31 March 2006 and to 
the date of this report. 
Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 23 Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Consideration of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration policy is set by the Board and is described below. Individual
remuneration packages are determined by the Remuneration Committee
within the framework of this policy. The names of the Directors who were
members of the Remuneration Committee during the period relevant to the
year ended 31 March 2006 are set out on page 22.
Except when matters concerning his own position are being considered,
the Chief Executive is normally invited to attend the meetings to assist the
Committee. Any matter affecting the Chairman would be discussed by the
Remuneration Committee without the Chairman present. The terms of
appointment of J Cox were agreed by the Remuneration Committee during
the year.
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice where it
considers it appropriate. During the year such advice was received from
PricewaterhouseCoopers who were appointed by the Committee and who also
provided similar advice to the Company in respect of other senior managers.
Remuneration policy
The Committee gives full consideration to the following:
• the importance of recruitment, motivation and retention 
of high-quality management;
• the culture of linking reward to overall corporate and individual 
employees’ performance.
The Remuneration Committee monitors practices in other companies 
to ensure that it remains in touch with current best practice in the market,
whilst accepting its obligations to continue to honour pre-existing 
contractual commitments.
The base salaries of Executive Directors are, and will continue to be, 
reviewed annually, having regard to personal performance, Group and
business unit performance and competitive market practice, supported 
by research through external independent surveys. 
Subject to an overriding discretion by the Remuneration Committee, after
taking an overall view of the Company’s performance, annual bonuses may
be earned by Executive Directors based on the achievement of pre-agreed
targets for profit after tax (excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles,
impairment of goodwill and exceptionals) in the year, and the Remuneration
Committee’s assessment of strategic and personal performance. The
maximum bonus was raised and is capped at 75% of basic salary following
consultation with major shareholders.
The current Executive Share Option Schemes are set up generally in
accordance with guidelines published by the bodies representing institutional
investors. When Executive Scheme grants are made, a performance
condition is set by the Remuneration Committee, which must normally 
be met before any executive options can be exercised.
The performance condition used for all grants of executive options, being
those made in June & September 2001, July & December 2002, March &
December 2004 and July & December 2005 requires that, before any such
options can normally be exercised, the average annual growth in the Group’s
underlying earnings per share as published in the audited accounts must, 
in a three-year period equal or exceed the average annual growth in the
Government’s Retail Price Index plus 3.0% over the same period. 
The relevant three-year periods are, for each of these groups of option grants, 
as follows:
Date of Grant Exercise Period
June & September 2001 any three consecutive financial years within 
the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006
July & December 2002 any three consecutive financial years within 
the period 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2007
March 2004 the three consecutive financial years ended 
31 March 2006
December 2004 the three consecutive financial years ended 
31 March 2007
July & December 2005 the three consecutive financial years ended 
31 March 2008
These performance conditions are considered appropriate and in line with
market practice. They seek to achieve commonality of goals between option
holders and shareholders. Performance conditions are monitored via the
publication of the underlying basic earnings per share figures in the annual
accounts and through regular review of Executive Directors’ performance 
by the Remuneration Committee.
The grant of executive options is on a discretionary basis within the limits 
set down in the rules of the Executive Share Option Schemes with emphasis
on performance and job responsibilities. It is the policy of the Committee to
consider carefully the need to incentivise senior management and the spread
of time over which options are granted to ensure an appropriate long-term
incentive. The Committee keeps under review the structure and mix of
incentives overall.
Executive options held at 31 March 2006 were granted under the Executive
Share Option Schemes 2001. Save in respect of those granted before 
31 March 2003, executive options do not have the benefit of re-testing
against the performance condition. Other than in respect of the Sharesave
Option Scheme, options are not granted at a discount. 
Directors’ contracts 
The Executive Directors, other than N Sullivan, have each entered into a
service contract dated 23 March 2001. P Bateman’s service contract was
dated and commenced on 9 October 2002 and he retired on 14 December
2005. N Sullivan’s service contract is dated 7 November 2002 and his
employment commenced on 5 November 2002. He was appointed an
Executive Director of the Company with effect from 1 January 2004. Each 
of the Executive Directors may terminate his service contract on six months’
notice, whereas the notice period receivable from the Company is 12 months. 
The termination conditions for Executive Directors under these continuing
service contracts are as follows: 12 months’ basic salary together with
compensation for the value of other benefits to which he is entitled for the
period of 12 months from the date on which employment terminated. It is
intended that future appointments to the Board will have notice periods of 
12 months or less, except where longer periods are required in order to
attract appropriate candidates. Although in such cases, it would be expected
that the notice period reduce to 12 months or less following the expiry of the
initial period.
The Executive Directors are each entitled to the following benefits pursuant to
their service contracts: a company car or a car allowance in lieu of a company
car , company sick pay in accordance with Wincanton’ s sick pay and absence
policy, 25 days’ paid holiday, the right to participate in Wincanton’ s private health
insurance arrangements and payment of the annual membership subscription
to a relevant professional body. During the year A D Malpas assumed the role of
non-executive Chairman, in succession to V W Benjamin, such appointment
taking effect from the end of the AGM on 21 July 2005. He is entitled to a fixed
fee of £115,000 per annum and no other benefits. The appointment may be
terminated by either Wincanton or the Chairman giving six months’ notice. For
the period prior to his retirement at the AGM, V W Benjamin was entitled to a
fixed fee at the rate of £100,000 per annum, the use of a company car and no
other benefits.
24 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006  The non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, received a basic fee 
of £40,000 each per annum, (increased from £30,000 per annum on 1 October
2005), and Chairmen of Committees received a fee of £7,500 per annum per
Committee (increased from £5,000 per annum on 1 October 2005). The
appointments of A D Malpas and P G Cox were originally made for a three-year
term, under letters dated 4 June 2001, on which date their appointments
commenced. Those appointments were each renewed, on the same terms, 
for a further period of three years on 8 June 2004. The letter of appointment of
Dr W Hasselkus is dated 22 December 2003 and his appointment commenced
on 1 January 2004, also for a three-year term. The letter of appointment of 
D A Edmonds is dated 14 December 2004 and his appointment commenced 
on that date, also for a three-year term. The letter of appointment of J Cox is
dated 21 October 2005 and his appointment commenced on that date, also 
for a three-year term. These appointments may be terminated by either the
Company or the non-executive Director giving 12 months’ notice.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any incentive, pension or
benefit schemes and their appointments are subject to a performance review
every year.

Resigned on 7 February 2006. Bonus included as part of severance arrangements as noted below.
Those Directors receiving the performance bonus are required to take at least
25% of that entitlement as shares under the terms of the Share Match
Incentive Scheme 2003 (see details below).
Under the terms of the Share Match Incentive Scheme 2003, as approved by
shareholders at the AGM in 2003, Directors who have earned a performance
bonus in the year are required to apply 25% of their annual bonus to acquire
shares. Those shares are lodged with the Scheme trustees and, subject to
satisfying the performance condition set at the date of the initial award, the
lodged shares are then matched, on a one-for-one basis, with free shares at
the end of a three-year qualifying period. Directors also have a discretion to
purchase shares with all or part of the balance of the bonus for a further award
of matched shares at the end of the three-year qualifying period, but on a two-
for-one basis, subject to a more stringent performance condition, also set at
the date of the initial award.
Under the terms of the Share Match Incentive Scheme 2003, in June 2005
the following Executive Directors acquired shares, which are included in the
table on this page and became entitled to the following matching shares
subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions.

200 Directors’ remuneration report continued
Executive Directors (other than P Bateman) are members of the Wincanton Defined Benefit Scheme which is now closed to new entrants. Executive
Directors are generally eligible for a pension of up to two-thirds of base salary at normal retirement age of 60 normally after 20 years of qualifying service 
(for which purpose previous service with Uniq plc will qualify). The Directors’ current ages are stated on pages 18 and 19. Pensions for Executive Directors
(other than P Bateman) were provided on a non-contributory basis so far as possible through the Wincanton Scheme or, in respect of G D Connell, G McFaull,
and N Sullivan (who are subject to the statutory earnings cap on pensionable earnings), through the use of unfunded arrangements, to provide broadly similar
benefits. The Company is in consultation with members of the Scheme to introduce changes, including to the levels of contributions, to take effect from 
1 April 2006. This may result in contributions being made by the Executive Directors. P Bateman received an additional payment of £75,000 (2005: £87,000),
which was subject to both tax and national insurance deduction, equal to 25% (2005: 25%), of his base salary that forms part of the total remuneration shown
against his name in the table on page 25. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any Group pension arrangement.
The value of bonuses, other benefits and share options or other long-term incentives do not form part of pensionable salary. The pension scheme and/or
purchased life policies provide for the payment of benefits on death or disability. On death, a two-thirds spouse’s pension is due. Children’s allowances 
to a maximum, including spouse’s pension, of 100% of the Executive’s pension may be payable.
During the year there was a change in market conditions which has led to an increase in transfer values for the majority of the Directors. P H Brown’s transfer
value has reduced due to a change in his personal circumstances.
26 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 
It is Group policy not to give Directors expense allowances, but to reimburse them for all expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. P H Brown left
the Company on 31 March 2006 under a compromise agreement. The total value of his severance arrangements was £554,000 made up of 12 months salary,
including benefits, bonus and pension, to which he is entitled and, an additional payment of £86,000 into his pension to augment benefits for a further year
negotiated as a result of arrangements entered into in 2002 to secure his services in Continental Europe. Other than as disclosed, none of the Directors received
compensation for loss of office in either the current or preceding year. Benefits relate principally to the provision of company cars and medical insurance cover. 
P H Brown received an overseas living allowance of £17,000 (2005: £17,000), which is included in the table on page 25.
G D Connell is a non-executive Director of Pennon Group plc. The retention of the fees of £38,500 for the year ended 31 March 2006 (2005: £35,000) by him has
been approved.

Resigned on 7 February 2006.
Details of the performance criteria of these options are given on page 24 under Remuneration policy. Grants of options to Executive Directors are, 
in the absence of exceptional circumstances, limited to a single multiple of their individual annual salary at the time of the grant.
On his retirement P Bateman waived his entitlement, created at the time of his appointment, to a further grant of share options, equal to approximately 
one year’s salary. 
The Company’s register of Directors’ interests (which is open to inspection) contains full details of Directors’ shareholdings, options and awards. No options
were exercised by Directors in the year ended 31 March 2006 except for certain of those held by P Bateman and P H Brown which were exercised after their
ceasing to be a Board member, and there have been no changes in the number of share options held by them between 1 April 2006 and 7 June 2006.
The highest and lowest prices of the Company’s shares during the year were 361.0p and 217.25p respectively. The price at the year end was 321.5p.

Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 27 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the Group
and parent Company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law
and regulations. 
UK company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the
parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting
Standards (UK GAAP). 
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as adopted by
the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of the Group.
The Companies Act 1985 provides, in relation to such financial statements,
that references in the relevant part of the Act to financial statements, giving 
a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation. 
The parent Company financial statements are required by law to give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing each of the
Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company
financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent Company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the parent Company’s auditors are unaware; and each
Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to
make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the parent Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for
preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration report and corporate
governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
28 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006  We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements 
(the ‘’financial statements’’) of Wincanton plc for the year ended 31 March
2006 which comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement of
recognised income and expense, the Group and parent Company balance
sheets, the Group statement of cash flows, and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body , in accordance
with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’ s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and the Group
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for
preparing the parent Company financial statements and the Directors’
remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting
Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ‘UK GAAP’) are set
out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities on page 28. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a
true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes the
information presented in the Chairman’s statement and Business review
which are cross referenced from the Directors’ report. We also report to you
if, in our opinion the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or 
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 31 March 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
• the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of 
the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2006;
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and as regards the Group financial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; 
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial
statements.

Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 33 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 Accounting policies
Statement of compliance
Wincanton plc is a company incorporated in the UK. The Group’s consolidated
financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the ‘Group’), plus proportionately consolidate the
Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities and equity account the Group’s
interest in associates.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by
the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and by the EU (Adopted IFRS). 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosure’ was issued in August 2005 to
enhance the disclosure in respect of financial instruments, and is effective for
years commencing on or after 1 January 2007. IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether
an arrangement contains a lease’ was issued in December 2004 and is
effective for years commencing on or after 1 January 2006. 
Wincanton has opted not to adopt IFRS 7 early as it relates only to disclosure.
In 2006 IFRS 7 would not have affected the balance sheet or income
statement as the standard is concerned only with disclosure. The Group 
plans to adopt it in the year ended 31 March 2008. 
IFRIC 4 has been adopted with effect from 1 April 2006 and will lead to
additional disclosure in respect of operating leases in the Group financial
statements to 31 March 2007.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; these are
presented on pages 66 to 69 and these present information about the
Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
Basis of preparation
The Group and parent Company financial statements are presented in pounds
sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. They are prepared on the
historical cost basis except where assets or liabilities are required to be stated
at their fair value.
The preparation of Group financial statements under Adopted IFRS and
parent Company financial statements under UK Accounting Standards
requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions
to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate 
is revised and/or in future periods if applicable. Judgements made by
management in the application of Adopted IFRS that have significant effect
on the Group financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of
material adjustment in the next year are discussed in the relevant notes to 
the Group financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these Group financial statements and in preparing an
opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 for the purposes of the transition
to Adopted IFRS. The principal exception is that, as more fully explained
below, financial instruments accounting is determined on different bases 
in 2006 and 2005 due to the transitional provisions for IAS 32 and IAS 39
contained in IFRS 1.
T ransition to Adopted IFRS
The Group is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted
IFRS for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1 ‘First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’. An explanation 
of how the transition to Adopted IFRS has affected the reported financial
position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group is provided 
in note 31.
In addition to the exemption from the requirement to restate comparatives 
for IAS 32 and IAS 39, IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full
requirement of IFRSs in the transition period. The following exemptions 
have been taken by Wincanton and reflected in these financial statements:
• business combinations – Business combinations that took place prior 
to transition on 1 April 2004 have not been restated;
• cumulative translation differences – Cumulative translation differences 
for all investments in foreign operations have been set to zero on transition
at 1 April 2004.
The effect of taking these exemptions is explained more fully below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Group financial statements include the financial statements
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to the balance sheet
date. When the Company acquired the Wincanton group of companies upon
demerger from the former parent in May 2001, the changes in group structure
were accounted for using the principles of merger accounting available under
UK GAAP at the time. Businesses acquired or disposed of since then have
been accounted for using acquisition accounting principles from or up to the
date control passed.
Wincanton has elected to apply the exemptions under IFRS 1 neither to
restate any pre-transition business combinations under IFRS 3 nor to identify
the translation differences arising prior to 1 April 2004 and to attribute these 
to the result of any disposals of those entities. Acquisitions post-transition
have been accounted for under IFRS 3 and translation differences arising
since 1 April 2004 will be separately identified and accounted for. 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when
the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or
convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries
are included in the consolidated financial statements from or up to the date
that control passed.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but
not control. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share
of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted
basis, from or up to the date that significant influence passes. When the
Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is
discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group
has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated
financial statements include the Group’s proportionate share of the assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses which are included with items of a similar
nature on a line-by-line basis, from or up to the date that joint control passes.
34 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006  Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and
expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions
with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent 
of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the
same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence
of impairment.
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase
method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries,
associates and jointly controlled entities. In respect of acquisitions that have
occurred since the transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis 
of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP .
The exemption under IFRS 1 has been applied and the classification and
accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 
1 April 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening 
IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses (see below). Goodwill 
is allocated to cash-generating units and under Adopted IFRS is no longer
amortised but is tested annually for impairment (see below). In respect of
associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount
of the investment in the associate.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets arising under a business combination (acquired intangible
assets) are capitalised at fair value as determined at the date of acquisition
and are stated at that fair value less accumulated amortisation (see below)
and impairment losses (see below).
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets from the date they are
acquired. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer relationships 8 to 15 years
Software rights 1 to 5 years
T rademarks and logos 1 to 5 years
The cost of computer software purchased or developed in house which has
the capacity to generate economic benefits for a period in excess of one year
is capitalised as an intangible asset. Amortisation is charged to the income
statement on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
Computer software costs 3 to 5 years
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less
accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see below).
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable costs, including
appropriate commissioning costs. The cost of financing the construction of
major properties is included in their capitalised cost. The interest rate applied
represents the actual finance costs incurred on the funds borrowed
specifically to construct the asset.
Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at deemed
cost, being an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value
of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated
depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see below). Lease
payments are accounted for as described in the accounting policy on
expenses. Finance leases are those under the terms of which the Group
assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Subsequent expenditure
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and
equipment the costs incurred in replacing part of such an item if it is probable
that the future economic benefits will flow to the Group and when the cost
can be measured reliably. All other such costs, including the derecognition of
the replaced part of the item, are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and
equipment. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are
as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Short leasehold improvements life of lease
Plant and equipment, furniture and fittings 5 to 25 years
Office machinery and computers 3 to 5 years 
Motor vehicles 5 to 10 years
The range of useful economic lives given reflects the fact that assets held for
specific contracts are depreciated over the lives of those contracts.
The residual value of tangible assets, if significant, is reassessed annually.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in
acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and
condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less selling expenses.
T rade and other receivables
T rade and other receivables are stated at their fair value on initial recognition
(discounted if material) and subsequently at amortised cost, i.e. less any
impairment losses (see below).
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash 
and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
T rade and other payables
T rade and other payables are stated at fair value at initial recognition and
subsequently at amortised cost.
Foreign currency
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences
arising on such translation are recognised in the income statement. 
Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 35 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair
value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at the
foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and
expense of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating
the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in a
separate component of equity.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available in IFRS 1 to deem
the cumulative translation differences for all investments in foreign operations
to be zero at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to Adopted IFRS. Exchange
differences arising after 1 April 2004 from the translation of the net investment
in foreign operations, and of related hedges are taken to a translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal. 
Employee benefits 
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension
schemes. The assets of these schemes are held separately from those 
of the Group.
Defined contribution schemes
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes 
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current
and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine the present value,
and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. The discount rate is the
yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rate bonds that have maturity
dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation 
is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
When the benefits of a scheme are improved, the portion of the increased
benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until
the benefits become vested. T o the extent that the benefits vest immediately
the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to
Adopted IFRS, have been recognised in equity under the provisions of IAS 19
‘Employee Benefits’ (Revised). Any actuarial gains and losses that arise
subsequent to 1 April 2004 in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect 
of a scheme are recognised in full through equity through the statement of
recognised income and expense.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset
is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the scheme or
reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Share-based payment transactions
From 1 April 2004 the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-
based Payments’ to the grants of options made under the Executive and
Sharesave option schemes. In accordance with the transition provisions,
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that had not
vested as at 1 January 2005.
The Group issues options under these equity-settled share-based incentive
schemes to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of
grant. The fair value determined is expensed on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually
vest. This estimate is revised each year to take account of changes in non-
market circumstances.
The Directors have established that fair value is most appropriately measured
by the use of a Binomial pricing model. The expected life used in the model
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A number of shares in the Company are held in trust on behalf of employees
who hold options under the Group’ s equity–settled share based incentive
schemes. Such shares are held by an employee benefit trust and are treated
as treasury shares and shown in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. 
Other share schemes
Shares awarded on a matching basis to employees participating in the
Company’s Share Incentive Plan are purchased at the prevailing market rate
and charged to the income statement each period as the employee makes 
an eligible contribution. The shares purchased are held in a separately
administered trust.
Under the terms of the Company’s Share Match Scheme the expected
market price of matching shares to be awarded to participating employees 
is recognised in the income statement over the period of qualification set by
the Scheme. The shares purchased are held in a separately administered
offshore trust.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows.
The Group provides for insurance claims on an appropriate discounted basis
depending on the expected timing of their settlement. Provision is made for
the estimated costs of claims arising from past events based on the advice 
of the Group’s external insurance advisors. 
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists,
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The two exceptions are dealt
with as per the separate applicable accounting policy. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset
or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses
are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in
respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the amount of
goodwill allocated to the applicable cash generating unit and then to reduce
the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A cash
generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates
cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other
assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost
is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted
at the original effective interest rate inherent in the asset. Receivables with 
a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value. For an asset that does not generate
largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
36 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006  Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. An impairment loss
in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed only to the
extent that the carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined if no impairment loss has been recognised and
if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment was recognised.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement on
the delivery of those services based on the proportion of the total delivered 
at the balance sheet date. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in
the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership
have been transferred to the buyer. 
Certain distribution contracts oblige Wincanton to purchase goods from third
parties and sell them on to the customer at cost. As Wincanton is rewarded
for the physical distribution service provided acting only as an agent in these
buy/sell transactions, and as the sale and purchase of the goods have no
impact on the operating profit, the amounts invoiced to customers and
charged by suppliers for the sale and purchase of these goods are excluded
from revenue and cost of sales. T rade and other receivables and payables
relating to such transactions are included in the balance sheet. 
Expenses
Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the
total lease expense.
For finance leases the minimum lease payments are apportioned between
the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance
charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable and other charges less 
interest income.
Interest payable on borrowings is calculated using the effective interest 
rate method. Other charges include bank charges and commission costs,
discounts unwound, and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised
in the income statement (see hedging accounting policy below). 
Interest income includes interest receivable on funds invested and gains on
hedging instruments, and these are recognised in the income statement as
they accrue.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in
the income statement using the constant periodic rate of return method.
Lastly, net financing costs include the expected return on defined benefit
pension scheme assets less the interest on defined benefit pension 
scheme obligations.
Taxation
T ax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax and is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to
items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date,
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing 
for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial
recognition of goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and
differences relating to accumulated profits of overseas subsidiaries to the
extent that they will probably not be distributed. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement 
of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s geographical
segments, being the primary segmentation format based on the Group’s
management and internal reporting structure. As the secondary segment 
is the business of providing contract logistics services which encompasses
the entire scope of Wincanton’s operations no further segment analysis 
is required.
The geographical segments are those distinguishable components of the
Group that are engaged in providing services within a particular economic
environment which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from
those of other segments.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to
foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing
and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted
for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments which are accounted for as trading instruments
are recognised initially and subsequently stated at fair value. The gain or loss
on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income
statement. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting,
recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item
being hedged (see page 38).
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group
would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking
into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the
swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their
quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of 
the quoted forward price.
Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 37 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, or of a highly probable forecast
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial
instrument is recognised directly in equity. 
Where the forecast transaction is in respect of a non-financial asset or liability
when it occurs the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and
included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non financial asset
or liability.
Where the forecast transaction is in respect of a financial asset or liability
when it occurs the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income
statement immediately or over the same period that the financial asset or
liability affects the income statement (i.e. when interest income or expense 
is recognised if the derivative is an interest rate swap). 
For cash flow hedges other than those covered by the preceding two policy
statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity
and recognised in the same period or periods during which the hedged
forecast transaction affects the income statement.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement immediately. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting but the hedged transaction still is
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity
and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction
occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the
income statement immediately.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm
commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised
immediately in the income statement. The carrying value of the hedged item is
adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged
(even it if is normally carried at cost or amortised cost) and any gains or losses
on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement
(even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves).
Hedge of net investment in foreign operation
Where a foreign currency liability hedges a net investment in a foreign
operation, foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the liability
are recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective position is recognised
immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement
when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities
Where a derivative financial instrument is used to economically hedge the
foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no
hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is
recognised in the income statement.
Effect of first time adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 
not to restate corresponding amounts in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Instead the following policies were applied in the comparative period in
respect of Group investments in debt and equity securities, derivative financial
instruments and hedging:
In the comparative period, other than the following exceptions, all financial
assets and financial liabilities were carried at cost (amortised as appropriate)
less, in the case of financial assets, provision for any permanent diminution in
value. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts treated as
hedging instruments were not recognised in the income statement. On
recognition of the hedged transaction the unrecognised gains and losses
arising on the instrument were recognised in the income statement. Interest
differentials arising from interest rate swaps were recognised by adjusting
net interest payable or receivable over the period of the contract.
The only adjustment necessary to implement these revised accounting
policies as at 1 April 2005 is the recognition of the fair value of the Group’s
interest rate swaps. The resultant adjustment to net assets of £0.1m after
tax has been taken through the 2006 statement of recognised income and
expense. Corresponding amounts for 2005 are presented and disclosed 
in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, FRS 13 
and FRS 4. 
Had IAS 32 and 39 been adopted for the comparative period the only
adjustment arising would have been the recognition of the fair value of 
the Group’s interest rate swaps in the year.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between
cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared
and approved, or paid.
38 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006  2 Segment information
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’ s geographical segments, being the primary segmentation format based on the Group’ s management
and internal reporting structure. As the secondary segment is the business of providing contract logistics services which encompasses the entire scope of
Wincanton’s operations, no further segment analysis is required.
The Group operates in two principal geographical areas, the United Kingdom & Ireland, and mainland Continental Europe. In presenting information on the basis
of geographical segments, segment revenue and assets are based on the geographical location of the business operations. 
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) which are identified according to geographical segment as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
UK & Ireland 22.1 22.1
Continental Europe 30.4 18.8
52.5 40.9
Included in the Continental Europe goodwill in the above table is £11.3m in respect of Premium Logistics which, as it was acquired in the year, is still capable of
separate testing for impairment.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations are cash flow projections based on the financial budgets
and, in respect of Premium, forecasts approved by the Board for the forthcoming financial year and beyond. Cash flows beyond those 12- and 36- month periods
are extrapolated over a further 19 or 17 years respectively using the estimated growth rates and underlying inflation rates stated below, which do not exceed the
long-term average growth and inflation rates in the specific geographical areas where the CGU operates. A 20-year cash flow projection period is viewed as
appropriate when considering the value in use of goodwill.
Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:

The other provisions are held primarily in respect of leasehold property liabilities and for restructuring costs. The provisions for leasehold liabilities are
determined by management as the best estimate of the expected costs of empty and under-utilised properties and are utilised over the relevant lease terms.
The restructuring provisions are similarly determined and are expected to be utilised in the current financial year.
The Group holds 100% of the share capital of a captive insurer whose functions are to both insure and reinsure certain of the risks of the Group. The insurance
provisions in the above table are held in respect of outstanding insurance claims, the majority of which are expected to be paid within two to six years. The
discount unwinding arises on the employers’ liability policy which is discounted over a period of seven years at a rate based on the Bank of England base rate. 
The assets of the captive insurer consist of cash deposits held with various banks, typically on three month fixed interest deposits, see note 28.

22 Acquisitions
Current year acquisitions
On 7 October 2005 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Premium Logistics (now renamed Wincanton S.A.S.) for £20.3m in cash. The acquired
company provides contract logistics services in France and in the six months since acquisition contributed £1.2m of operating profit. If the acquisition had
occurred on the first day of the year it is estimated that the totals of Group underlying operating profit and revenue would have been approximately £43m 
and £1,848m respectively.
The acquisition has given rise to a value of goodwill of £11.3m, being the difference between the cash consideration paid and the net assets acquired 
at fair value.
The acquired net assets at acquisition are summarised in the table below:

Net identifiable assets and liabilities 7.4 1.6 9.0
Goodwill on acquisition 11.3
Consideration payable including expenses of £1.2m 20.3
Net debt acquired 2.1
Net cash outflow 22.4
The fair value adjustments above are required to align the accounting policies of the acquired business with those of the Group. These adjustments can, 
if necessary, be amended for up to 12 months following acquisition. Goodwill of £11.3m has arisen on the acquisition reflecting the strategic importance 
of broadening Wincanton’s business base in France and achieving national coverage in that important logistics market, the value of the management 
and workforce and some of the expected synergies to be gained as the acquired entity is fully integrated into the Group.
Following the acquisition of a 26.0 per cent interest in PSL T rans European Spedition und Logistik GmbH (PSL) in December 2002, the Group increased 
its shareholding by 74.0 per cent in April 2005 for consideration of £0.1m, resulting in an increase in goodwill of £0.6m (note 9).

During the year the Company issued shares, under both the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Sharesave Scheme, for consideration at the applicable
exercise prices shown in note 27. During the year ended 31 March 2002, the Company established a Capital Redemption Reserve of £49,998 on redemption 
of redeemable preference shares.
The cumulative amount of goodwill eliminated against reserves, as previously accounted for under UK Accounting Standards, at 31 March 2006 and 2005 
was £56.2m.
The aggregate current and deferred tax relating to income and expenses taken directly to or transferred from equity is £19.3m (2005: £2.8m).

At 31 March 2006 the authorised share capital comprised 159,999,980 (2005:159,999,980) ordinary shares of 10p each.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
All shares rank equally with regard to the Company’s residual assets. In respect of the Company’s shares that are held by the Group (see below), all rights are
suspended until these shares are reissued.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose from the original acquisition of the then Wincanton group of companies by Wincanton plc on the demerger from the previous parent
in May 2001, which was accounted for under merger accounting principles.
T ranslation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as from
the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
IFRS 2 reserve
The IFRS 2 reserve comprises the charges made to the income statement in respect of share based payments under the Group’s share option schemes.
Own shares
The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by the Group. At both 31 March 2006 and 2005 the Group held
3,500,000 of the Company’s shares within an Employee Benefit T rust established in Jersey and managed on the Company’s behalf by independent trustees.

The employee benefit liabilities of the Group consist primarily of the post-retirement obligations of the Group’s pension arrangements. In addition certain
employment contracts of employees in the Group give rise to holiday pay obligations which are deferred at the accounting year end due to the relative 
timing of the annual holiday year. These two elements are analysed in the table below and the pension arrangements discussed in detail:

Pension schemes
Employees of Wincanton plc participated in funded and unfunded pension arrangements in the UK and Ireland and elsewhere in Europe during the year ended
31 March 2006, details of these are given below. 
The principal Wincanton Scheme in the UK has three defined benefit sections, plus a defined contribution section called the Wincanton Retirement Savings
Section. The employees of Wincanton Ireland Limited are eligible to participate in a separate defined contribution scheme. Assets of these pension arrangements
are held in separate trust funds independent of Wincanton. Additionally a small number of senior employees, who are subject to the statutory earnings cap on
pensionable earnings, are entitled to participate in an unfunded unapproved arrangement, which generally replicates the benefits that would otherwise be
payable from the Scheme had they not been subject to the earnings cap. The pension cost in relation to the defined benefit sections of the Wincanton Scheme
is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method. 
52 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006  The latest formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2005 by Hymans Robertson and as a result, the Group in consultation with the pension fund
trustees and Scheme actuary has agreed a series of measures to address both the actuarial past service deficit and the level of future service cost of the Group’s
defined benefit scheme. The measures in respect of the cost of future service accrual remain subject to consultation with employees.
An incremental cash contribution of £40m (approximately £28m net of corporation tax) has been made in two instalments, one before the end of the financial year
and the second early in the new financial year . Following the up-front contribution, the actuarial past service deficit, which has increased primarily as a consequence
of increased longevity assumptions, will be approximately £70m (approximately £49m net of deferred tax). The past service deficit will be further addressed through
an increase in incremental cash contributions, with effect from April 2006, from £2m per annum currently to £8m per annum. Lastly Company contributions
were increased from 13.6% to 14.6% of pensionable salaries for the main category of employee with effect from 1 April 2006. Different rates apply for other
smaller employee categories.
In addition, contributions are made to a number of smaller pension arrangements for employees elsewhere in Europe and Wincanton has assumed liability for
certain historic unfunded pension obligations of the German business which closed to future service in the 1980s. The pension charge in respect of this
arrangement represents interest on the unfunded obligations.
Following the acquisitions of Premium Logistics and PSL (see note 22), Wincanton assumed liability for their pension obligations. A provision of £0.8m is
included in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2006, which represents the present value of the expected future payments due.
Pension scheme deficit
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes of the Group are calculated in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and are set out in the 
table below.
The calculations under IAS 19 are based on actuarial assumptions which are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible assumptions about the long-
term future which, unless by chance, will not necessarily be borne out in practice. The fair value of the assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short
term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long
periods and are thus inherently uncertain.

Net pension liabilities (81.4) (26.2) (107.6) (67.0)
The movement in the deficit in the year was primarily a result of an increase in liabilities, due to the adoption of the most recent mortality tables in the actuarial
assumptions, offset by a further improvement in market value of the Scheme assets.

The expected rates of return on the Wincanton Scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices. The overall expected rate of return of 6.47% 
is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the Scheme’s investment portfolio, net of investment management
expenses. The assets of the Scheme are currently held in the following proportions; equities (58%), corporate bonds (26%), government bonds (12%) and other (4%).

to the date of grant. 
The number and weighted average exercise price of all share options extant under the Executive and Sharesave Schemes are as follows:

Exercisable at the end of the period 1,249,216 190 1,680,070 190
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 324p (2005: 252p). The options outstanding 
at 31 March 2006 had a range of exercise prices of 152p to 335p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of seven years.
On transition to Adopted IFRS, the grants of options since 7 November 2002 are required to be accounted for under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’, 
which requires the fair value of services received in return for share options granted to be recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.
The fair value of these services is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted which is estimated using a Binomial pricing model.
The 10- year contractual life of the options and the expectation of early exercise are incorporated into the model. The other key inputs used in the model 
for options granted in the current and prior-year are as follows:
2006 2005
Weighted average price at grant date 334p 269p
Expected volatility 27.0% 27.0%
Expected life 5 years 4 years
Risk free rate 4.35% 4.40%
Expected dividend yield 5.00% 5.00%
Expected volatility was determined wholly by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the period since demerger in May 2001. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £1.7m and £0.4m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2006 and 2005 respectively. 
At the year end liabilities of £0.4m (2005: £0.1m) were included in the balance sheet for these items. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

28 Financial instruments
Financial risk management and treasury policies
The Group has a centralised treasury function which operates under Board-approved treasury policies and guidelines, covering funding, management 
of foreign exchange exposure, and interest rate risk. All transactions entered into by the Wincanton treasury function are required to be in support of, 
or as a consequence of, underlying commercial transactions. 
Liquidity risk
The Group has financed its growth in recent years through retained profit and bank loans. The Group’s policy on funding capacity is to ensure that there is always
sufficient long-term funding in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements. The Group’s committed banking facilities were increased during the
year from £200m to £210m. Margin reductions were negotiated, and the maturity of the facilities was extended to 2010.
During 2005 the funding platform was also broadened and the average maturity of debt extended by raising US$ 150m in the US private placement market on 
7- and 10- year floating rate terms. The funds have been swapped into euros at floating rates, and have been used to refinance bank facilities, and to position the
Company to take advantage of the opportunities for continued growth.
Interest rate risk
The Group maintains a policy of using derivatives to achieve the appropriate balance between fixed, capped, and floating interest profiles, so as to limit the
exposure to the cash cost of servicing our debt.
The Group has carefully considered the impact of IAS 39. The majority of the Group’s drawn debt at 31 March is in floating rate euros, derived from the fixed 
rate US$ private placement. IAS 39 does not permit hedge accounting treatment of interest rate swaps to manage such exposure. We have therefore allowed
our existing swaps to mature, and limited our exposure to increases in euro interest rates by purchasing an interest rate cap.
Currency risk
As a Pan-European business a proportion of the Group’ s activities are denominated in currencies other than sterling, principally the euro. However , the transactional
exposure of the Group is minimised as the vast majority of transactions are denominated in the relevant functional currency of the operation concerned.
In order to protect the sterling value of the balance sheet, the Group has financed its investment in overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in euros. Although a
proportion of this funding is obtained by borrowing directly from the Group’s committed facilities, a large element (as noted above) results from swapping the
US$150m private placement into sterling, and then into euros. The underlying US$150m principal and all future cash flows are fully hedged; the fair values of 
the US$ principal, and the US$ / sterling swap move in line with each other, so there is no resulting significant adjustment to the Group’s income statement. 
As part of the sterling / euro swap is used for the Group’s net investment hedge, where changes in fair value are taken to reserves to offset the movement in 
the Group’s euro denominated foreign investments, the currency risk of this instrument is minimised.
The Group makes use of foreign currency swaps to manage certain of its short-term trading currency requirements. However, as at the year end, there were 
no such foreign currency swaps outstanding (2005: Nil). The fair values of foreign currency swaps are recognised as derivatives and included within non-trade
receivables and/or payables as applicable, see table below.
Credit risk
The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Deposits are only made with pre-approved
counterparties. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit. The Group does not generally require collateral in respect of financial assets. 
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount 
of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet.
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over the longer-term,
however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the above table;
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current
spot rate. For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and unsecured bond issues
Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows at market interest rates.
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogenous lease agreements. 58 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006

T ransition to IFRS
Wincanton has taken advantage of the exemptions under IFRS 1 on transition to Adopted IFRS and therefore the following UK GAAP disclosures are required in
respect of 2005, which are based on those included in the 2005 Annual report although certain of the values have been changed due to the transition,
specifically the recognition of a property finance lease and the reclassification of jointly owned entities.
Interest rate and currency of funding
After taking into account the various interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts entered into by the Group, the effective interest rate and

From March 2003 to March 2006 the Company maintained a number of three-year interest rate swap arrangements to fix the interest rate liability of approximately
two-thirds of both the sterling and the euro denominated debt. The floating bank loans and overdrafts bear interest at short-term inter-bank rates (principally
applicable to periods of three months or less) and bank base rates.

Currency analysis
As a Pan-European business a proportion of the Group’s activities are denominated in currencies other than sterling. However, the transactional exposure of the
Group is minimised as the transactions of each operation are denominated in the relevant functional foreign currency. At the 2005 year-end there were no
material transactional balances that were denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency.
The Group’s exposure to structural foreign exchange movements is minimised by matching non-sterling assets with non-sterling liabilities. Any gains or losses
arising on the non-sterling investments and associated non-sterling borrowings are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Fair values of financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise overdrafts, medium-term loans and finance leases. Short-term debtors and creditors are excluded. The Group makes use of foreign
currency swaps to manage certain of its short-term trading currency requirements. As at the 2005 year-end, there were no foreign currency swaps outstanding.
The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities, including foreign currency swaps, is not materially different from the book value, except for the interest rate
swap transactions entered into in March 2003. At 31 March 2005 the fair value of these, being the market values of the instruments, is given in the fair value
table on page 57. Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 59

30 Accounting estimates and judgements
Management discusses with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies and estimates and the
application of these policies and estimates.
The areas where policy selection is most critical for the Group are concerned with the accounting for pensions, share based payments, and the testing of
goodwill for impairment. Information about the assumptions and risk factors relating to these issues are given in notes 26, 27 and 9 respectively.
31 Explanation of transition to Adopted IFRS
As stated in note 1, these are the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing first the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, secondly the
comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and lastly an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 
(the Group’s date of transition).
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old
basis of accounts (previously United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’)). 
In November 2005 the Group published an IFRS T ransition Statement to explain how the transition from UK GAAP to Adopted IFRS has affected the Group’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows and to set out the changes to the accounting policies of the Group and provide reconciliations of the
restatement of previously published comparative financial information. This statement is required to be reproduced in these Group financial statements in
respect of the comparative year ended 31 March 2005 and in respect of the opening balance sheet at the transition date 1 April 2004.
Overview of impact of adoption of IFRS
Conversion to Adopted IFRS affects Wincanton’s reporting particularly in respect of certain jointly owned entities, pensions, share based payments, leases and
dividends. It does not affect the cash flows or the underlying prospects of the business; however, the implementation of the new standards may result in
increased volatility in reported results due to changes in the accounting for pensions and share based payments. A group restructuring has been completed to
ensure the Group has an appropriate level of distributable reserves following the transition to Adopted IFRS. 60 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006

Underlying operating profit, earnings and taxation are reported before exceptional costs, amortisation of acquired intangibles and any tax thereon. Previously under UK GAAP adjusted operating profit, earnings
and taxation were reported before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation, pension credit and any tax thereon.
The significant areas of impact for Wincanton of IFRS adoption are discussed
in more detail below.
Jointly owned entities
Under UK GAAP Wincanton fully consolidated the results and balance sheets
of those entities in which it has an equal share of equity as it exercised
dominant influence over those entities but had no power of control. Under
Adopted IFRS the control requirement is for either the legal power to control
or an option to purchase a controlling stake to be in place. IAS 31 ‘Interests in
Joint Ventures’ requires the interest in a jointly controlled entity to be
recognised using either proportionate consolidation or the equity method.
The Group has chosen to report its jointly owned entities using the former.
Accordingly the share of the results and balance sheets of the four such
entities, attributable to the other parties, has been excluded from the reported
Group position and the minority interests reduced accordingly.
Employee benefits including pensions and other 
post-employment benefits 
The impact of applying IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ to the Group’s defined
benefit pension schemes has been to reduce underlying profit before tax for
the year ended 31 March 2005 by £1.1m, comprising a reduction of £1.2m in
underlying operating profit and a decrease in net financing costs of £0.1m.
The operating and net financing impact of the defined benefit schemes are
now recognised in the income statement. In addition the pension credit arising
under SSAP 24 of £4.0m is no longer amortised to the income statement.
The impact on the transition balance sheet is to reduce net assets by £25.7m.
The net defined benefit pension liability of £69.9m (£48.9m net of deferred
tax) has been recognised on the balance sheet. The SSAP 24 provision of
£33.2m (£23.2m net of deferred tax) has been removed. 
Actuarial gains and losses will be reflected in the statement of recognised
income and expense. In the year ended 31 March 2005 this amounted to 
a loss of £7.0m (£4.9m net of deferred tax). Pension deficits on overseas
schemes already held on the balance sheet have been brought in line with
IAS 19 valuations. The impact is included in the adjustment above.
In addition an adjustment has been made to recognise holiday pay accruals of
£1.7m in the transition balance sheet.
Leases 
Adopted IFRS makes a number of changes to the accounting for leases. 
In particular it: 
• introduces new tests to apply in determining the classification of leases
between operating and finance leases; and
• requires lease incentives to be spread over the entire lease period.
As a consequence one property lease has been reclassified from an operating
lease to a finance lease and in addition all property lease incentives have been
re-phased.
The impact of these changes has been to decrease net assets in the transition
balance sheet by £0.4m and in the year ended 31 March 2005 to increase
underlying operating profit by £0.7m and increase financial expenses by £0.4m.
Share-based payments 
Wincanton operates a number of share-based incentive schemes. Under UK
GAAP the charge to operating profit is the difference between the market
value of the shares at the date of grant and the proceeds on exercise
amortised over the performance period. SA YE schemes are exempt from this
requirement under UK GAAP . IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ requires the cost
of all share options (including SA YE schemes) to be fair valued at the date of
grant and for this fair value to be recognised over the relevant vesting periods.
As allowed by IFRS 1, Wincanton will only account for share-based incentive
schemes under the new rules for options issued after 7 November 2002 that
had not vested at 1 January 2005. Fair values have been calculated by our
external consultants, including the use of a Binomial pricing model. 
This has resulted in a charge of £0.3m to underlying operating profit for the
year ended 31 March 2005, as compared with the previous UK GAAP charge
of £nil. In accordance with IFRS 2 this item is shown within reserves in the
balance sheet.
Exceptionals
The introduction of Adopted IFRS removes the UK GAAP classification of
exceptional items, however in the interests of clarity Wincanton will continue
to report individual items of a significant nature contained in operating profit to
ensure that readers of the accounts have a full understanding of performance
in any period. 
These will be disclosed separately in a note to the accounts and referred 
to on the face of the income statement. 
Financial Instruments
Wincanton has elected to apply the exemption under IFRS 1 not to implement
the requirements of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’ in respect of recognising first the fair value of interest rate
swaps on the balance sheet and secondly the net translation and hedging
requirements in respect of foreign investments and related hedging
instruments. These requirements have been fully applied since 1 April 2005.
Income T axes 
IAS 12 ‘Income T axes’ requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary
differences rather than just timing differences as under UK GAAP . This has
the effect of increasing the tax charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 by
£0.2m and reducing net assets in the transition balance sheet by £0.3m. Business Combinations
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ prohibits merger accounting and the
amortisation of goodwill. The standard requires goodwill to be carried at cost
with annual impairment reviews. It also requires the recognition of intangibles
arising on business combinations.
IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ requires
translation differences arising in respect of an acquired foreign entity to 
be classified as a separate component of equity and the transfer of the
cumulative difference to the income statement as part of the result of 
any subsequent disposal of that foreign entity.
Wincanton has elected to apply the exemptions under IFRS 1 neither to
restate any pre transition business combinations under IFRS 3 nor to identify
the translation differences arising prior to 1 April 2004 and to attribute these to
the result of any disposals of those entities. Acquisitions post transition have
been accounted for under IFRS 3 and translation differences arising since 1
April 2004 will be separately identified and accounted for and included within
other reserves in the balance sheet. 
The impact of the transition to Adopted IFRS in respect of business
combinations is summarised as follows:
• the value of goodwill reported under UK GAAP at 1 April 2004 is frozen;
• the goodwill amortisation charge of £2.0m in the year ended 31 March
2005 under UK GAAP has been reversed;
• a value of intangibles of £3.5m has been recognised on acquisitions since 
1 April 2004 and reclassified from goodwill previously recognised; and
• a charge for amortisation of acquired intangibles of £0.1m has been made
in the year ended 31 March 2005.
Provisions
Adopted IFRS requires provisions expected to be settled within one year of
the balance sheet date to be shown as current liabilities. This has resulted in 
a reclassification of £12.5m in the transition balance sheet from non-current
liabilities to current liabilities.
Intangible assets
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ requires computer software which is not an
integral part of hardware to be treated separately as an intangible rather than
included within tangible assets as under UK GAAP . This has resulted in a
reclassification of £8.0m in the transition balance sheet.
Dividends 
Under IAS 10 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’, dividends declared after
the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability.
The final dividend of £8.3m for the year ended 31 March 2004 was declared in
June 2004 and consequently this has been reversed in the transition balance
sheet and charged through the statement of changes in equity in the half year
ended 30 September 2004. Similar adjustments have been made in respect
of dividends accrued at the half year ended 30 September 2004 and year
ended 31 March 2005.
Revenue Recognition
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ precludes the recognition of revenue unless the outcome
of the transaction can be reliably estimated. Previously under UK GAAP
Wincanton deferred certain contract execution costs arising under certain
operations and amortised these against future revenue flows. Under Adopted
IFRS these costs will now be expensed but an applicable amount of revenue
will be recognised at the commencement of the contract and the accrued
revenue ‘unwound’ over the subsequent contract term.
As a result of the above all contracts have been reviewed and those identified
where first the future revenue stream does not meet the recognition
requirements of IAS 18 and secondly which have costs of contract execution
deferred on the balance sheet. As a result, the net assets at transition have
been reduced by £1.3m of these costs. The impact on the results for the year
ended 31 March 2005 is immaterial.
Cash flows 
None of the IFRS adjustments relevant to Wincanton relate to cash and
therefore there is no impact on cash flows. IAS 7 ‘Cash Flow Statements’
changes the definition of cash used in the cash flow statement to cash and
cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand and on
demand deposits and this will result in a change in disclosure in respect of
deposits held by the captive insurer.

1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing
with items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s
financial statements except as noted below.
In these financial statements the following relevant new standards have been
adopted for the first time; FRS 20 ‘Share-based payments’, FRS 21 ‘Events after
the balance sheet date’, FRS 23 ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange
rates’; the presentation requirements of FRS 25 ‘Financial instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation’; and FRS 26 ‘Financial instruments: Measurement’.
The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below. The
effects of their adoption were as follows:
FRS 20 had no effect on the Company’s profit or net assets as the accounting
for the Wincanton share option schemes is dealt with by the relevant principal
employing entity.
The major effect of FRS 21 is to change the approach to dividends declared
after the balance sheet date in respect of the year under review such that
those dividends are no longer accrued in the closing balance sheet. As a result
the Company’s net assets as at 31 March 2005 increased by £8.9m.
FRS 23 sets out additional guidance for the translation of foreign currency
transactions and for determining the functional currency of an entity.
Adoption has no impact on the Company’s profit or net assets.
The adoption of the presentational requirement of FRS 25 has no effect on
the Company’s profit or net assets and the disclosure requirements have
been complied with. 
FRS 26 sets out the requirements for the presentation of and disclosures
relating to financial instruments. The impact of FRS 26 is shown in the
Financial Instruments policy set out below.
The corresponding amounts in these financial statements are, other than
those covered by the exception permitted by FRS 26, restated in accordance
with the new policies. FRS 26 permits the corresponding amounts not to be
restated and the Company has adopted this approach. 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable
accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules. 
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt
from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under FRS 1 (Revised) the Company is exempt from the requirement 
to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds the cash flows of the
Company are included in the published Group financial statements.
Advantage has been taken of FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ not to disclose
transactions with subsidiaries on the basis that all transactions were with
members of the Group, 90% or more of whose voting rights were controlled.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if
there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling
at the date of the transaction or, where applicable, the contracted rate. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the end of the financial year.
Profits and losses on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening
net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings and the foreign currency
loans that exist to finance these acquired entities are taken directly to
reserves. All other profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to
operating profit. 
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into
account deferred taxation. Deferred taxation is recognised without
discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of
certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes that have occurred 
but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required 
by FRS 19 ‘Deferred T ax’.
T ax charges or credits arising on the retranslation of foreign currency
borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in
foreign enterprises are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and
losses together with the exchange differences on the borrowings themselves.
Financial instruments
The Company does not trade in derivative financial instruments and it makes
limited use of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency
cash flows. Gains or losses on such instruments are recognised in the period
to which they relate. 
Prior to 31 March 2005, only the amount payable or receivable in respect 
of interest rate swaps was recognised as an interest expense over the period
of the contracts, since the adoption of FRS 26 on 1 April 2005 the fair value 
of interest rate swaps has also been recognised as part of interest expense.
On adoption a net charge of £0.1m, being the net fair value liability, was
recognised through reserves and this has been credited to interest expense
in the year to the point of the expiry of the interest rate swap in mid March
2006. No further swaps have subsequently been taken out.
Shares held by employee benefit trust
Shares in the Company held by the Wincanton plc Employee Share T rust are
shown as a deduction from shareholders’ equity at cost in accordance with
UITF Abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’.

Operating profit, and hence profit before and after taxation, is adjusted to exclude pension credit, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. Basic earnings per share is calculated on the same basis.
5
Interest cover is based on the profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, but including pension credit, in line with the Group’s banking facilities. Dividend cover is calculated on the same basis.
6
Capital employed is defined as net assets/(liabilities) adjusted for goodwill, debt, taxation, dividends, pension and insurance provisions. Return on capital employed is calculated as operating profit before pension
credit, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items over capital employed. In 2003 the T rans European acquisition reduced the return due to the inclusion of only three months of post-acquisition operating profit
but the full amount of year-end capital employed.
Except for 2005, Wincanton is not required to restate the above table to comply with Adopted IFRS. Had this been required the major changes, as more fully
detailed in note 31 to the Group financial statements, would have been in respect of the accounting for jointly owned entities, pensions, share-based payments
and leases. Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 71

Chairman’s Statement
The Group has made excellent progress
delivering outstanding financial results and 
at the same time significantly advancing the
strategic development of your business.
Trading results |
I am delighted to present our first set of results since the
admission of the Company to AIM on 2 March 2004. 
The Group has made excellent progress during the
period to 31 December 2004, delivering outstanding
financial results and at the same time significantly
advancing the strategic development of your business. 
I am particularly pleased to report that following the
acquisition of the Alphameric Retail Division (comprising
Pennine Retail Systems (Holdings) Limited and its
subsidiaries), the Group is now the UK market leader 
for retail IT systems.
In addition, we have established a strong management
team and are now extremely well positioned both to
achieve rapid growth and to aggressively pursue our
overall objective of maximising shareholder value by
establishing Torex Retail as the leading independent
solutions provider to the international retail IT market.
The reported results represent the trading of the Group
for the eleven months since the Company’s incorporation
on 4 February 2004. These show turnover of £67.9
million and operating profit before amortisation of
goodwill and exceptional items of £12.7 million.
Rob Loosemore
Chairman Chairman’s Statement | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 03
In order to provide a better understanding of our 
trading results we have prepared pro forma information 
(a summary of which is set out below and a complete
statement of which is included in the Financial Review). 
This shows the results for the Group as if it had been
trading in its current form for a full twelve month period,
with the exception that the Torex Retail (KPOS) Limited
(formerly KPOS Computer Systems Limited) (“KPOS”)
and Alphameric Retail Division businesses acquired
during 2004 are included from their dates of acquisition.

* Full details of the basis of calculating the pro forma information are shown in 
the Financial Review. Operating profit is before charging exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation.
I am delighted to report that pro forma operating profit
increased by 55% to £12.5m. This excellent performance
is due mainly to very strong operating margins, which
reflect the success of our business model to focus on
software and services revenues rather than on lower
margin hardware business, combined with a very tight
control over costs. It is a great credit to our business that
our operating margins are amongst the highest in our
industry and give evidence of the high operational
efficiency of the Group. 
Pro forma basic EPS increased by a very impressive
170% to 2.7 pence.
Operating cash inflow represented 128% of operating
profit reflecting strong working capital management. 
Net debt was only £19.4 million at 31 December
compared to £16.0 million at the interim stage
notwithstanding the additional £7 million loan taken 
on in the second half to fund the acquisition of the
Alphameric Retail Division.
Management and staff |
During the period we have successfully established an
enviable team at plc board level and in depth throughout
the executive of the Company. Headed by myself, the 
plc executive of Chris Moore, Richard Thompson, 
Mark Pearman and Nigel Horn represent a first rate team
with a proven track record of effectively managing
profitable growth. Complemented by our non-executives
Geoffrey Forster and David Hallett, they make up the full
Board, which I am proud to lead. The wider Group
executive team is rich in talent, dedicated and immensely
motivated to achieving our goals.
I would like to pay tribute to all the staff of Torex Retail, 
who have all contributed to this first set of excellent results.
The Group employed over 1,100 people at 31 December
2004 and on behalf of the Board I would like to thank
them all for their valuable and much-appreciated
contribution. 04 Torex Retail Plc | Report & Accounts 2004 | Chairman’s Statement
Strategy |
The Group’s strategy is based around the continued
development of modern and innovative products, 
which can be sold both to new customers and
throughout the Group’s existing blue chip customer base. 
Our market leading LUCAS electronic point of sale
(‘EPoS’) product provides the platform for a suite of
integrated store management solutions including loss
prevention, labour scheduling, time and attendance and
customer counting. In addition the recent Alphameric
Retail Division acquisition has enhanced our strong 
in-store product offering with best-of-breed head office
and business intelligence solutions. These act as good
entry points to new customers for our EPoS products, 
as well as cross-selling opportunities to our existing base.
The Group’s focus on the sale of our own intellectual
property rights (‘IPR’) software, together with related
services, continues to prove successful both in terms 
of improved operating margins and also in new contract
wins. The Group’s leading IPR product portfolio and
commitment to modern technologies is a key differentiator
in securing new business in the competitive retail systems
market. The Group is working with both the latest JAVA
and Microsoft .NET technologies and has nearly 300
people committed to product development activity. 
This significant investment ensures that we remain at the
forefront of innovation in retail systems and so provide
our customers with real business benefits.
The strength of our product portfolio means that there
are significant opportunities for us to develop our
business in new markets. This is reinforced by the
international activities of many of our customers, 
who are looking to implement common systems across
their multi-national estates. We are currently rolling out
systems to a number of customers on a global basis,
such as Mont Blanc, ESPRIT and Deichman, and our
work on these projects has identified a number of very
exciting new market opportunities. In 2005 we will focus
on increasing our penetration into the USA and South
East Asia in particular. 
The Group’s strategy is based around the continued development of modern
and innovative products, which can be sold both to new customers and
throughout the Group’s existing blue chip customer base. Chairman’s Statement | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 05
Whilst we are confident of continued new business
successes, the sales cycle for large scale retail systems 
can be lengthy. Therefore in addition to our drive for
organic growth, we will continue to look for suitable
acquisitions to accelerate the overall growth of the 
Group by expanding our customer base, enhancing 
our product and service offering and entering new
geographic markets.
Current trading and outlook |
We are delighted with our results, which represent
excellent progress during the period both in terms of
financial performance and strategic development. We are
pleased to report that trading in the current period to
date has continued to exceed our expectations as the
integration of the Alphameric Retail Division is well ahead
of schedule. We will continue to integrate our activities in
the future as rapidly as possible, therefore maximising
economies of scale whilst providing a well established
platform for continued growth both organically and by
acquisition. The combination of innovation, technology,
customer base, geographic coverage and market
leadership places us in a unique position to capitalise on
the immense opportunities arising from the improving
market conditions. 
Dividends |
It is the Board’s intention to ensure that shareholders
benefit from the success of the Group with a progressive
dividend policy, whilst also balancing this with the
continuing investment needed to increase earnings.
Consequently the Board recommends a final dividend 
of 0.58p per ordinary share making a total for the period
of 0.68p. Subject to approval by the shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 20 May 2005 to
shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 22 April 2005.

Chief Executive’s Business Review
Chris Moore
Chief Executive
Our Store Management Solutions business 
has made excellent progress during the
period.
Operations |
Our Store Management Solutions (“SMS”) business has
made excellent progress during the period in both the UK
and Germany. We have continued to experience strong
new sales success for LUCAS, the Group’s market
leading JAVA-based EPoS solution, with a number of
significant contracts from major retailers including
Breuninger, Tedi, Otto, ESPRIT, Sport Scheck, Heinrich
Heine and Mont Blanc.
LUCAS, launched at the end of 2000, has over 8,000 
till installations across Europe and North America. 
This is a very impressive achievement for a new product
and not only demonstrates the strong market demand 
for this innovative solution but also provides an unrivalled
installed reference base for future sales. In 2005 we will
roll out LUCAS in the UK for Deichmann, the international
shoe retailer.
The UK business also achieved notable EPoS wins with
our Visual software product. Following a successful pilot
of 30 stores, the Co-operative Group Pharmacy have
contracted to roll out the solution to their chain of 300
stores nationwide.  Chief Executive’s Business Review | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 07
The renewal of a £7 million contract with WH Smith
Travel Retail to provide full IT outsourcing services was 
a key contract for the business. The contract, which runs
until 2007, represents a significant renewal for Torex
Retail and follows the successful provision of this service
to WH Smith Travel Retail over the past four years. This
win demonstrates our continued ability to retain high
profile blue chip business customers.
Operationally, SMS was involved in large rollouts for
Matalan, Kaufland, Ipswich and Norwich Co-operative
Society and Toom, a German DIY business. The Matalan
rollout featured the first implementation in the world of a
new LINUX-based IBM operating system for retailers, 
and we are very proud to have received a prestigious
IBM Solution Provider Excellence award for our work on
this account. In North America, LUCAS was successfully
rolled out into 45 Montblanc stores and fully integrated
into the customer’s Swiss head office SAP system. 
The second half of the year also included a number of
estate-wide implementations for Chip and PIN solutions.
The relatively slow take-up of Chip and PIN by retailers is
well documented but we expect a significant increase in
this business in the first half of 2005.
Budgens and Torex Retail are
committed to working closely to
provide streamlined products
and services for their many
mutual customers throughout
the UK.
SMS achieved notable success with Big Food Group,
implementing our staff scheduling software solution
across their estate of 950 Booker and Iceland stores
throughout the UK. In addition, the recently acquired
Business Intelligence operation (part of the Alphameric
Retail Division) signed a sizeable three year contract 
with a leading US ladies fashion retailer to supply
Smartdecision, our leading edge merchandise planning
and decision support product. This contract underlines
the significant potential for Smartdecision in the US
market where, given the huge demographic and climate
variations, the requirement for range planning at store
level is great and can provide a very attractive return on
investment to retailers through increased shelf availability
and reduced mark-downs.
Our Petroleum and Convenience (“P&C”) business has
continued to grow during 2004, enjoying a record year
both for order intake for its Iridium and Prism EPoS
solution and for the number of installations, which
increased by 25% to 842. This reinforced our position as
the leading supplier of systems to independent petroleum
retailers in the UK.  08 Torex Retail Plc | Report & Accounts 2004 | Chief Executive’s Business Review
Our goal is to create solutions that enable our customers to
choose the right product that gives them competitive advantage
in an increasingly challenging marketplace.
Product strategy |
We believe that technological innovation is critical to our
success as a leader in the retail IT systems market. It is
only through utilising modern technology that we can
provide retailers with scaleable systems that provide low
total cost of ownership and a quick demonstrable return
on investment. To underpin our commitment to modern
technology and continued innovation we have 25% 
of staff involved in product development or related
technical areas.
LUCAS is our strategic EPoS solution. It was designed
with the vision of meeting the requirements of international
retailers who want to exploit the benefits of running
common systems across their multi-national estate. 
To achieve this, it is based on JAVA technology. 
This provides a tremendously scaleable system which 
is independent of the underlying hardware, operating
systems and database. LUCAS has no legacy code and
is designed to take full advantage of the processing
capabilities of modern hardware and databases. 
In addition, LUCAS has been designed using the
internationally accepted ARTS data model which greatly
speeds up the development of new functionality and the
adoption of the product in new markets.
As a balance to our adoption of JAVA as our principal
EPoS technology, our head office systems have been
developed using the latest Microsoft .NET technology.
This not only uses both technologies to exploit their
respective strengths but also allows us, from a marketing
and partner perspective, to leverage relationships with 
all the major IT companies throughout the world.
Major product development projects completed during
the period include the continued enhancement of LUCAS
together with the localisation work required to introduce
LUCAS to the UK and North American markets. We are
now working on projects to integrate LUCAS seamlessly
with our newly acquired merchandise management
products. In addition we have successfully developed a
self scanning terminal in an international apparel retailer to
allow customers to serve themselves and this product is
now being run on an extended pilot in the retailer’s stores. Chief Executive’s Business Review | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 09
A new fully internet-enabled version of our successful
LORD loss prevention product has been released in 2004.
We are undertaking a major expansion of the functionality
of our best of breed, merchandise planning product,
Smartdecision. With this project we are working very
closely with a major US fashion and apparel retailer to
ensure that the product exactly meets a retailers
requirements. In P&C we are implementing petroleum
functionality into LUCAS to provide a highly scaleable
and centrally managed EPoS solution to target the large
multi-national petroleum retailers.
We are proud of our strong and
growing customer base which
includes many major names
across the UK, Europe and 
the US. 10 Torex Retail Plc | Report & Accounts 2004 | Chief Executive’s Business Review
Sales and marketing |
2004 has seen a significant investment to refocus 
Torex Retail from a business model which prioritised
customer retention to one that in addition aggressively
seeks new business. A key part of the strategy of the
newly-independent Torex Retail is to shed its image as
“one of the best kept secrets in retail IT” and substantially
raise the profile of the business as a supplier of a
comprehensive range of innovative and market leading
retail management solutions.
As part of this process new corporate branding, 
including a new website (www.torexretail.com), has been
introduced and all of our activities across Europe now
trade under the Torex Retail brand. In addition, the Group
has appointed a number of experienced sales executives
to drive new business, particularly in the UK market. 
The benefit of this investment is evidenced by the new
contract wins in 2004 and a strong sales pipeline for
2005, supplemented by an excellent prospects list.

Chief Executive’s Business Review continued Chief Executive’s Business Review | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 11
A further route to market is via partners and during 2004
much greater emphasis has been placed upon building
relationships with these third parties. In particular 
Torex Retail has been appointed an IBM Premier
Business Partner. This is IBM’s highest category of
partner and there are only two other similar status
partners in the UK retail IT market. We are also in
discussion with a number of potential distributors 
and other third parties to help us introduce our leading
IPR software products into new geographic markets.
We are confident that working more closely with 
partners going forward will help us win increased levels 
of business, particularly amongst larger retailers and in
new markets.
Business development |
During the period we enhanced the SMS business in 
the UK with two acquisitions. 
In August we acquired KPOS, a long standing supplier of
IT systems to the UK retail market with an outstanding
reputation for customer service. The acquisition of KPOS
creates significant cross selling opportunities to the
expanded customer base and increases our channel to
the UK market. Integration benefits have been realised in
2004 and new areas of synergy will be achieved during
the coming year.
In November we acquired the Alphameric Retail Division 
which established Torex Retail as the market leader in 
the UK for retail IT systems. Going forward, the increased
critical mass of our business provides us with much greater
leverage when negotiating contracts. The enlarged
product portfolio, including merchandise management
and business intelligence systems, strengthens our
offering as a ‘one stop shop’ for retailers’ IT solutions.
The acquisition also provides the opportunity for strong
organic growth by cross-selling the enhanced product
portfolio within the combined customer base. This gives
customers the confidence that they are buying from 
the marker leader.
The integration of the business is already well under way
and ahead of schedule. The management team is now in
place and manning levels are currently being assessed in
other areas of the business. Annualised cost savings of
£3.3 million have been identified. 
In September the remaining 30.2% of the German Torex
Retail Solutions GmbH (“Torex GmbH”) business was
acquired. Torex GmbH develops LUCAS, which is the
basis of the product offering that the Group is
successfully marketing and rolling out across Europe 
and North America.
Following the period end, the Group acquired Flexiline
Forecourt Services Limited (“Flexiline”). The acquisition
will be integrated into the P&C business and will give us
the ability to provide a complete solution for all filling
station installation and maintenance services which we
believe will be particularly attractive to the major oil
companies and large supermarket groups.

Financial Review
Introduction |
The Company was incorporated on 4 February 2004 as
Lynxangel (Holdings) Public Limited Company and on 
16 February 2004 acquired the Torex Retail Group of
companies from Torex PLC which was part of iSOFT Group
Plc. On 17 February 2004 the Company changed its name
to Torex Retail Plc and on 2 March 2004 the Company’s
ordinary shares were admitted to trading on AIM.
Operating results |
The reported results represent the trading of the Group
for the eleven months since the Company’s incorporation
on 4 February 2004. These show turnover of £67.9
million and operating profit before amortisation of
goodwill and exceptional items of £12.7 million.
However, in order to provide a better understanding 
of our trading results we have produced pro forma 
information, shown below. This information shows the
results for the Group as if it had been trading in its
current form for a full twelve month period. Comparative
pro forma information has also been provided for the 
12 month period to 31 December 2003.
The pro forma information has been prepared 
on the following basis:
• The pro forma results for the twelve months ended 
31 December 2004 comprise the actual results of the
Group for the eleven month period and the actual
January 2004 operating loss of the original Torex Retail
Group, on the basis of current accounting policies.
They have an assumed tax rate of 30% (after allowing
for goodwill amortisation), the same goodwill
amortisation charge as the eleven month period and
include the results of KPOS and Alphameric Retail
Division from their respective dates of acquisition.
• The pro forma results for the year ended 31 December
2003 comprise the actual results for the period, on 
the basis of current accounting policies. The results
include the same plc board costs, interest and 
goodwill amortisation charges as for the year ended 
31 December 2004. Tax has been calculated on the
same basis as above.
• The pro forma EPS are based on the weighted 
average number of shares for the period ended 
31 December 2004.

Richard Thompson
Group Finance Director Financial Review | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 13
The Group has achieved improved gross margins in all
major areas of the business. This has arisen primarily from
an increase in sales of higher margin software products
which have grown to 20% of total sales (2003: 17%).
Similarly there has been a reduction in lower margin
hardware sales from 38% in 2003 to 33% in 2004. 
A tight control has been maintained on overheads
throughout the year and in addition, the full effect of cost
saving exercises completed in 2003 has been recognised
in 2004. This is not fully visible in the above figures due
to the overhead costs of the acquired businesses. 
The total overhead cost for 2004, excluding KPOS 
and Alphameric Retail Division, is £32.8 million.
Pro forma operating profit before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items was £12.5 million
(2003: £8.1 million), an increase of 55% driven by strong
growth in the SMS business. The former KPOS and
Alphameric Retail Division businesses contributed 
£1.2 million in the period.
Exceptional items and goodwill amortisation |
An exceptional charge of £787,000 has been incurred 
in the period. Of this, £545,000 represents a charge
required under UITF Abstract 17 to reflect the fair value
of share options vested in an Employee Share Scheme
and £242,000 relates to redundancy costs incurred as
acquired businesses were restructured.
A £2.9 million charge for the amortisation of goodwill 
has been made during the period, of which £0.2 million
related to goodwill generated on the acquisitions of
KPOS and the Alphameric Retail Division. 
Tax |
The overall tax charge on ordinary activities was 36%
which is in excess of the standard rate. This is principally
due to goodwill amortisation, which is not allowed for 
UK tax purposes, and higher overseas tax rates, which
are partially offset by a tax credit on the £2.4 million
redemption premium on the loan notes issued as part 
of the consideration for the acquisition of the Torex Retail
Group from iSOFT Group plc. 
Earnings per share |
Basic pro forma earnings per share were 2.7p, up 170%
on the prior period (2003: 1.0 pence).
Balance sheet |
The balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 shows net
assets of £72.6 million, including goodwill of £78.2
million, after the current period’s charge for amortisation.
Goodwill is being written off over twenty years and arises
from the acquisitions detailed below.
During the 11 months to December 2004, the Group has
experienced strong cash inflows from operating activities,
generating £11.5 million of cash (128% of operating
profit). Net debt at the period end was £19.4 million,
which includes £0.6 million in relation to finance leases.
Acquisitions |
The acquisition of the Torex Retail Group was completed
on 16 February 2004 for a total consideration of 
£62.9 million which comprised of £46.3 million in cash,
£14.2 million in loan notes and £2.4 million in redemption
premium on the loan notes.
Other acquisitions made during the period:
• KPOS was acquired on 9 August 2004 for a
consideration of £8.7 million comprising £4.9 million 
in cash and £3.8 million in shares; 
• On 6 September 2004 the remaining 30.2% stake in
Torex GmbH was acquired, making it a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Group. The consideration was fully
satisfied by new shares in the Company, with a value 
of £3.8 million; and 
• The Alphameric Retail Division was acquired from
Alphameric Plc on 29 November 2004 for an initial
consideration of £15 million. A further £15 million may
be payable dependant upon the financial performance
of the acquired business during the period to 
31 December 2005. The initial consideration comprised 
£10 million in cash and £5 million in shares.
On 19 January 2005 Flexiline was acquired for a
consideration of £2.1 million, which was satisfied by 
the payment of £1.05 million in cash and the balance 
in shares.

Corporate Social Responsibility
A comprehensive intranet site has been set up which, 
in addition to providing copies of the basic documents
available to staff in connection with their employment,
also has sections which keep everyone in touch with
news and opinion, both corporate and personal,
concerning the organisation. A vital requirement for 
the intranet site is that it is kept fully up to date and
experience so far is that this is being achieved.
Everyone who was with the Group at the time of 
flotation has been given a number of options under 
the Company’s share option plans and these holdings 
will mature in the usual way.
In November 2004, we commissioned Mosaic Business
Dynamics, an independent consultant, to undertake a
survey of our employees about their views, both positive
In our first year, our emphasis has been
directed towards our most important asset –
our employees. Corporate Social Responsibility | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 15
and negative, on their relationship with the Group and
with their work colleagues. There was an encouraging
60% response, which is above the average for such
surveys, and all views were incorporated into a report
which was published on the intranet in December. 
As well as analysing the results of the survey, the report
set out various areas which management would be
addressing in order to tackle the main issues raised.
The intranet site also explains the various more regular
means by which we communicate with and obtain
feedback from our employees. Our commitment to
equality of treatment and non-discrimination in any area
of employment is also emphasised, as is our approach to
health and safety. In particular, we ensure that disabled
employees, regardless of the nature of their disability or
the time of its onset, are given fair and proper consideration
for training, career development and promotion.
As a recently-formed and floated company, and one
which has a significant and ongoing programme of
acquisition and consolidation, we are understandably at
an early stage in formulating an overall corporate social
responsibility policy. However, we can comment generally
on other areas of CSR as follows.
We aim to treat our stakeholders in a responsible
manner. We maintain regular contact with our major
shareholders to explain current developments in our
business and all shareholders are of course most
welcome to attend the AGM. Our suppliers are another
key group and our relationship with them is one which
we are keen to develop, hopefully to our mutual benefit.
Our policy, in relation to all our suppliers, is to settle 
the terms of payment when negotiating a particular
transaction and then, assuming satisfactory performance
by the supplier, to make payment accordingly. The number
of days’ purchases (creditor days) outstanding for
payment by the Group at 31 December 2004 was 38.
In our particular business sector, the ability to make
major improvements to our environmental impact and,
indeed, the risk of suffering a major environmental
disaster, are limited. Nevertheless, environmental
considerations form part of our ongoing risk assessment
policy and we are taking steps towards some modest
improvements in areas such as the disposal of used PCs
and toner cartridges and in energy and paper use.
The degree of corporate acquisition and consolidation 
in the relatively short period of the organisation’s
independent existence has meant that, at Group level,
we have yet to establish policies for charitable giving or
for meaningful involvement in the communities in which
we are located. We have not made any political donations. 16 Torex Retail Plc | Report & Accounts 2004

Corporate governance |
The corporate governance statement is set out on pages

Annual General Meeting |
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be 
held on 28 April 2005. Details of the resolutions to be
proposed, together with appropriate explanations, are set
out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting attached
with this report. There are five items of special business:
(i) to increase the authorised capital of the Company to
£4,000,000: this is to support the Group’s progressive
acquisition policy where, in appropriate cases,
consideration for purchases will be satisfied by 
the issue of new shares; 
(ii) to grant the directors authority for a period of five
years from the date of the AGM to allot a maximum
of 61,925,768 relevant securities. This represents one
third of the aggregate current issued ordinary share
capital;
(iii) to permit the directors for a period of five years from
the date of the AGM to allot up to 9,288,865 equity
securities wholly for cash other than on a pre-emptive
basis to current shareholders pro rata to their existing
holdings. This represents 5% of the aggregate current
issued ordinary share capital;
(iv) to amend the articles of association to increase the
aggregate annual amount payable as directors’ fees:
this is to reflect the changes to the structure of the
board since the articles of association were first
approved by shareholders; and
(v) to amend the rules of the Torex Retail Plc
Unapproved Company Share Option Plan 2004 to
permit grants of options to certain executives which
exceed in value one times’ relevant earnings. This will
allow flexibility for the Remuneration Committee and
will avoid potential unfairness where an employee
joins the Group shortly before the end of the
Company’s financial year and is not in a position to
receive maximum option entitlement in that year.
Items (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) will be proposed as ordinary
resolutions and item (iii) will be proposed as a special
resolution: they appear as Items 12 to 16 inclusive in 
the Notice.
Auditors |
Hurst Morrison Thomson LLP have indicated their
willingness to continue in office and a resolution for their
re-appointment as auditors of the Company will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance
Whilst as a member of AIM the Company is not required
to comply fully with the principles and provisions of the
Combined Code, nevertheless its intention is to comply
so far as is appropriate for a company of its size 
and nature.
Directors |
As the inaugural period of the Company’s existence, this
has inevitably been a time of consolidation which has
extended to the composition of the Board. 
At flotation, the Board comprised one executive and two
non-executive directors. Of the latter one, Dr Colin Wall,
who had provided invaluable assistance during the
flotation period, resigned in April to pursue his other
business interests and was replaced by David Hallett.
The executive side of the Board was strengthened by 
the appointment of Mark Pearman (who previously 
held a number of positions at Torex PLC including chief
executive) and Richard Thompson, who was recruited
externally for the position of Group Finance Director 
using the help and advice of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Two further appointments were made in November, 
in each case involving individuals who had previously
worked at Torex PLC. Following the changes announced
on 8 February 2005 and 15 March 2005, the Board now
comprises five executive and two non-executive
directors. Notwithstanding that he received a small
payment for pre-flotation advice, the Board has
determined that Geoffrey Forster is independent, 
as is his non-executive colleague, David Hallett. 
The Nomination Committee will be taking due account of
non-executive director independence when considering
future appointments to the Board.
The Board |
The Board’s whole year timetable provides for a minimum
of six full Board meetings spread across the whole
calendar year: at least one of these meetings will include
a detailed  discussion of the strategic plan. The directors
believe that these meetings make the Board well-placed
to remain fully up-to-date on the Group’s activities and to
exercise adequate control. There is a clear distinction
between the role of the chairman in running the Board,
and that of the chief executive in running the business:
the latter is obliged to comply with a practical schedule
(which will be reviewed at least annually) of matters
requiring Board approval before implementation. 
The agenda for each regular Board meeting includes
substantial reports on all aspects of the Group’s business
and ad hoc reports are circulated if decisions are
required between meetings.
Geoffrey Forster has been designated as senior
independent director.
All newly appointed directors are provided with an
induction programme which includes meetings both
internally and externally with those principally involved
with the business. Arrangements will be made for
ongoing director training.
The Company maintains appropriate directors’ and
officers’ insurance cover.
All directors have access to the advice and services of
the Company Secretary and are able to take independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Relations with shareholders |
Communication with shareholders is taken seriously and
the Company maintains regular direct contact with its
major shareholders. 
Immediately following flotation, a grant of share options
was made to all employees in the UK and Germany:
subsequently, this benefit was extended to employees in
Belgium. It is hoped that in the fullness of time, this will
result in a significant number of employees becoming full
shareholders in the Company.
The inaugural Annual General Meeting will be held at
Blenheim Palace. All shareholders will of course be very
welcome since this will provide an excellent opportunity
to meet with the directors. The venue will also be
convenient for many of our employees, should they wish
to attend.
The results of the votes on all resolutions put to the AGM
will be published on the Company’s website, together
with details of proxy votes cast for each resolution,
whether or not a poll is demanded.
Board committees |
The Board has the following standing committees: each
has its own terms of reference which are available on the
Company website.
Audit Committee |
Members are: Geoffrey Forster (chairman) and David
Hallett (appointed 7 June 2004). Colin Wall resigned from
the Committee on 26 April 2004. The Group Finance
Director and a representative of the external auditors
attend by invitation. Updated terms of reference were
adopted by the Board during the period. 
Torex Retail Plc | Report & Accounts 2004 21
The Audit Committee review the assurance procedures,
ensuring that an appropriate mix of techniques is used to
obtain the level of assurances required by the Board. The
Audit Committee chairman presents their findings to the
Board on a six monthly basis or earlier as appropriate.
The Committee has discussed the independence of
external auditors and is satisfied that this is not
prejudiced when undertaking non-audit work. 
This will be kept under regular review.
Due to the size of the Company it has not been thought
appropriate to establish an internal audit function. 
This matter will be kept under review.
Remuneration Committee |
The Committee is comprised exclusively of non-executive
directors. Members are: David Hallett (chairman,
appointed 7 June 2004) and Geoffrey Forster. 
Colin Wall resigned from the Committee on 26 April
2004. The Chairman and the Chief Executive also attend
the Committee by invitation, when appropriate, during
the period. Committee members have no personal
interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters
decided by the Committee.
Nomination Committee |
Members are: Robert Loosemore (chairman), Geoffrey
Forster and David Hallett (7 June  2004). All director
appointments are considered before formal approval by
the Board and the Committee aims to maintain a proper
balance between executive and non-executive directors:
this includes a formal annual review of Board structure
and succession planning.
The chairman of each Committee will be available at 
the AGM to respond to questions about his particular
Committee.
The Company Secretary is secretary to each Committee.
Internal controls |
The Group has established processes and procedures
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant
risks faced by the Group. The processes have been
embedded into the fabric of the Group and have been in
place for the period under review and up to the date of
approval of the annual report and financial statements. 
The processes and procedures will be regularly reviewed
by the Board.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s
system of internal controls and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The role of management is to implement
Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal
controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure of the achievement of business objectives.
In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
A process of control self-assessment and hierarchical
reporting has been established which provides for a
documented and auditable trail of accountability. These
procedures are relevant across all Group operations: they
provide for successive assurances to be given at increasingly
higher levels of management and, finally, to the Board.
The processes used by the Board to review the
effectiveness of the system of internal controls include
the following:
• annual budgets are prepared for each operating
business and compared with monthly management
reporting, which focuses on actual performance against
these budgets;
• management reports and external audit reports on the
system of internal controls and any material control
weaknesses that are identified;
• discussions with management including discussions on
the actions taken on problem areas identified by Board
members or in the external audit reports;
• policies and procedures for such matters as delegation
of authorities, capital expenditure and treasury
management as well as regular updates.
• review of the adequacy of the level of experienced and
professional staff throughout the business and the
expertise of individual staff members so that they are
capable of carrying out their individual delegated
responsibilities; and
• review of the external audit work plans.
The Group’s management operates a risk management
process, which identifies the key risks facing each
business. The process is based on each business unit
producing a risk register which identifies the potential key
risks to the individual business unit, the impact should
they occur and the action being taken to sufficiently
manage those risks. 
Going concern |
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Directors’ contracts |
Directors’ service agreements |
All executive directors’ service contracts are subject to
12 months’ notice of termination from the Company.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for a
three year term which is extendible at the Board’s
discretion. All appointees are subject to regular 
re-appointment by shareholders. Contracts are
terminable without notice in accordance with the 
articles of association.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration |
The remuneration for non-executive directors is set by
the full Board on the recommendation of the executive
directors. Remuneration comprises an annual fee. 
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in
any of the Company’s bonus or share option schemes.
Remuneration policy |
It is the Company’s policy to provide for each of its
executive directors a remuneration package which is
adequate to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the 
appropriate calibre, whilst at the same time not paying
more than is necessary for this purpose.
Proposals for the most recent review were put to the
Remuneration Committee by the chairman, having
consulted a number of independent advisors.
Executive directors’ remuneration |
The following comprised the principal elements of
executive directors’ remuneration for the period 
under review:
• base salary
• benefits, including pension contributions, life
assurance, company car allowance, healthcare 
and permanent health insurance
• annual short term performance related bonus
• share options
The short term bonus is awarded annually by the
Remuneration Committee and relates to the achievement
of certain profit and cash targets set by that Committee.  Remuneration Report | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 23
Share option plans |
The Company operates two share option plans (a UK
Inland Revenue approved plan and an unapproved plan)
under which directors and other executives are eligible 
to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee. Options are granted at market value,
determined immediately before the grant. Annual awards
do not normally exceed one times relevant earnings.
The Company also operates an approved and an
unapproved Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme.
On 10 February 2004, a total of 1,000,000 and
1,869,898 options respectively were issued by these
schemes to two senior managers. Following flotation, no
further options may be issued by either scheme.
Robert Loosemore is precluded from participating in
either of the above option plans and the Board is
considering alternative means of providing suitable
incentivisation comparable to that enjoyed by other
executive directors.
As described in the Admission Document, the Company
expects to issue to senior management up to 8% of the
original issued share capital (that is, a total of 12,059,453
shares) at an exercise price of 1p per share.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law in the United Kingdom requires the
directors to prepare financial statements for each
financial period which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In
preparing those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent
• state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures

2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 27
We have audited the financial statements of Torex Retail
Plc for the period ended 31 December 2004 which
comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the
Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and
Losses, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
and the related notes. These financial statements have
been prepared under the historical cost convention and
on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company's
shareholders, as a body, in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the Company's
shareholders those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company's shareholders as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors |
As described in the Statement of Directors'
Responsibilities the Company's directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the
Directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if
the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if
we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors' remuneration and transactions with
the Company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Report and
Accounts and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. This other information
comprises only the Report of the Directors, the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Business
Review, the Financial Review and the Corporate
Governance statement. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion |
We conducted our audit in accordance with United
Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company's circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence
to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the financial
statements.
Opinion |
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair
view of the state of the Group’s and the Company's
affairs as at 31 December 2004 and of the Group’s profit
for the period then ended, and have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting
standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiaries up to 31 December 2004.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition. Profits and
losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. On acquisition of a subsidiary, all the subsidiary’s assets and
liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company, as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, representing the difference between the purchase
consideration and fair value of net assets acquired, has been capitalised and is amortised on a straight line basis over
its estimated useful economic life as shown in note 12. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Turnover and long-term contracts 
Turnover represents the amounts derived from the sale of software product licences, the implementation, installation,
maintenance and support services and the supplies of third party hardware and software. All revenue is reported
excluding value added tax. 
• Income from maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the contract. Payments
received in advance are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred income.
• Implementation and installation revenues are recognised as and when delivery takes place.
• Hardware and software licence revenues are recognised on customer acceptance, when there are no significant
vendor obligations remaining and the collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
In the case of longer term service arrangements these are accounted for as long term contracts. The attributable
profit on long-term contracts is recognised once their outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. Amounts
recoverable on such contracts are included within prepayments and accrued income, after provision has been made
for any foreseeable losses and the deduction of applicable payments on account. Full provision is made for losses
on all contracts in the year in which the loss is first foreseen.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write the cost of each asset down to
estimated residual values evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements – lease term
Plant and equipment – 3 to 10 years Notes to the Financial Statements | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 33
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Software development
Software development costs are charged against profits in the period in which they are incurred.
Stocks 
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each
product to its present location and condition.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an obligation
to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred
tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which future
reversals of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis
at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on
rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Lease and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at cost upon inception and depreciated
over their expected useful lives. 
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the
finance leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments
outstanding. Outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors. 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged against profits as incurred.
Pension costs
Retirement benefits to employees are provided by a number of defined contribution schemes. Payments are made
to pension trusts which are financially separate from the Group. These payments are charged against profits as
incurred.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rates
of exchange for the period. The adjustment to closing rates for the period is taken to reserves. The exchange
differences arising from the retranslation at closing rate of the opening balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are
taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account. 34 Torex Retail Plc | Report & Accounts 2004 | Notes to the Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Deferred consideration
The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash,
shares or other securities at a future date, depends on uncertain future events such as the future performance of the
acquired company. The amounts recognised in the financial statements are the fair value of the consideration that is
reasonably expected to be paid at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, primarily to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Discounts and premiums are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the life of the asset to which
they relate.
It is the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.

11 EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
weighted average number of shares in issue. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the potential ordinary share dilution from share options and shares to be
issued. Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares are set out below:

Exceptional items 787 – 0.50
Tax on exceptional items (73) – (0.04)
Underlying earnings per share 8,324 156,581 5.32
Underlying earnings per share excludes the effect of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. This is provided
because the directors consider it gives a better indication of underlying performance than basic earnings per share.
The Company has deferred consideration associated with the acquisition of Torex Retail NV (formerly Micrelec NV)
and the Alphameric Retail Division which is payable either in shares or cash solely at the discretion of the
Company. In calculating diluted earnings per share it has been assumed that the deferred consideration will be
payable by way of shares and the market price of the ordinary shares at the period end has been used to estimate
the number of shares that are to be issued. Only the conditions associated with the Torex Retail NV deferred
consideration have been met and therefore the dilutive effect of the Alphameric Retail Division acquisition has not
been included in the above table.
Any potential dilution from the possible future issue of shares described in the Admission Document and outlined
on page 23 has not been included in the above figures. Notes to the Financial Statements | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc 39

FRS 10, goodwill arising on each of the acquisitions during the period has been capitalised on the Group’s balance
sheet and is being amortised over 20 years. This is the period over which the directors estimate that the value of
the underlying business acquired will continue to exceed the value of the underlying assets. The investment in each
company or business is included in the balance sheet at its fair value at the date of acquisition. These fair values
are preliminary and will be further reviewed in 2005.

(b) Stocks have been written down to their estimated fair values
(c) Write-down of debtors primarily relates to the application of the Group’s revenue recognition policy
(d) Tax asset arising at acquisition and as a result of fair value adjustments
(e) Reassessment of the amounts payable in respect of acquired deferred consideration, primarily in respect of
Figure Retail Systems Limited, based on the most recent data available

20 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group purchases financial instruments in order to finance its operations and to manage the interest rate and
currency risks that arise from those operations and from its sources of finance. In addition, various balances, for
example, trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments, arise directly from the Group’s operations.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than currency risk
disclosures.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risks. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings. There is also a small
amount of finance lease commitment.
The Group seeks to minimise net interest payments by amalgamating Group cash balances to limit overdrafts and
maximise centrally placed term deposits.
The interest rate exposure of the financial liabilities of the Group was:
At

Fixed Floating 2004
interest rate interest rate Total
Sterling: £’000 £’000 £’000
Bank loans – 28,000 28,000
Finance leases 591 – 591
591 28,000 28,591
The bank loans bear interest at a range of rates between 1.5% and 2% above LIBOR.
In order to manage its exposure to floating interest rate risk, on a proportion of the loan the LIBOR interest rate from
the loan inception to 30 November 2005 has a cap of 5.45% and a collar of 4.25%. The amount so protected was
£14 million at 31 December 2004 and this will reduce in increments to £12 million at 30 November 2005 when 
the arrangement ceases. From 30 November 2005 to 31 May 2007 an initial amount of £11 million, reducing to 
£7 million over the period, is protected by a fixed rate of 5.45% (as the LIBOR rate).
The bank overdraft facility bears interest at a rate of 2% above the Lloyds TSB Bank plc base rate.
The weighted average interest rate on finance leases for the period was 5.5% and the weighted average period
which finance leases are over is 2.5 years. 48 Torex Retail Plc | Report & Accounts 2004 | Notes to the Financial Statements

2004 
Cash at bank and in hand £’000
Sterling 7,065
Euros 2,170
9,235
The Group places its cash balances on short term deposits on floating rates of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a mixture of short and medium-term bank facilities to meet foreseeable peak
borrowing requirements. Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
As at 31 December 2004, the bank facilities were as follows:
Overdraft £7 million facility – next annual review due on 30 November 2005
Other loan Revolving £10 million – next review date set at 30 November 2009
Five year loan Term loan £18 million – next review date set at 30 November 2009
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows:

Between two and five years 20,800 – 20,800 20,800
28,000 591 28,591 28,000
Currency risk
The Group does not actively hedge against the effect of exchange rate differences resulting from the translation of
foreign currency earnings, but has a policy to seek to hedge significant transaction exposures. Material surplus cash
balances not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit are promptly translated into the functional
currency of the operating unit.
The table opposite shows the Group’s transactional currency exposures that give rise to net currency gains and
losses in the profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group 
that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved. 49 Notes to the Financial Statements | 2004 Report & Accounts | Torex Retail Plc

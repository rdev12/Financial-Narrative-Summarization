  Financial calendar p2 aIr BerlIn annual report 2009 Mr Hunold, international air travel is still in one of its most serious crises.  
How is air Berlin coping?
joachim hunold   One of the greatest challenges facing the capital-intensive airline industry is  
applying   the   necessary   flexibility   when   circumstances   change   quickly   and   dramatically.   The   formula 
is to gain efficiency without losing quality: costs down, but never losing sight of growth prospects. 
Even before the crisis on the international financial market broke out, we launched a programme 
for increasing the overall performance across the whole Group. Further measures followed, such as 
the consistent reduction of long-haul routes. We have constantly optimised our whole route net-
work to the changing market conditions, reduced overcapacity and adjusted our capital expenditure. 
The successful effect on the bottom line is plain to see. We have managed to be one of the very few 
airlines to post a better result in 2009 than in the previous year.
and with successful capital measures …
joachim hunold   … significantly improving our balance sheet as well. Air Berlin’s equity increased 
by EUR 238 million in 2009 to EUR 610 million. That is an increase of 64 per cent. We received 
proceeds of EUR 133 million from the various capital measures in 2009. In turn, we decreased  
debt by EUR 187.9 million, measured by net debt. That is 25 per cent. Not only that, but with the 
new issue and the simultaneous buyback of a convertible bond, we achieved income of more than 
EUR 20 million. Last but not least, the success of the capital measures shows that investors are 
convinced by the potential for the future of our hybrid business model and are ready to invest their 
capital in these prospects.
Keyword – prospects: are you aiming for alliances amongst the international competition?
joachim hunold   Alliances make sense for us if the advantages prevail. So at the moment, we are 
maintaining a range of partnerships in selected attractive markets and offer connections with a 
joint flight number. Amongst other things, we operate a code share with S7 Airlines in Russia.  
This results in immediate growth.

joachim hunold   Correct. Air Berlin and the largest private airline in Turkey have linked their web-
sites, and we can thus offer our customers 17 additional connections between Germany and Turkey 
and 26 additional domestic Turkish routes. At the same time, the parent company of Pegasus, 
ESAS Holding A.S., is one of the strategic anchor shareholders of Air Berlin as of 2009. This un-
derlines our collective long-term direction. In this way, we can tap the growth market of Turkey 
much more effectively and integrate it into the Western European route network. Plus Turkey is the 
natural gateway to Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In addition the airport in Vienna will also 
gain importance for us as a hub for the East. The announced closer cooperation with our Austrian 
partner Niki fits seamlessly into this picture. In my opinion we are driving a very convincing growth 
strategy which is clearly orientated towards increasing value.
Key phrase – climate change. How long will people still be able to afford the luxury  
of flying?
joachim hunold   Mobility is a fundamental human right which cannot be relinquished in our free 
world. In addition, the increasing international diversity of labour requires an increasing amount  
of mobility. When viewed in this way, flying is by no means a luxury. “Commuting” by air is of 
great importance on short and medium-haul routes at the moment, and is continuing to grow.  
People can also always choose their airline from an environmental perspective. Our experience is 
that companies, businesses and frequent fliers are taking ever more notice of that. We are prepared 
for it. 
In what way?

for   decades   –   not   just   since   they   took   on   “target   group   relevance”.   As   early   as   the   beginning   of 
the   1990s,   we   were   the   first   in   Europe   to   install   the   jet   fuel-saving   winglets   on   the   wings   of   our

and in the future?
joachim hunold Even more savings, as we will consistently drive the modernisation of our fleet 
forward to meet our requirements. The newest aircraft also have the lowest fuel consumption. That 
can best be seen with our ultra-modern Q400 turboprops. In 2009, we integrated eight additional 
aircraft into our fleet and took old planes out of service. We are already positioning ourselves for 
the advent of the “Single European Sky” – the imminent new world in the European skies with uni-
fied air traffic control. The sooner the patchwork quilt of around fifty national traffic control bodies 
is abolished, the less aircraft will have to circle in unnecessary holding patterns and constantly 
change their speed, altitude and flight path because the transfer procedures from one air traffic 
control jurisdiction to the next are so incredibly complicated. However, without the latest technolo-
gies for  flight optimisation  on board and on  the ground,  the new  world will  barely function properly 
– particularly if air traffic grows further. Air Berlin is by all means prepared for this new age.

“o ur growth strategy is  
clearly orientated towards  
increasing value.” last question: What can we expect for 2010?
joachim hunold   I am confident that, despite the ongoing risks in terms of general global economic 
development – in particular on the job market – we have a good chance of continuing the positive 
developments   of   last   year   forward   into   the   next.   We   are   anticipating   that   we   will   again   grow   our   
passenger numbers more strongly in 2010 than the market as a whole, for which IATA expects  
passenger growth of 4.5 per cent. To achieve this, we are focusing on our highly motivated team on 
the ground and in the air, our balanced route portfolio for business and private travel and the fur-
ther optimisation of our high frequency and flexible route network. Just as we made it more attrac-
tive with the TUIfly city connections and with new partnerships in 2009, we will continue to focus  
on its further development in the current year. And we will of course continue to seek further cost 
reductions.

eVol VInG For success.
even c harles Darwin, who would have celebrated his 200th 
birthday last year, knew that only those who find their niche 
can keep up with the pace of progress. a nd only systematic 
growth can bring success. air Berlin is loyal to this principle 
and, thanks to its hybrid business model, has achieved a 
unique market position.
With its multi-award-winning service, highly used, attractive 
route network and state-of-the-art, fuel-saving fleet, a ir Berlin 
is outperforming not just the low cost airlines. t he result is 
that, in the deepest crisis in air travel, a ir Berlin is one of the 
few airlines that actually improved its operating result in 2009.
We shall reveal some of the secrets of our success over the 
following pages, and so pay homage to c harles Darwin – one of 
the fathers of our success.

An innovative on-board system, called the “Traffic flow restrictions module”, shows 
the Air Berlin pilots where air space is open and where it is closed. It does this at an 
early stage and without permanent radio contact with the air traffic controllers. This 
allows the pilot to define an optimised flight route on time. In this way, Air Berlin saves 
several thousand tons of aviation fuel each year and clearly reduces carbon dioxide 
emissions. This is good for the environment and good for the balance sheet. p.30

Air Berlin has been using an innovative, satellite-controlled navigation system since June 2009 
- the only airline in Europe to do so. This system can determine the position of the Air Berlin 
Boeing 737 on its approach to within one metre accuracy. The GBAS system can show up  
to 49 approach flights at one airport simultaneously. In this way, better use is made of the air 
space above the airports, approach routes are optimised, delays avoided and fuel saved.

Januar Y 2009
significant environmental measures right at the start of the year: a ir Berlin is the first airline 
in europe to be approved by the l Ba (Federal o ffice of civil a viation) to carry out instru-
ment landings of the highest category cat IIIb for its fleet of more than 40 Boeing aircraft. 
a s such, landings will be possible when visibility in fog is down to just 75 metres, meaning 
that diversions will be rarely required. a ir Berlin also starts using a new software system  
s afer oute™ to improve landing approaches. t he speed of incoming aircraft is adjusted in 
such a way that holding patterns are avoided, even when there is a high density of traffic. 
r esult: passengers save valuable time, noise pollution affecting properties neighbouring the 
airport is significantly reduced and fuel consumption falls together with emissions.

ThE AIR BERLIN ShARE
Annus horribilis 2009. However, the year in aviation did not 
end as dramatically as many had feared. Air Berlin was able  
to consistently maintain and achieve its forecast for the finan-
cial year, actually generating a better operating result than  
the previous year.
The Air Berlin share price in 2009
Following the shockwaves that descended on the financial world in 2008, 2009 was the year  
of recovery. However, development was by no means consistent, with stock markets only 
reaching the bottom of their previous bear trend in March. This was initially followed by a severe 
rollercoaster ride. 
The Air Berlin share price displayed a similar trend: it was not able to escape the correction of the 
markets. Starting the year at EUR 5.00 and quickly climbing to its high for the year of EUR 5.05 
by 6 January, it then fell to its low for the year of EUR 3.06 by late-March 2009. Both the stock 
markets and the Air Berlin share then went through a period of strong recovery, which was  
followed by just as significant a correction. However, the test of the march low towards the 
end of June proved successful. The market and share reached “higher lows”. The subsequent 
recovery in the second half of the year was somewhat less erratic and the Air Berlin share did not 
quite follow the performance of the SDAX Index. It closed 2009 at EUR 3.76, before a strong 
price increase began in January 2010, driven by several buy recommendations. 
The European Dow Jones STOXX Airlines Index featured development over long periods of 
2009 that mirrored that of the wider market. The strong economic cyclicality of the  
aviation industry and its dependency on the development of oil prices was reflected positively 
in airline share prices in net terms: the global economy displayed its first trend towards recovery 
and oil prices started to perform moderately again following the price escapades of the previous 
year. 
Successful capital measures
Contrary to the performance of the share price, the market capitalisation of Air Berlin PLC 
increased by a good 3 per cent over the course of 2009. While there were 65.7 million Air Berlin 
shares in issue by the end of 2008, the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2009 totalled 
85.2 million. This corresponds to an increase of almost 30 per cent.

with strong fluctuations
Number of shares  
increases by almost 30 
per cent in 2009 p42 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
In the second quarter of 2009, two share placings were implemented, issuing a total of 
11,071,700 new shares at a subscription price of EUR 3.50. Following this, there was a total of 
76,788,803 registered shares outstanding. In October 2009, a further capital increase was  
carried out in accordance with the agreement between Air Berlin and Leibniz-Service GmbH,  
a group company of TUI Travel PLC, regarding the acquisition of 9.9 per cent of Air Berlin.  
The TUI subsidiary acquired 8,437,393 new shares in Air Berlin PLC at a price of EUR 3.97 per 
share. As at the end of October, there was a total of 85,226,196 registered shares outstanding.
In August 2009, Air Berlin placed a convertible bond with a principal amount of EUR 125 
million. A portion of the proceeds was used to buy back outstanding bonds with a total nominal 
amount of EUR 84 million from the 1.5 per cent convertible bond issued in 2007. The remainder 
was kept available for refinancing future aircraft deliveries and improving liquidity. The new  
convertible bond is convertible into shares of Air Berlin PLC. It is denominated into units with a 
nominal par value of EUR 50,000 and has a maturity of 5 years and a coupon of 9 per cent.  
The conversion price per share is EUR 4.01.
In addition to the improved earnings situation, Air Berlin significantly improved its capital 
resources in 2009 thanks to these successful capital measures. As at 31 December 2009, 
equity increased by a net amount of EUR 238.0 million, or 64.0 per cent, to EUR 610.0 million 
compared to EUR 372.0 million at the 2008 balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2009, the 
equity ratio was 25.3 per cent compared to 15.4 per cent at the end of the 2008 financial year.

COMPANy PROfILE
Company structure and operating activities
Legal form
As the legal parent of the Group, Air Berlin has chosen the legal form of a PLC (public limited 
company). It was founded in England and Wales with its registered office in Rickmansworth and 
its management is based in Berlin. As a PLC, the Company is run by a “unitary board” com-
prised of executive and non-executive directors. Changes to the Board during the financial year 
are listed on page 113. 
Unique business model with a clear brand strategy
The Air Berlin Group follows a clear brand strategy with its strong “airberlin” brand, which 
is well-established throughout Europe. As a “hybrid carrier”, Air Berlin is the only European air-
line to occupy the gap between classic full-fare airlines and the low-cost carriers (LCC) with their 
very limited services. As such, Air Berlin sets standards in international competition 
between airlines: low prices combined with outstanding service on the ground and in the air 
offering a price/performance ratio which is unique in the industry.
Air Berlin’s business model mainly targets three major customer groups: business passen-
gers, private individuals, and organisers of package holidays. Since the three target groups exhibit 
different characteristics (shorter-term seasonal demand versus more medium-term demand 
cycles), they complement each other ideally: weaker phases in one group can be compensated for 
by higher demand from the other customer groups. This stabilises business performance, 
both during the year as well as over longer periods of time.

Air Berlin benefited from this positioning, most notably during the recent deep recession. In  
particular, the number of contracts with corporate customers in 2009 increased signifi-
cantly by 50 per cent to 1,200 compared to 2008. When they choose Air Berlin, companies bene-
fit from low prices, yet their employees still enjoy an outstanding service. Air Berlin wants to 
continue generating its corporate growth from the potential offered by all three customer groups.
Air Berlin operates a worldwide flight network with a strong base in germany and europe. 
Southern Europe, in particular the Spanish market, has traditionally been a core region. Within 
the closely-knit European route network, the Company flies to 21 destination airports in Ger-
many. Düsseldorf, Berlin, Nuremberg and Munich, as well as Palma de Mallorca in particular, 
are Air Berlin’s hubs. In total, Air Berlin flies to 84 destinations in Europe and 11 in North Africa, 
along with a further 18 destinations overseas, in Africa and in Asia (as of 31 December 2009). 
Air Berlin flies to most european cities. These include Barcelona, Birmingham, Budapest, 
Copenhagen, Gothenburg, Helsinki, Innsbruck, Krakow, London, Milan, Manchester, Moscow, 
Nice, Oslo, Paris, Rome, St Petersburg, Stockholm, Venice, Vienna and Zurich. Mallorca alone 
welcomes more than 500 Air Berlin planes each week during the summer. From Palma de Mal-
lorca, passengers can fly to a further 18 destinations on the neighbouring islands, the Spanish 
mainland and in Portugal. 
Air Berlin is systematically expanding its codesharing partnerships, thereby using numer-
ous growth opportunities in international air traffic. As of late 2009, the Company had partner-
ships with the fourth-largest airline in China, hainan airlines, with russia’s s7 airlines, 
which offers Air Berlin access to the largest domestic route network in Russia, with Pegasus  
Airlines, Turkey’s largest private airline, and with Thailand’s Bangkok Airways.
With 8,278 employees, a fleet of 152 airplanes, 42 of which are owned by the Company itself (as 
at 31 December 2009) and 27.9 million passengers, the Air Berlin Group is the second largest 
airline in Germany. After the acquisition of the TUIfly destinations Air Berlin is sixth in Europe 
when measured by the number of flights. The Company has been a member of the International 
Air Transport Association (IATA) since 1997 and, accordingly, is deemed a scheduled carrier.
As of late-2009,  
Air Berlin flew to 134  
destinations

Under the slogan “airberlin. Your Airline.”, customer orientation and convenience  
represent the central elements in Air Berlin’s market presence. The Company therefore uses all 
distribution channels, from traditional booking via a travel agent or telephone to the different 
opportunities for online booking. Air Berlin customers can even check in using the trans-
parent, user-friendly Air Berlin website or by mobile phone online. The numerous convenience 
solutions also include a dedicated 24/7 service centre staffed by competent contact persons.  
However, the services on offer go much further than the actual services related to flying itself. 
For example, Air Berlin works closely with several partners from the fields of travel and financial 
services as well as with the press. The premium partners provide additional services directly via 
the Air Berlin website.
Air Berlin places considerable emphasis on family-friendliness. For example, children 
between two and eleven pay only two thirds of the regular price. Unlike traditional low-cost  
carriers, Air Berlin provides snacks and drinks free of charge to its passengers on all flights.

CORPORATE STRATEGy
Air Berlin’s corporate strategy focuses on increasing the value of the company. Steady, 
above-average and profitable growth in the classic growth market of international travel is the  
cornerstone of the value added strategy. 
The main driving force behind the corporate growth is the attractive unique selling point of Air 
Berlin’s unique position as a “hybrid supplier”. With this market position between the tradi-
tional low-cost carriers (“no frills airlines”) with their severely reduced service and the traditional 
flagship airlines (“full-fare airlines”) with a very good level of service but high prices, Air Berlin 
offers the advantages of both: for Air Berlin, high product quality goes hand in hand with 
above-average service while still maintaining low prices. In addition, the closely knit,  
optimally structured route network with its many hubs ensures convenient distances, thereby 
increasing the convenience of flying for the passengers, both on the ground and in the air. 
Furthermore, the structure of the route network has been optimised for profit. Together with 
high operating efficiency and strict cost awareness in the entire Air Berlin Group, as well as 
attractive source markets, particularly centred on the hubs, profitability is given further impetus. 
The concentration on the three major customer groups (business passengers, private individuals, 
organisers of package holidays) – even in economically difficult times – makes a major contribu-
tion to stabilising business performance and profits.
Air Berlin markets its position aggressively and uses all channels for this purpose. The brand 
essence is clearly outlined with the slogan “Air Berlin – Your Airline.”: the friendly airline for 
the entire flight-related service package. It is also brought to life with an unmistakeable brand 
philosophy and a high recognition value. The community character of the Air Berlin brand  
philosophy takes centre stage. The main goals of this brand strategy are long-term, stable cus-
tomer loyalty while also appealing to new attractive target groups. Its message is convenience 
and best-possible price/performance ratio for the flying experience.

COMPANy MANAGEMENT
Complying with all relevant safety regulations regarding flying takes top priority in company 
management. Strict cost and process efficiency take centre stage when it comes to operating and 
strategic management. Continuously improving these aspects in all Company divisions repre-
sents a permanent, Company-wide task to be observed by all employees. With regard to the  
Company’s organisational structure, this maxim results in an extremely flat and transpa-
rent structure. 
Cross-divisional functions are performed centrally by the relevant flight operations, on-board 
service and technical service division with the last two areas combined in dedicated subsidiaries. 
Internally, the Group uses ebitdar (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation  
and rent) as a reflection of its earnings. EBITDAR is used as the generally comparable operat-
ing performance ratio in the aviation industry and by investors and analysts. 
Airlines which finance and capitalise a larger share of their aircraft on balance sheet generally 
incur higher depreciation, and possibly higher interest costs. By contrast, companies which lease 
more aircraft have comparatively high expenses for materials and services, including leasing 
costs. optimisation of the proportion of owned aircraft compared with leased aircraft and max-
imisation of the result from operating activities after financing can only feasibly occur on the 
basis of EBITDAR, as it adjusts the operating result by the two expense types, depreciation and 
leasing costs.
Safety first!
EBITDAR is the pivotal 
steering indicator p54 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Additional important operating indicators in aviation, and hence for Air Berlin as well, are the 
seat-load factor as the basis for the fleet and aircraft utilisation. It is the quotient from reve-
nue passenger kilometres (RPK) and available seat kilometres (ASK). In addition, the average 
yields per passenger, kilometres flown or passenger kilometres measure the specific sales 
power. Air Berlin operates a fully developed yield management system, which is continually 
being optimised to systematically increase the average yields.

The international financial industry entered a crisis of unpredictable magnitude following the 
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the fourth quarter of 2008. Illiquidity on the financial mar-
kets as the direct result of this forced many companies in the real economy to take drastic meas-
ures: ensuring one’s own liquidity took number one priority. The consequence of this was an 
abrupt and massive negative inventory cycle. In order to protect liquidity, orders were  
cancelled, investments stopped and payments postponed for as long as possible. Upstream  
production sectors, manufacturers of investment goods, global trade and hence the entire infra-
structure and transport industry were confronted with an extremely serious slump in business. 
By contrast, consumption initially provided a boost to the global economy. In the winter  
of 2008/09, but particularly in the first quarter of 2009, the world suffered the deepest  
recession in eight decades.
Once the rescue and stabilisation measures of governments and central banks had initially stabi-
lised the financial system, the liquidity situation on the financial markets improved. Starting in 
the second quarter of 2009, the massive spending programmes to support the economy 
started to show an effect. Numerous countries succeeded in supporting employment in key 
industries such as the automotive industry through direct subsidies (“car scrappage scheme”). 
All in all, the inventory cycle was reversed, resulting in a renewed flow of commodities, albeit  
at a clearly reduced level, and depleted inventories were replenished.

The global economy, including Germany, has again been on a growth path since the second  
quarter of 2009. However, its momentum and strength remain weak. This is indicated by 
the clear slow-down in industrial activity from the end of the third quarter after the intermittently 
positive inventories effect had stagnated. According to an initial provisional assessment of the 
German Federal Statistical Office on 13 January 2010, the German economy, measured by gross 
domestic product (GDP), shrunk in 2009 for the first time in six years. At -5 per cent, the decline 
in the price-adjusted GDP was the largest seen in the post-war period. This is one of the largest 
declines in countries within the OECD, which is expecting a decline of only 3.5 per cent for its 
member countries in total, and a decline of 4 per cent for countries in the OECD euro zone.
The price of oil rises from a low level
After the price of crude oil had been exposed to extreme volatility in 2008 and American 
light crude oil (WTI) had reached an historic high of USD 145.31 for the 159-litre barrel in July 
2008, the price descended in an equally unprecedented amount to just one third of this ultra-
high price. Since reaching a low of USD 48.86 in November 2008, the WTI price successively 
recovered in 2009 with only minor fluctuations, and temporarily broke through the eighty dollar 
mark in the fourth quarter. With an end-of-year price of USD 79.39 in 2009 (2008: USD 44.60), 
crude oil became 78 per cent more expensive in the reporting year. Since the jet fuel 
price depends closely on the price of crude oil, it increased by a comparable amount.

Central banks stabilise the interest markets
The 2009 financial year was marked by clearly reduced interest rates as well as numer-
ous stabilisation measures taken by the central banks to support the financial markets. Concern 
about the economy and the strong increase in risk aversion, particularly with regard to credit 
instruments, led to people seeking refuge in government securities and a corresponding power-
ful decline in related yields. For example, 10-year US Treasuries only had a return of 2.6 per cent  
at the start of the year. At its first meeting in 2009, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided  
to lower its tender rate by 50 basis points, and expanded the target range of the interest rate  
tender by 200 basis points.
Even though the national economic programmes established in the European Union led to an 
increase in the government bonds on offer, this was countered by enormous demand, 
particularly for federal government securities. The expansionary ECB policy as well as the decline 
in inflationary expectations forced the EUR yields in the 10-year range to below 3 per cent at the 
end of the first quarter of 2010.
Significant reduction in 
interest rates in 2009 p58 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
In the middle of 2009, the extensive buying up of securities and interest rate cuts of the central 
banks meant that further worsening of the global confidence crisis was averted. While the US 
central bank had lowered the key interest rate level to almost zero, the capital market 
recorded a slight upturn and the 10-year returns in the USA rose again towards 3.5 per cent. 
While a very flat interest rate yield curve developed in the euro zone for short-term maturities as 
a result of providing further liquidity, the capital market yield in the 10-year range picked up 
slightly and rose to around 3.3 per cent to the end of the year.
Currency exchange markets impacted by weak dollar
While the USD was traditionally regarded as a safe haven in the past, an unusual reaction 
occurred in 2009 as it lost against most currencies. In the first quarter of 2009, the euro was 
quoted at around USD 1.26 for several weeks, and then clearly increased in value. By November, 
it had reached a value of just over USD 1.51. declining risk appetite of the market partici-
pants initially spoke against the USD, and the expansive fiscal steps in the USA led to medium-
term inflation risks. Even good US data led to dollar losses as the market reacted to the positive 
news with greater risk propensity.
Sufficient liquidity and historically low USD interest rates coupled with investors looking to gain 
a return resulted in a short positioning of the USD as a result of carry trades. Within a very short 
space of time, the USD took on the previous refinancing function of typical low-interest curren-
cies such as the Swiss franc or the Japanese yen. In addition, emotionally-charged discussions 
about the status of the usd as a reserve currency caused some elements of the market to 
position themselves to the detriment of the USD. It was not until the end of the year that positive 
signals from the US labour market caused some of the long positions in the euro to be unwound, 
with the euro falling to 1.4300 – 1.4450.

The air travel sector in 2009
For the International Air Transport Association IATA, the global umbrella association of tradi-
tional full-fare airlines, 2009 was the worst year in its post-war history. Passenger  
volumes of IATA airlines declined by 3.5 per cent and cargo traffic by 10.1 per cent. According to 
IATA, its statistics cover 93 per cent of international air traffic.
IATA stated that as a consequence the industry’s long-term growth trend was set back by two-
and-a-half years in terms of passenger traffic and by as much as three-and-a-half years in terms of 
cargo in 2009. The industry’s capacity, measured by the available seat kilometres (ASK), declined 
by 3 per cent; Utilisation (seat-load factor) fell from 75.9 per cent in 2008 to 75.6 per cent in 
2009. The passenger kilometres flown (RPK) fell by as much as 3.5 per cent for the year as a 
whole. 
Business performance in 2009 shows that compared to the previous year the industry did not 
start achieving positive results until September – and then only slowly at first. However, it must 
be taken into consideration that this was mainly due to the already very weak basis in the 
fourth quarter of 2008. In particular, December 2008 recorded extreme declines.
Simply comparing the industry RPK with the performance of Air Berlin’s RPK makes little sense, 
since Air Berlin consistently placed improving profitability at the centre of its corporate strategy 
in 2009. To this end, both the capacity and the average route distance, and hence the ASK, were 
clearly reduced at a very early stage, and adjusted in very close coordination with the demand 
trend. This is shown by the relationship between RPK and ASK: The closer the two lines are to 
each other, the more efficiently supply management (ASK) reacts to the demand trend (RPK).  
In the case of Air Berlin, the monthly changes scarcely deviate from each other, particularly in 
the second half of 2009. By contrast, the industry trends clearly diverge – a sign of the 
marked erosion of profitability in the aviation industry, particularly in the first half of 2009. As a 
result, IATA assumes that the average yields of the industry in 2009 fell by between 5 and 10 per 
cent below the previous year’s level, and the industry incurred record global losses 
totalling USD 11 billion. Air Berlin’s yields increased in 2009.

It is clear that the airlines did not adjust their passenger and cargo capacities as quickly as 
demand sank. The industry RPK reached its lowest level in March 2009; this was also the lowest 
point of the most recent cycle.
The association of european airlines (aea) measured a drop of 4.5% in passenger  
kilometres and 5.8% in passenger volume for its 36 member airlines in 2009. This decline of  
20 million from 346 to 326 million passengers is well above the previous negative record from 
2002, when 14 million fewer flights were booked as a consequence of the 11 September attacks.

The german federal statistical office has concluded that German aviation passenger  
traffic suffered losses in 2009 for the first time since 2002. With 158 million passengers,  
German airports recorded a decline of 4.8 per cent. Again, this means that the losses in Germany 
were higher than after the terrorist attacks in the USA (2002: -3.3 per cent). There was no  
difference in the performance of domestic and international traffic figures: passenger figures on 
international flights fell by 4.8 per cent to 135 million passengers, while passenger figures on 
domestic flights fell by 4.9 per cent to 24 million passengers.
The German Airport Working Group (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Verkehrsflughäfen; ADV) 
also recorded a year-on-year 4.8 per cent decline in passenger figures to 180.8 million at Germany’s 
23 international airports. Under this method, domestic flights are recorded both at the origin and 
destination airport. In air cargo, including airmail, traffic volume fell by 6.7 per cent to 3.4 mil-
lion tonnes. However, the latest monthly comparisons have shown a clear positive trend, even in 
Germany. This is comparable with the international trend. For example, in December 2009 pas-
senger demand and air freight volume rose by 2.6 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. 
Against the backdrop of this trend in European air transport, Air Berlin recorded an above-average 
performance with a drop in passenger numbers of 2.3%, despite the rigorous capacity reduction.
In 2009, the share of low-cost carriers in German air traffic again increased considerably. 
According to a joint evaluation carried out by Deutsche Flugsicherung (the German air traffic 
control body) and ADV, low-cost carriers accounted for more than 29 per cent of all flight  
movements at Germany’s airports as of the middle of 2009. In 2008, they had a market share  
of only 25.8 per cent. In 2001, fewer than 5 per cent of all take-offs and landings were by low-cost 
airlines. Among Germany’s 19 low-cost carriers, Air Berlin is clearly in the top position, meas-
ured by the number of take-offs. In Europe, Air Berlin is in third place.

OPERATIvE DE vELOPMENT
“Jump” showed its full effect in 2009
The “Jump” programme was launched in 2008 and rapidly implemented in time for the start of 
that year’s winter schedule. Its purpose was to improve the performance in the Air Berlin Group, 
and it achieved its full impact for the year in 2009. Consisting of six individual modules, Jump 
focussed on optimising and improving the network and fleet and pricing structure, on increasing 
additional potential revenue, the systematic control of operating costs, including improving  
fuel efficiency, streamlining HR costs as well as optimising the performance of the technical  
divisions.
The implementation of Jump allowed for a significant improvement of key operating perform-
ance indicators per output unit in 2008; in the reporting year, these improvements were achieved 
throughout the entire year with a positive effect. This means that further improvement of the per-
formance was achieved in 2009 as a whole, despite the downturn in the aviation industry. A fully 
comparable calculation cannot be provided since the network of TUIfly, which was taken over in 
autumn 2009, differed substantially from the one TUIfly operated in 2008. The following 2008 
figures are thus as originally reported, whereas those for the year under review include the TUIfly 
network from 25 October 2009. 
On this basis flight revenue per passenger in the reporting year stood at EUR 106.28, having 
achieved EUR 108.28 in the previous year. Flight revenue per ASK increased by 6.9 per cent to 
5.86 eurocent following 5.48 eurocent, and increased by 8.5 per cent per RPK to 7.57 eurocent fol-
lowing 6.98 eurocent.
The progress achieved in 2008 also had a positive effect on costs throughout 2009 as a whole. In 
particular, the efforts to reduce the use of jet fuel and the corresponding costs had an impact. 
These cost reductions were achieved despite a 9.5 per cent decline in the average length per desti-
nation and a corresponding increase in fuel consuming lift-offs. The specific use of jet fuel was 
reduced considerably through the optimisation of the route network and numerous additional 
measures (also see section “Sustainability” on page 80). With total fuel costs down 18.2 per cent 
and a decline of capacity (ASK) by 10.3 per cent fuel costs per ASK fell 8.8 per cent and 7.4 per

cent per RPK. On the other hand, the operative margin EBITDAR per passenger increased by 
10.9 per cent reaching EUR 18.04 after 16.27 in the previous year. Per ASK EBITDAR rose by 
20.8 per cent and per RPK by 22.7 per cent. 
Passenger travel and the fleet
One of the major challenges in the 2009 financial year was to adjust capacity, route  
network and fleet management to total demand which had been in stark decline since the fourth 
quarter of 2008 as well as to the changed demand structure, and to do so as quickly as possible 
and with as much foresight as possible. This was largely successful, even during the very volatile 
phase in early 2009 where the general market weakness was compounded by capricious weather 
in the Mediterranean, which had a considerable effect on the important early-year passenger  
traffic at the major hub of Palma de Mallorca. In addition, the consequential reduction of the 
intercontinental routes, which the global recession had affected particularly badly, had a 
stabilising effect. This had a particular effect on the Chinese destinations, which were discontin-
ued in the 2008/2009 winter schedule and where international passenger traffic almost came  
to a standstill, as well as on the transatlantic traffic and reductions in flight frequencies to South 
Africa and the Far East.
However, the portion of sold seat kilometres (RPK) of the available seat kilometres (ASK) 
declined only slightly in spring 2009 compared to the pre-crisis level in the first half of 2008. 
Thanks to this successful management of capacity, route network and the fleet as 
well as the cost reduction measures which were introduced, Air Berlin went against the industry 
trend and improved profits and returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2009.

The Air Berlin Group transported a total of 27,911,193 passengers, of which slightly more than 
400,000 were passengers from the TUIfly network from 25 October 2009, in the reporting year. 
The passenger volume for the previous year was 28,559,220. This results in a clearly below-aver-
age decline of 3.7 per cent excluding the impacts of the TUIfly network, despite the systematic 
capacity adjustment and route optimisation. The total number of available seats was reduced by 
0.9 per cent from 36,443,866 to 36,124,762. Accordingly, the seat load factor in the reporting 
year fell by 1.10 percentage point to 77.26 per cent. It was thus 1.66 per cent above the average 
achieved by IATA airlines.

The total number of aircraft rose to 152 in 2009, compared with the previous year. This 
includes the 15 airplanes operated by TUIfly for Air Berlin. As a result and of the scheduled  
purchase of an additional eight ultra-modern Q400 turboprops, the composition  
of the fleet changed. The acquisition of TUIfly’s aircraft led to a clear increase in the number of  
Boeing aircraft. Most notable is the addition of 11 B737-700s and, initially, two B737-300s, which 
were phased out in February 2010. The slightly older TUIfly airplanes have caused the average 
age of the fleet to increase slightly from 4.6 years in the previous year to 5.5 years in the reporting 
year. Nevertheless the Air Berlin Group’s fleet remains one of the youngest in Europe.
In December 2009, the Swiss service provider sr technics and air berlin concluded a series 
of contracts for engine maintenance. During the ten-year term of these contracts, SR 
Technics will perform certain maintenance services for a substantial proportion of the engines of 
the Air Berlin fleet, consisting of around 55 aircraft of the Airbus A320 family, 13 Airbus A330s 
and roughly 55 Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft. In the context of these contracts, SR Tech-
nics will provide comprehensive maintenance services for Air Berlin’s engines. This includes 
scheduled engine overhauls and field team assistance. These services will be provided at the  
SR Technics Engine Maintenance Center in Zurich. As part of this new business relationship, 
Air Berlin and a member of the corporate group of Mubadala Development Company (the parent 
company of SR Technics), have concluded a sale and lease-back transaction for up to twelve 
reserve engines worth approximately USD 100 million. SR Technics will take on the mainte-
nance of these engines as part of the contractual arrangements with Air Berlin.

The optimisation of the route network in the previous year resulted in passenger volume 
being concentrated at the ten largest destination airports. This continued in 2009: while passen-
ger volume for the smaller destinations declined by a total of 3.9 per cent, passenger figures for 
the ten busiest airports declined by only 0.8 per cent. Excluding the TUIfly destinations, the 
decline of the smaller destinations would have been more pronounced. Overall, this leads to 
greater efficiency and lower specific costs.
With +7.1 per cent, the German capital moved clearly against the trend. This would have been  
the case even without TUIfly. In Berlin, more than 6 million passengers checked in and out with  
Air Berlin. Behind this is the capacity expansion as part of the launch of a number of new 
city connections. Passenger volume also grew in Vienna, where Air Berlin opened new city 
connections which had a significant immediate effect. 
With -1.6 per cent, the important Palma de Mallorca hub recorded an above-average performance. 
The decline in Düsseldorf can mainly be attributed to the discontinuation of transatlantic routes. 
The clear downturn in Munich is the result of the elimination of long-haul routes and some Euro-
pean and domestic German destinations were discontinued as part of route network optimisation.

In the 2009 business year, Air Berlin sold approximately 62,2 per cent of its tickets via individ-
ual ticket sales and 37,8 per cent through tour operators and tour organisers (bulk tickets). The 
high bulk-ticket share continues to differentiate Air Berlin from other European low-cost carriers 
which are practically unrepresented in the charter business. Individual ticket sales at Air Berlin 
also exhibit a unique quality: compared with the industry as a whole, Air Berlin sells a high pro-
portion of tickets via the conventional distribution channel of travel agencies. Air Berlin therefore 
uses a balanced mixture of strong and well-established distribution channels. Temporary dips in 
one distribution channel are often compensated by better performance in the other channels, 
thereby stabilising business as a whole.

DEvELOPMENT IN fINANCIAL fIGURES 
In the following comments to the results, financial position and net assets, the adjusted figures 
from the 2008 financial statements have been used. The adjustments relate to the bonus miles 
issued to customers as part of Air Berlin’s frequent flyer programme (“topbonus” programme). 
In accordance with IFRIC 13 “Customer Loyalty Programmes”, these are to be measured at the 
fair value using the deferred-income method as of 1 January 2009 with a retrospective adjust-
ment to comparative periods. The value of one mile was valued using the marginal-cost method 
until 31 December 2008. Further explanations can be found in Note 4p on page 135.  
The information on the reporting year also includes the activities of the TUIfly route network, 
which was taken over as of 25 October 2009.
Results
The 2009 financial year was marked by the global recession, which had a particularly severe 
impact on the international aviation industry. However, Air Berlin was able to absorb the nega-
tive influences on the overall economy better than the sector. At EUR 3,240.3 million, revenue for 
the reporting year was down 4.4 per cent on the previous year (EUR 3,388.5 million; the applica-
tion of IFRIC 13 led to a reduction of EUR 12.2 million). 
Revenue from single-seat ticket sales was maintained at almost the same level as the previ-
ous year (EUR 1,863.3 million), with a drop of less than one per cent to EUR 1,845.4 million. 
charter revenue, however, fell by 8.8 per cent to EUR 1,121.1 million, down from EUR 1,229.1 
million. Revenue from in-flight sales also dropped by 6.0 per cent to EUR 33.1 million, down 
from EUR 35.2 million, which was largely due to the reduction of long-haul routes. revenue 
from other services fell by 7.7 per cent from EUR 260.9 million to EUR 240.7 million, 
mainly for the same reason. These services include freight services, technical services and addi-
tional services such as credit cards and Air Berlin cards, seat reservations, excess baggage and 
proceeds from advertising and commission.
other operating income totalled EUR 42.4 million for 2009, up from EUR 38.6 million. 
The total income for the reporting year fell by 4.2 per cent to EUR 3,282.8 million, compared 
with EUR 3,427.1 million in the previous year.

With regard to costs, Air Berlin saw considerable improvements in its general operating perform-
ance as a result of the Jump programme implemented for the first time over an entire year. 
Accordingly, substantial reductions were possible in a large number of expense lines. This 
result was achieved despite the fact that a much larger portion of the route network was replaced 
by short- and medium-haul destinations, which, owing to the higher number of take-offs and 
landings, lead to higher average costs than long-haul routes. 
The improvements can be seen under expenses for materials and services, particularly in 
the 12.7 per cent reduction in catering expenses, under other operating expenses in the 43.2 per 
cent decline in expenses for sales commissions paid to agencies, in the 22.4 per cent drop in 
other personnel expenses, particularly for training purposes, and in travel expenses for flying 
crew (-10.3 per cent). With the optimization of the route network, airport fees were also reduced 
by 1.8 per cent and navigation fees by 3.6 per cent. 
The sharp decline in fuel expenses provided considerable relief: they dropped by 18.2 per cent 
to EUR 715.4 million, compared with EUR 874.3 million in the previous year. Not only did lower 
overall market prices have a positive impact, but also significant fuel savings thanks to ongoing 
efforts to reduce consumption. With the aid of these measures, consumption was cut by 
11,000 tonnes or 1.0 per cent in 2009 under otherwise equal conditions. 
In total, expenses for materials and services fell by 7.1 per cent to EUR 2,193.2 million from  
EUR 2,359.8 million. Other operating expenses were down 0.9 per cent at EUR 511.3 million, 
compared with EUR 515.9 million for the previous year, despite a 19.2 per cent increase in IT 
expenses. personnel expenses were reduced by 1.2 per cent to EUR 440.7 million from  
EUR 446.3 million.
overall operating expenses at EBITDAR level totalled EUR 2,779.1 million in the reporting 
year, down 6.2 per cent on the previous year’s figure of EUR 2,962.5 million, showing a noticea-
bly stronger decline than in the total operating performance. The profit figure EBITDAR (earn-
ings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rent) therefore increased by 8.4 per cent 
to EUR 503.6 million in 2009 from EUR 464.7 million in the previous year.

leasing expenses for aircraft rose by 1.8 per cent from EUR 359.5 million to EUR 366.0 mil-
lion, primarily due to the net increase in the size of the fleet. depreciation increased by 5.8 per 
cent to EUR 109.1 million from EUR 103.1 million. result from operating activities 
(EBIT) therefore increased more than fourteenfold to EUR 28.5 million in 2009 from EUR 2.0 
million in the previous year.
The financial result improved from EUR –72.0 million in the previous year to EUR -51.0 
million in 2009. The redemption of bonds with a total nominal value of EUR 84.0 million in 
the second half of 2009 contributed significantly to this effect. A return of EUR 21.3 million was 
achieved on the transaction.
The pretax earnings amounted to EUR -21.7 million in 2009, compared with EUR -70.0 mil-
lion in the previous year. After an income tax income of EUR 12.2 million, the net loss for the 
reporting year was EUR -9.5 million, compared with EUR –83.5 million in the previous year. 
Earnings per share, based on the average number of 73.523 million shares outstanding in 2009, 
therefore amount to EUR -0.13, compared with EUR -1.27 in the previous year (basic and diluted). 
In 2008, the average number of outstanding shares was 65.539 million.
Net Assets
The balance sheet of the Air Berlin Group increased only insignificantly by 0.1 per cent to 
EUR 2,411.5 million in 2009 compared with the previous year. The first-time adoption of IFRIC 
13 from 1 January 2009 influenced the equity, the deferred tax assets and the deferred income 
(see Note 4p on page 135). 
Structural shifts in the assets resulted from the 6.1 per cent decline in non-current assets, 
in part owing to a reduction of 4.7 per cent in property, plant and equipment. This decline related 
mainly to technical equipment and machinery, i.e. equipment on the ground. Non-current assets 
equal 68.1 per cent of total assets, compared with 72.6 per cent for the previous year. At the same 
time, there was an increase of 16.5 per cent in current assets, whose share in total assets rose 
from 27.4 per cent to 31.9 per cent. This increase is largely due to the sharp rise in liquidity 
as a result of the capital measures carried out in 2009. The cash position rose by EUR 104.9 mil-
lion or 39.1 per cent to EUR 373.2 million.

The liabilities in the balance sheet changed significantly in 2009. The equity was strength-
ened considerably with several successful capital measures. In addition, changes in the valua-
tion of hedging instruments at the balance sheet date had a positive impact on equity. In 2009, 
equity increased by 64.0 per cent to EUR 610.0 million from EUR 372.0 million in the previous 
year. The equity ratio rose from 15.4 per cent at the end of 2008 to 25.3 per cent as at the  
balance sheet date for 2009. Together with the reduction in debt – particularly in the short term 
– there was a significant overall improvement in the financing structure.
In three capital increases on 4 June, 10 June, and on 19 October 2009 Air Berlin issued a total of 
19,509,093 new shares at a share price of 3.50 EUR for 11,071,700 shares and a share price of 
EUR 3.97 for 8,437,393 shares. The gross proceeds from the issue of new shares totalled 
EUR 72.2 million (net: EUR 67.8 million). 85,226,196 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 
EUR 0.25 and 50,000 A shares with a nominal value of GBP 1.00 were issued and fully paid up 
as at the 2009 balance sheet date. This includes 177,600 treasury shares held in connection with 
an employee share plan. The issue of a new convertible bond at the same time as the partial buy-
back of the outstanding convertible bond further strengthened the equity: the equity component 
of the bond as at 31 December 2009 exceeded that on 31 December 2008 by EUR 24.3 million.
non-current liabilities fell by 3.5 per cent to EUR 978.4 million from EUR 1,013.9 million. 
In particular, the non-current interest-bearing liabilities and non-current liabilities due to bank 
from assignment to future lease payments were reduced by 9.7 per cent and 4.5 per cent respec-
tively. Conversely, the non-current part in the negative market value of derivatives increased as at 
the balance sheet date.

As of the 2009 balance sheet date, current liabilities were reduced to EUR 823.1 million 
from EUR 1,023.1 million in the previous year. This corresponds to a decline of 19.5 per cent. 
Having already been cut back significantly by EUR 78.4 million or 64.1 per cent to EUR 44.0 million 
in the previous year, current interest-bearing liabilities were reduced by a further EUR 30.4 mil-
lion or 69.0 per cent to EUR 13.6 million in 2009. Trade and other payables increased by 5.9 per 
cent to EUR 334.9 million, and current liabilities from derivatives decreased from EUR 236.7 
million in the previous year to EUR 12.8 million as at 31 December 2009.
net debt was reduced considerably by EUR 187.9 million or 24.7 per cent in the year under 
review. On 31 December 2009, this totalled EUR 574.1 million, compared to EUR 762.0 million 
in the previous year. gearing (net debt as a percentage of equity) was 94.1 per cent as at year-
end 2009, following 204.8 per cent in the previous year. 
f inancial Position
cash generated from operations in 2009 amounted to EUR 184.2 million following 
EUR 44.3 million in the previous year, with depreciation of EUR 109.1 million (previous year: 
EUR 103.1 million) and EBIT of EUR 28.5 million (previous year: EUR 2.0 million). A decline  
in trade and other receivables by EUR 21.5 million and an increase in trade and other payables  
by EUR 26.7 million affected operating cash flow. In addition, other liabilities increased by 
EUR 36.5 million. After income taxes paid and net interest paid totalling EUR 53.8 million  
(previous year: EUR 32.5 million), the net cash flow from operating activities was EUR 130.4  
million compared to EUR 11.8 million in the previous year.

cash outflow from investing activities totalled EUR -68.7 million in the year under 
review compared to EUR -156.8 million in the previous year. While net payments for non-current 
assets including advanced payments were reduced by 25.0 per cent to EUR 173.5 million due to 
difficult overall economic development, cash inflows from sales of intangible and tangible assets 
increased by 45.2 per cent to EUR 106.0 million.
cash flow from financing activities in the year under review was primarily characterised 
by the repayment of interest-bearing liabilities totalling EUR 92.2 million (previous year: EUR 
60.7 million), the issue of new ordinary shares, generating net inflows of EUR 67.8 million, and 
the net cash inflow of EUR 65.3 million from the issue of new, and the buyback of outstanding, 
convertible bonds. Overall, cash inflow of EUR 40.9 million was generated from financing activi-
ties in 2009, following a cash outflow of EUR 60.7 million in 2008. As such, there was a net 
inflow of cash and cash equivalents of EUR 102.6 million in the 2009 financial year, compared 
to a cash outflow of EUR 205.7 million in 2008.

SUSTAINABILITy
Sustainability has traditionally had a fixed place in Air Berlin’s corporate culture: economic suc-
cess is based on acting in a socially and environmentally-friendly manner. Air Berlin would like 
to communicate this mission statement to its various interest groups from shareholders, inves-
tors and financial analysts right up to customers and employees. A good environmental balance, 
a firmly established commitment to society and a strategic management system designed for  
sustainability are the best foundations for flying right at the very front in the future.
As an energy-intensive industry, the aviation industry has a particular responsibility when it 
comes to climate change. Air Berlin therefore gives maximum priority to environmental protec-
tion. In its role as first mover, the Company has implemented numerous technical innovations 
in order to improve the environmental balance. For example, the Company installed winglets as 
early as 2001 – the first European airline to do so. The wing tips improve the aerodynamics, and 
lower jet fuel consumption by around 3%. Winglets have now become a standard in the aviation 
industry.
In 2009 alone, the Company’s efforts in this regard led to a saving of 32,000 tonnes of co2 
on a comparable route. This is equal to the CO2 emissions of 225 flights from Düsseldorf to New 
York on an Airbus A330.
Air Berlin was recognised for its ecological, economic and social balance in 2009. The renowned 
sustainability agency, oekom research AG, describes Air Berlin as an attractive investment, when 
taking sustainable issues into consideration. oekom research also awarded Air Berlin the “Prime” 
investment status. In the annual oekom Corporate Responsibility Ratings, a “Prime” rating is 
only given to companies which are leaders in their industry and which meet minimum require-
ments in the areas of ecology and social responsibility. The main areas which oekom evaluated 
positively were Air Berlin’s progressive fleet policy, the focus on efficiency in operations and  
customer management.

The Air Berlin fleet: efficient and modern
Air Berlin consistently uses state-of-the-art technology. Since its foundation more than 30 years 
ago, the Company has been investing in the latest technology. Environmental awareness 
and economic benefits go hand in hand: jet fuel accounts for 22 per cent of the operating costs 
per seat kilometre.
With an average age of 5.5 years, the Air Berlin fleet is one of the youngest and most environmen-
tally friendly in Europe. The aircraft operate particularly quietly and have an excellent fuel bal-
ance, clearly better than the industry average. In 2009, the average specific fuel 
consumption (measured in litres per 100 passenger kilometres) slightly improved. In 2008, the 
figure came to 3.70 litres; in the reporting year, this was reduced by 1.6 per cent to 3.64 litres.  
For many major European airlines average consumption exceeds four litres. And all new aircraft 
delivered to the Company meet the highest noise protection standards. 
Highlights of the latest fleet modernisation include the replacement of the ageing Fokker 100s 
with the particularly low-consumption bombardier turboprop q400s, and the 
replacement of the older Boeing 737 Classic with the modern Boeing 737 Next Generation. These 
replacements were completed by the end of 2008. The Q400s operate with ultra-modern, very 
quiet six-blade propeller turbines. With a jet fuel saving of 30 per cent to 40 per cent, they are 
more cost-effective per passenger than the average car, based on the same journey length.
Innovations for more eco-efficiency
A modern fleet and the latest engines form the basis for eco-efficient flying. However, modern 
aircraft can only achieve all potential savings if flight operations are arranged in an ecologi-
cally-friendly manner. For this reason, Air Berlin is developing new measures to reduce con-
sumption on an ongoing basis. Special efficiency training programmes improve the pilots’ 
environmental awareness: flying economically and ecologically is one of the core points in  
training and testing.

Potential for savings can be found everywhere from flight planning and flying, right down to 
ground operations. Prior to every flight, modern software optimises the route and flying alti-
tude depending on the weather, load, airspace situation and other factors. Prior to every flight Air  
Berlin uses a sophisticated fuel management system which determines the optimum fuel level 
including reserve fuel. In 2009, 492 tonnes of jet fuel and 1,554 tonnes of CO2 were saved by 
these measures alone. Air Berlin has also further optimised its alternative airport planning, 
thereby saving another 1,311 tonnes of jet fuel and 4,130 tonnes of CO2.
The “Traffic Flow Restriction Module” (TFR) is a further innovation in saving jet fuel. It comple-
ments the flight planning system and enables Air Berlin to optimise flight paths to the most 
economical route, taking into consideration current airway restrictions. This reduces fuel 
consumption by up to 2 per cent. The result for 2009: 2,295 fewer tonnes of jet fuel and 7,252 
fewer tonnes of CO2. In addition, the cockpit selects the appropriate altitude and speed profile  
during the flight. This measure alone led to a 5,698-ton reduction in CO2 emissions in the 
reporting year. 
On the ground, the aircraft need electricity in order to feed the on-board systems and to start the 
engines. To this end, the aircraft are fitted with a jet fuel-operated auxiliary power unit (APU). Air 
Berlin has reduced use of the apu to a minimum, and uses stationary ground power units or 
mobile generators where possible. This led to a 7,770-ton reduction in CO2 emissions in 2009.
With the two latest technical innovations, the “SafeRoute™” software system and the satellite-
supported flight navigation system GLS, Air Berlin is again at the cutting edge in europe.  
SafeRoute™ makes it possible to land without delay, even in airports with high traffic density. 
The system calculates the optimum distance between incoming aircraft for the approach. This 
means that holding patterns are avoided, and passengers save valuable time. The Boeings 
are to be fitted with the new software first, followed by the Airbus fleet at a later date. 
The satellite-based navigation technique GLS (“Global Positioning Landing System”) allows for 
more efficient landing approaches with less noise. Unlike the current instrument-based landing 
system ILS, which is only able to handle linear approaches, GLS allows a variety of approaches – 
for example in surrounding areas with dense population. As it operates independently for exam-
ple of weather influences, delays and holding patterns are avoided and thus fuel can be saved.

55 kilograms of paper in the form of landing maps and detailed handbooks are an avoidable bal-
last. The less-paper cockpit (LPC), in the development of which Air Berlin played a crucial role, 
can remedy this problem. Air Berlin was the first airline in the world to start using digital flight 
maps in 2005 and has the goal to stop using paper completely in flight operations by 2011. What 
does this mean for environmental protection? 1,970 fewer tonnes of CO
2
 and 625 fewer tonnes of  
jet fuel. 
Employees
Compared with 8,311 the previous year, Air Berlin employed a total of 8,278 employees as at 31 
December 2009. Women made up the 53.3% majority, with 4,413 to 3,865 men. On average, the 
employees of the Air Berlin Group have worked for the Company for 4.9 years and are 36.1 years 
old. Air Berlin employs a total of 596 persons in other countries, 247 of them in Spain and 299 
in Switzerland.
At the end of the reporting year, 1,866 employees worked part-time for the Air Berlin Group. Of 
these, 1,053 Air Berlin employees from the Cockpit/Cabin flight department are taking advantage 
of an employment model known as “Take a Month Off”, with adjusted salaries. Depending on 
the situation at the various Air Berlin locations, a certain number of captains and/or co-pilots and 
cabin crews were granted a maximum of 6 free months in the calendar year 2009. The propor-
tion of part-time employees is 22.5 per cent.

Numerous training opportunities at Air Berlin
Air Berlin places value on good development prospects for every single employee and takes this 
into account with a diverse selection of training and further education opportunities. 
This involves giving young people the ability to make a promising start to their professional life 
and offering them ideal conditions for their personal future. A range of several classical and tech-
nically-orientated occupations which require training is made available to these young people at 
Air Berlin. There are training programmes for air travel and air traffic clerks, office 
and industrial clerks and office communication clerks. For young people interested 
in technology, there is also the opportunity to receive training as an aircraft mechanic or 
electronic technician for aviation systems.
In total, 38 young individuals began apprenticeships at Air Berlin in 2009 in commercial or tech-
nical areas. Two thirds of the apprentices in the commercial area were trained as travel and air 
traffic clerks but a vocational training in office communication is also offered. Possibilities for 
technical professions such as aircraft mechanics and electronic technicians for aviation systems 
complete the training offered. Distributed across all training year groups, 114 apprentices were 
working for the Air Berlin Group at the end of the reporting year. 26 of these successfully com-
pleted their training in 2009 and progressed to regular employment. Air Berlin also provides a 
wide selection of internship placements, and a total of 89 interns were employed in various 
departments as at 31 December 2009.
469 flight attendants were hired and trained in 2009. There were 192 the previous 
year. Safety and emergency training, on-board service, first aid, communication and announce-
ment training, training flights and various practical exercises are offered as part of the specialist 
training courses. The training programme lasts six weeks.

The air berlin flight school has trained commercial pilots since 2007 in cooperation  
with TFC GmbH Käufer (Technic Flight Consulting). Those who have chosen a Flight School 
education with Air Berlin receive two years of training in theory and practice that meets the  
highest international standards. In February 2009, the Air Berlin Flight School was the first  
aviation school in Germany to be approved by the Federal Office of Civil Aviation to train  
students for the multi-crew pilot licence (mpl). 
The Air Berlin Flight School was one of the first to offer this new training standard. The forward-
looking MPL flight licence is perfectly tailored to the demands of modern airlines and 
makes training with Air Berlin even more attractive. The first four trainee pilots with the new 
pilot’s licence started as co-pilots with the Air Berlin Group in 2009. At the end of 2009, a total 
of 76 students were undergoing pilot training. Air Berlin is offering pilot training again for 2010. 
Employee communication and participation
Air Berlin pursues an “open-door policy” across its hierarchy. The deliberately flat organisa-
tional hierarchy ensures short procedures, intensifies the culture of cooperation and promotes 
communication. Employees are informed promptly, regularly and in detail of all Company mat-
ters that affect them.
Particular attention is given to economic developments and the financial situation at Air Berlin. 
This is done by methods of communication such as the Company’s own Intranet (Corporate 
Web), or the regular “letters to the employees” from the Board of Directors. New employees 
receive a starter kit with a comprehensive information pack about Air Berlin and their new  
position.

SOCIAL COMMITMENT
As a responsible business, Air Berlin sees it as its obligation to promote the development of 
society in a positive sense. The welfare, safety and health of its employees, customers and all who 
come into direct and indirect contact with the Company are all considered worthy of protection 
by Air Berlin.
Respecting the personal dignity, privacy and personal rights of employees is an integral part of 
the corporate culture. Air Berlin is an equal opportunity employer and makes every effort to 
prevent and prohibit any discrimination based on ethnic origin, gender, religion or ideology, dis-
ability, age, or sexual orientation. 
In line with the general principle of equal treatment in the European Union, all general 
regulations and HR processes are reviewed on an ongoing basis for possible discrimination and 
senior management are informed of the relevant legal requirements.
Mutual respect and diversity in practice are a matter of course at Air Berlin. As an internationally 
operating company, Air Berlin not only provides mobility across borders but also unites people 
and cultures across the whole world. This diversity is also practised internally: in 2009,  
Air Berlin employed people of 68 different nationalities
 
Work-life balance and the compatibility of work and family
Air Berlin places great value on a family-friendly personnel policy, as only motivated employees 
will make a long-term contribution to the financial success of the Company. Supporting employ-
ees in maintaining a balance between their professional and personal lives is therefore an  
important part of the hr strategy.

Air Berlin supports its employees in obtaining personal coverage in old age with various pension 
plan models. Provisions are made for the demands of demographic development and the 
changes to legal conditions. 
With hearts and minds – commitment to society at Air Berlin 
There is a tradition of promoting social projects at Air Berlin. The Company has been involved 
with the christiane herzog foundation for 14 years. The Foundation works with young 
people with cystic fibrosis, the most common hereditary metabolic disorder. Each year, Air Berlin 
flies children with cystic fibrosis to the island of Gran Canaria for climate therapy, initiates fund-
raising campaigns and helps to finance Foundation events. Air Berlin employees support the 
Foundation with ex-stock sales and similar activities.
Air Berlin launched the air berlin endowment fund for als therapy research at the 
charité hospital in 2008. ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a degenerative disease of the 
motor nervous system. The Charité ALS clinic receives EUR 100,000 from the fund every year. 
Intensive therapy research helps to establish the causes in the long term and furthers the devel-
opment of efficacious medication. 
Air Berlin is involved in a heart for children and gives its passengers the chance to help. 
Since the beginning of 2009, Air Berlin passengers booking their flights on the airberlin.com 
website can support the A Heart for Children aid organisation. During the booking process, cus-
tomers are given the option to donate one euro. Customers who decide to make this voluntary 
contribution have the amount added to their fare. Not a single cent goes towards administration 
costs. The money from these donations helps to support nurseries, schools, playgrounds, chil-
dren’s clinics and soup kitchens. This has so far raised EUR 125,000. 
Air Berlin also supports numerous cultural projects. This is not just about spectacular occasions, 
but also regional, high-quality events which could not take place without financial support.

RISK MANAGEMENT SySTEM
As an international aviation company, Air Berlin operates in an environment characterised by 
diverse opportunities and risks. The early identification and control of these risks and the utilisa-
tion of opportunities which present themselves represent a central component of corporate gov-
ernance. At Air Berlin, they are supported by a comprehensive risk management system. As 
an integral part of the operating and reporting system, opportunities and risks are systematically 
recorded and assessed. 
Regular reviews in collaboration with the responsible individuals ensure early identification of 
areas of potential and risks and enable effective management. Opportunities and risks are 
also discussed at the monthly meetings of Executive Management. If Executive Management 
regard specific measures as necessary, these can be initiated promptly.
The existing risk management system is an integral part of the overall operating and reporting 
process. The registered risks are regularly updated using a software-supported process. Risk 
reporting covers the review and assessment of all risks in each individual area. Where appropri-
ate, the registration of new risks includes the reassessment of their probability of occur-
rence and potential extent of damage for existing risks and the identification of risks 
which no longer exist. A quantitative – i.e. monetary – assessment of risks is performed. A quali-
tative assessment should only be carried out in exceptional cases.
Also of major importance for operating activities are the regulations of the national and interna-
tional authorities and institutions, particularly with reference to safety. A company-wide com-
pliance programme ensures the registering of changes and the compliance with and adaptation 
of all processes to the current regulations.

INDUSTRy RISKS
The aviation industry is characterised by a high level of competitive intensity. In this 
respect, Air Berlin is not only in competition with other airlines, but – particularly on short-haul 
routes – with other ground transportation options as well. Air Berlin meets this competition with 
its successful hybrid business model, which offers high-quality services to its individual and 
charter passengers and private and business customers. This positioning permits a high 
level of flexibility in order to compensate for the seasonal fluctuations in demand which are 
typical for the industry. An attractive range of additional services and the Top Bonus customer 
loyalty programme complete the services on offer.
The introduction of emissions trading will also impact the market situation in the aviation indus-
try. Air Berlin is making extensive preparations for this new development within a framework of 
appropriate projects.
fINANCIAL RISKS
As an internationally operating aviation company, Air Berlin is exposed to fluctuations in jet 
fuel prices, interest rates and exchange rates – especially the market trend of the US dollar. 
Possible rises in the price of jet fuel in particular lead to increased cost positions, which are com-
prehensively and permanently hedged. Possible risks are reduced in advance on the basis of 
rolling hedging for the relevant defined periods of time. The financial futures contracts 
which are standard on international markets are contracted with renowned financial institutions.
A Group-wide treasury management system is used within the existing risk management system 
for systematic management of interest rate and currency risks. As well as the representation of 
all underlying transactions and the hedging transactions concluded on a suitably revolving basis, 
there is a comprehensive calculation of the market-driven measurement and effectiveness 
of the hedging arrangements entered into, including the reporting system in accordance with 
IAS 39.
The balanced customer 
structure limits the  
market risks
Exclusively standard 
hedging transactions p90 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Internal guidelines which define the scope of operative action are used for the management of 
financial risks. The core element here is sound liquidity management, which is ensured by com-
prehensive financial and liquidity planning.
OPERATING RISKS
As part of the risk management system, Air Berlin, like every other airline, covers existing operat-
ing and technical risks of flight operations. These are systematically identified, assessed 
and managed using appropriate measures.
PURCHASING RISKS
The factors significant to maintaining competitiveness and safeguarding the reliability of 
flight operations are a reliable supply of fuel, materials, auxiliary and operating media and access 
to attractive destination airports, in addition to a modern, high-performance and fuel-efficient 
fleet of aircraft.
A modern fleet radically reduces costs for maintenance and repairs. Air Berlin therefore main-
tains long-term relationships with major aircraft manufacturers Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier 
in order to ensure access to the most modern aircraft. In addition to existing purchase agree-
ments with the manufacturers, Air Berlin also has options to acquire additional aircraft at prices 
which have already been fixed. Air Berlin uses a fleet of leased aircraft with short and medium-
term lease periods in addition to its own aircraft. The reduced amount of committed capital 
stands in contrast to the decreased security of long-term planning.

Air Berlin also maintains long-term relationships with suppliers of other necessary raw materi-
als, supplies and spares in order to ensure security of supply at any given time. The 
most important raw material for Air Berlin is undoubtedly jet fuel. However, securing on-board 
catering, for example, also plays a major role in offering customers high-quality service. This is 
one area in particular in which Air Berlin works with fixed purchase agreements.
IT RISKS
The central business processes at Air Berlin are inconceivable without appropriate IT support. 
Identifying and controlling risks resulting from this area forms a particular focus of the risk 
management system at Air Berlin. Both external and internal risks are taken into consideration. 
The basis for dealing with IT risks is laid out in Company-wide internal security guidelines. p92 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009

DEvELOPMENT Of THE O vERALL ECONOMy AND THE A vIATION INDUSTR y
The recovery of the global economy remains fragile
The trend towards recovery in the global economy remains fragile in early 2010 and potentially 
instable. The economies of the industrialised nations are still largely dependent on the drip feed 
from the state stimulus programmes of last year. In the areas in which such programmes took 
place, such as in the case of the state scrappage bonus in the automotive industry, production is 
falling. Hope is provided in the form of a resurgent inventory cycle and the recovery  
of global trade and therefore export activity. The difficulties of the recession could largely be 
explained by the massive clearance of inventories, which led to similar clear drops in production. 
Important developing countries, particularly China, suffered less in 2008/09 and their econo-
mies will also recover more quickly. 
The dwindling momentum of the recovery of the previous quarters is manifesting itself 
in Germany in a clear drop in industrial orders received in December and in the palpable slow-
down in industrial production during the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall, Germany’s GDP stag-
nated in the final quarter of 2009. Furthermore, the worsening debt problem in a number of 
countries and the continuingly weak condition of the US property and employment markets are 
having a negative impact in numerous countries.
The German government is assuming an increase in the german gdp of approximately  
1.5 per cent for 2010. However, the data is inconsistent. The experts surveyed in January  
by the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in Mannheim had a sceptical view of the 
German economy for the fourth month in succession and the ZEW index of economic expecta-
tions sank to its lowest level since July 2009. In contrast, the Ifo index for the economic climate 
is signalling brightening expectations for the future of companies, which have been 
ongoing for months. Against this backdrop, the forecasts for German economic growth in 2010 
are overall very cautious and are fluctuating on a low level between 1% and 2%. A self-supporting 
and stable upturn is not expected.

ECONOMIC DEvELOPMENT AND  
ThE OUTLOOk FOR ThE GROUP p93 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The collective analyses of the German Ifo Institute, the French INSEE and the Italian ISAE also 
produced a rather gloomy outlook for the eurozone. In real terms, they expect Eurozone GDP 
to rise by only 0.2 per cent in each of the first two quarters of 2010. The fading impetus of the 
state support programmes, the restrictive credit conditions and the strained situation on 
the european labour market are all viewed as having an especially negative impact. Accord-
ingly, industrial production in the Eurozone is likely to expand only slowly.
The European and global economic prospects look similar to the experts from the OECD.  
In their outlook from November 2009 for the 13 OECD countries in the Eurozone, they expect 
growth of only 0.9 per cent in 2010. The OECD forecasts are similarly cautious for other Euro-
pean countries such as the UK. For the USA, the experts are anticipating an increase in real GDP 
of 2.5 per cent, half as a result of a positive stock cycle. The January 2010 forecasts from the 
International Monetary Fund are only marginally more positive.
further challenges facing international air travel
According to IATA, there are still “enormous” risks for international air travel. Continuing 
into 2010, airlines must pay close attention to controlling their costs and bringing their capacities 
in line with demand. After -4.1% in 2009, the current year is expected to witness a rise of 4.5% in 
passenger volumes. Despite this slightly more optimistic projection, IATA is expecting considera-
bly higher losses than previously for 2010, according to a new analysis of the development of 
earnings of its member companies. continuingly high excess capacity – with another 
1,300 new aircraft, a 2.8% expansion of worldwide capacity is expected, and decreasing travel 
budgets for companies will hinder improving yields.
 
In addition, in 2010 at USD 75 the average price of oil (Brent) will be at least 21 per cent 
higher than in 2009 according to IATA. Correspondingly, after losses of USD 3.8 billion to 
date, the organisation expects these to reach a total of USD 5.6 billion. However, this is a source 
of perceptible improvement, as IATA is still assuming losses of USD 11 billion for 2009. Overall, 
the years 2000 to 2009 represent a decade of high losses for the industry totalling USD 49.1 
billion. Against this backdrop, 2010 will turn out no better in IATA’s view.

REPORT ON EXPECTED DEvELOPMENTS
Business focus of the Air Berlin Group for the next two financial years
We are not planning any major changes in the operating policy or the market positioning of  
the Air Berlin Group for financial years 2010 and 2011. In particular, the Air Berlin Group will 
remain focussed on its current growth strategy through both organic and acquisition-based 
investment as long as it contributes to the target return. Against this background, therefore,  
the issues outlined in the “Company Profile”, “Corporate Strategy” and “Company Management” 
sections on pages 48 to 54 will largely apply to this period too. 
The key markets for the Air Berlin Group are expected to remain Germany as well as the catch-
ment areas of its major foreign hubs, particularly Palma de Mallorca and Vienna. Business in 
Eastern Europe and the Middle East will be strategically expanded. Closer collaboration with our 
austrian partner niki during the current financial year has laid important foundations for 
implementing this strategy. 
If the ongoing world economic crisis should persist or even deepen, the Board of Directors will 
take all measures necessary to safeguard the market position of the company and its liquid-
ity. The now significantly improved level of funding has helped increase the room for manoeuvre 
needed by the Air Berlin Group in a possible long downturn.
Opportunities and risks in the forecast
In view of what has so far been a very modest trend towards recovery following the collapse of the 
global economy, the risks associated with forecasting in an uncertain economic 
climate remain very high. In particular, consumer behaviour is expected to remain cautious: 
the number of people out of work, particularly in the industrialised nations, rose significantly in 
2009 and this trend will in all likelihood continue in 2010.
No changes in our 
growth stragegy
Economic risks  
continue to  
predominate p95 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The aviation industry, however, is particularly dependent on people’s demand for luxuries 
since flying is not a basic need. In the case of business travel too, forecasts regarding future 
trends should generally be on the cautious side as companies are unlikely to quickly abandon 
their cost-consciousness, which was enhanced during the recession. Despite the slight increase 
in volume hoped for by IATA, therefore, the price competition in the air travel industry is 
expected to remain very lively in 2010. The flagship airlines in particular are facing the challenge 
of winning back, at least in part, the market share lost to budget airlines.
Other forecasting risks for fiscal 2010 include the continued increase in the prices of raw materi-
als, which cannot be forecast, and their susceptibility to speculative market forces, which has 
increased significantly in recent years. Since interest rates are not expected to increase signifi-
cantly in the medium term, refinancing costs remain low, which offers strong incentives for 
speculating on international commodity markets. As a result, Air Berlin continues to 
hedge a high level of its jet fuel requirements; at the end of 2009, the hedging ratio for require-
ments in 2010 already stood at 40.3 per cent. But hedging costs can increase dramatically, partic-
ularly in response to major price fluctuations. 
Likewise, international foreign exchange markets are subject to strong speculative forces 
for the same reasons as commodity markets. The debt faced by certain countries in the euro  
area has severely affected the euro exchange rate since the start of 2010. The ongoing sharp 
depreciation of the euro against the US dollar would, on balance, result in higher procurement 
costs for fuel in particular, since this is generally paid for in US dollars. Although Air Berlin is 
also hedging the currency risk to a high degree, full hedging – whether for fuel or for foreign- 
currency transactions – is not economically viable.

2010 financial year
Air Berlin is expecting to grow more strongly in 2010 than the market as a whole, for 
which IATA expects passenger growth of 4.5 per cent. As such, the number of passengers using 
Air Berlin in 2010 is, for the first time ever, expected to rise well above the 30 million mark. This 
forecast is backed up not only by the add-on effect of the TUIfly connections, which can be seen 
for the first time throughout the year, but also by Air Berlin’s unique competitive advantages 
that have contributed to above-average growth in the past. Key factors here include the well-bal-
anced product portfolio that caters for business and private travellers alike, the outstanding price/
performance ratio particularly on short- and medium-haul routes, as well as the optimisation  
of Air Berlin’s highly used and flexible route network, which will continue throughout 2010. 
We expect sales to markedly increase, mainly due to the full year contribution of the  
TUIfly business. Naturally, we will continue our cost reduction efforts and, against this back-
ground, we expect to continue on our path of profitable growth.

The Audit Committee met six times during 2009. The primary function of the Committee is to 
assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to internal and external 
audits and controls. The Committee’s tasks include reviewing the Company’s annual financial 
statements and other financial information before their publication, determining the scope of the 
annual audit, and advising on the appointment of external auditors. Additionally, the Committee 
is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control systems, 
including the work of internal audit. The Committee periodically reviews the scope of the non-
audit work undertaken by the auditors and the fees related to such work to ensure that the audi-
tors’ impartiality is not or may not become impaired. The Committee also makes 
recommendations to the Board regarding the reappointment or the removal of external auditors, 
their terms of engagement and the level of their remuneration. 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
As at 31 December 2009, the Nominations Committee comprised Johannes Zurnieden  
(as Chairman of the Committee), Joachim Hunold, Dr Hans-Joachim Körber, Hartmut Mehdorn, 
Heinz-Peter Schlüter, Ali Sabanci and Nicholas Teller, the majority of whom are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is primarily responsible for assisting the Board in 
determining its composition, makeup and balance. It also is responsible for periodically review-
ing the Board’s structure and identifying potential candidates to be appointed as Directors, as the 
need may arise. Further, the Committee determines the succession plans for the Chairman of the 
Board and the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee meets as required, but no less than once

of the Company as determined by the Board; the monitoring of operational and financial results 
against plan; the monitoring of the quality of the investment process against specified objectives; 
the prioritisation of the allocation of capital, technical and human resources and the development 
and implementation of a risk management system. 
All Directors may benefit from the advice and assistance of the Company Secretary, who is 
responsible to the Chairman for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and that 
applicable rules and regulations are followed. The Company Secretary is responsible for advising 
and supporting the Chairman and the Board on corporate governance matters and new develop-
ments in legislation and new regulations. The Company Secretary ensures that new Board mem-
bers receive an appropriate introduction into all relevant business aspects of the Company.  
The Company Secretary is Michelle Johnson, who was appointed to that position on 21 February 
2007. Furthermore, the Directors have access to appropriate independent professional advice if 
necessary to perform their duties, at the expense of the Company. The Company maintains  
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance at an appropriate level.
SHAREHOLDER RELATIONS
The AGM provides all shareholders with the opportunity to communicate directly with the Board, 
including the chairmen of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees. At the AGM 
the number of proxy votes cast on each resolution is made available, both at the meeting and, 
subsequently, on the Company’s website. Each substantially separate issue is presented as a sepa-
rate resolution.
Dr Hans-Joachim Körber has been appointed the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
and is available to shareholders if contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief  
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer is inappropriate or has been unsuccessful.
The Company also maintains regular contact with its major institutional shareholders through  
its investor relations department and through meetings with the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman, as well as through its special institutional investor 
events. Moreover, the Company ensures that all Directors have an understanding of the views 
and concerns of major shareholders. A separate investor relations department facilitates engage-
ment. p102 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND BOARD PERfORMANCE
The Directors are responsible for establishing and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal control systems. Internal control procedures are only designed to provide reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance regarding the safeguarding of assets against misuse or unauthorised dis-
position and the risk of material misstatement or loss, or failure to achieve business objectives. 
Whereas the overall responsibility for establishing such control procedures and the day to day 
management is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, certain powers have been delegated to 
the responsible department heads. The authority granted is subject to defined limitations and 
reporting requirements.
The Company has developed an ongoing process for the effective identification and management 
of risks, whereby potential risks are identified, monitored and reported by key areas of the  
Company. Detailed reports are provided to management, which considers individual depart-
ments’ and the Company’s performance regularly, and on an ad hoc basis. Significant risks  
are addressed by the Board as a whole.
Policies and procedures are subject to ongoing review and updated as required to ensure that 
they are properly and consistently applied with respect to significant risks, investment decisions 
and management issues. 
The Company continues to review the effectiveness of its internal controls, including operational 
and compliance controls as well as risk management. To further ensure the effectiveness of such 
internal controls the Company established an internal audit department in January 2009.
The Chairman regularly meets with the members of the Board to discuss their performance,  
the performance of the Board as a whole and of the board committees of which the directors are 
members and any other matters that the Directors may wish to discuss.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMBINED CODE
As the Company is not listed in the United Kingdom, it is not required to comply with the obliga-
tion under the UK Listing Rules to disclose in its annual audited financial statements the extent 
of its compliance with corporate governance standards set forth in the Combined Code, nor is it 
required to comply with German corporate governance standards. The Company complies volun-
tarily with the provisions of the Combined Code. However, the Company has not complied with 
certain provisions of the Combined Code that are not required by German corporate governance 
standards and are not customary in the German market. Specifically, the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts have fixed terms of more than one year and cannot be terminated during such 
period unless for cause. As a consequence of the fixed term nature of the contracts, there is no 
obligation on the Directors to mitigate loss in case of termination. The Directors are subject to  
re-election at periods which are customary in the German market. The Company continues to 
believe that more stringent requirements would place the Company at a disadvantage in the 
recruitment and retention of senior executives. 
GOING CONCERN
After making inquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has ade-
quate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in 
note 1 to the financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the accounts. p104 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
INfORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO A UDIT
Membership and Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors and determines on 
behalf of the Board the overall remuneration packages for the Executive Directors, the Company’s 
Chairman and the Company Secretary in accordance with the remuneration policy, including any 
bonuses, pension rights (where appropriate) and share-based compensation payments as 
described below.
The Committee remains responsible for:
  determining and reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the Company’s 
remuneration policy; 
  setting and monitoring performance criteria for any bonus arrangements provided by the 
Company; 
  approving the length and term of the service contracts for the Chairman, the Executive Direc-
tors, the Company Secretary and the senior executives; and 
  ensuring that the Board maintains contact with its principal shareholders with respect to its 
remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee has the ability to obtain independent advice with respect to the 
establishment of appropriate executive compensation. The Committee determined that such 
external advice was not necessary when establishing the level of compensation for the year 2009.
Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
The Company’s remuneration policy provides compensation packages at market rates which 
reward and encourage successful performance. Accordingly, the Company’s policy is to provide a 
compensation package which reflects each Executive Director’s level of responsibility and contri-
bution to the Company, and the competitive environment. The compensation package for the 
Executive Directors in 2009 comprises a combination of a basic salary, a variable bonus scheme, 
benefits in kind and participation in the Employee Share Plan under the framework established 
in 2006.

The base salaries of the Executive Directors for 2009 are: 
Director Fixed remuneration per annum (EUR ) 
Joachim hunold 1,000,000  
Ulf hüttmeyer 450,000  
Jean Christoph Debus (since 1 June 2009) 204,167 
Elke Schütt (until 31 May 2009) 114,583  
karl Lotz (until 31 May 2009) 114,583  
w olfgang kurth (until 31 May 2009) 114,583 
The Executive Directors may receive a discretionary annual bonus as determined by the Remu-
neration Committee. The Remuneration Committee determines, on an annual basis, the  
payment of any bonus compensation and, in deciding to award any such bonus, takes into  
consideration the consolidated EBITDAR of the Company, the Executive Directors’ performance 
and whether established benchmarks of the business plan have been reached. If these bench-
marks have been reached the parties assume that the annual bonus will amount to 100% of the 
fixed annual remuneration. The Remuneration Committee may, at its own discretion, decide to 
increase the bonus if its amount was affected by the results of the Company due to extraordinary 
circumstances. However, such a decision to increase the bonus is only possible in two consecu-
tive years. 
Service Contracts
Each of the Executive Directors has a fixed term service agreement as set out below. 
Director  Date of Agreement Term of Agreement 
Joachim hunold 2 December 2005 2 December 2010 
Ulf hüttmeyer 1 February 2006 2 December 2010 
Jean Christoph Debus 1 June 2009 2 December 2010 
Prior to expiry, the service agreements of the Executive Directors may be terminated by the Com-
pany for cause only or due to mutual agreement between the parties. Any Executive Director who 
is removed from office prior to 2 December 2010 without the service agreement being terminated 
as outlined above is entitled to remuneration for the remainder of the term of the service contract.  p106 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The service contracts for each Executive Director contain an obligation not to compete with the 
Company’s business for one year following termination or expiry of their respective service agree-
ments. In consideration for this undertaking, each Executive Director is entitled to receive his or 
her fixed remuneration for that year. 
New service agreements have been concluded with the Executive Directors which have no fixed 
term but which can be terminated on twentyfour months notice.
Additional Benefits
The service agreements provide a right of the Executive Directors to participate in the Restricted 
Stock Unit Scheme of the Company. In 2006, Mr. Hunold and Mr. Hüttmeyer received the legal 
title to shares in connection with the Company’s Employee Share Plan. No further awards were 
made in 2007, 2008 or 2009.
In 2007, the Company entered into a defined benefit pension plan for its Executive Directors. 
Upon reaching age 65 or in case of permanent inability to work, Executive Directors are entitled 
to pension benefits amounting to at least 4% (in the case of Mr. Hüttmeyer and Mr. Debus) and 
6.25% (in the case of Mr. Hunold) of their final annual base salary for each year of service. An 
Executive Director’s entitlement cannot exceed 50% of his final annual base salary. The accumu-
lated pension rights as of 31 December 2009 are set forth on page 109.
Each Executive Director is provided with a Company telephone, car and telecommunications 
equipment. In addition, each Executive Director is entitled to reduced or free air transportation 
on flights operated by the Company. Each Executive Director has the benefit of directors’ and 
officers’ insurance and accident insurance, at appropriate levels.
Remuneration Policy for 2010
It is anticipated that the policy described above will continue to be applied in determining each 
Executive Director’s base salary. It is expected that the Remuneration Commitee, using its discre-
tion, will determine the level of any annual bonus award made to the Executive Directors taking 
into consideration Air Berlin’s financial and operational performance assessed on the basis of  
factors such as Air Berlin’s consolidated EBIT, net profit and dynamic indebtedness (a measure of 
net debt against EBITDAR) and the airline’s punctuality.

Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the Non-Executive Director remuneration. 
No Director is involved in determining his own level of compensation. In accordance with the 
Articles of Association, the compensation afforded the Non-Executive Directors cannot, in aggre-
gate, exceed EUR 750,000.
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company’s share development against the SDAX and DJ STOXX 
Airlines Index. The SDAX was selected for comparative purposes because it is a broad equity 
index of which the Company is a constituent. The DJ STOXX Airlines index was chosen inas-
much as it comprises companies operating in a comparable sector as the Company.

Directors’ share awards
The number of shares held by the directors at year end under the Employee Share Plan was as 
follows:
Under the terms of the Employee Share Plan, the directors hold legal title to the shares but will 
only be able to acquire the beneficial interest in the shares if certain performance conditions are 
met. 50% of the shares granted under each of the tranches are subject to a performance condi-
tion based on return on equity achieved by the Company and 50% of the shares granted under 
each of the tranches are subject to performance conditions based on the percentage increase in 
the Company’s share price over a three-year period as follows:

Neither of the performance conditions were met for the Tranche I performance period, which

under those tranches and may be required to transfer the legal ownership of those shares to the 
Air Berlin Employee Share Trust.
None of the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to share options. No options were exercised or 
lapsed during the period. A detailed description of the Employee Share Plan is also provided in

CHANGES IN THE BOARD Of DIRECTORS
Elke Schütt, Karl Friedrich Lotz, and Wolfgang Kurth resigned from the Board on 31 May 2009. 
Claus Wülfers resigned from the Board on 9 June 2009. On 1 June 2009, Jean Christoph  
Debus was appointed as the Company’s Chief Commercial Officer. Prior to his appointment Mr.

line Condor Flugdienst GmbH. Ali Sabanci joined the Board in May 2009. Mr. Sabanci is also a 
member of the board of ESAS Holding, the Company’s largest shareholder, and chairman of 
Pegasus Airlines. In July 2009, Hartmut Mehdorn joined the Board. Mr. Mehdorn was CEO of 
Deutsche Bahn AG for nearly ten years prior to his appointment to the Board. Mr. Dieter Pfundt 
resigned from the Board on 28 February 2010. Thereafter, on 1 March 2010, Peter Oberegger

werk & Co. KG.
SUPPLEMENTARy REPORT
In the period from the end of the 2009 financial year until the editorial deadline for this Annual 
Report on 18 March 2010, no events occurred which could have had a material impact on busi-
ness development.
Wolfgang Kurth, Chief Maintenance Officer, resigned from the company on 9 February 2010 
with immediate effect. 
Air Berlin PLC announced the increase of its stake in NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH on 18 February 
2010. The contracts were notarised on 17 February 2010. Air Berlin PLC and its subsidiary Air 
Berlin PLC & Co. Luftverkehrs KG agreed with the Privatstiftung Lauda (Lauda private founda-
tion) that Air Berlin PLC & Co. Luftverkehrs KG will indirectly acquire 25.9% of the shares of 
NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH and thereby increase its current participation in NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH 
from 24% to 49.9%. The purchase price for the shares is EUR 21 million. In conjunction with 
the increase of its stake, Air Berlin PLC & Co. Luftverkehrs KG will grant the Privatstiftung 
Lauda a loan of EUR 40.5 million. The Privatstiftung has the option to pay back the loan in three 
years in cash or by transferring the remaining 50.1% of shares in NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH. Andreas 
Nikolaus (Niki) Lauda will remain available to NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH’s for at least another three 
years.  p114 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The implementation of these measures is subject to the receipt of the necessary antitrust approv-
als. NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH will be fully consolidated within the Air Berlin Group in the future. 
NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH will remain a legally independent company with its own management. 
The NIKI name should also be retained in the foreseeable future.
The integration of NIKI into the Air Berlin Group increases the number of aircraft by eleven. 
Based on the provisional figures for 2009, the number of passengers flying with the Air Berlin 
Group has increased by 2.6 million – with a seat-load factor of 77%. According to its provisional 
figures for 2009 (based on local GAAP), NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH achieved revenue of EUR 269.2 
million (+17% on the previous year) and EBIT of EUR 23.1 million. That equates an increase  
of 71% against the 2008 financial year.
NIKI is planning a network expansion for the current year. These plans include opening up con-
nections to Sofia, Bucharest, Copenhagen and Nice. Further routes to Olbia/Cagliari, Belgrade 
and Barcelona complement Air Berlin’s selection.
In March 2010 Air Berlin reduced the number of firm orders of Boeing 787 aircraft from 25 to 15 
and the number of Options from 10 to 5. Furthermore the delivery of 9 Boeing 737 aircraft  
was rescheduled to 2015. There aircraft were originally scheduled for delivery in 2010 or 2011, 
respectively.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF 
ThE ANNUAL REPORT AND ThE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECLARATION BY ThE 
LEGAL REPRESENTATIvES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent  
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements 
for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are  
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company 
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to pre-
sume that the group and the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any  
time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent  
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies 
with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. p118 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009

We have audited the financial statements of Air Berlin PLC for the year ended 31 December 2009 
set out on pages 121 to 187. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the EU and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 117, the direc-
tors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/UKP.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent com-
pany’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU;
  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance  
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the  
Companies Act 2006;
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Compa-
nies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO 
ThE MEMBERS OF AIR BERLIN PLC p119 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 and under the 
terms of our engagement
In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 and under the terms of our engagement we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1. INTRODUCTION
The consolidated financial statements of Air Berlin PLc for the year ended 31 December 2009 comprise Air Berlin PLc and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as “Air Berlin” or the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in associates. Air Berlin is a public 
limited company incorporated in England and Wales with its registered office in London. The corporate headquarters of Air Berlin 
are located in Berlin. The company’s ordinary shares are traded on the f rankfurt stock Exchange.
2. BASIC PRINCIPLES AND PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Both the parent company financial statements and the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the  
directors in accordance with International f inancial Reporting s tandards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted If Rs ”). On publishing 
the parent company financial statements here together with the group financial statements, the c ompany is taking advantage of 
the exemption in s ection 408 of the c ompanies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and 
related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements. The company financial statements are presented on pages 
126 to 128.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial 
statements except for the changes by If RIc 13 “c ustomer Loyalty Programmes” which are discussed in note 4p below and If Rs 
3 “Business combinations” and IAs 27 “consolidated and separate financial statements”. The accounting policies have been 
applied consistently by all Group entities. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that 
derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euro. The European c entral Bank year-end  exchange rate was GBP 
0.8881 to the Euro. All financial figures presented have been rounded to the nearest thousand currency units, except for share and 
bond data. The financial statements were authorised and approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 march 2010. 
going concern
The Groups’ business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Report on Economic Development and the Outlook for the Group on pages 92 to 96.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, and liquidity position are described in the Development in financial figures 
on pages 71 to 78. Details for the Group`s borrowings are set out in note 15 and 29 of the financial statements. In addition, 
notes 4u and 28 to the financial statements include the Group`s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its  
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit and 
liquidity risk.
The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its cash holdings. As discussed in the Report on Economic 
Development  and the Outlook for the Group on pages 92 to 96, the current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly 
in respect of  
fluctuating currency rates, fluctuating jet fuel prices and passenger demand. The Group`s forecasts and projections, taking into 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet its  
liabilities in the foreseeable future.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the  
foreseeable future. The going concern basis is used in preparing the accounts.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted If Rs s requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.   06)  Financial Statements
p130 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of  
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. 
Judgements made by management in the application of Adopted If Rs s that have a significant effect on the financial statements 
and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year relate primarily to the estimate of residual values of 
fixed assets, the impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the expected utilisation of de-
ferred tax assets and are discussed in note 4b, 4d and 4j below. 
3. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
a) Subsidiaries
All subsidiaries under the control of Air Berlin are included in the consolidated financial statements. c ontrol exists when  
Air Berlin has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements  
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
The subsidiaries listed in note 35 are included in the consolidated financial statements.
s everal of the c ompany’s subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in a currency other than Euro (s wiss francs). The  
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated to Euro at the exchange rates of the reporting date. The income and  
expenses of foreign operations are translated to Euro at the average exchange rate for the period. f oreign currency differences 
resulting are recognised directly in equity. since 1 January 2003, the Group’s date of transition to IfRs, such differences have  
been recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
All of the German subsidiaries identified in note 35 are required to present financial statements under German statutory law  
except for the following companies, as they are exempt due to Article 264b German commercial code:
 Air Berlin PLc & c o. Luftverkehrs KG 
 Air Berlin PLc & co. Airport service KG
 Air Berlin PLc & co. cabin service KG
 Air Berlin PLc & co. DUs KG
 Air Berlin PLc & co. service center KG
 
b) Special purpose entity
In 2006 the Group established a special purpose entity (sPE) in connection with the repurchase and administration of shares re-
lating to its Employee s hare Plan, which is included in the consolidated financial statements. An s PE is consolidated if, based 
on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the Group and the s PE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it 
controls the sPE. sPEs are considered to be controlled by the Group if they were established under terms that impose strict lim-
itations on the decision-making powers of the s PE’s management and that result in the Group receiving the majority of all the 
risks and benefits related to the sPE’s operations and net assets.
c) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating poli-
cies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on  p131 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
an equity accounted basis and are initially recognised at cost, from the date that significant influence commences until the date 
that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s carrying 
amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate. 
d) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in prepar-
ing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the ex-
tent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the 
extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 
4. SIgNIFICANT ACCOUNTINg POLICIES
a) Intangible assets
Goodwill is recognised where the cost of a business combination exceeds the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Other identifiable intangible assets acquired through a business combination are capi-
talised at fair value and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and impairment losses. Goodwill 
and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually, or more fre-
quently if there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Acquired intangible assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and impairment losses. Amortisation 
of intangible assets is based on the Group’s accounting policies and calculated according to the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives (if applicable). 
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are as follows:
software licenses   3 – 5 years
Trademarks   5 years
customer relationships   4 years
Landing rights (slots)   indefinite
Landing rights are determined to have indefinite lives, as they do not expire and are not subject to a regular loss in value over time. 
b) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are valued at their acquisition or production costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulat-
ed impairment losses. Depreciation is based on the Group’s accounting policies and calculated according to the straight-line 
method over the estimated useful lives. 
-- AIRcRAfT AND ENGINEs
The Group owns aircraft and engines of the type Boeing 737-800, Airbus A319 and A320 as well as Bombardier Q400 and en-
gines. The depreciation period is ten years taking into account estimated residual values. The residual values and useful lives are 
reviewed at the end of each period. Judgement is required in estimating the residual values and useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment. Uncertainty exists in the useful life of aircraft and engines and in the amounts which can be realised through 
future disposals.  06)  Financial Statements
p132 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Portions of the cost of an aircraft is attributed on acquisition to major inspection and overhaul costs of its engines and airframe 
and is depreciated separately over a period of five to seven years, at which time the new overhaul is capitalised and depreciated 
over its useful life.
As aircraft and engines are purchased in stages with the payment of initial and subsequent deposit payments, the borrowing 
costs associated with these payments are capitalised as part of the costs of those qualifying assets. Other borrowing costs are 
expensed as incurred.
-- LAND AND BUILDINGs
Land and buildings relate to two airport buildings leased under finance leases as further discussed in note 16. The buildings are  
depreciated over their remaining useful lives or the term of the lease.
-- OTHER TANGIBLE AssETs
The estimated useful lives of other tangible assets are as follows:
Technical equipment and machinery     8 – 15 years 
Office equipment   3 – 13 years
c) Subsequent expenditure
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of aircraft, engines and other equipment, including major inspection and 
overhaul expenditure, is capitalised as a separate item. Other subsequent expenditures are capitalised only when they increase 
the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment. All other expenditures are recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income as an expense when incurred.
d) Impairment
-- NON-fINANcIAL AssETs 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each  
period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable 
amount is estimated. f or goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, the recoverable amount is estimated at each  
period end. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the assets’ fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assess-
ments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. f or an asset that does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses, 
if any, are allocated first to goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based 
on their carrying amounts. In respect of tangible assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the im-
pairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. p133 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Judgement is required in determining the cash generating unit, as well as in calculating value in use. The operating margins 
used in determining value in use are based on planned business and operational growth. The trading environment is subject to 
both regulatory and competitive pressures that could have a material impact on the operating performance of the business.  
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the peer-group long-term cost of capital for the cash generating unit.
-- fINANcIAL AssETs
financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether objective evidence of impairment exists. An impair-
ment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between the present value of estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate and its carrying amount.
e) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories include supplies and spares, raw materials and 
purchased merchandise. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost formula.
f) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method less impairment loss, which approximates their fair value. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference 
between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective inter-
est rate. Receivables for which collection is doubtful are written down to their realisable value in a separate account. f urther 
details to the allowance for impairment losses are found in note 29a. The allowance for impairment losses is used to record im-
pairment losses until the Group determines that the receivable is irrecoverable. f inancial assets are derecognised directly when 
they are expected to be irrecoverable. 
Estimated future cash flows are based on estimates and judgements regarding the credit worthiness of individual receivables, 
the actual customer structure and an analysis of historical impairment losses. 
g) Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are used for hedging fuel price, interest rate, and currency rate risks arising from operational 
and financing activities. Hedging transactions are entered into to secure future cash flows. Derivative financial instruments are 
recognised initially at fair value. All derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading. Hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, if the Group revokes 
the designation as hedge accounting or if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. subsequent to initial 
recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. Any resultant gain or loss is recognised directly in the state-
ment of comprehensive income as profit or loss unless the derivative has been classified as a hedge of a highly probable future 
cash flow. The effective portion of gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
are taken to equity in accordance with IAs 39 and are recognised in the profit and loss when the related transaction impacts in-
come or the future cash flow ceases to be considered probable. The ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised im-
mediately in income.
f orward exchange transactions are used to mitigate exchange rate exposure. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is 
their quoted market price at the end of the period, being the present value of the quoted forward price. 
commodity swaps and options are used to limit the fuel price risk.
The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert variable rate liabilities in foreign currencies to fixed rate positions 
in the functional currency. 
  06)  Financial Statements
p134 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
h) Cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months. 
cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost. Bank overdrafts used for cash management purposes are included in cash and 
cash equivalents for purposes of the cash flow statement. c ash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash as set out in 
note 27. 
i) Share capital
s hare capital of the c ompany consists of ordinary shares and redeemable c lass A shares. In addition the c ompany holds  
treasury shares. 
-- ORDINARy sHAREs 
Incremental costs directly related to the issue of ordinary shares are shown as a deduction in equity. 
-- REDEEmABLE “cLAss A” PREfERENcE sHAREs
class A shares are classified as equity, as these shares are redeemable only at the option of Air Berlin and any dividends are dis-
cretionary. Dividends are recognised as distributions within equity.
-- TREAsURy sHAREs
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and shown as a deduction from total equity. The amount of consideration 
paid for the repurchase of share capital, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction in retained earnings.
j) Income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year and on items taken to equity comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is rec-
ognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognised in equity.
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the end of the period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with IAs 12 on the basis of temporary differences between the tax base at the level 
of the individual company and the respective If Rs book value. No deferred tax is recognised on the initial recognition of good-
will arising from acquisitions. A deferred tax asset is recognised for tax loss carry forwards and other temporary differences result-
ing in an expected tax benefit in future periods to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available in the near 
future against which the unused tax losses can be utilised. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected man-
ner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the end of the period. Judgement is required in estimating the probability of utilisation of deferred tax assets; uncertainty ex-
ists in the amount and timing of future taxable income.
k) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as 
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the ob-
ligation is measurable. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. p135 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
l) Interest-bearing liabilities
Interest-bearing liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. subsequent to initial recogni-
tion, interest-bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
m) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently stated at their amortised cost using the ef-
fective interest method, which approximates their fair value. 
n) Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rate 
at the date of the transaction. monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently translated at 
the exchange rate at the end of the period. Any differences resulting from the currency translation are recognised in the state-
ment of comprehensive income. further details to the currency risk are provided in note 29d.
Exchange rate differences arising from interest-bearing liabilities and other financing activities  –  as well as unrealised ex-
change rate differences due to the fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments and other unrealised foreign ex-
change rate gains and losses  –  are classified as part of financing costs. All other exchange rate differences are allocated to the 
various income and expense line items from which they arose within operating results.
o) Recognition of income and expenses
Revenue relates primarily to transportation services provided and duty-free sales. Revenue and other operating income are rec-
ognised when the corresponding service has been performed (for example transportation) or when the risks and rewards asso-
ciated with the right of ownership are transferred to the buyer (for example duty-free sales). Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received taking into account the amount of any sales deductions (for example air passenger duty, 
VAT and discounts). Expenses are recognised in the period in which they are incurred, which generally corresponds to the time 
at which the income is recognised.
p) Deferred income
Deferred income in the statement of financial position relates mainly to ticket sales and bonus miles resulting from Air Berlin’s fre-
quent flyer plan.
Air Berlin recognises ticket sales as income at the time the transportation is provided. However, when the fare is for a round-
trip and the return flight has not been taken at year-end , the unearned revenue is deferred in the consolidated statement of fi-
nancial position under “deferred income” until such time the transportation is provided. Revenue on unclaimed tickets is real-
ised when the expiry date of the ticket has passed. 
-- fREQUENT fL yER PLAN
The Group operates a frequent flyer plan (“topbonus” programme) which allows the customer to collect bonus miles on flights, 
by doing business with Air Berlin’s partners (hotels, car rental agencies, insurance and financial service companies) or by shopping.
Within the scope of the “topbonus” programme of Air Berlin miles earned are valued at the fair value using the deferred-in-
come-method in accordance with If RIc 13 “c ustomer Loyalty Programmes”. If RIc 13 was applied from 1 January 2009. The 
value of one mile was previously valued using the incremental-cost method until 31 December 2008. In accordance with IAs 8 
“Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”, the impact of If RIc 13 has been applied retrospectively.  06)  Financial Statements

q) Leasing
The Group leases a number of aircraft under operating leases which require Air Berlin to maintain the leased assets. Repair and 
overhaul costs are not included in the lease rentals. In addition, for the majority of its leased aircraft, the Group makes pay-
ments for the future maintenance expenses to the lessor. These are based on the estimated costs of major airframe and certain 
engine checks and are calculated based on the number of flight hours or cycles flown. When maintenance takes place the Group 
is reimbursed for the payments already made.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease. 
The Group capitalises fixed assets leased under arrangements in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the Group as finance leases in accordance with IAs 17. Leased assets are measured initially at the lower of their 
fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments. The assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. The related obligation is shown under Interest-bearing liabilities in the amount of the discounted minimum lease payments 
less payments made.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the lease term.
The Group carries out sale and leaseback transactions. If the leaseback transaction is an operating lease, and the sale price is 
below fair value of the asset, any profit or loss is recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income in accord-
ance with IAs 17. If the loss is compensated for by future lease payments below market price, it shall be deferred and amortized 
in proportion to the lease payments over the lease term.
r) Pensions
Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans which do not qualify as defined contribution plans. Defined contribu-
tion plans are pension plans under which fixed contributions are paid into a separate legal entity with no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay further amounts.
The Group’s net obligation or asset in connection with defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan. The amount 
of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods is estimated and discount-
ed to present value using an appropriate discount rate based on AA-credit rated bonds with maturities approximating the maturi-
ties of the Group’s obligations under the pension plans. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected 
unit credit method. The fair value of plan assets as of the end of the period are deducted from the obligation. Any resulting net 
assets are limited to the net total of the present value of future refunds or reductions in payments and the amount of any unrec-
ognised prior service cost. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss in the period in which they 
are incurred. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in profit and loss 
in the period in which they are due. p137 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
s) Share-based payment transactions
The fair value of options granted to employees is estimated on the grant date and recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income as personnel expense over the vesting period (i.e. the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the options). The corresponding entry is an increase in equity. The fair value was determined using valuation techniques which 
comply with IfRs 2.  
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options expected to vest. market conditions are 
included in the calculation of fair value at grant date and do not affect future valuation, whereas vesting conditions are taken 
into consideration in determining the number of share options expected to vest. further details to vesting conditions are found 
in note 12.

u) Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
  credit risk
  Liquidity risk
  market risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and proc-
esses for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. f urther quantitative disclosures are included 
throughout the financial statements. 06)  Financial Statements
p138 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management frame-
work. The Board has an established risk management system, which monitors the Group’s risk management policies. Any  
significant risks are reported to the Board.
Risk reporting includes the review and assessment of all risks in the individual departments. This includes the registration of 
new risks and the reassessment of existing risks regarding their probability of occurrence and potential effect on earnings. In 
general a quantitative assessment of risks is undertaken. The registered risks are continuously updated using respective IT-tools.
Extensive risk reporting, which contains information on current risks and assessments, changes in assessments and the appro-
priate measures is submitted each quarter to the Executive Board.
There were no changes in the Group’s exposures to risk or its objectives, policies and processes for identifying, measuring and 
managing risks since the previous period.
Credit risk
s ingle-seat tickets are sold subject to payment up front. c redit risk is very low and limited to payments made from overdrawn 
bank accounts shortly before the flight. credit risk relating to bulk ticket sales to charter and package tour operators is also lim-
ited, as tour operators make regular pre-payments during the month based on the expected monthly sales.
The sale of passage and freight documents is handled via agencies and the Internet within the guidelines of IATA. Agencies are 
connected with country-specific clearing systems for the settlement of passage or freight sales. Individual agents are subject to 
controls by appropriate clearing houses. The credit risk from an individual sales agent is relatively low due to worldwide disper-
sion. Where the agreement upon which a payment is based does not explicitly state otherwise, claims and liabilities arising be-
tween the airlines are usually settled on a bilateral basis or via a clearing house of the International Air Transport Association 
(IATA). s ettlement takes place principally through the balancing of all receivables and liabilities in monthly intervals, which also 
contributes to a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment. s eparate security may be required in the particular payment 
agreement for other transactions. 
f or all other payment relationships, depending upon the type and level of the particular payment, securities may be required or 
credit information/references obtained. Historical data from the business relationship up until that point, in particular in relation 
to payment behaviour, may be used in an effort to avoid non-payment. Recognisable risks are accounted for by valuation adjust-
ments on receivables. 
The credit risk from investments and derivative financial instruments arises from the risk of non-payment by a contract partner. 
since the transactions are concluded with contracting parties of the highest possible credit rating the risk of non-payment is ex-
tremely low. c ash in bank is held only at banks with the highest credit ratings. Derivative financial instruments are also held 
with parties with AA ratings or that are known to be reliable based on past experience. The Group considers its net position in 
determining its impairment risk on bank balances and positive market values of derivatives.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Liquidity in the Group is 
protected by appropriate liquidity planning and adequate financing structures. 
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet 
its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to 
the Air Berlin reputation.
A group-wide treasury management system is implemented. It covers and evaluates all matters associated with interest and  
exchange rates. All substantial Air Berlin companies are fully incorporated into the Air Berlin treasury management system.  
In addition the Group has enhanced its liquidity management through the development of a liquidity management tool which  
incorporates expected operational, financing and investing cash flows on a weekly basis. The primary focus is on sufficient  
liquidity, based on comprehensive financial and liquidity planning. p139 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The treasury management system includes those hedge relations required by IAs 39 for hedge accounting and the calculations 
for hedge effectiveness. Both the underlying transactions and the hedging activities are incorporated into this system. All the 
hedging arrangements entered into are continuously monitored on their effectiveness and modified as necessary.
Market risk
market risk is the risk of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.  
c hanges in market prices can affect the Group’s income and expenses or the value of Air Berlin holdings in financial instruments. 
As an airline Air Berlin is exposed to currency, interest rate and fuel price risks as well as credit and liquidity risks. Air Berlin 
uses derivatives to limit these risks. A detailed description of the Group’s exposure to market risks and the hedging activities  
to limit these risks is presented in note 29.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the c ompany defines as net 
operating income divided by total shareholders’ equity. The Board seeks to maintain a balance between higher returns that 
might be possible with a higher level of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. In 
particular, in reviewing the c ompany’s financing alternatives, the Board, always bearing in mind the shareholders’ return on  
equity, balances a variety of financing options, including share issues, bond issues and traditional bank financing. 
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
v) Financial instruments
f inancial instruments are all contracts which lead to the recognition of a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instru-
ment. financial assets include primarily cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans receivable and positive market values 
of derivative financial instruments. f inancial liabilities include liabilities to banks, trade creditors, finance lease liabilities and 
negative market values of derivatives. financial instruments are recorded in the statement of financial position at the time Air 
Berlin becomes partner to a contract for a financial instrument. 
categories of financial assets and financial liabilities which apply to Air Berlin are as follows:
  Loans and receivables
  financial assets at fair value through profit or loss classified as held for trading in accordance with IAs 39 (derivative  
financial instruments)
  f inancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss classified as held for trading in accordance with IAs 39 (derivative  
financial instruments)
  financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (includes trade payables and other financial liabilities as well as interest-
bearing liabilities and liabilities due to banks for the assignment of future lease payments)
The categories of financial assets and financial liabilities are further detailed in note 29h.  06)  Financial Statements
p140 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009

The Group performed an impairment test on both landing rights and goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2009 based on a variety  
of assumptions and concluded that as the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amounts, no impairment was re-
quired. The recoverable amount was determined for the cash generating unit to which the landing rights and goodwill belongs.  
The Group has determined three cash generating units for purposes of the impairment test and allocated goodwill to these cash 
generating units as follows:
   Technical  flight 
In thousands of Euro f reight  services  services  Total
Goodwill  31,000  0  163,668  194,668
Landing rights 0  0  118,249  118,249
The future cash flows were estimated using the value-in-use method based on the most recent mid-term cash flow plan 
(2 years) approved by management for the existing fleet, extrapolated to perpetuity using a 0.5% (2008: 0.5%) growth rate  
and discounted to their present value. The pre-tax peer-group weighted average cost of capital was 10.43% (2008: 12.33%). 
The plan is based on the passenger volume of 33 – 35 million passengers. The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the  
assumptions of discount rate and the number of passengers. The operating margins used in determining value in use are based 
on planned business and operational growth, excluding growth arising from purchases of additional fixed assets but including 
maintenance and repairs. The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by a significant amount. The recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit flight services will be equal to its carrying amount by an adverse change in the weighted 
average cost of capital of 2.57 percentage points or through a decline in the passenger volume of about 1.2 million passengers. 
The trading environment is subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that could have a material impact on the  
operating performance of the business. The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the peer-group long-term cost of 
capital for the cash generating unit. 06)  Financial Statements

Other capital reserves
Other capital reserves are comprised of general partners’ and limited partners’ capital of consolidated partnerships and subscribed 
capital of consolidated entities which were reclassified to other capital reserves due to the reverse acquisition in 2005. 
Treasury shares
In connection with the amendment made to the employee share-based payment scheme discussed below, the c ompany repurchased 
the beneficial interest (and limited all significant legal aspects of the ownership, such as voting rights) in 177,600 shares of its stock 
in 2006. The purchase price was € 0.25 per share (par value), resulting in a decrease in retained earnings of € 45. 
hedge accounting reserve
The reserve for hedge accounting contains the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments designated as hedges of probable future cash flows, net of tax.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The reserve for currency translation differences comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the  
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Dividends
No dividends on ordinary shares or class A shares were declared or paid during the period. p147 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Minority interest
The minority interest of € 629 shown in the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2008 relates to the 51 per cent  
of Belair’s equity at the acquisition date. On 26 October 2009 the Group purchased the remaining 51 per cent of Belair’s equity. 
The purchase price equals cHf 1,785 (€ 1,182). The increase in ownership interest in Belair without change in control is  
accounted for as an equity transaction.
11. EARNINgS PER ShARE
The basic and diluted earnings per share are determined by dividing the loss for the period by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.

The 50,000 c lass A shares (redeemable preference shares) do not entitle the holders to any participation in the profit or loss  
of Air Berlin, as dividends are discretionary. These shares therefore have not been included in the calculation of the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding above. 
The conversion of convertible bonds would have had an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share and is therefore not consid-
ered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
12. EMPLOyEE ShARE PLAN
The c ompany introduced a share-based payment scheme in April 2006, which was later amended in November 2006, as part of 
the remuneration package provided to the Executive Directors and certain senior executives of the Group (each a “Participant”). 
In April 2006 the company invited Executive Directors and certain senior executives of the Group (each a “Participant”) to sub-
scribe for shares in a one-off award (the “Award”). Participants paid the nominal value for their shares. The Award was made 
subject to the conditions set out in an agreement entered into between the company and each Participant. Participants became 
owners of the shares when they subscribed for them but were unable to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares other than in ac-
cordance with the agreement. 
The plan was amended on 28 November 2006 so that the c ompany reacquired the beneficial interest in all of the shares under 
the Award and placed restrictions on the legal interest in the shares (i.e. voting rights). The beneficial interest in the shares was 
transferred to Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited as trustee of the Air Berlin Employee s hare Trust. The amendment was 
not treated as a modification. 06)  Financial Statements
p148 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Under the terms of the revised Employee s hare Plan 2006 the Participant holds (limited) legal title to the shares but will only be 
able to acquire the beneficial interest to the shares if certain performance conditions are met and if the employee remains with 
the company for the entire performance period (vesting period). If the conditions are not met, if the Participant leaves the com-
pany before the end of the vesting period or if the Participant does not transfer payment for the shares within two weeks upon 
notification by the c ompany that the conditions have been met, the c ompany may require the Participant to transfer legal title 
to the shares to the company. Participants are not entitled to receive dividends during the performance period. In addition, re-
strictions have been placed on the Participant’s legal interest in the shares (i.e. voting rights) during the performance period. 
The shares are divided equally in three tranches, each comprising one-third of the shares granted. 50% of the shares granted 
under each of the tranches are subject to a performance condition based on return on equity achieved by the c ompany and 
50% of the shares granted under each of the tranches are subject to performance conditions based on the percentage increase 
in the company’s share price over a three-year period as follows:
Tranche and three-year performance period  Total number of  Threshold return  Threshold share price 
(ending 31 December)  shares in tranche   on equity element   growth element
Tranche 1: 2008 59,200  13%  35%
Tranche 2: 2009 59,200  14%  38%
Tranche 3: 2010 59,200  15%  40%
Both performance conditions will be measured in respect of the first, second and third tranches over the performance periods of 
three consecutive financial years ending on 31 December 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. 
The right to acquire the beneficial interest in the shares subject to the Employee s hare Plan 2006 is exercisable during a two 
week period following notification by the c ompany of fulfilment of the performance criteria. The exercise price is € 0.25 per 
share, the nominal value of the shares. 
Neither of the performance conditions were met for the Tranche 1 performance period, which ended 31 December 2008, and 
for the Tranche 2 performance period, which ended 31 December 2009. Therefore, participants will not be able to call for the 
economic interest in the shares under these tranches and may be required to transfer the legal ownership of those shares to the 
Air Berlin Employee share Trust. The equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value on the grant 
date in accordance with If Rs 2. The weighted average fair value of these options was € 8.95 at the measurement date. The fair 
value of the options granted was determined using the binomial model under the following assumptions:
 Volatility: 40%
 Dividends: 0
 Risk-free interest rate: 4%
Volatility was estimated by a peer group analysis in the airline sector, adjusted for a “new issuer” premium. p149 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The number and weighted average exercise price of share options during the period was as follows:
     Weighted    Weighted 
   Number of  average  Number of  average

Total benefit in the statement of comprehensive income relating to the Employee share Plan was € 88 in 2009 (benefit of  
€ 143 in 2008).

The provisions for anniversary bonuses and old age part time (early retirement) are described in note 14. 
Defined benefit plans
In 2007, the c ompany entered into a defined benefit pension plan for its Executive Directors. In addition the Group has a  
defined benefit pension plan for certain employees of dba. Both pension plans are funded through payments to qualified insurance 
contracts.
The development of the Group’s defined benefit obligations during the period is as follows:

f air value of plan assets at 31 December 13,562  10,279
Plan assets consist exclusively of external contracts with insurance companies in Germany. These insurances could potentially 
include shares in Air Berlin Plc. However, due to strict requirements in Germany regarding the structure of insurance companies, 
the percentage of Air Berlin shares held would be minimal.
The actual loss on plan assets was € 515 during the period (€ 37 gain in 2008). No experience adjustments were made during 
the period.
The amount recognised as pension expense in profit or loss is as follows:
In thousands of Euro 2009  2008

The Group expects to contribute € 3,610 to its defined benefit pension plans in 2010.  p151 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date are as follows:
 2009  2008 
Discount rate at 31 December 5.39%  6.30%
Expected return on plan assets at 1 January 4.00 – 4.30%  2.75 – 4.00%

cost of living adjustment (future pension increases) 1.00%  1.00% 
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables (“Richttafeln 2005 G” published 
by Heubeck-Richttafeln-GmbH). The average remaining life expectancy of an individual retiring at age 65 is 20 years for males 
and 25 years for females.
Defined contribution plans
Through the acquisition of dba in 2006, the Group acquired a defined contribution pension plan covering all employees of dba, 
to which the Group makes contributions. The net pension expense recorded in the profit and loss in 2009 as a result of the defined 
contribution plan is € 5 (2008: € 18).
As employees in Germany are covered by and required to contribute to the German social security system, Air Berlin does not 
have any other employee benefit plans at the end of the period. The Group paid contributions into the German social security 
system of € 26,687 in 2009 (€27,713 in 2008).

Thereof € 10,298 relating to the provision for anniversary bonuses and old age part time was classified as non-current as at  
31 December 2009 (2008: € 10,661). 
As a result of the existing collective labour agreement, older employees of LTU (age 55 and above) have the opportunity to take 
part in the old age part time (“Altersteilzeit”) program, till the end of the reporting period. The program is a form of early retire-
ment in which the employee works full time during the first few years and not at all in the following years until reaching the  
official age of retirement. 69 employees have signed such agreements as of the end of the period. A discount rate of 4.9% and 
an expected salary increase of 2.0% was used to calculate the provision. Uncertainties exist as to the life expectancy of the  
employees and as to the future salary at the time the contract takes effect.
The provision for anniversary bonuses was calculated using a discount rate of 5.6% and an expected yearly salary increase of 
2%. Uncertainties exist in the probability that the employees will remain with the Group until they are entitled to receive their 
anniversary bonus and as to their salaries at that time. The provision was accounted for in accordance with IAs 19.
The provision for redundancy costs is related to the layoff of dba and LTU staff at the offices in munich and Dusseldorf in con-
nection with the concentration of the business in Berlin. Uncertainties exist relating to the amount and probability of payments. 
The provision is based on the most likely outcome based on similar cases in Germany. 06)  Financial Statements

Operating leases
The Group leases a number of aircraft, engines and one Unix server under leasing agreements which qualify as operating lease 
agreements. The leases typically run for a period of up to twelve years and terminate automatically upon expiry of the lease 
term. Lease payments are denominated in UsD and vary depending upon the change in the market rate of interest. No restric-
tions have been placed on the lessee as a result of these leases.
In addition the Group leases a number of warehouse and office facilities under operating leases. The leases expire between 
2010 and 2018, with an option to renew the leases after these dates. 
Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows:

No contingent rents were recognised as lease payments in the period. 
During the year ended 31 December 2009, € 381,836 (2008: € 383,628) was recognised as an expense in the statement of com-
prehensive income in respect of operating leases.
The Group also leases several of its aircraft as lessor under agreements which qualify as operating leases. The lease terms vary 
from three to twelve years, the latest of which expire in 2019. Lease payments are in Us D.

Finance leases
The Group leases certain technical equipment under an agreement which qualifies as a finance lease. The finance lease relates 
to technical equipment for aircraft leased under operating leases with various leasing terms, the latest of which phase out in 2015. 
The Group also leases two aircrafts under agreements which qualify as finance leases. The lease agreements are for terms of 
eleven years, the latest of which expires in 2018. The agreements contain various put and call options relating to the right of the 
lessee to purchase the aircraft or the right of the lessor to require the lessee to purchase the aircraft on certain dates at prices 
and conditions set out in the agreements. In addition, the lessor has the right to require the lessee to name a purchaser at the 
end of the lease term for a fixed price (guaranteed residual value). Lease payments are in Us D and vary based on changes in 
the interest rate component of the lease. The present value of future minimum lease payments was therefore determined by us-
ing the expected lease payments based on the preliminary interest rate stated in the lease. 06)  Financial Statements

Segment information
The company is managed by the Board of Directors as a single business unit in one geographical area and one service. The key 
figures and ratios presented to the Board of Directors in managing the company are: Result from operating activities, Net Debt, 
Revenues, passengers, yield and block hours. The financial measures are IfRs measures and are shown in the primary state-
ments. Resource allocation decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire fleet.  
Revenues derive nearly completely from the principal activity as an airline and include flights, commissions, inflight and related 
sales that are generated in Europe. since Air Berlin’s aircraft fleet is employed across its scheduled destinations on an as need-
ed basis all assets and liabilities are allocated to the one segment. The Board has also determined that there is no reasonable 
basis of allocating assets and related liabilities, income and expenses to geographical areas other than Europe or to individual 
groups of customers.

26. INCOME TAx ExPENSES AND DEFERRED TAxES (ADJUSTED)
Profit or loss before tax is primarily attributable to Germany. 
Income tax expense is as follows: 
In thousands of Euro 2009  2008 
   (adjusted)
current income tax expense  (5,606 ) (4,910 )
Deferred income tax benefit (expense) 17,835  (8,631 )
Total income tax benefit (expense)  12,229  (13,541 )
The current income tax expense of the Air Berlin Group includes corporate tax, a solidarity charge in addition to corporate  
tax, trade tax and foreign income taxes. The current income tax expense of € 5,606 (2008: 4,910) includes € 380 of prior year 
income tax expenses (2008: income tax income for prior years of € 414).
The tax rate for the Air Berlin Group equals 30.18% (2008: 30.18%). It consists of corporate tax rate and solidarity charge  
of 15.83% and trade tax of 14.35%. The calculation of the trade tax rate includes the effect of the different trade tax rates  
depending on the municipality in which the company operates.
As a result of variations in the tax rate in different jurisdictions, several subsidiaries have tax rates which differ from the Air 
Berlin Group tax rate. The difference to the Group tax rate is shown as “effect of tax rates in different jurisdictions” in the tax 
rate reconciliation in amount of € 7,635 (2008: € (11,337)). The reasons for the differences between the tax burden expected  
on the basis of profit for the period and the recognised income tax expenses are as follows: p161 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009

As of 31 December 2009, total tax loss carry forwards for which deferred tax assets were capitalised amounted to € 312,399 for 
trade tax purposes and € 261,347 for corporate tax purposes (2008: € 379,270 and € 296,755 respectively). As of 31 December 
2009, no additional deferred tax assets were capitalised for further loss carry forwards of € 595,330 for trade tax and € 845,663 
for corporate tax (2008: € 634,783 and € 826,635). The tax loss carry forwards are not subject to expiration.

     107,383  12,003  112,136  5,044 p165 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Trade receivables are analysed for a possible impairment loss according to historical data on impairment losses as discussed 
below. Receivables which are neither past due nor impaired are generally considered to contain only a small risk of impair-
ment based on past experience. The consideration is the same for receivables that are 1 – 30 days overdue. However, due to the 
worldwide crises in financial markets and the impact on the world economy, which affected Air Berlin’s customers, the impair-
ment losses increased in the reporting period.
 
The movement in the impairment allowance is as follows:
 Allowance for  Allowance for
 impairment  impairment 
 losses  losses
In thousands of Euro 2009  2008
Balance at 1 January 5,044  4,009
Increase in allowance for impairment losses 9,426  4,444
Release of allowance for impairment losses (2,467 ) (3,409 )
Balance at 31 December 12,003  5,044
The allowance for impairment losses is used to record impairment losses until the Group determines that the financial asset 
should be derecognised. 
The allowance for impairment losses is based on estimates and judgements regarding the credit worthiness of individual re-
ceivables, the actual customer structure and an analysis of historical impairment losses. A companywide credit control process 
is implemented. The third notice is issued along with a court order, and an allowance for impairment losses of 60% is recorded 
on the receivable. This percentage represents the probability of impairment loss based on past experience. Receivables more 
than one year past due are written off completely. At the balance sheet date the allowance for impairment losses is € 12,003 
(2008: € 5,044).
-- OTHER LOANs AND REcEIVABLEs
None of the other loans and receivables were past due as of 31 December 2009 (2008: none), and there were no renegotiations 
of payment terms during the period which would otherwise have resulted in overdue receivables. Impairment losses of € 2,000 
(2008: none) have been recorded on other financial assets.
These receivables relate primarily to amounts due from suppliers (deposits and bonus and claims). The Group only enters into 
contracts with suppliers of high quality and as such does not consider there to be a significant impairment risk relating to these 
amounts. 
Receivables from related parties relate primarily to amounts due from Niki for administrative services provided and clearing ac-
counts and to the long-term loans receivable from Lee & Lex. As the receivables are not overdue and payments have been made 
on time in the past, the Group does not consider an impairment loss to be necessary.

No impairment has been recorded on bank balances or positive market values of derivatives, as the transactions are only made 
with parties of the highest credit rating or, in the case of derivative financial instruments, with parties that are known to be reli-
able based on past experience (past customer behaviour regarding timely payments of amounts due). The Group considers its 
net position in determining its impairment risk on bank balances and positive market values of derivatives. 06)  Financial Statements

The amounts disclosed in the maturity analysis are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, including future interest payments. 
Amounts in Us D are translated at the relevant year-end exchange rate, and variable interest payments are calculated using the 
year-end basis rates.
The Group intends to meet its obligations primarily through cash balances held and cash inflows from operations and in the case 
of purchases of new aircraft (not included above) through future borrowings which are already in place for aircraft deliveries in 
2010 and early 2011.
d) Currency risk 
The Group has significant transactions in UsD as well as smaller transactions in GBP and cHf . Air Berlin enters into UsD cur-
rency forwards and options in order to manage functional currency risk which arises on operating costs (e.g. payments regard-
ing aircraft financing and leasing, fuel, maintenance etc.) denominated in Us D. Air Berlin generally hedges up to 75% (2008: 
75%) of the expected cash flow on a 6 – 18 month (2008: 6 – 18 month) revolving basis. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on the currency values at end of year:

p170 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The variable rate interest bearing liabilities and liabilities due to banks from assignment of future lease payments, which are 
generally denominated in Us D, expose the Group to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates as well as 
to a foreign currency risk. The interest risk results from the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities with variable 
interest rates to changes in the market interest rate. Air Berlin uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge these risks. The 
swaps are considered cash flow hedges from their inception until the liability is recorded in the statement of financial position, 
at which point the interest rate swaps are classified as held for trading, with future changes in market value taken to profit or 
loss.
-- fAIR VALUE sENsITIVIT y ANALysIs fOR fIxED RATE INs TRUmENTs 
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not 
designate any of its derivatives (interest rate swaps) as fair value hedge accounting instruments. Therefore a change in interest 
rates (unless they resulted in the hedge becoming ineffective) at the reporting date would only affect profit or loss to the extent 
that it affects the fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as hedge accounting (held for trading). A change of 100 basis 
points in interest rates would have increased or decreased equity by € 274 (2008: € 516) and profit or loss by € 14,313 (2008: € 
6,303) based on a one year impact. 
-- cAsH fLOW sENsITIVIT y ANALysIs fOR VARIABLE RATE INs TRUmENTs
Assuming that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant, a change of 100 basis points in interest 
rates would have increased or decreased profit or loss (financial result) by € 1,152 (2008: € 1,323) and had no effect on equity 
over the twelve-month period, based on the balance sheet amounts at the reporting date and taking into consideration the effect 
of interest rate swaps.
f) Fuel price risk
The fuel price (jet fuel) plays an important role as far as the business performance of the Group is concerned. fuel expense 
amounted to 22.0% (2008: 25.5%) of the Group’s entire operating expenses. Air Berlin uses commodity swaps as well as com-
modity options to hedge the exposure to fuel price increases. At the end of the period 2009, the hedged volume was 523,500 tons 
for the business year 2010 (2008: 681,000 tons for 2009). The hedging quota was 40.3% for 2010 (in the prior year: 55.8% for 
2009). 
-- sENsITIVIT y ANALysIs
Assuming that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant, a 10% increase in the fuel price at the reporting 
date would have increased equity by € 18,585 (2008: € 23,286) and profit or loss by € 797 (2008: € 0). A 10% decrease in the fuel price 
at the reporting date would have decreased equity by € 17,250 (2008: € 23,286) and profit or loss by € 2,237 (2008: € 0).
The calculation is based on the fair values of commodity derivatives (swaps and options) at the end of the period. The assumptions 
used were the same as in the prior period.
g) hedge accounting
As an airline, the Air Berlin Group is exposed to currency, interest rate and fuel price risks as well as credit and liquidity risks. 
Air Berlin uses derivatives to limit these risks. 
Air Berlin applies hedge accounting for its hedges of future foreign currency denominated cash flows and its hedges of future 
cash flows related to the purchase of jet fuel that satisfy the criteria under IAs 39, thus reducing income statement volatility. In 
addition, as of the third quarter of 2007 Air Berlin applies hedge accounting for its foreign currency options and for several of 
its hedges of future cash flows resulting from variable Us D interest rate payments. These hedging transactions are accounted 
for as cash flow hedges. p171 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
IAs 39 sets out strict requirements on the use of hedge accounting. Air Berlin fulfils those requirements by documenting, at the 
inception of a hedge, both the relationship between the derivative used as the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well 
as the aim and strategy of the hedge. This includes assigning the hedging instruments to the corresponding firm commitments 
and future transactions and also estimating the degree of effectiveness of the hedging instruments employed. The effectiveness 
of existing hedge accounting is monitored on an ongoing basis. f or hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the hedg-
ing instrument is deferred in equity to the extent the hedge is effective. Accumulated fair value changes from qualifying hedges 
are removed from equity to profit or loss in the period when the hedged cash flow affects profit or loss (2009 and 2010 for foreign 
currency and fuel hedges, 2009 to 2015 for cross-currency interest rate hedges).
Air Berlin also uses hedges that do not satisfy the strict hedge accounting criteria of IAs 39. f or such derivatives Air Berlin  
recognises the changes in fair value in profit or loss. The fair values of derivatives are presented in a separate line in the state-
ment of financial position.

ment during the period are as follows:

All foreign currency options and commodity options (fuel price) entered into during the period meet the qualifications of hedge 
accounting and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The change in the intrinsic value is recorded in equity, and the change in 
the time value is recorded in profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting concerning the cross-currency interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Those cross-cur-
rency interest rate swaps which do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting continue to be recorded in profit or loss and are 
classified as held for trading.
cash flow hedges are expected to impact profit or loss in the same period in which the cash flows are expected to occur, as 
detailed in section c “liquidity risk” above.

p174 AIR BERLIN ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments:
   
Derivatives 
f orward exchange, interest rate and fuel price derivatives are carried at fair value, by valuation model. The valuation is  
performed using the quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly  
(i.e. derived from prices). Therefore, all the derivative financial instruments of Air Berlin relate to the Level 2 of the three level 
hierarchy as defined in IfRs 7.27A.
 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
f air value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows using current rates. 
  
Trade and other receivables / payables 
f or receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the carrying value is deemed to reflect the fair value.  
All other receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value. 
   
Cash and cash equivalents 
Due to the short maturity date, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
i) Net gain or loss
The net gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities during the period are as follows:
In thousands of Euro 2009  2008 
Loans and receivables (14,655 ) (7,259 )
cash and cash equivalents 1,612  5,008
Derivatives 19,034  (2,963 )
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 16,450  (38,179 )
 22,441  (43,393 )
This includes foreign exchange rate gains (losses), impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses, changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss and gains (losses) on disposal. 
No interest income, fee income and fee expense was accrued on impaired financial assets during the period (2008: none).

On 17 f ebruary 2010 Air Berlin PLc & co. Luftverkehrs KG acquired a further 25.9% of the share capital of NIKI Luftfahrt
GmbH (NIKI) for a purchase price of € 21,000 from Privatstiftung Lauda (private Lauda foundation). The Group interest in the 
share capital of NIKI would be 49.9%. As a result of the analyses of the transaction, Air Berlin has to account for it in accord-
ance with IfRs 3 Business combinations, provided Air Berlin receives approval from the antitrust agency.
In connection with the increase of its shareholding, Air Berlin PLc & co. Luftverkehrs KG provides the private Lauda foundation 
a loan of 40.5 million Euro. The private Lauda foundation has the option of repaying the loan in three years with cash or 
through the transfer of the remaining 50.1% of NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH’s shares.
The initial accounting of this business combination was incomplete at the time when the financial statements were authorised 
for issue, therefore, the disclosures about the major classes of consideration transferred, assets and liabilities acquired, recog-
nized goodwill, accounting for non-controlling interest as well as disclosures for the business combination achieved in stages 
could not be made.
In march 2010 Air Berlin has reduced the number of firm orders of Boeing 787 aircraft from 25 to 15 and the number of options 
from 10 to 5. furthermore the delivery of 9 Boeing 737 aircraft was rescheduled to 2015. These aircraft were originally sched-
uled for delivery in 2010 or 2011.

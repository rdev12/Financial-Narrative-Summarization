Chairman’s 
Statement
Overview
The year started well with a continuation of 
the strong growth momentum of recent years 
but performance was impacted by the 
economic downturn as the year progressed. 
Total revenues increased by 2% for the year 
with growth of 7% at the half year and a 
decline of 3% in the second half. In 
challenging market conditions our 
performance was supported by successful 
design innovation and our strong portfolio of 
brands including Sanderson and Harlequin 
positioned at the mid market and Morris & Co 
and Zoffany at the upper end of the interior 
furnishings market. Revenues from these 
brands have grown year on year by 5%.
Collection - Tamika  
Design - Miya
Approximately half our manufacturing output 
was to third parties and this business 
declined by 9% in contrast to production for 
our own brands which increased by 4%.
We have strengthened our balance sheet 
during the year reducing net debt at the year 
end to £6,218,000 from £7,289,000 in 2008.
The current economic environment is clearly 
unfavourable. However many global 
opportunities are available to us in the 
medium term and a clear strategy to develop 
the Group for a strong future and to manage 
the downturn is set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review. Walker Greenbank PLC

Overview
Financials
Revenue increased 2% to £63,698,000, from 
£62,448,000 over the same period last year. 
The operating profit for the year decreased 
10% to £3,561,000 (2008: £3,961,000). The 
profit before tax decreased 10% to 
£2,787,000 (2008: £3,099,000). The profit 
after tax declined to £1,622,000 (2008: 
£8,171,000), due almost entirely to non-cash 
deferred tax movements as a consequence of 
the recognition for the first time last year of a 
deferred tax asset. This related predominantly 
to historical corporation tax losses.
The earnings per share were 2.96p (2008: 
14.49p). An adjusted earnings per share that 
excludes the deferred tax movements and 
reflects the cash tax of the Group is 4.97p 
(2008: 5.44p).
Interest cover increased to 5.1 times, 
compared with 4.0 times last year.
The Group’s net indebtedness at the year end 
reduced to £6,218,000 (2008: £7,289,000). 
This represents a reduction in gearing to 31% 
(2008: 35%). The cash inflow from operating 
activities was £2,830,000 (2008: £3,542,000), 
reflecting higher stock levels as a result of 
extensive brand product launches during the 
year. At the year end, the Group had available 
banking facilities of £12,773,000 (2008: 
£14,183,000) representing headroom of 
£6,555,000 (2008: £6,894,000).
Dividend
The Directors do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend at this point in time. In 
this current economic environment we remain 
focused on continued cash generation and 
reduction in net debt.
People
On 31 January 2009, Ian Kirkham retired from 
the Board. He has served as Non-executive 
Chairman for a period of five years and during 
that time has overseen the transformation of 
the Group’s fortunes. I would like to offer our 
grateful thanks to Ian on behalf of the Board.
Following Ian’s retirement, I am delighted to 
have become Chairman at the start of the 
2009/10 financial year.
On 17 December 2008, Fiona Goldsmith 
joined the Board as a Non-executive Director. 
Her extensive financial background across a 
variety of business sectors will be of great 
value to the Group in future years.
 
Finally I would like to offer sincere thanks to all 
of our management and employees for their 
loyalty and commitment during the year. 
Outlook
Over the past five years the Group has 
established itself as a leader in its field 
increasing revenue and profits significantly,

generating cash and building a strong balance 
sheet. In the current uncertain global 
environment in which we operate we have 
focused on reducing our cost base, improving 
manufacturing efficiency and reducing net 
debt. In addition we continue to invest in the 
strength of our exceptional brand portfolio. 
Revenues in the first half will be significantly 
down on a buoyant period last year, though 
the impact of this reduction will to some 
extent be mitigated by our focus on costs and 
efficiency. With a clear strategy and a robust 
balance sheet we believe that the Group is 
well positioned to take advantage of an upturn 
in its markets.

Chief Executive’s  
Review
Strategy
Despite the turbulent economic conditions in 
which we are trading, we remain committed 
to the five key elements of our growth strategy 
which is supported by the Group’s cash 
generation and a robust balance sheet.  
In addition we benefit from world renowned 
brands all of which can be expected to  
return to strong growth on any upturn in  
the trading environment. The key elements  
of the strategy comprise:
UK growth – to continue to exploit   >
the medium term organic growth 
opportunities that exist for our Group in  
the UK retail market.
Geographic expansion – to invest in  >
marketing and distribution in the North 
American market, where our Group is 
currently immature relative to our peers, 
and to focus on the distribution and 
marketing of our brands in Europe and the 
Rest of the World, where again as a Group 
we are presently underdeveloped.
Contract sales – to drive the expansion of  >
our developing contracts business through 
further investment in people and contract 
specific product supported by the strength 
of our brand names and our manufacturing 
capability, predominantly focusing at the 
mid to upper end of the contract market;
Licensing income – to exploit the global  >
recognition of the Sanderson and Morris & 
Co. brand names and to develop further  
the licensing opportunities that exist for 
Harlequin in the UK. 
Acquisitions – to evaluate acquisition  >
opportunities that may fit with our current 
brand portfolio and potentially provide 
synergistic and earnings enhancing 
opportunities. 
Overview
Our brand sales have remained flat in the UK 
retail market. In mainland Europe, retail sales 
have grown 10% due to the strength of the 
euro, although this equates to a 4% decline in 
constant currency. In the Rest of the World 
sales have grown by 16%. Sales in our US 
retail business, which remains a relatively 
small part of our Group, have increased 3% 
due to the strength of the dollar, but fallen 7% 
in constant currency. Within our brand 
segment our Contract business continues to 
benefit from strong investment and has 
delivered 17% year on year growth. Our 
licence business has grown 21% reflecting the 
strength of our brands and their potential to 
stretch into adjacent categories. Finally, our 
manufacturing units have suffered from the 
overall decline in the market with their third 
party sales falling 9%.
The brands
Total sales have grown year on year by 5% 
reflecting no growth in sales in the second 
half due to a much tougher trading 
environment, sales having been up 10% at the

brands, the factories print for third party 
customers.
Anstey
Anstey continues to benefit from the demand 
for wallpaper and its unique position as 
market leader in the UK for wallpaper 
manufacture at the mid to premium end of the 
market. Overall sales have grown year on year 
by 4%, sales having been up at the half year 
by 5%. Sales to Group company brands have 
grown 5% representing 51% of the overall 
sales, whilst external third party sales have 
grown 2%, reflecting the relative success of 
our brands in difficult markets. Margins have 
fallen slightly due to increased energy costs 
and overall profitability has slightly improved 
over the same period last year. We remain 
focused on improving factory efficiency and 
service to our customers. 
Standfast
Standfast has suffered particularly difficult 
trading conditions with overall sales falling 9% 
over the same period last year, sales were 
down 3% at the half year. Sales to Group 
company brands which represent 41% of the 
overall sales were up 3%, whilst external third 
party sales fell 16%, suggesting our Group 
brands are performing well in very difficult 
market conditions. Standfast has suffered 
margin decline due to less production 
throughput in the factory and increased 
energy costs, two factors which combined 
with the sales fall has led to a loss in the year.
At the beginning of the second half of the year 
management took action to reduce the cost 
base of this business in order to reflect the 
lower level of volume activity, resulting in a 
redundancy cost of £146,000.
Summary
All of our brands continue to perform 
competitively in a difficult market. The 
considerable investment we have made in 
product and marketing in recent years places 
us in a strong position to withstand the 
current economic environment and ultimately 
exploit the continuing and new business 
opportunities that exist within the Group.  
We remain confident about the progress the 
Group will make in the medium term given  
the global recognition of its brands and the 
robustness of the Group’s finances.

half year. Over recent years we have strongly 
increased our investment in our product 
launches across all our brands and this has 
helped protect our market share in a much 
tougher trading environment. We have a 
strong portfolio of brands covering a wide 
variety of market segments in the mid to 
upper end of the interior furnishings market, 
supported by a wide offering of product. We 
are however conscious of the tougher market 
in which we operate and, going forward, will 
keep tight control of the amount of product 
we launch to reduce cost while the current 
economic environment prevails. 
Harlequin
Despite increasingly tough market conditions 
in the second half, it is pleasing to report that 
Harlequin has managed to maintain its sales 
at the same level as last year having been 7% 
up at the half year and to continue its position 
as the leading mid-market contemporary 
brand in the UK. Overall both the UK market 
and export markets were essentially flat. 
However, within our export markets, Europe 
was down year on year by 7% and by 14% in 
constant currency. This was offset by growth 
in the emerging markets of the Far East, 
Middle East and Australia where overall sales 
were up 21%. Woven product continued to 
grow, up 4% on the same period last year, 
whilst wallpaper sales declined by 4% and 
printed fabrics declined by 8%.
Continued commitment and investment in our 
Contract business has helped grow year on 
year sales by 19%. Harlequin has also grown 
its licensing income principally with the 
development of a range of product lines in  
the John Lewis Partnership. More than half of 
Harlequin’s sales are from woven product 
which is sourced primarily from Europe. For 
this product category the gross margins have 
declined due to the strengthening of the euro 
which has led to a fall in profits.
Zoffany
Having established Zoffany as a leading brand 
at the premium end of the market and having 
invested heavily in new product over recent 
years, we reported last year that the design 
community had shown increasing interest  
in the older collections of Zoffany and that  
this had reinvigorated the sales of those 
collections. This year we have experienced  
an accelerating decline of those older 
collections but in their place our newer 
collections have performed well. 
Overall year on year sales have declined 1% 
having been up 7% at the half year. UK sales 
declined 2% but export markets continued to 
see overall growth of 5%, with Europe 
growing 6%, representing an 11% decline in 
constant currency and the Rest of the World 
up 5% helped by strong growth from the 
Middle East and Australasia. Woven fabric, 
which now represents more than half of 
Zoffany’s sales, grew 2% with both wallpaper 
and printed fabrics having declined by 1% 
each. Zoffany’s Contract business has grown 
year on year 2%. The strong euro has led to a 
decline in margins and this combined with 
additional stock provisioning due to the faster 
decline of the older collections has led to a 
reduction in profits. 
 
Arthur Sanderson & Sons incorporating 
the Morris & Co. brand
Significant investment in product and 
marketing over recent years has helped 
Sanderson to exploit the unrivalled global 
recognition of the Sanderson and Morris & 
Co. brand names and to grow its sales this 
year by 15%, having been up 25% at the half 
year. The growth continues to be broad-
based with all geographic markets growing 
strongly. The UK market delivered year on 
year sales growth of 9% whilst overseas 
markets were up 31%. This impressive export 
sales growth was driven by European markets 
up 32%, 17% in constant currency and the 
Rest of the World up 28%. The growth has 
been led by woven fabric, up by 22%, with 
wallpaper up 19% and printed fabrics up 4%. 
The growth has been supported by strong 
progress in its Contract business up 34%. 
Gross margins improved as the strengthening 
euro benefited margins with Sanderson selling 
more in Europe than it purchases. This margin 
gain combined with the sales growth has 
helped to improve profits significantly.
Overseas
USA
Sales in our US business have increased year 
on year by 7% however they have fallen in 
constant currency by 4% due to the 
strengthening dollar. Sales at the half year in 
local currency were broadly flat. The US still 
forms a relatively small part of the overall 
Group but we firmly believe in the medium to 
long term potential for the Group in this 
market. However economic conditions are 
becoming increasingly challenging and whilst 
this prevails we will remain tightly focused on 
the level of investment in marketing, 
patterning and sample support. Lower sales 
have led to a continued loss.
Europe
The Group’s distribution businesses in Rome, 
for Zoffany and Harlequin, and in Paris, for 
Zoffany and Sanderson, remain relatively small. 
Both these markets saw challenging trading 
conditions but the appointment of an 
experienced Export development director 
towards the end of last year brought 
improvements to both operations. Combined 
revenues have increased by 14%, representing 
a decline of 3% in constant currency.
Manufacturing
We have two freehold printing facilities in the 
UK: Anstey, our wallpaper factory in 
Loughborough; and Standfast, our fabric 
printing factory in Lancaster. Both factories 
offer highly specialised printing, and their UK 
location brings benefits including the ability to 
print very short runs and easy accessibility for 
UK designers to visit the factories during the 
printing process. In addition to printing the 
wallpaper and fabrics for the Group’s own  Walker Greenbank PLC

Financial  
Review
Income Statement and exceptional items
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief 
Executive’s Review provide an analysis of the 
key factors impacting the revenue and operating 
profit. In addition to the information on our 
brands and production facilities included in 
these reports, the Group has included in note  
4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
information on our business segments.
Disposals
There were no major disposals during the year. 
Interest
The net interest charge for the year was 
£695,000 (2008: £981,000) including 
amortisation of debt issue costs capitalised.  
The reduced cost reflects the reduction in 
interest rates over the year.
Net defined benefit pension
The charge during the year was £79,000 
(2008: income £119,000). This is a 
consequence of the increase in corporate 
bond rates from the start of the financial year 
compared with that at the beginning of the 
previous year. The charge is also impacted if 
the pension deficit increases which will be the 
case in the coming year. 
Mereville, Sanderson
Current taxation
There is a small corporation tax charge arising 
from the taxable profits at the Italian subsidiary 
and overseas licence income. The Group 
continues to review the overseas tax position 
to ensure every opportunity is considered to 
minimise the amount incurred.
Deferred taxation
Due to the substantial nature of corporation 
tax losses £21.3 million (2008: £23.7 million) 
the Group does not anticipate incurring or 
paying UK corporation tax in the immediate 
future. However, as the majority of the 
corporation tax losses have now been 
recognised as a deferred tax asset, in the 
current and future years there will be a 
deferred tax charge in the Income Statement 
until such time as the losses have been fully 
utilised at which point the Group will incur and 
pay UK corporation tax.
There is a one-off deferred tax charge of 
£320,000 arising from the phasing out of 
Industrial Building Allowances in the Finance 
Act 2008.
The Group also continues to recognise the 
deferred tax asset arising from the Pension 
Deficit. As the Pension Deficit has increased 
during the year an increase in the associated 
deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Earnings per share (‘EPS’)
Last year the Group recognised a deferred  
tax asset of £5,101,000 as the Group was,  
and remains, confident of utilising historical 
corporation tax losses as a result of 
foreseeable sustainable future profits.  
The impact of deferred tax in both years has 
been removed in the analysis of adjusted EPS 
discussed below, to enable better comparison 
of the underlying performance of the Group.
The basic and diluted EPS was 2.96p (2008: 
14.49p). The adjusted EPS was 4.97p for the 
current year (2008: 5.44p), and is calculated  
as follows:
 
  2009 2008
  £000 £000
Profit after tax per  
 the accounts  1,622 8,171
Exclude the impact  
 of deferred tax  1,108 (5,101)
Adjusted profit after tax 2,730 3,070
Adjusted EPS  4.97p 5.44p
The number of shares in issue remained 
constant, however, on 1 July 2008 275,000 
shares were purchased and brought into 
Treasury. The weighted average number of 
shares reduced to 54,880,000 for the year 
ended 31 January 2009 from 56,397,000 in  
the year ended 31 January 2008.

Overview
Operating cash flow
The Group generated net cash inflow from 
operating activities during the year of 
£2,830,000 (2008: £3,542,000) reflecting 
higher stock levels as a result of extensive 
brand product launches during the year. 
The Group paid interest of £704,000 (2008: 
£956,000) and capital expenditure of 
£1,687,000 (2008: £1,674,000). Due to the 
timing of actual payments the additions in the 
fixed asset notes were £1,500,000 (2008: 
£1,797,000). The depreciation and 
amortisation charge during the period of 
£1,846,000 (2008: £1,822,000) continue to be 
greater than required capital expenditure.
The Group made additional payments to the 
pension schemes of £1,052,000 (2008: 
£1,059,000) to reduce the deficit, part of the 
ongoing planned reduction, along with 
£275,000 (2008: £231,000) of regular 
contributions to fund scheme expenses. 
The Group purchased 275,000 shares at a 
cost of £83,000 in July 2008.
Net debt in the Group has reduced by 
£1,071,000 to £6,218,000 (2008: £7,289,000).

Net debt : EBITDA  1.1 1.3
Pension deficit
The pension deficit has increased this year. 
The key factors affecting the movement in the 
deficit have been; firstly ongoing contributions 
of £1,327,000 from the Company to reduce 
the deficit; secondly a reduction in the 
liabilities of the scheme arising predominantly 
from the increase in discount rates during the 
year and lastly the significant reduction in 
scheme assets due to the current economic 
climate. The impact of these factors is shown 
as follows:
   2009
   £000
Deficit at beginning of period  (3,409)
Scheme expenses   (275)
Other finance income  196
Contributions   1,327
Actuarial loss on scheme assets  (7,458)
Actuarial gains from the  
 change in discount factor  5,458
Gross deficit at the end of the year (4,161)
Long-Term Incentive Plan
There have not been any further awards 
during the year under the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’). There has been a charge of 
£373,000 (2008: £429,000) in the Income 
Statement for current awards.
Gearing 
The gearing level for the Group fell during the 
year to 31% at 31 January 2009 (2008: 35%). 
Funding
The Group utilises facilities provided by 
Barclays Bank Plc. The facilities were put in 
place on 17 July 2007 replacing previous 
facilities from another provider. There is a 10 
year term property facility of £3,400,000 (2008: 
£3,800,000) at the year end. 
There is also a facility linked to working capital 
which allows the Group to manage its cash 
more effectively during the seasonal 
fluctuations in working capital associated with 
the industry in which the Group operates. This 
facility has an initial three year term. The 
borrowings at the end of the year under this 
facility were £3,868,000 (2008: £5,506,000). 
The available facility at the end of the year was 
£9,373,000 (2008: £10,383,000) of which 
£3,000,000 (2008: £3,000,000) is from a stock 
facility which is effectively permanently 
available due to the level of stocks in the 
Group. The remainder of the working capital 
facility arises from trade debtors and fluctuates 
with the level of trade debtors. The total 
facilities have a current limit of £16.4m. 
All of the Group bank facilities remain secured 
by first fixed and floating charges over the 
Group’s assets. 
Going concern
The Directors are confident, after having made 
appropriate enquiries that the Group and 
Company have adequate resources to 
continue in the foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Treasury policy
The Group’s treasury policy is controlled 
centrally in accordance with procedures 
approved by the Board. It is run prudently as 
a central Group function, providing services to 
the other Group companies and adopts a risk 
averse strategy.
The main risks covered by this policy are 
interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and 
liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group has continued to maintain its debt 
in floating rate instruments in order to benefit 
from the lower rates available and the 
increasing reduction in borrowings. This 
policy remains constantly under review to 
ensure interest cost is minimised. The viability 
of hedging instruments that would limit the 
impact of interest rate movements will 
continue to be reviewed based on the Board’s 
perception of future rate increases and the 
reducing level of borrowings.
Foreign currency risk
All foreign currencies are bought and sold 
centrally on behalf of the Group. Regular 
reviews take place of the foreign currency 
cash flows and unmatched exposures are 
covered by forward contracts wherever 
economically practical.
The Group does not trade in financial 
instruments and hedges are only used for 
anticipated cash flows. There is a hedging 
reserve of £812,000 (2008: £110,000) at the 
end of the year.
The fluctuation in exchange rates during the 
year has benefited the trading at the US 
subsidiary but conversely the strengthening 
euro has impacted negatively at the brands as 
more product is sourced in euro than sold.
Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that it has adequate 
facilities available to cover both its short term 
and medium term commitments. The facility 
available at the end of the year was 
£12,773,000 (2008: £14,183,000) which 
represents an additional borrowing capacity 
of £6,555,000 (2008: £6,894,000).
Credit risk
The Group seeks to obtain credit insurance 
on all its significant overseas customers. 
However, credit insurers have been taking a 
much more conservative position in recent 
months on the level of credit insurance 
provided or the insurance has even been 
removed. The aging profile of trade debtors 
shows that customers do pay to terms or 
soon thereafter. Where credit insurance has 
been removed and the customer has kept to 
terms internal credit limits are set and strictly 
adhered to, otherwise internal credit limits are 
reduced and then strictly adhered to.

Report of the Directors
The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the audited 
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings 
(‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 January 2009.
Principal activities and Business Review
The principal activities of the Group are the design, manufacture, 
marketing and distribution of wallcoverings, furnishing fabrics and 
associated products for the consumer market. A review of activities is 
given in the Chief Executive’s Review, which, taken with the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Financial Review and the other information in the Report 
of the Directors, represents the Group’s Business Review. 
The Directors do not expect there to be any significant change in the 
principal activities of the Group in the foreseeable future.
Group result
The profit before taxation amounted to £2,787,000 (2008: £3,099,000). 
The Directors do not recommend payment of a final ordinary dividend 
(2008: no dividend paid), which leaves a surplus of £1,622,000 to be 
transferred to reserves (2008: £8,171,000).
Key Performance Indicators
The KPIs for the business are primarily financial.
    2009 2008
Sales growth    2% 15%
Operating profit margin before  
exceptional items    5.6% 6.3%
Gearing    31% 35%
Pension deficit as a percentage of  
shareholders’ funds    21% 16%
Adjusted EPS    4.97p 5.44p
Business risks
The Directors have identified a number of financial risks for the Group 
and these are explained and the degree of risk highlighted in note 2 of 
the financial statements and in the Financial Review. Where 
commercially appropriate the Group insures against financial loss 
caused by unforeseen events by the means of insurance policies. 
Apart from the impact of an event of a global nature or a significant 
downturn in the UK market there are no other significant business 
risks. Whilst the trading conditions in North America remain difficult, 
this will affect trading of our business in North America but this 
business is not currently a significant profit contributor to the  
overall Group.
Pensions
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes 
in the UK and overseas for all qualifying employees. Further 
information on the schemes and details of the valuations are given in 
note 22 to the accounts.
Employees
The Group keeps its employees informed on matters affecting them 
and on the progress of the Group by way of informal meetings and 
consultation with employees’ representatives. All Group businesses 
apply the principles of equal opportunity in recruitment, career 
progression and remuneration. Disabled persons are given full and fair 
consideration for employment where an appropriate vacancy occurs, 
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Whenever 
possible, arrangements are made for the continuing employment of 
persons who have become disabled during service and for appropriate 
training of all disabled employees, who are given equal consideration 
with all other employees in promotion and career development.
Payments to suppliers
The Group agrees terms and conditions for its business transactions 
with suppliers and makes payment in accordance with those terms 
and conditions subject to the supplier meeting its obligations. The 
amount of trade creditors shown in the consolidated balance sheet at 
31 January 2009 represents 92 days (2008: 98 days) of average 
purchases during the year for the Group.
The Company is a holding company and has no meaningful equivalent 
of creditor days.
Market value of interests in land including buildings
The Directors do not believe there is a significant difference between 
the current market value of the Group’s interests in land including 
buildings and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Political and charitable donations
The Group has not made any political donations (2008: nil). During the 
year the Group made no charitable donations (2008: nil).
Directors and their interests
The Directors in office at 31 January 2009 and their interests in the 
shares of the Company were as follows:

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and the parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and in 
accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies, and the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). The Group and parent Company 
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; >
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; >
state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as  >
adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the parent 
Company financial statements, that applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the 
Group and parent Company financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. Walker Greenbank PLC

Independent Auditors’ Report 
To the members of Walker Greenbank PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Walker Greenbank 
PLC for the year ended 31 January 2009 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Recognised Income and Expense, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes to the 
Consolidated Accounts. These group financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Walker Greenbank PLC for the year ended 31  
January 2009. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the 
group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, 
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We 
also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the group financial statements. The 
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, and 
the Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business Review 
section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Highlights from 
2009, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the 
Financial Review, the information on Directors and Advisers, the 
Report of the Directors, the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
and all of the other information listed on the contents page. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any  
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the group financial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the 
directors in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we 
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in  >
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the 
state of the group’s affairs as at 31 January 2009 and of its profit 
and cash flows for the year then ended;
the group financial statements have been properly prepared in  >
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the  >
group financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Accounts
1. Accounting policies and general information
General information
Walker Greenbank PLC is a luxury interior furnishings group whose brands include Harlequin, Sanderson, Morris & Co. and Zoffany. The brands 
are targeted at the mid to upper end of the premium market. They have worldwide distribution including prestigious showrooms at Chelsea 
Harbour, London and the D&D building, Manhattan, New York. Half of the brand’s turnover is sourced in-house from the Group’s own specialist 
manufacturing facilities of Standfast & Barracks, the fabric printing business situated in Lancaster, and Anstey Wallpaper Company situated in 
Loughborough. The manufacturing businesses produce for other interior furnishing businesses both in the UK and throughout the world. The 
Company is a public limited company which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange and is registered and 
domiciled in the UK. 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
as modified by the valuation of derivative financial instruments at fair value, on a going concern basis and with the accounting policies set out 
below which have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. 
In preparing these financial statements the Group has applied the IFRS adopted by the European Union and the IFRIC interpretations where the 
effective date is relevant to the financial year commencing on 1 February 2008 or ending 31 January 2009.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in 
note 3.
The financial statements of the Company as an entity continue to be prepared under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
and are presented separately from the consolidated financial statements (pages 53 to 61).
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to  
31 January each year. Subsidiaries are entities where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date on 
which control is transferred to or from the Group, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by 
the Group.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, in exchange for 
control of the acquirer. The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS5 
‘Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration for 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, 
after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquirer’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the 
cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are 
recognised in assets, such as inventory, are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the assets transferred.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position are expressed in sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the balance sheet date. All unhedged exchange 
differences are recognised in the income statement for the period and classified as other operating income or charges.
The assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries on consolidation are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. The income and expenses are translated at the weighted average rate during the period. Differences on translation are recognised in a 
separate foreign currency translation reserve within equity. On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, the cumulative exchange differences for that 
subsidiary are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets – Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration for the acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquired entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised, 
but reviewed for impairment annually, any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On disposal of a subsidiary or cash generating unit the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss  
on disposal. Walker Greenbank PLC

1. Accounting policies and general information continuedd
Intangible assets – Archive 
The Arthur Sanderson and William Morris archive comprises a historic record of unique designs that are used to generate a significant royalty 
income in the business. The archive is valued at a historical cost. The Directors believe that the archive has an indefinite useful life and is therefore 
not subject to amortisation. The carrying value of this asset will be reviewed annually and provision made for any impairment in the carrying value 
if required.
Intangible assets – Software assets
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised at the cost incurred to bring the asset into use, including where relevant directly attributable 
internal costs incurred in preparing the software for operation. The costs are amortised to their estimated residual value over their estimated 
useful life which range from three to six years.
Intangible assets – Collection design
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design of new collections 
are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulfilled:
It is technically feasible to complete the new collection so that it will be available for use or sale. >
Management intends to complete the new collection and use it or sell it. >
There is an ability to use or sell the new collection. >
It can be demonstrated how the new collection will generate probable future economic benefits. >
Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the new collection are available. >
The expenditure attributable to the new collection during its development can be reliably measured. >
Any costs relating to design of new collections that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Any such costs 
recognised as an expense in previous periods are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Capitalised collection design costs are 
recognised as intangible assets and are amortised to their estimated residual value at 25% on a straight-line basis over the life of the asset, and 
are tested for impairment if any impairment trigger events are identified in accordance with IAS 36.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Historical cost 
comprises the purchase price and costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use. The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
annually and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis on the original costs (excluding freehold land) after deduction of any estimated residual value. The 
principal annual rates are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold improvements Over the length of the lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles  Between 5% and 33%
Computer assets 33%
Government grants received for property, plant and equipment are classified within the cost of property, plant and equipment and released to the 
income statement over the life of the asset. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairments if events or changes in circumstances 
(assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is conducted, the 
recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the value in use (net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant 
cash generating unit), or the fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually. 
If a cash generating unit is impaired, provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the related assets to their estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are allocated firstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro rata basis against intangible and other assets.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, on a first-in, first-out basis, and direct labour, 
plus attributable production overheads based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less 
anticipated costs of disposal. Provision is made for any slow moving and obsolete inventory.

Marketing materials
Marketing materials consist of patterning books and other marketing assets that will be used to support the sale of the Group’s products. They 
are recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials plus costs of production. Net realisable value is 
based on estimated recoveries less anticipated costs of disposals. An impairment allowance is made for any slow moving and obsolete marketing 
materials. The Group’s policy is to classify marketing materials on the balance sheet within trade and other receivables. 
Financial assets and liabilities – measurement basis
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument 
giving rise to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Any impairment of a 
financial asset is charged to the consolidated income statement when incurred. Financial assets are derecognised when the Group’s rights to 
cash inflows from the asset expire: financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified according to the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Group’s financial assets are 
classified as either:
‘trade and other receivables’ – these are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active  >
market. They arise when the Group provides goods directly to a debtor, or advances money, with no intention of trading the loan or receivable. 
Subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less any amounts written off to reflect impairment, with changes in carrying amount recognised in the consolidated income statement within 
administrative expenses. 
‘cash and cash equivalents’ – these comprise of deposits with an original maturity of three months or less with banks and financial institutions,  >
bank balances, bank overdrafts and cash in hand.
A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be 
impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the net present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of provision account, and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off 
against the provision account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against administrative 
expenses in the income statement.
The Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘Other liabilities’. ‘Other liabilities’ are financial liabilities with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group receives goods or services directly from a creditor or supplier, or 
borrows money, with no intention of trading the liability. This category includes:
‘trade and other payables’ – these are typically non-interest bearing and following initial recognition are included in the balance sheet at  >
amortised cost;
‘bank loans and overdrafts’ – these are initially recorded at fair value based on proceeds received net of issue costs. Finance charges are  >
accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method;
‘borrowings’ – these are recorded initially at the fair value, net of direct issue costs, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Finance  >
charges, including premiums payable on settlement, or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the 
income statement, using the effective interest method, and are included within the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group does not have any non-derivative financial assets or liabilities classified as ‘at fair value through profit and loss’.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting – measurement basis 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in exchange rates, and the Group uses forward exchange rate contracts to 
manage these exposures. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, 
which provide written principles on the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedge items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’. Amounts accumulated in equity are released to the income statement 
when the hedged item effects the income statement. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are classified as ‘financial assets or liabilities at fair value through the profit or 
loss’. They are initially recognised at fair value, with fair value being remeasured at each reporting date. The fair value of the derivative is based on 
market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are included in the consolidated income statement within 
finance costs.  Walker Greenbank PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009

1. Accounting policies and general information continuedd
The Group has no embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent only liquid assets with original maturity of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, 
deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts that cannot be offset against other cash balances are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement it is the Group’s policy to classify interest income and expense, and other finance costs, within ‘cash 
flows from operating activities’. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is considered material.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All 
other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in property, plant and equipment and the resulting lease 
obligations are included in liabilities. The assets are depreciated over their useful lives and the interest element of the rental obligations is charged to 
the income statement over the period of the lease, and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Rent free periods receivable on 
entering an operating lease are released on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Employee benefits – Pension obligations 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the funding of benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with full actuarial valuations 
being carried out triennially.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income statement and 
presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Scheme expenses met by the Group, expected returns on plan assets, and interest on pension scheme liabilities are classified within ‘Net defined 
benefit pension costs’ on the consolidated income statement. 
Employee benefits – share based payments under long term incentive plans (LTIP)
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and recognised as an 
expense in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair values of these payments are measured at the dates of grant, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards are granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which 
employees become conditionally entitled to the awards, subject to the Group’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to 
employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based performance conditions not being met. The total amount recognised in 
the income statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest.
Employee benefits – short-term bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of 
tax, from the proceeds.

Treasury shares
Consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) on the purchase of the Company’s equity share 
capital (treasury shares) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where 
such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity shareholders.
Revenue
The Group revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts recoverable by the Group for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Revenue comprises:
Sale of goods – sales of goods are recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership,  >
which is usually at the point of delivery of the goods.
Royalty revenue – royalties are received from licence holders under the terms of various agreements, and are recognised on an accruals basis  >
in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
Exceptional items
Items that are both material and whose nature is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure and identification are disclosed within the financial 
statements and classified within their relevant income statement category. 
Taxation including deferred tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charges or credits. 
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profits differs from the net profit as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance  
sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that effects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
IAS 12 Income taxes requires that the measurement of deferred tax should have regard to the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner of expected recovery or settlement at the balance sheet date of the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. In calculating its deferred 
tax liability the Group’s policy is to regard the depreciable amount of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment to be recovered 
through continuing use in the business, unless included within assets held for resale, where the policy is to regard the carrying amount as being 
recoverable through sale.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Segmental reporting
Walker Greenbank is a designer, manufacturer and distributor of furnishings, fabrics and wallpaper. The Group predominantly manages its 
operations as two business segments which are the brands and manufacturing. 
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are 
different to those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products and services within a particular economic 
environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Interest received
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. Walker Greenbank PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009

2. Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate 
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to 
hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out at Board level under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Executive Directors identify, evaluate and 
hedge financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the 
US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a 
currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.
The Group’s policy is, where possible to allow the Group entities to settle liabilities in their functional currency with the cash generated from their 
operations in that currency. Where the Group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency (and have 
insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them) cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible be transferred from elsewhere 
in the Group.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising on future transactions, it is the Group’s policy to enter into forward currency contracts to hedge  
the exposure.
 
For the year ended 31 January 2009, the average sterling to US dollar translation rate applied by the Group including the impact of hedging 
contracts was £1:US $2.06. If the rate had been £1:US $1.96 lower with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been higher 
by £127,000. If the rate had been £1:US $2.16 higher with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been lower  
by £115,000. 
For the year ended 31 January 2009, the average sterling to euro translation rate applied by the Group was £1:euro 1.24. If the rate had been 
£1:euro 1.14 lower with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been lower by £381,000. If the rate had been £1:euro 1.34 
higher with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been higher by £324,000. 
The sensitivity of movements in other currencies is not considered material to the performance of the Group. 
Interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest bearing assets its revenue and cash generated from operations are substantially independent of changes 
in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate 
risk. The Group’s borrowings at variable rate are denominated in UK pounds or euros. The Group regularly analyses its interest rate exposure 
calculating the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. Based on the calculations the Board consider refinancing, renewal of 
existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. 
In July 2007 the Group entered into a new financing contract with Barclays Bank PLC, variable interest rates were negotiated on all the loans. The 
Board continues to monitor the interest rates monthly.
For the year ended 31 January 2009, had benchmark interest rate levels been 0.5% higher/lower than actual experience, with all other variables 
held constant, the profit before tax of the Group would have been lower/higher by £62,000 due to the change in interest rate expense on variable 
rate borrowings. 
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the Group’s trade receivables, cash held with banks, and derivative financial instruments. It is the risk that the counterparty 
fails to discharge its obligation in respect of the instrument.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single company or group of companies, as the nature of the Group’s 
operations mean that trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. 
Prior to accepting new customers an independent credit check is obtained. Based on this information individual credit limits and payment terms 
are established and where appropriate credit guarantee insurance cover is sought. If no independent credit ratings are available, customers are 
asked to pay on a proforma basis until creditworthiness can be established. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. Credit limits may 
only be exceeded with the authorisation from key management, this is dependent on the amount expected to exceed the limit and the Group’s 
trading history with that customer.
There is no difference between the carrying amount and the maximum credit risk exposure.

2. Financial risk management continued
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments. It 
is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. The maturity profile of the Group’s debt and 
other financial liabilities is disclosed in note 21.
During the year the Group had facilities with Barclays Bank PLC. A significant element of the facility is linked to working capital, which allows the 
Group to manage its cash more effectively during the seasonal fluctuations in working capital associated with the industry. This element of the 
facility is due to expire in July 2010.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash and loan facility on a monthly basis. The Group ensures that it has adequate facilities 
available to cover both its short-term and medium-term commitments. In addition, the Group’s liquidity management policy is to project cash 
flows in major currencies and consider the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
 
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
to safeguard the entities ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other  >
stakeholders; and
to provide an adequate return for shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. >
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, or sell 
assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the average net debt to adjusted capital ratio (or ‘gearing ratio’). The ratio is calculated as average net 
debt divided by adjusted capital. Average net debt is calculated as the total debt less cash and cash equivalents during the year. Adjusted capital 
comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, retained earnings, and other reserves) other than amounts recognised in 
equity relating to cash flow hedges and forward currency contracts.
During the year to 31 January 2009, the Group’s strategy, which was unchanged from the previous year, was to reduce the average gearing ratio. 
The average gearing ratios for 2009 and 2008 were as follows:
       31 January 31 January 
        2009 2008 
Year ended       £000 £000
Average net debt        11,233 10,777
  
Total equity       19,911 20,799
  
Less: amounts recognised in equity relating to currency contracts      812 110
  
Adjusted capital       20,723 20,909
  
Average net debt to adjusted capital ratio       54% 52%
Year end net debt to adjusted capital ratio       31% 35%
The Group considers the average debt to adjusted equity ratio to be too high currently, and will continue to reduce debt and the pension deficit by 
cash generated from operations until the ratio is at a level considered appropriate.
The gearing ratio at the year end is lower than the average gearing ratio as the level of trade debtors is lower at the year end than the average 
during the year due to the seasonal nature of trading in the months of December and January.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date provided by 
relationship banks.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate their 
fair values.  Walker Greenbank PLC

3. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future events. The resulting accounting estimates will seldom precisely equal the 
related actual results. The Group applies its best endeavours in setting accounting estimates, and uses historical experience and other factors, 
including input from experienced and specialist management. Estimates and assumptions are continually re-evaluated and the resulting 
accounting balances updated as new information including actual outcomes become apparent. 
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below. 
a) Retirement benefit obligations
The Group recognises its obligations to employee retirement benefits. The quantification of these obligations is subject to significant estimates 
and assumptions regarding life expectancy, discount and inflation rates, wage and salary changes, the rate of increase in pension payments, and 
the market values of equities, bonds and other pension assets. In making these assumptions the Group takes advice from a qualified actuary 
about which assumptions reflect the nature of the Group’s obligations to employee retirement benefits. The assumptions are regularly reviewed to 
ensure their appropriateness. 
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present 
value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the 
Group considers the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and 
that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Details of the estimates and assumptions applied, and carrying 
amounts of retirement benefit obligations and pension assets, are set out in note 22.
b) Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill or its indefinite life intangible asset has suffered any impairment, in accordance with its accounting 
policy. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value in use (VIU) calculations. These calculations 
require use of estimates of future sales, margins, and other operating and administrative expenses, and of discount rates. Further disclosures 
relating to the estimates and assumptions applied, and carrying amounts of the non-financial assets, are set out in note 13.
The Group makes provision for impairment in the carrying amount of its inventories and marketing materials. The nature of the Group’s products 
are exposed to changes in taste and attitudes from time to time, which can affect the demand for those products. The Group has skilled and 
experienced management who utilise historical sales information, and exercise their judgement, in making estimates about the extent of 
provisions necessary based on the realisable value of inventory and expected future benefit to the Group of marketing materials taking into 
account the estimated price and volume of future sales or usage less the further costs of sale and holding costs. Further disclosures relating to 
the effect on the income statement of the establishment and reversal of such provisions against inventory are included in note 6. Details of the 
carrying amount of marketing materials is disclosed in note 16 and of inventories in note 17. 
c) Deferred tax recognition
Following the completion of the Group’s recovery programme and return to sustained profitability over recent years, the Group has considered it 
appropriate to recognise at the balance sheet date deferred tax assets resulting from historical trading losses. The amount of deferred tax 
recognised is based on estimates of the timing and amount of future taxable profits of companies within the Group, which in turn relies upon 
estimates of future operating profits and the occurrence, timing and tax treatment of significant items of income and expenditure including 
contributions to pension schemes and the vesting of share based payment awards. Further disclosures relating to the effect on the income 
statement of the recognition of deferred tax assets are included in note 11, and the amount of deferred tax asset recognised and other relevant 
disclosures are included in note 15. 
d) Share based payment awards
The Group has granted awards to Executive Directors and Senior Management which include vesting conditions relating to the future financial 
performance of the Group as measured by Profit before tax (PBT). The number of awards that will ultimately vest, if any, varies based on the PBT 
achieved by the Group in the years ending 31 January 2009 and 2011 and the continued employment of award recipients. The PBT target for the 
year ending 31 January 2009 has been achieved. The fair value of the awards granted is charged against the income statement over the vesting 
period; the amount of that charge is dependent upon the Group’s estimates of how many awards will ultimately vest, which is linked directly to its 
estimates regarding future PBT achievement. Further disclosures relating to the effect on the financial statements of share awards is included in 
note 24.

Factors affecting current and future tax charges
The Finance Bill 2008 announced the phasing out of the relief for Industrial Building Allowances by 31 March 2011. An additional deferred tax 
liability of £320,000 has been recognised as a consequence, and is classified as an exceptional item. 
The deferred tax credit of £5.1 million in 2008 arose from the recognition of deferred tax losses incurred by the Group in prior years and 
temporary differences. Because of the nature and size of this item it was disclosed as an exceptional item.
Following the recognition of deferred tax assets arising from losses and temporary differences the future effective tax rate will be influenced by 
changes in deferred tax positions.
The Group does not anticipate that UK corporation tax will become payable on profits within the immediate future due to the availability of tax 
losses of approximately £21.3 million.
 
12. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number  
of shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust (note 24) and those held in treasury, which are treated  
as cancelled. 
Adjusted earnings per share is also presented as, in the opinion of the Directors, this provides additional information to shareholders on the 
results of the Group’s activities. Adjusted earnings per share has been calculated to remove any charge or credit arising from deferred tax in the 
current and comparative periods. The impact on after tax profit of deferred tax during these periods has been significant, and varies from an 
exceptional credit of £5,101,000 in the comparative year following the first time recognition of historical corporation tax losses, to a charge for the 
current year of £1,108,000, including an exceptional charge of £320,000 (refer note 11), as the corporation tax losses are utilised and the impact of 
the removal of IBA’s in the 2008 Finance Act takes effect. In the opinion of the Directors, the exclusion of the deferred tax charges or credits 
creates a more comparable earnings base on which to assess the performance of the Group.

Impairment tests for goodwill and Arthur Sanderson and William Morris Archive

13. Intangible Assets continued
The Group tests goodwill and the Archive for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. There 
was no impairment charge recognised in the year (2008: none). 
In assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is required the carrying value of the cash generative unit (‘CGU’) or group of CGUs is compared 
with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount for each CGU and collectively for groups of CGUs that make up the segments of the 
Group’s business have been based on the value in use (‘VIU’). 
The Group estimates the VIU using a discounted cashflow model (‘DCF’), where the projected cash flows for separate or collective groups of 
CGUs are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 9.50% (2008: 8.48%). The discount rate used is the same across all segments.
The Group has used formally approved budgets for the first two years (2008: one year) of its VIU calculation, with extrapolation beyond the last 
explicit year using an assumption of growth for future years ranging from 1% to 2% (2008: no growth) depending upon the CGU being tested. The 
cash flows used in the calculation of the VIU are derived from past experience and are based on operating profit forecasts, which in turn rely upon 
assumptions relating to sales growth, margins and operating and administrative expenses. The cash flows have not included the benefits arising 
from any future asset enhancement expenditure, as this is not permitted by IAS 36. The VIU calculations therefore exclude significant benefits 
anticipated from future capital expenditure. The growth rates included within the assumptions supporting the VIU calculations do not therefore 
represent the Group’s anticipated total forecast growth, but rather only the growth deriving from capital expenditure completed at the balance 
sheet date.
The recoverable amount of the Archive intangible asset is estimated based on VIU, and comprises estimated future cash flows from royalty 
income relating to the Archive. A discount rate of 9.50% (2008: 8.48%) is applied.
The Group does not consider there to be reasonably probable changes to the key assumptions that would result in impairment of either goodwill 
or the Archive as at 31 January 2009.

A deferred tax asset of £5,158,000 (2008: £6,055,000) is recognised in respect of tax losses and other timing differences and £1,108,000 has 
been charged to the income statement during the year as some of the tax losses have utilised and Industrial Buildings Allowances were phased 
out in the Finance Act 2008.

The movements in the deferred tax asset on pension scheme obligations are recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of £21.3 million (2008: £23.7 million) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred asset is recognised in respect of £17.7 million (2008: £20.5 million) of such losses as the Group believes that realisation of the related tax 
benefit through future taxable profit is probable and can be readily accessed under existing tax legislation. No deferred tax has been recognised 
on the remaining £3.6 million (2008: £3.2 million) as these losses are not readily available for offset against the Group’s future profits under 
existing tax legislation and therefore the realisation of these losses is not considered probable. The recognition of deferred tax on losses will be 
assessed at each reporting date.
Potential deferred tax assets at 31 January 2009 of £1,269,000 (2008: £1,068,000) relating to tax losses and deductible temporary differences 
have not been recognised as it is not considered probable that recovery of the potential deferred tax asset will arise under existing tax legislation.

The value of trade receivables providing funding under the Barclays facility was £6,721,000 (2008: £7,621,000).
There is no material difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the trade and other receivables. 
Credit quality of financial assets
(i) Neither past due nor impaired
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balances are debtors with a carrying value of £4,849,000 (2008: £7,058,000) which are neither past due 
nor impaired at the reporting date. The nature of the Group’s business means that it has a long standing relationship with the majority of its 
customers, who either have no experience of historical default or only temporary late payments with full recovery of balances due. 
For the Group’s cash at bank, and the receivable leg of derivative financial instruments, the counterparty to the financial instruments is a major UK 
bank, and the Group does not consider there to be any significant credit risk from holding these financial assets. 
(ii) Past due – not impaired
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balances are debtors with a carrying value of £3,561,000 (2008: £2,930,000) which are past due at the 
reporting date for which the Group does not consider the receivable to be impaired as there has not been a significant decline in credit quality 
and the Group believes that the amounts are still fully recoverable. The table below shows the aging analysis of the receivables:
       2009 2008 
       £000 £000

91+ days past due       79 –
       3,561 2,930
(iii) Past due – impaired
As at 31 January 2009, trade receivables of £643,000 (2008: £415,000) were individually determined to be impaired and provided for. The amount 
of the provision was £281,000 (2008: £186,000). The main factors used to assess the impairment of trade receivables is the age of the balance 
and circumstances of the individual customer. It has been assessed that a proportion of the receivables is expected to be recovered. The 
Directors believe that in the current economic environment there is objective evidence of credit deterioration and an impairment of £142,000 
representing a collective assessment of risk has been made. Due to the nature of Group’s products, there is limited amount of stock left in the 
possession of customers that could act as collateral under terms of trade. As the value of this stock is immaterial, it has not been disclosed in the 
financial statements.

The Group considers that any exposure to concentrations of credit risk will be impacted principally by underlying economic conditions in the 
principal geographical segments in which the Group operates. As at the balance sheet date the carrying value of trade receivables by 
geographical segment was:
       2009 2008 
       £000 £000
United Kingdom        5,284 6,625

Forward foreign exchange contracts – cash flow hedges       (812) (110)
Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group’s US based subsidiary, Walker Greenbank Inc., sells products to local customers with sales invoiced in US dollars. As the Group’s 
presentation currency is sterling it is exposed to changes in the reported sterling value of these sales. The Group considers that it is highly 
probable that future sales of this nature will continue to arise over at least the next 12 months. During the year Walker Greenbank PLC has 
entered into monthly forward foreign exchange contracts up to January 2010, with a third party, to buy sterling and sell dollars. The Group has 
designated these contracts as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency risk arising from the highly probable future forecast sales transactions. As 
at the reporting date the fair value of the forward foreign contracts deferred in the hedging reserve relating to the exposure on these anticipated 
future transactions is a liability of £820,000 (2008: £110,000). The amounts deferred in equity will be released into the income statement in the 
period or periods during which the hedged forecast transactions effect the income statement, which is expected to be within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date. 
The brands make more purchases from the euro zone than sales made to the euro zone. As the Group’s presentation currency is sterling it is 
exposed to changes in the reported sterling value of the purchases. The Group considers that it is highly probable that future purchases of this 
nature will continue to arise over at least the next 12 months. During the second half of the year Walker Greenbank PLC has entered into monthly 
forward foreign exchange contracts up to December 2009, with a third party, to buy euros and sell sterling. The Group has designated these 
contracts as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency risk arising from the highly probable future forecast purchase transactions. As at the 
reporting date the fair value of the forward foreign contracts deferred in the hedging reserve relating to the exposure on these anticipated future 
transactions is an asset of £8,100 (2008: £nil). The amounts deferred in equity will be released into the income statement in the period or periods 
during which the hedged forecast transactions effect the income statement, which is expected to be within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

Total borrowings       7,268 9,306
In July 2007, the Group agreed terms for new facilities from Barclays Bank PLC replacing the Burdale Financial Limited funding. The facilities 
comprises: a variable rate Term Loan secured on the Group’s freehold property of £4 million which is being repaid on a 10 year profile, and 
Receivables and Inventory Financing Agreements which provide three year variable rate floating loans secured on the eligible trade receivables 
and eligible inventories at any point in time (the working capital facilities). The working capital facilities may be drawn down in either sterling or 
euros. The total Barclays loan facility is capped at £17 million; the utilisation of the facility at the year end was £7,268,000 (2008: £9,306,000). The 
term loan bears interest at variable rates based on a margin above the Bank of England base rate. The working capital facilities bear finance costs 
in the form of discount charges which are calculated periodically and vary at margins above the base rate published by Bank of England (for 
sterling loans) or the European Central Bank (for euro loans).

21. Borrowings continued
Under the Barclays Bank PLC facilities, the Group is subject to various financial covenants which apply to the term loan, including interest cover 
and debt service. The receivables and inventory financing agreements require compliance with a number of operational covenants. Any non-
compliance with covenants could, if not remedied or waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements. The Group 
has reported to its financiers that it was in full compliance with its financial and operational covenants throughout each of the periods presented. 
The fair value of current borrowings equal their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant. The carrying amounts and fair 
value of the non-current borrowings are as follows:
   Carrying amount  Fair value
  
     2009 2008 2009 2008

Defined contribution schemes
The Group contributes to the defined contribution section of the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme and to a Group Personal Pension Plan 
which is also a defined contribution scheme. Contributions are charged to the income statement as incurred, and amounted to £404,000 (2008: 
£437,000). Active members of the schemes are also able to make contributions. 
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates the following funded defined benefit pension schemes in the UK which offer pensions on retirement and death benefits to 
members: the Walker Greenbank Pension Plan, the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme and the WG Senior Management Pension Scheme. 
Pension benefits are related to the members’ salary at retirement and their length of service. The schemes are closed to new members and the 
future accrual of benefits. The most recent triennial funding valuation for the defined benefit schemes was April 2006. An updated valuation for 
IAS 19 financial reporting purposes has been completed at the balance sheet date. The Group’s contributions to the schemes for the year 
beginning 1 February 2009 are expected to be £1,342,000.  Walker Greenbank PLC

22. Retirement benefit obligations continued
The principal assumptions applied when valuing the defined benefit schemes were:
       2009 2008
Discount rate       6.90% 6.10%
Rate of salary increase       3.20% 3.40%
Rate of increase to LPI pensions in payment       3.20% 3.40%
Rate of increase to pensions (in excess of GMP) in deferment      3.20% 3.40%
Rate of inflation       3.20% 3.40%
Expected return on plan assets       6.60% 7.00%
Members are assumed to commute 25% of their pension (2008: 25%). 
The assumptions used in determining the overall expected return on assets of the scheme have been set with reference to yields available on 
government bonds and appropriate risk margins for equities and other classes of assets.
The mortality assumptions applied are based on the PA92 year of birth with medium cohort tables (2008: PA92 with medium cohort tables). The

24. Share Capital continued
The shares held by the trust and the treasury shares are held for the purpose of satisfying awards under long term incentive plans to Executive 
Directors and senior management. 
Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)
The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan. At the balance sheet date two awards had been previously granted under this plan, in which 
Executive Directors and senior management of the Group participate. The LTIP has previously been approved by the shareholders at an Annual 
General Meeting. 
Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced share options, and are to be satisfied either using market-purchased shares or by 
the issuing of new shares. The awards vest in full or in part dependent on the satisfaction of specified performance targets at the end of the 
vesting period applying to each plan. The number of award that vest is dependent upon the profit before tax (‘PBT’) achieved for the relevant year. 
As the awards carry a nil-value exercise price, the grant date fair value corresponds to the share price of the Group on the grant date. Details are 
set out below:
     Award One Award Two
Grant date of awards     25 July 2007 24 May 2008
Grant date fair value of award (pence per award)     26.75 53.00
Vesting date of awards     25 July 2009 24 May 2011
Maximum number of awards     2,549,000 1,415,093
Relevant year ending date for determination of PBT     31 January 2009 31 January 2011
Based on the performance of the Group for the year ended 31 January 2009 the Award One awards have satisfied the PBT vesting condition in 
full, and are expected to vest on 25 July 2009. 
Movements during the year in the number of awards outstanding, assuming maximum achievement of PBT targets, are as follows:
       2009 2008

Notes to the Accounts
1. Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention. They have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, with the Companies Act 1985, 
and with the accounting policies set out below which have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. 
Profit and loss account
No profit and loss account is presented for Walker Greenbank PLC (‘the Company‘) as it has applied the exemption provided by Section 230 of 
the Companies Act 1985. A loss of £4,103,000 (2008: profit £275,000) has been dealt with in the accounts of the parent company.
Consolidation
These financial statements present information relating to the entity Walker Greenbank PLC, and are not consolidated. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Group of which the Company is the parent are separately presented within this Annual Report and Accounts under IFRS. 
Fixed assets
Depreciation is charged on tangible fixed assets (excluding freehold land) on a straight-line basis on the original cost after deduction of any 
estimated residual value. The principal annual rates are:
Freehold buildings 2% 
Short leasehold improvements Over the unexpired period of the lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles Between 5% and 33%
Computer assets Between 12.5% and 33% 
Land and buildings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets and investments
Fixed assets and investments are subject to review for impairment in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.11. Where impairment 
triggers are identified the recoverable amount of the relevant asset, or group of assets within an income generating unit, is determined, being the 
higher of value in use and net realisable value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is 
calculated. Any impairment is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year in which it occurs. Where impairments have been identified in 
prior years and recoverable amount was based on value in use, an updated discounted cash flow is prepared annually to assess whether the 
previous impairment in value has reversed. When all conditions are met, the impairment is reversed and recognised in the profit and loss in the 
year in which the reversal occurs.
Financial instruments
The Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market regulated by The London Stock Exchange. It is not required to adopt FRS26 
‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’ or FRS29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ in these financial statements, and has not elected to 
voluntarily do so. 
The Company continues to adopt the amortised cost basis of accounting for financial instruments, and had not elected to voluntarily apply fair 
value measurements of financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments. 
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling at the date of transaction. All differences are taken to the profit and loss 
account. Further disclosure of the Group’s financial risk management policies is included in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group which are separately presented from these Company accounts. 
Employee share ownership plan (‘ESOP’)
Where the Company’s issued share capital is acquired by an ESOP trust sponsored by the Company the cost of acquisition is deducted from 
profit and loss reserves in accordance with UITF Abstract 38. 
 
Employee benefits – share based payments under Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP)
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not 
vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and are recognised as an 
expense in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair values of these payments are measured at the dates of grant, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards are granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which 
employees become conditionally entitled to the awards, subject to the Group’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to 
employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based performance conditions not being met. The total amount recognised in 
the income statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest. Walker Greenbank PLC

1. Accounting policies continued
The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 44 ‘FRS20 – Group and treasury shares’. The adoption of UITF 44 has resulted in restatement of 
comparative financial statements, with the portion of the fair value of awards granted to employees providing services to the Company’s 
subsidiary companies being recognised as an additional investment in those subsidiaries, and not as an expense of the Company. This has been 
applied retrospectively and has resulted in restatement of profit and loss account for year ended 31 January 2008 (note 12). 
Employee benefits – pensions
The Walker Greenbank Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. Further 
details of these schemes are included in note 22 of the consolidated financial statements of the Group presented within the Annual Report and 
Accounts. Defined benefit pension schemes are now accounted for within the separate Financial Statements of Group’s trading subsidiary,  
Abaris Holdings Limited. The parent company recognises contributions to defined contribution schemes in respect of its employees as expenses 
when incurred.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of 
tax, from the proceeds.
Treasury shares
Consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) on the purchase of the Company’s equity share 
capital (treasury shares) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where 
such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity shareholders.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and that give rise 
to an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future. Deferred tax is calculated using the average rates that are expected to 
apply when the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates that have been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. No provision has 
been made for any liability arising from the distribution of past earnings of subsidiary undertakings. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when 
it is more likely than not that they will be recovered in the foreseeable future. 
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Company. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets used by the Company which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in tangible fixed assets and the resulting lease 
obligations are included in liabilities. The assets are depreciated over their useful lives and the interest element of the rental obligations is charged to 
the profit and loss account over the period of the lease, and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Rent free periods 
receivable on entering an operating lease are released on a straight-line basis to the next break point in the lease. 
Related party
The Company has applied the exemption available in FRS 8 and has decided not to disclose transactions with wholly owned subsidiary undertakings.

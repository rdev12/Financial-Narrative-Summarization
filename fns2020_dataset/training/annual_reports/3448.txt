CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE
Chloride has again delivered very strong growth in sales, proﬁts and orders.
This momentum was underpinned by our focus on buoyant market sectors
including IT services, energy and oil & gas, where we grew well ahead of the
market. We continued to grow strongly in our main European market where
our total solutions approach is welcomed by our customers and provides
real competitive advantage. Good progress was made in Asia Paciﬁc and
the Middle East where we continue to invest in these attractive markets.
Our strategic positioning as a provider of secure power solutions reinforces
our pace of growth, as blue-chip customers across the globe recognise that
power quality is critical to their business continuity.
In December 2007 the Company entered the FTSE 250 Index, reﬂecting the
strong growth in its market value.
KEY FINANCIALS
Total sales increased by 31% to £267 .6 million
(2007: £204.4 million), with product sales up
33% at £182.8 million and service revenue
up 26% at £84.8 million. Adjusted operating
proﬁt increased by 54% to £36.1 million (2007:
£23.5 million), reﬂecting the strong operational
gearing of our business model. The operating
margin increased by 2 points to 13.5% – the
sixth successive year of increase.
Adjusted proﬁt before tax increased by 54%
to £33.3 million (2007: £21 .7 million), generating
adjusted earnings per share of 9.51p
(2007: 6.63p), an increase of 43%. Basic
earnings per share was 9.99p (2007: 6.38p).
Operating cash ﬂow was £30.0 million (2007:
£24.3 million), representing 83% of adjusted
operating proﬁt, after accommodating the
increase in working capital to support the
strong growth in sales and orders.
Net debt for the year was ﬂat at £21 .8 million
(2007: £21 .3 million) after capital expenditure,
payment of dividends, acquisitions, tax,
interest and the purchase of own shares
by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust, all of which
totalled £35.1 million.
Tax provisions of £2.9 million were released
during the year. These related to potential
taxation risks on businesses divested in 2001 the
provisions for which were no longer required.
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
We made a number of strategic investments
to improve and expand our capabilities,
focusing on attractive geographic and
market sectors. In Europe, our core market,
Masterpower Electronics Limited acquired
in March 2007 , met expectations and now
provides a platform to extend our business
in the UK oil & gas and energy sectors. We
acquired AST Services Electronique SARL,
to expand our multi-vendor service capabilities
in France and, towards the end of the year,
we took a minority stake in Eltek UPS to
introduce the Chloride brand to Scandinavia.
In addition, Chloride Rus was formed with our
long-standing partners in Russia where we
already have a number of blue-chip customers
in the ﬁnancial services and oil & gas sectors.
The high-growth
characteristics of our
main market sectors are
underpinned by robust
long-term market drivers ANNUAL REPORT 2008 5
Since Keith was appointed Chief Executive in
1992, the Company has been transformed into
a focused secure power solutions company,
with leading positions in high-growth markets
worldwide. We have developed a clear strategy
for growth and progressively invested in
people and resources to support our strategic
development. My fellow directors and I are
very grateful to Keith for his leadership and
clear vision throughout this exciting period.
Keith will be succeeded as Chief Executive by
Tim Cobbold, who joined the Board as Chief
Operating Ofﬁcer in June 2007 . Tim joined
Chloride from Smiths Group, where he held
a number of senior appointments notably
in the John Crane division. We are conﬁdent
that under Tim’s leadership, and with our
proven strategy for growth, Chloride will
prosper further.
I am pleased to welcome Paul Lester, who
joined the Board as a non-executive director
in September. Paul is Chief Executive of
VT Group and the Board will beneﬁt from his
wealth of industrial experience, particularly
in service delivery and facilities management.
Robin Southwell, who has been a non-executive
director since 2002, will retire from the Board
at the AGM in July, and I greatly appreciate his
support over the last six years. Gary Bullard
will take over Chairmanship of the Remuneration
Committee on Robin’s retirement.
PEOPLE
Our people are crucial to Chloride’s success
and on behalf of the Board I would like to
thank them for another year of exceptional
progress. Our commitment to training
is demonstrated through the continued
investment in the Chloride Academy, and I
am pleased to report that in its ﬁrst year of
operation 130 of our employees successfully
passed residential and distance-learning
courses run by the Academy.
A WELL-POSITIONED BUSINESS
Chloride has established an international
reputation for providing market-leading power
protection solutions. We continue to make
excellent progress in our major European
market, and our expansion in Asia Paciﬁc and
the Middle East is gathering momentum as
we continue to strengthen our infrastructure
and market presence.
The high-growth characteristics of our main
market sectors are underpinned by robust
long-term market drivers. In particular, energy
shortages and rising oil prices will continue
to attract high levels of capital investment into
these sectors. We are conﬁdent that through
the consistent application of our proven
strategy and ongoing enhancement of our
solutions offering we are well positioned
to deliver continued high returns on capital,
strong earnings growth and excellent cash
generation over the long term.
CURRENT TRADING
We entered the new ﬁnancial year with
a record order book reﬂecting order intake
consistently ahead of sales. This positive trend
has continued into the ﬁrst two months of
the current year, with sales, operating proﬁt
and operating margin well ahead of last year
and in line with management’s expectations.
Product and service orders have again
increased and we ended May with a yet
stronger order book, supporting the Board’s
conﬁdence in the outlook for the year.
Norman Broadhurst
In Asia Paciﬁc we acquired Ascor Power
Systems Pte Limited, Singapore and quickly
invested in new facilities in Singapore to
establish Chloride South East Asia as our
regional centre for sales, technical support
and training in the region. We also increased
our shareholding in DB Power Electronics,
India to 32%. This business is exceeding
expectations and provides access to
international and domestic customers
for Chloride’s large systems in the Indian
IT services, ﬁnance and oil & gas sectors.
We took an important strategic step in the
management of our supply chain, with the
completion of a manufacturing joint venture
with Phoenixtec Power Company, Taiwan.
Production of large systems to Chloride
speciﬁcations has now commenced in a new
facility in Shenzhen China, and we expect
important beneﬁts to come through towards
the end of the current ﬁnancial year, as the
facility approaches full production.
We continue to look for suitable acquisition
opportunities which will add long-term
shareholder value.
DIVIDEND
The Board is pleased to propose a ﬁnal
dividend of 2.40p per share (2007: 1 .70p),
reﬂecting our continued conﬁdence in the
Company’s future prospects. Together with
the interim dividend of 1 .60p, this gives a
dividend for the year of 4.00p – an increase
of 33% on the prior year. Subject to
shareholders’ approval at the Annual General
Meeting (AGM) the ﬁnal dividend will be paid
on 4 August 2008 to shareholders on the
register at close of business on 11 July 2008.
BOARD
In March we announced that Keith Hodgkinson
will be retiring from the Board at our AGM in
July and will continue in an advisory capacity
until November 2008.
We have developed a clear
strategy for accelerated
growth and progressively
invested in people and
resources to support our
strategic development 6 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
A PROVEN
STRATEGY
Chloride is uniquely positioned as a focused provider of high-quality secure power
solutions. We have a proven strategy to build sustainable competitive advantage
and accelerate growth through:
 focusing on geographies and market sectors which exhibit long-term growth
characteristics;
 investing in people, technology and services to align our capabilities closely
with our chosen geographic markets and sectors; and
 continual improvement of our robust and cash-generative business model.
Through the consistent execution of our
strategy we are market leaders in our largest
market, Western Europe. We were proud
to be named European UPS Company of
the Year 2007 by the leading independent
market research company Frost & Sullivan,
in recognition of the exceptional growth
in all areas of our European business.
By applying this strategic framework to
developing international markets and sectors
we are winning business and building
platforms for further growth in dynamic
markets across the world.
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH MARKETS
In 2007 the world market for UPS products
grew for the ﬁfth year in succession. Frost &
Sullivan estimated market growth of 13%
for 2007 , and a compound annual growth rate
of 8.6% through to 2011 – an increase in
market size of nearly $3 billion over the period.
Chloride’s secure power solutions are closely
aligned to high-growth sectors of the market,
such as IT services including data centres, oil
& gas, energy and transportation where capital
investment in infrastructure is accelerating.
The market drivers have proved enduring
– secure electrical power is an essential
requirement for global businesses and public
sector organisations as they seek to protect
their critical applications from the damaging
effects of degrading power quality. The failure
to improve power infrastructures to match
the rate of growth in many economies
underpins the prospects for long-term
growth in our industry.

DEVELOPING OUR SOLUTIONS OFFERING
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
At the end of the year we streamlined the
management structure to combine sales
and service and operations for both standard
and industrial systems. We also consolidated
the R&D, production, sales and service and
product marketing functions. This move will
more effectively leverage our sales and service
network, our technology and operational
capability to extend best practice in solutions
development throughout the Group. This step
will be important in driving sales growth and
cost efﬁciencies as we move forward.
SERVICES
Our success is based on our ability to provide
industry-leading products and services,
tailored to the requirements of our global
blue-chip customers. We are continually
improving our services offering, expanding
our international scope and extending
our capabilities in services for multi-vendor
UPS and other critical electronic equipment.
LIFE.net, our industry-leading remote
diagnostic software is an important part
of our solutions offering. We again made
improvements to LIFE.net, enhancing the
system to monitor a range of non-UPS
equipment, and introducing secure internet
communications between the monitoring
stations and the installed base.
Our services are closely aligned to the
demands of large system applications,
which drive the growth in services, generate
recurring high-margin service revenues and
give us visibility of future earnings.
Revenue from services was up 26%
to £84.8 million, (19% organic), and now
accounts for 32% of total sales. Our service
order book is £9.3 million ahead of last year.
PRODUCTS
Product sales underpin the growth in services,
and our product range is continually refreshed
to anticipate market requirements, reduce
footprint and improve energy efﬁciency. Sales
were up 33% (28% organic) at £182.8 million.
In 2007/2008, 73% of product sales came from
products introduced in the previous three years.
We have a healthy pipeline of new products and
anticipate product innovation continuing to be
an important driver of our growth in the current
and future years.
We introduced static transfer switches to
improve our tier 4 data centre capabilities,
90-NET products for the US market and,
in conjunction with DB Power, a new range
of Active ﬁlters for applications requiring
enhanced harmonic reduction.
Improvement in energy efﬁciency is a key
objective in new product designs, such as the
range of Power Lan models introduced during
the year. Chloride is the only UPS company
to participate in the EU Code of Conduct
to improve end-use energy efﬁciency in AC
uninterruptible power supplies. We also seek
to reduce energy wastage in the testing of
large systems, through an innovative process
in use at our large systems test facility in
Bologna, Italy where the energy used in
the test process is recovered and recycled,
resulting in minimum energy wastage.
We added to our software development
capabilities by setting up an additional R&D
centre in Pune, India. Operated by DB Power,
this state-of-the-art facility gives us access to
over 100 technology and software engineers and
is already making a signiﬁcant contribution to
our product development programme, especially
the development of the next generation
of control modules, which will keep our
technology at the forefront for large systems. 12 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
A PROVEN
STRATEGY
We completed a joint venture agreement
with Phoenixtec Power Company, Taiwan,
to develop a high-quality, low-cost
manufacturing facility for large systems in
Shenzhen China. The venture is scheduled
to reach full production in the ﬁrst half of 2009,
and is expected to give us the beneﬁt of lower
transfer prices, as well as a 50% share of the
company’s proﬁts and a local source of supply
for our Asian markets.
We also have access to low-cost, high-quality
manufacturing facilities in DB Power, giving
further scope to reduce product costs.
CHLORIDE ACADEMY
Developing our knowledge base and training
our staff to the highest industry standards is
fundamental to our solutions approach. The
Chloride Academy educates students through
a combination of distance learning, practical
and residential courses to enhance skills and
spread best practice to the highest industry
standards throughout the Group. The Academy
has dedicated staff to uphold the standard of
training, and utilises the wealth of expertise in
the Company to develop course programmes
aligned to business objectives.
The Academy has recently celebrated its ﬁrst
anniversary and in its ﬁrst year has increased
the number of courses available. Accredited
training centres have been established at Group
facilities in Germany, Spain, the UK, Australia
and in our new facility in Singapore. In the ﬁrst
year of operation 130 employees successfully
completed 185 Academy courses, with further
expansion planned in the current year.
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
WESTERN EUROPE
This region now accounts for 63% of Group
sales, and we hold market leadership positions
in the UK, Italy, Spain and Germany. Overall
sales from Western Europe grew by 30%

installed base and enabled us to build on
relationships with important customers
such as the El Corte Ingles chain of
department stores. The integration with
Chloride Spain was successfully completed
during the year, giving a uniﬁed approach
to the market. Spain is also an excellent
market for Chloride’s industrial systems,

our secure power solutions capabilities and
improves access to opportunities in the
Russian market.
ASIA PACIFIC
Sales in Asia Paciﬁc were up 50%. Excellent
performance was achieved in Australia, where
our business won a number of excellent
product and service orders and in China,
where we focus our sales approach on large
multi-national companies. We secured
important contracts from blue-chip customers
such as Intel and Dow Corning as well as a
data centre project for the Beijing Olympics.
The strategic partnership with DB Power
Electronics, India continues to prove a major
success, giving us access to blue-chip
customers in a number of sectors including
Microsoft, Dell and IBM in IT services, HSBC,
Standard Chartered and Barclays in ﬁnancial
services, Tata and Reliance Industries in
energy and oil & gas, and Suzuki Textiles in
manufacturing. During the year we increased
our stake in DB Power to 32% – a key
investment to expand our position in the
dynamic Indian marketplace.
We acquired Ascor Power Systems Pte
Limited, Singapore early in the year, and
immediately created a state-of-the-art service
support and training centre there to reinforce
our high-quality technical, sales and service
capability in the region.
At the year end we opened a Chloride
representative ofﬁce in Vietnam as the
foundation for building our presence in this
high potential new market.
MIDDLE EAST`
We achieved exceptional growth in the Middle
East with sales up 78%, from many projects
in energy and oil & gas, IT services and in the
transport sector from airport projects including
those in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Jordan.
AMERICAS
Overall performance in the Americas was
disappointing, with sales up by only 4%,
due largely to our small products and power
conditioning business in the USA, where sales
were down by 4% (up 2% in local currency).
Our large systems business in the USA grew
by 7% (13% in local currency) and we made
good progress in Brazil and Mexico. 16 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

OTHER
We achieved good growth in a number
of other sectors, including leisure – where,
for example, we have supplied to the Beijing
Olympics, manufacturing – with successes
across the world, and medical – particularly
with hospitals and with equipment
manufacturers.
BUILDING MARKET SHARE
Chloride’s pace of growth again outstripped
the growth of the market, with sales up 31%
(25% organic) at £267 .6 million, set against
the Frost & Sullivan market growth forecast
of 13%.
Product sales were up 33% (28% organic)
at £182.8 million and services, which form an
important part of our total solutions approach,
were up 26% (19% organic) at £84.8 million.
Orders were also strong – well ahead of
sales and last year. We ﬁnished the year with
a record order book for products and services
(up £21 million to £102.4 million). This increase
was evenly spread across all territories
for both products and services, providing
a ﬁrm foundation for further growth in the
current year.
MARKET SECTORS
DATA CENTRES AND OTHER
IT INFRASTRUCTURE
In 2007/2008 we increased sales by 51%,
as the increasing requirement for data
processing and storage facilities powered
growth in this sector. Chloride is an
acknowledged leader in critical power services
for data centres in Europe, where the market
is forecast to grow by a CAGR of 12.5%
through to 2011 . Our expertise and reputation
in Europe was an important competitive
advantage in winning important orders for
data centres in Asia Paciﬁc, particularly India
and Singapore.
OIL & GAS AND ENERGY
Sales grew by 105%. High energy prices
and rising demand are driving investment
in upstream and downstream infrastructure
projects, especially in the Middle East and
Asia Paciﬁc. Chloride’s industrial systems are
engineered to withstand the most challenging
of climatic conditions and hostile electrical
environments, making them ideally suited
to applications in this high-growth sector.
The qualiﬁcation of our products for nuclear
applications means we are well positioned
for the re-emergence of nuclear power
generation in Europe and other parts of
the world.
The development of renewable energy
generation has also presented opportunities
for Chloride’s technologies and services, and
we look to win further business in renewables
as the sector gathers momentum.

STRATEGY
ROBUST BUSINESS MODEL
The operating margin increased by 2 points
to 13.5%, the sixth successive year of
improvement, as we leveraged the sales
and service network to increase revenue,
and secured cost reductions from the drive for
business efﬁciencies. This margin improvement
was achieved despite the negative impact
of commodity cost increases. We anticipate
further opportunities to improve the operating
margin in the future.
Operating cash conversion was 83%, after the
additional working capital required to support
the growth of the business, demonstrating
the quality of earnings and the cash-generative
nature of our business model.
PEOPLE
Chloride has some of the most experienced
people in our industry, generating over
£170,000 of sales per employee. We place a
high priority on nurturing talent and providing
career opportunities to enable employees
to develop their skills and provide excellent
service to customers. I would like to thank
my colleagues throughout the Group for their
commitment and support during my period
as Chief Executive. I hand over to Tim Cobbold
conﬁdent that we have the right people and
leadership for continued success.
OUTSTANDING PROSPECTS
Chloride operates in worldwide markets with
long-term underlying growth characteristics,
driven by our customers’ need for secure
electrical power to protect their mission-critical
applications from inadequate and unreliable
power supplies.
By focusing on the consistent execution
of our strategy, we have built strong positions
in high-growth international markets and
continually improved our technology and
services to meet the broad scope of our
customers’ requirements. These actions place
the Company in a leading position to beneﬁt
from attractive opportunities in the world’s
major and emerging economies.
We entered the new ﬁnancial year with a
record order book and a clear plan to meet
our growth objective. This gives us conﬁdence
in the outlook for the coming year and beyond.
We are well placed to build further momentum
for the beneﬁt of our shareholders, customers
and our people in the longer term.

ENHANCING
SHAREHOLDER
VALUE
Shareholder returns again rose signiﬁcantly ahead of both the Small Cap and
FTSE 250 indices during the past year, following strong growth in the top line
and in earnings, through both organic growth and accretive acquisitions.
As a consequence Chloride entered the FTSE 250 index during the year.
Over the year the share price rose over 17%
from c.163p to c.191p at 31 March 2008.
On 12 May 2008 the Company announced that
it had received and rejected an approach from
Emerson Electric Company at 255p per share.
On 28 May 2008 the share price was 275p.
The Company continues to believe it is very
well positioned to grow Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) further over the coming years –
the fundamental drivers for growth – degrading
power supplies and increasingly critical
application needs – remain strong.
The Board’s conﬁdence in the future is again
reﬂected in the ﬁnal dividend, which the Board
recommends rises 41% to 2.40p, giving
a full year dividend up 33% at 4.00p.
KPI
Achievement of our strategic goals is key
to enhancing shareholder value and the
progress made is discussed in the Chairman’s
statement and Chief Executive’s review.
The Group uses a number of ﬁnancial and
non-ﬁnancial KPIs to assess performance
against its objectives. The major ﬁnancial
KPIs are shown on page 21 .
The major non-ﬁnancial KPIs relate to
Environmental and Health and Safety
Performance, progress upon which is reported

FINANCIAL REVIEW
ADJUSTED OPERATING CASH FLOW
Management remains committed to turning
proﬁts into cash to enable reinvestment in
the businesses. In 2008 the strong growth
in the business resulted in some investment
in working capital. Nevertheless adjusted
operating cash ﬂow was again strong. Good
credit control was exercised (year-end debtor
days fell from 75 to 73 days and the level
of overdue debtors remained constant at
15 days).This once again underpins the quality
of the customer base and the related earnings.
Management of the supply chain has been
tightened further with inventory turns
improving although terms with key suppliers
have been held or shortened in some cases
to ensure quality and speed of delivery.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
AND INVESTMENTS
Tangible ﬁxed asset capital expenditure in the
year was £5.2 million. C. £1million has been
spent on service infrastructure investment –
ﬁtting out our new service ofﬁces in Bedford,
UK and the regional headquarters established
in Singapore. New energy efﬁcient testing
facilities have been put in place in Bologna,
Italy at a cost of c. £0.8 million. C. £2 million
was invested in the systems to integrate our
Spanish businesses and the roll out of the
system in Australia, together with the ongoing
upgrades in the IT infrastructure and the Group
website. The balance of expenditure was
largely routine and replacement in nature.
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT
Besides the investment late last ﬁscal year
in Masterpower in Aberdeen, which has
performed to expectations, a number of
further important investments took place
during the year.
On 25 April 2007 the Company acquired
the entire share capital of AST Electronique
Services SARL (ASTE), a company specialising
in third-party maintenance focusing on the
Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) service
market in France. This acquisition enables
Chloride to offer an enhanced service offering
in the competitive French market. The cash
consideration was £1 .9 million and ASTE
contributed £1 .9 million of revenue and
£0.2 million to the Group’s operating proﬁt
in the period between the date of acquisition
and the balance sheet date.
On 23 May 2007 the Company acquired
the entire share capital of Ascor Power
Systems PTE Limited (now renamed Chloride
Singapore), supplier of critical power
protections services in Singapore for a cash
consideration of £1 .2 million. The business
contributed £2.3 million of revenue and
£0.2 million to the Group’s operating proﬁt
in the period between the date of acquisition
and the balance sheet date. This acquisition
has provided the strategic platform through
which the Group will access the buoyant
Singaporean market. A signiﬁcant investment
in customer service and testing facilities
will allow Singapore to be the regional
headquarters for South East Asia.
In July and October 2007 our investment in
DB Power Electronics in India was raised by
10% and 12% respectively to now total 32%.
Our partnership with DB Power continues
to ﬂourish as we grow our presence in the
dynamic Indian market.
In October 2007 we signed the joint venture
agreement with Phoenixtec Power Company
to establish a manufacturing facility in China
to produce large systems to Chloride’s
speciﬁcation. Production is ramping up during
the ﬁrst half of 2008/2009 and will enhance the
availability of low-cost, high-quality products.

TREASURY OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s funding, liquidity and exposure
to interest rate and foreign exchange rate
risks are managed by the Group treasury
department. The treasury department uses
a combination of derivative and conventional
ﬁnancial instruments to manage these
underlying risks. Treasury operations are
conducted within a framework of Board-
approved policies and guidelines.
This function operates to reduce risk and
cost and no transactions are undertaken on
a speculative basis. The trading of ﬁnancial
instruments within the Company is conﬁned
to central treasury.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY
The Group’s management is committed to
enhancing shareholder value, both by investing
in the businesses so as to improve the return
on investment and by managing capital
structure. The Group’s objective is to fund
its growth out of existing resources and debt,
such that it maintains a strong balance sheet
and complies with its borrowing covenants.
CORE FACILITIES AND NET LIQUID FUNDS
The Group’s management policy regarding
liquidity risk is to ensure that it always has
sufﬁcient committed facilities available to
meet its foreseeable needs. As the Group
has grown in size and continued to be cash
generative so has its credit rating grown in
strength such that the Group is regarded
as having credit rating of BBB+/A-.
The Group policy is to manage its debt using
a number of three-year committed revolving
facilities, which mature at different points to
ensure adequacy of funding. Interest on these
facilities is charged at LIBOR or equivalent plus
an appropriate margin. At 31 March 2008 the
Company had committed term facilities of
£90 million of which £50 million remained
undrawn. All but £30 million of these facilities
are on loan agreements that expire in a period
of greater than one year. Since the year end
the Company has also, due to its strong
credit rating, been able to secure a further
£20 million of committed facilities (giving
a total of £110 million) to ensure that it
has substantial funds available to cover
possible acquisitions.
At 31 March 2008, the Company had net
debt of c. £21 .8 million comprising on demand
borrowings of £0.5 million most of which
relates to the hedging of our overseas
operations, ﬁnance lease obligations of
£0.3 million and committed borrowings
of £43.8 million less cash and short-term
deposits of £22.8 million.
In its principal overseas companies the
Company has on-demand overdraft and
bill discounting facilities to provide local
funding for operating and working capital
requirements. Drawings under these facilities
provide a partial hedge against assets held
in local currencies. The funding structures of
our UK and overseas operations are regularly
reviewed with the objective of achieving the
optimal post-tax ﬁnancing cost.
The Company also has adequate foreign
exchange contract and engagement facilities
for its day-to-day commercial and exposure
matching needs.
The on demand borrowings at 31 March 2008
of £0.5 million are guaranteed by Chloride
Group PLC. The committed term facilities are
guaranteed by Chloride Group PLC and contain
common ﬁnancial covenants regarding interest
cover, a ceiling on net debt and minimum
consolidated shareholders’ funds. It is Group
policy to manage the consolidated balance
sheet so as to operate at all times well within
covenanted restrictions. 24 ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Section 2: Business review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CURRENCY RISK
The Group publishes its consolidated ﬁnancial
statements in sterling and conducts business
in many foreign currencies. As a result, it is
subject to foreign currency exchange risk
due to exchange rate movements which will
affect the Group’s transaction costs and the
translation of the results and underlying net
assets of its foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on the translation
of foreign currency borrowings, where they
are in an effective hedge relationship, are
recognised in the statement of recognised
income and expense.
For currencies in which there is an active
market, the Group seeks to hedge its
transactional foreign exchange rate risk on
a transactional basis. Where the Company has
regular net foreign currency cash ﬂows which
are strongly predicted the Company hedges
its net exposure using forward foreign currency
exchange contracts. The effective portion of
the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised
in the statement of recognised income and
expense to the extent it is effective and
recycled into the income statement when
the underlying hedged transaction impacts
the income statement.
Apart from optimising expenses and interest
on local borrowings, the Group does not
believe, as an internationally based business,
that it is appropriate to hedge other aspects
of its proﬁt and loss account translation
exposure. There was a positive exchange
impact of £1 .4 million on operating proﬁt
during the year largely due to the strength
of the euro and the fact that c.80% of Group
operating proﬁts are euro based.
Net assets are held in a number of currencies
and translated at year-end rates. This is
explained more fully in the accounting policy.
The resulting exposures are managed where
practicable by matching local currency assets
with local currency borrowings.
Non-sterling currencies of primary importance
to the Group moved as follows in the year:
2008 2007 % 2008 2007 % Impact on
Y ear end Year end Change Average Average Change op profit
US$ 1.99 1 .96 1 2.00 1 .89 6 £(0.1)m
Euro 1.25 1 .47 (15%) 1.42 1 .48 (4) £1.2m
Other £0.3m
Total £1.4m
INTEREST RATE RISK
The majority of the Company’s borrowings
are at interest rates of LIBOR or EURIBOR
plus a margin.
The Company’s policy is to review the ratio
of ﬁxed rate debt to total outstanding debt
on an ongoing basis to minimise the risk
of major interest rate ﬂuctuations over the
medium to long term, and to hedge as
appropriate such exposure through the
use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 March 2008, the Company had a ratio
of ﬁxed rate debt to total outstanding debt
of approximately 2%. As of 31 March 2008
the Company had ﬁxed £0.7 million of euro
denominated borrowings at an average ﬁxed
rate of 2.3%. The remainder of borrowings
are at ﬂoating rate and predominantly LIBOR
based. The weighted average remaining period
as at 31 March 2008 for which the above debt
was ﬁxed was 27 months.
CREDIT RISK
The Group monitors its credit exposure
to its counterparties via their credit ratings
(where applicable) and through its policy,
thereby limiting its exposure to any one
party to ensure that they are within Board
approved limits and that there are no
signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk.
The counterparties to the ﬁnancial instruments
transacted by the Group are major international
ﬁnancial institutions. Group policy is to enter
into such transactions only with counterparties
with good long-term credit ratings.
USE AND FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At 31 March 2008, outstanding forward
contracts existed with a gross book value
totalling £27 .4 million in respect of actual
transaction exposures. The net fair value
of these forward foreign exchange contracts
was £0.3 million at 31 March 2008. In addition
to these forward contracts the Group is
exposed to foreign exchange movements
on its overseas borrowings.
INSURANCE
The Group purchases insurance for
commercial or, where required, for legal or
contractual reasons. In addition, the Group
retains insurable risk where external insurance
is not considered an economic means of
mitigating these risks.
TAX RATE
The tax charge in 2008 represents an effective
rate of 30% (2007: 26%). The rise in rate
is due to the substantial uplift in volume
of taxable proﬁts in European tax regimes
with effective rates of 30% or higher.
Neil Warner ANNUAL REPORT 2008 25
Section 2: Business review
RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
The Group, in common with other international
businesses, is exposed to a number of
potential risks which may have a material
effect on its reputation, ﬁnancial or operational
performance. It is not possible to identify or
anticipate every risk that may affect the Group,
or the materiality of that risk. The Board has
overall responsibility for risk management
and internal controls and is assisted by the
Audit Committee.
Further details of the Company’s system of
internal controls are contained in the corporate
governance report on pages 37 and 38.
The Audit Committee has one meeting a
year dedicated to reviewing risk. In addition,
internal control and risk management actions,
together with Risk Committee updates are
kept under review at the Audit Committee
meetings held to consider the interim and
full year results. It is assisted by the Risk
Committee and the Group Risk Manager.
The Risk Committee is chaired by the Finance
Director and comprises the Chief Operating
Ofﬁcer and other senior operational and head
ofﬁce management, including the Group Risk
Manager. Its core functions are to:
 assess and report to the Audit Committee on
the effectiveness of the Group’s non-ﬁnancial
and ﬁnancial internal control systems;
 ensure that an embedded framework
for managing risks is in place throughout
the Group; and
 provide an appropriate level of reporting
on the status of risk management to the
operational management and to the
Audit Committee.
The Risk Committee meets twice a year
and the minutes are also circulated to the
Audit Committee Chairman. All directors are
entitled to receive the Risk Committee papers,
and to attend the meetings.
The nature, likelihood and materiality of
the risks affecting each Group business
are assessed by operational management
on an annual basis. On the basis of these
assessments, the Risk Committee produces
a risk map for the Group as a whole, and the
summary of material risks is reviewed by the
Audit Committee and endorsed by the Board.
The risk assessment process applies both to
normal operational activities and to projects
which are signiﬁcant to the Group, where a
risk register is drawn up and monitored by the
Group Risk Manager throughout the project.
As described in the corporate governance
report, there is an embedded process for
monitoring and controlling the identiﬁed risks
through monthly ﬁnancial and operational
reporting procedures. In addition, appropriate
levels of cover are maintained under the
Group insurance programme in respect
of insurable risks.
The Group Risk Manager monitors the
effectiveness of risk management and internal
controls through site reviews of Group
businesses. His visit programme is approved
annually by the Audit Committee. After each
site visit a report is prepared and presented
to local area Group management, and to the
Chairman of the Audit Committee. A copy is
also made available to the external auditors.
The Group Risk Manager is able to call on
additional resources from central staff and
external consultants as necessary. External
consultants also review health and safety
and environmental practices at selected sites
on the basis of a rolling schedule agreed with
the Group Risk Manager.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
There have been no major operational risks
identiﬁed during the year other than those
typical in a competitive environment – key
areas identiﬁed for ongoing management
attention continue to be:
 product and service revenue growth above
market – sales and service strategies for
customer satisfaction, staff training and
development;
 acquisitions – delivery of acquisitions that
meet the Group’s strategic requirements
for appropriate value and integration after
full risk assessment of targets;
 outsourcing of supplies of components
and products – protection of the
Company’s intellectual property; quality
and security thereof;
 product and service development and
market introduction – prioritisation of
development activity and effectiveness
of the money spent; and
 employee safety – monitoring of working
practices to ensure high standards of
health and safety and environmental
compliance.
FINANCIAL RISKS
As an international business, the major
ﬁnancial risks faced by the Group are liquidity
risk, currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Board regularly reviews these risks and
approves policies covering the use of ﬁnancial
instruments to manage ﬁnancial risk and
overall risk limits. A detailed summary of the
Group’s ﬁnancial risks and how these risks are
managed can be found in the ﬁnancial review
on pages 23 and 24.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this annual report
are forward looking. Although the Company
believes that the expectations contained in
such statements are reasonable, it can give
no assurance that these expectations will
prove to be correct. Actual results may differ
materially from those expressed in or implied
by these forward-looking statements. 26 ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Section 2: Business review
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Responsible behaviour towards our stakeholders and the wider community is
fundamental to Chloride’s business. We seek to ensure that we always act with
integrity; that we give priority to the health and safety of our employees and
those affected by our activities; and that we manage our activities so as to
control our environmental impact. The Chloride Board takes full responsibility for
compliance with ethical, health and safety and environmental standards and the
Chief Operating Ofﬁcer is responsible for reporting on these issues at Board level.
ETHICAL BUSINESS POLICY
Our employees are required to act with
integrity in all their business activities.
Our statement of business policies
reinforces Chloride’s commitment to:
 maintaining fair and competitive
employment practices, which promote
equal opportunities and develop the
potential of our people;
 providing a safe working environment and
encouraging health and safety awareness;
 setting standards of environmental
management, conservation of resources
and waste management that meet or
exceed the legal requirements in the
countries where we operate;
 being responsive to customer needs,
and providing the highest standards
of customer care;
 opposing bribery and corrupt business
practices;
 ensuring that employees act in the best
interests of the Company and do not
accept inappropriate gifts or payments;
 treating our suppliers fairly and building
long-term, mutually beneﬁcial relationships
with key suppliers; and
 supporting local communities through
charities supported by our employees. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 27
New employees go through an induction
and initial training process which explains key
employment conditions and Company policies,
including those relating to the elimination of
bribery and corruption in whatever form. We
have a policy in place with our agents and
distributors to ensure that any commissions
paid to intermediaries are legitimate and fairly
reﬂect the value of services provided.
Limits of authority are in place to restrict
the size and type of contracts that individuals
may sign, ensuring that signiﬁcant contracts
with customers, suppliers and intermediaries
are signed off at an appropriate level in
the organisation.
General managers are required to report
quarterly on compliance with Company
policies by their businesses, as part of the
management reporting cycle. Compliance is
further veriﬁed by internal audit inspections
carried out by the Group Risk Manager.
WHISTLEBLOWING
We encourage open and honest
communication between employees and
management throughout the organisation.
Employees may also use our conﬁdential
“whistle blowing” procedure if they
have serious concerns about ethical or
management issues that they feel unable
to discuss directly with local management.
EMPLOYEES
The Company is committed to providing equal
recruitment and other opportunities for all
employees, regardless of age, sex, sexual
orientation, religion, race or disability. We
endeavour to provide all possible help to retain
employees who have become disabled while
working for the Group.
At 31 March 2008 the Group had 1,578
employees. The Company’s employees are
spread over 15 countries and in the larger
sites there are dedicated human resources
managers reporting to the local General
Manager. The Group Director of Human
Resources is responsible for compliance on
a global basis with human resources policies.
It is the practice to encourage lines of
employee communication at local level through
appropriate means, such as works councils,
brieﬁng groups, workshops and newsletters.
The Company is committed to developing
and motivating its people and, in the UK
participates in the Investor in People scheme.
There is also a programme to help employees
acquire professional and technical
qualiﬁcations that are relevant to their jobs.
The Chloride Academy, established in May
2007 , provides enhanced skills training to
employees, as described in the Chief
Executive’s review on page 12.
Outstanding achievement among the sales
staff is recognised by the award of prizes
at an annual sales conference.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
We recognise the primary importance of ensuring
the health and safety of our employees and
others affected by the Company’s activities.
Chloride’s policy is to manage activities so that
employees and others are not exposed to
unnecessary and unacceptable risks to their
health or safety, and to meet or exceed the
legal and regulatory health and safety standards
in the territories in which we operate. During
the year the Board approved a restatement of
its overall policy on health and safety, together
with a new Group framework for managing
health and safety risks.
Health and safety management is embedded
in the organisation. The General Manager in
each business is accountable for health and
safety issues within his/her business, and in
the major sites there are designated senior
managers with responsibility for health
and safety. Policies and procedures are
documented and in our principal locations,
employees’ representatives are involved
in discussion of health and safety issues
through Works Councils or Health and
Safety Committees, on a regular basis.
Where health and safety issues are identiﬁed
as signiﬁcant risks, the Risk Committee keeps
under review the actions taken to address the
risk. These in turn are reported to the Audit
Committee, along with statistics on workplace
accidents. Evaluation of health and safety and
environmental performance is also an integral
part of the due diligence process on the
acquisition of businesses. 28 ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Section 2: Business review
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Health and safety training is provided as
necessary, particularly in relation to battery
handling and working with electricity. The
Chloride Academy includes health and safety
as an integral part of its education programme,
ensuring that students recognise the health
and safety implications of delivering secure
power solutions. We continue to focus on
minimising risk to service engineers while
providing installation, commissioning and
after-sales technical service in customers’
premises.
We have procedures in place to minimise
the exposure of our employees to terrorist
and other risks while working in sensitive
locations. All travel to areas deemed sensitive
by the Foreign Ofﬁce travel advice service
is subject to prior approval by the Group
Risk Manager. Business continuity policies
developed in response to the threat of
epidemics – such as SARS and avian ﬂu –
also restrict travel to affected areas in the
event of such an epidemic.
During the year ending 31 March 2008, 190
working days (less than 0.10% of the total)
were lost due to work-related accidents.
ENVIRONMENT
Chloride is committed to maintaining good
environmental practice to minimise the impact
of its activities on the environment and we are
a constituent company of the FTSE4Good
Index. Our policy is to comply with standards
that match or exceed environmental legislation
in all countries in which we operate, and to
comply with the ISO 14001 environmental
management standard in our principal
operational sites.
We encourage initiatives which beneﬁt the
environment and result in cost savings. We
have reduced the requirement for air travel
through the use of video conferencing.
Energy savings are achieved through the use
of thermographic technology in Chicago, to
detect areas of the building where heat is lost
and improve insulation. We encourage energy
saving initiatives, such as the innovative
system in use at our large systems test facility
in Bologna, where the energy used in the test
process is recovered and recycled, resulting in
minimum energy wastage.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The Company has three principal production
centres at Bologna, Italy; Lyon, France and
Chicago, USA. Such activities mainly involve
the assembly and testing of electronic
products. In accordance with the nature of
these activities, emissions to air and water
are low and the assembly processes have low
consumption of water, energy and hazardous
substances. The principal sales and service
sites are in Southampton and Bedford, UK;
Erlangen, Germany; Bologna, Italy; Istanbul,
Turkey; Madrid, Spain and Sydney, Australia.
All of these production and sales and service
centres have achieved ISO 14001 certiﬁcation,
and upgraded to the more demanding ISO
14001, 2004 issue. As part of the ISO 14001
requirement, each site is required to evaluate
environmental risks, and measure performance
on the key areas of impact. These performance
measurements are speciﬁc to each site,
enabling the focus to be maintained on the
areas of importance to each site. Compliance
with ISO 14001, 2004 issue is certiﬁed by an
independent certiﬁcation body, such as the
British Standards Institute.
95% of Chloride’s turnover is generated by
ISO 14001 compliant sites. In addition, many
of our components are purchased from
ISO 14001 certiﬁed suppliers, and our principal
Far Eastern supplier of outsourced products
is also ISO 14001 certiﬁed.
Where requested by the customer, Chloride
undertakes responsibility for disposing of
used batteries at the end of their useful life.
All waste batteries are handled through licensed
waste contractors who recover and recycle
the lead content, and dispose of any waste
in accordance with applicable regulations. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 29
PRODUCTS
Chloride’s total power protection solutions
perform an essential role in providing secure
power to a wide range of safety-critical
applications. These include emergency lighting
in challenging environments such as offshore
drilling rigs and underground metro tunnels;
hospital equipment; passenger safety systems
in airports; control centres for the emergency
services; signalling on railway networks,
and trafﬁc management systems on major
road networks.
Our solutions are an essential part of many
renewable energy generation projects, such
as wind farms and solar power installations.
We have also formed alliances with partners
for the supply of fuel cells (the only waste
product of which is water) and for rotary
technology, to help our customers achieve
their environmental goals.
We ensure that our products meet
environmental regulations in the countries
where they are installed and that new
products are progressively more energy
efﬁcient. Our 80-net and 90-net UPS systems
were designed for high energy efﬁciency
and our 90-net model has been recognised
by an independent laboratory as the most
energy efﬁcient double conversion product
of its kind.
Chloride is the only UPS company to
participate in the EU Code of Conduct
to improve end-use energy efﬁciency
in AC uninterruptible power supplies.
We are actively involved in industry bodies –
notably the European Committee of
Manufacturers of Electrical Machines and
Power Electronics (CEMEP) – which consider
the application of the EU Directive 2002/95/EC
“Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous
Substances in Electronic Equipment” (the
RoHS Directive) to UPS systems. Although
this directive, which requires the reduction
of substances such as lead and cadmium
in electronic equipment, does not directly
apply to UPS systems, we are committed to
avoiding the use of non-compliant materials
where this does not compromise the operation
or reliability of the UPS system. Our low
power ranges now have RoHS compliant
electronics and we work with customers to
meet their individual compliance requirements.
Although currently there is no equivalent
standard covering the USA, our Oneac
subsidiary produces all its new low power
products with RoHS compliant electronics. 30 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

Section 3:Governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
COMPLIANCE WITHTHE COMBINED CODE
The Board recognises its accountability to shareholders and is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. The Board
considers that throughout the year under review the Company has complied with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2006 FRC
Combined Code on corporate governance (the Combined Code).
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OFTHE COMBINED CODE
This report explains how the Company has applied the principles of the Combined Code to its activities. Section 1 of the Combined Code sets
out the main and supporting principles of good governance for companies, which are split into the following topics: directors; remuneration;
accountability and audit; and relations with shareholders.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Company currently operates with a Board of eight directors comprising the non-executive Chairman, four non-executive directors, including the
Senior Independent Director, and three executive directors. On the recommendation of the Nomination Committee Tim Cobbold was appointed as
an executive director and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer on 1 June 2007 , and Paul Lester was appointed as a non-executive director on 1 September 2007 .
Keith Hodgkinson and Robin Southwell have both indicated their intention of retiring as directors with effect from the AGM on 29 July 2008.
The number of directors and the balance between executives and non-executives provides for effective operation and is considered appropriate
to the Company’s size and scope of activities.
A schedule of formal meetings of the Board, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee is arranged each year in line with the
Company’s management reporting, and interim and annual reporting cycle. During the year, the Board met formally seven times, together with
a further meeting to review strategy. Attendance at meetings was as follows:

Notes
1 n/a means that the director is not a member of the Committee. Certain directors who are not committee members have attended meetings by invitation. Details are not included in the table.
2 Paul Lester joined the Board on 1 September 2007 . He was appointed a member of the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee on 25 October 2007 –
after the date of the October Audit and Remuneration Committee meetings.
3 Robin Southwell missed one Board meeting and one Nomination Committee meeting, held on the same day, due to an unanticipated commitment.
In addition to the formal schedule of meetings, the Board held discussions with senior operational managers on strategy, business development,
and other topics important to the Company’s progress.
The Board has reserved to itself powers relating to matters that it considers signiﬁcant to the Group’s business, operational and ﬁnancial risks.
These are set out in a formal schedule and include the approval of corporate policies, strategy, plans and budgets; major acquisitions and disposals
of companies or businesses; major investment and ﬁnancial decisions; appointments to the Board; executive remuneration policy and major
management or organisational changes.
The Chairman and Chief Executive have deﬁned roles, providing for a division of responsibilities between them, which have been documented and
approved by the Board. The Chairman is responsible primarily for the running of the Board, while the Chief Executive’s primary role is the running
of the business and the development and implementation of strategy.
The Chairman has been appointed for successive ﬁxed terms totalling 11 years. The other non-executive directors have each been appointed for
a terms or successive terms totalling less than nine years. The effective dates of the current terms of appointment are set out in the remuneration
report on page 42. 36 ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Section 3:Governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Chairman met the Combined Code criteria for independence on his appointment in 2001 . The Board considers that the other non-executive
directors are independent of management and free of any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their
independent judgement.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association all directors below the age of 65 are required to submit themselves for re-election every other year.
Directors aged 65 or over must submit themselves for re-election each year.
At the forthcoming AGM, Norman Broadhurst, Gary Bullard, Paul Lester and Eric Tracey retire in accordance with the Articles of Association and
will seek re-election. The Board has reviewed their performance and strongly supports their re-election, and recommends that the shareholders
vote in favour.
All the directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and senior managers generally, and may take independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense if they consider it necessary to do so in the furtherance of their duties.
The non-executive directors held one meeting during the year with the Chairman, without the executive directors present.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has three standing committees – the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, each with a different Chairman. The Chairman
chairs the Nomination Committee and is a member of the Remuneration Committee. All the independent non-executive directors are permanent
members of the Committees. The Board considers that this is the most appropriate way of enabling the non-executives to participate in monitoring
governance issues, including executive remuneration, succession planning and risk management, without placing undue reliance on any
one individual.
The terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, which are based on the model terms of reference published
by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, are published on the Company’s website – www.chloridegroup.com.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Committee’s activities and responsibilities are described in the Audit Committee report on pages 39 and 40.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee’s activities and responsibilities are described in the remuneration report on page 41 .
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Committee’s terms of reference include the following responsibilities:
 making recommendations to the Board in respect of new appointments of executive and non-executive directors;
 succession planning for directors and senior executives; and
 making recommendations on reappointment of non-executive directors at the end of their term of appointment.
The Committee has a process for recommending Board appointments, based on a review of the skills of the other directors, development of
a speciﬁcation and employment of a ﬁrm of recruitment specialists to draw up a shortlist. Given that the Nomination Committee consists of all
the non-executive directors, the Chairman and the Chief Executive, matters relating to reappointment of non-executives and succession planning
are also handled within meetings of the main Board.
ACTIVITIES
During the year the Committee was asked to oversee the appointment of an additional non-executive director with broad industrial experience.
A leading ﬁrm of recruitment consultants was engaged and this resulted in the appointment of Paul Lester, whose biographical details appear
on page 31 .
The Committee also reviewed the induction process and performance of the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, before recommending to the Board his
appointment as Chief Executive on the retirement of Keith Hodgkinson. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 37
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The Board has a process for performance evaluation which has been applied to the Board and its Committees since 2003/2004.
As in previous years, in 2007/2008, the process was based on the completion of a questionnaire by the directors in relation to the Board and
each of the Committees of which they were members. Certain attendees at committee meetings were also asked to complete a questionnaire.
The responses were collated, reviewed by the Chairman and distributed to the directors for discussion at a Board meeting. In addition, the Senior
Independent Director conducted personal reviews with individual non-executive directors.
Actions implemented as a result of the review in 2006/07 included a presentation to the Board on the Companies Act 2006 and the introduction
of a new statement on health and safety policy, and Group framework for implementing health and safety policy.
Performance evaluation relating to the Audit and Remuneration Committees is discussed in the Audit Committee Report on page 40 and
remuneration report on page 41 .
REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for compliance with the Combined Code in determining executive directors’ remuneration.
The remuneration report on pages 41 to 48 demonstrates how Chloride applies the principles of the Combined Code relating to the level
and make-up of remuneration and to disclosure.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Board seeks to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s position and prospects, through the Chairman’s
statement, the directors’ report, which includes the business review (comprising the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the risk
management report and corporate social responsibility report).
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The directors are responsible for the Company’s system of internal control which aims to: safeguard the Company’s assets; ensure that proper
accounting records are maintained; ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements; and ensure the effectiveness and efﬁciency
of operations, including the assessment and management of risk. A system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk
of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance particularly against misstatement or loss.
Chloride has a well established and embedded framework of internal ﬁnancial and operational control for identifying, evaluating and managing the
risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee carries out an annual review of the effectiveness of the material controls, and the Board receives
regular information about the Company’s operations, enabling it to evaluate the nature and extent of the risks faced by the Company. The Board
is therefore able to conﬁrm that the system of internal control has been in place throughout the year under review, and up to the date of approval
of the annual report. The key elements of the framework of internal and operational control, which complies with the Turnbull guidance, “Internal
Control Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” published in September 1999, are as follows:
Directors have responsibility for setting the strategy and monitoring the conduct of the Company. The directors and the executive management
of the Company are accountable for their conduct and performance within the agreed strategies. A management structure exists with clearly
deﬁned lines of responsibility and the appropriate levels of delegation.
The Company and its operations are subject to a detailed annual budget process and ongoing formal capital investment appraisal process.
Actual performance during the year is monitored monthly against budget, forecast and previous year, and full-year forecasts are updated at regular
intervals during the year, based on trended historical data and realistic macroeconomic forecasts. These forecasts and results are presented to the
Board regularly. The Chief Executive, Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and Finance Director each prepare Board reports monitoring performance and actions
to achieve objectives. 38 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company and its subsidiaries operate control procedures designed to ensure complete and accurate accounting of ﬁnancial transactions,
and to limit the risk of loss of assets or fraud. Measures taken include physical controls, segregation of duty in key areas and internal reviews
and checks. The identiﬁcation, mitigation and monitoring of material risks are primarily the responsibility of operating company management.
During the budget and reporting cycle, general managers and ﬁnancial controllers are required to identify risks the business is exposed to,
assess any potential impact and to put in place actions to reduce them. The Audit Committee agrees the key risks to the business, which are
endorsed by the Board and monitored throughout the year. It is assisted by the Risk Committee, the functions of which are set out in the
risk management report on page 25.
Key functions such as tax, treasury, insurance, legal, personnel and systems are controlled centrally. Further information on policies to manage
ﬁnancial risk is contained in the ﬁnancial review on pages 23 to 24.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company’s annual report and accounts. They independently and objectively review
management’s reporting of the operational results and ﬁnancial position. They also review and test the systems of internal control and the data
contained in the annual report and accounts to the extent necessary for expressing their audit opinion. The policy on independence of auditors
is included in the Audit Committee report on page 40.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and considers that the Group Risk Manager whose role is described in the Risk
Management report on page 25 fulﬁls this function.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Relations with shareholders receive the highest priority. The Company promotes dialogue with institutional shareholders and analysts through
regular meetings following the announcement of interim and ﬁnal results, and responds positively to invitations to enter into dialogue whenever
it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally to do so. All directors are available to attend meetings with shareholders if
requested. The Chairman and Senior Independent Director attend analysts’ presentations, and the Chairman also attends meetings with institutional
shareholders when possible. The views of shareholders and analysts are reported back to the Board.
The Company routinely communicates with shareholders six times a year, through the preliminary and interim results announcements, interim
management statements, and trading updates issued at the start of the close period before announcement of the full and half year results.
At the AGM there is an opportunity, following the formal business, for informal communication between investors and directors. In addition,
information, including the presentations made to institutional shareholders and analysts and recent announcements, is readily available to
shareholders on the Company’s website – www.chloridegroup.com. It is the Company’s practice to send the notice of Annual General Meeting
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 39

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code by the Audit Committee of the Company and has been approved
by the Board.
MEMBERSHIP
The Committee is made up of four non-executive directors, all of whom the Board considers to be independent. The members at 31 March 2008
were Eric Tracey (Chairman), Gary Bullard, Paul Lester and Robin Southwell. Mr Tracey has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience gained through
his former positions as a partner in Deloitte and ﬁnance director of Amey PLC and Wembley PLC, and through his current roles at Governance for
Owners, Quintain Estates & Development PLC, Xero Live Ltd and NZ Trade & Enterprise.
The members bring extensive experience of corporate management in senior executive positions to the Committee.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the model published by the Institute
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The terms of reference are available on the Company’s website and include the following:
 monitoring the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements, reviewing the annual and interim reports in detail to ensure that they present a balanced
and understandable assessment of the Company’s position and prospects;
 reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and risk management systems;
 overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, monitoring their independence, agreeing the scope of audit and monitoring the
effectiveness of the audit process;
 making recommendations to the Board on the requirement for an internal audit function and reviewing the effectiveness of internal audit; and
 reviewing the Company’s arrangements for whistleblowing.
The Committee has authority to investigate any matters within its terms of reference and has access to the resources and information it requires
for this purpose.
The Committee is entitled to obtain independent professional advice on matters within its terms of reference.
MEETINGS
The Committee met three times during the year – in May, October and January. The Company Secretary acted as secretary to the Committee
and the meetings were attended by invitation by the Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, Finance Director, Group Risk Manager
and other senior ﬁnance staff. The external auditors also attended the Committee meetings.
During the year, the Committee met once with the auditors without executive managers being present. It also held a private meeting with the
Group Risk Manager. In addition, the Committee Chairman met regularly with the Group Risk Manager to review matters arising from his site
visit reports, and with the external auditors.
Attendance at meetings by the Committee members was as set out in the corporate governance report on page 35.
ACTIVITIES
The meeting that took place in May 2007 was principally concerned with the draft ﬁnancial statements for the year ending 31 March 2007 together
with the draft preliminary results announcement. The Audit Committee also considered the report of the external auditors on the full-year audit,
concentrating on issues of judgement and audit focus identiﬁed in the audit plan. The steps taken to ensure that all relevant audit information
had been disclosed to the auditors were reviewed, enabling the directors to make the statement in the directors’ report on page 34. In addition,
the Committee was updated on internal control and risk management issues, in accordance with normal procedure.
At the October meeting, in addition to an update on internal control and risk management issues, the Committee considered the draft interim
ﬁnancial statements for the period ending 30 September 2007 , together with the draft interim results announcement. In addition the audit scope
and fee proposal for 2007/2008 and audit expectations were reviewed.
The meeting in January 2008 was concerned primarily with the review of the risk management process including the activities of the Risk
Committee, the outcome from risk control visits and the agreement of the Group Risk Manager’s visit plan for the forthcoming year. The external
audit plan for 2007/2008 was also considered, and the external auditors reported on the structure in place to ensure their independence.
The insurance arrangements for 2008/2009 were also considered. 40 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE
During the year, the Committee reviewed its performance through the process described on the corporate governance report on page 37 .
The Committee considered it had the skills to perform its responsibilities, particularly through Mr Tracey’s ﬁnancial and audit experience.
Actions for improvement focused on training requirements and adding resource to the Group Risk Management function to ensure that
the scope of activity could be maintained in busy periods.
AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the audit process following the 2006/2007 audit, and shared its ﬁndings with the auditors.
The Committee considered that in addition to a high level of technical competence and objectivity, the auditors demonstrated a clear
understanding of the business and communicated the issues of judgement and focus effectively to the Committee. Recommendations
were made to improve the interface between the Group Risk Manager and the external auditors, which were actioned in the year.
Based on the Committee’s view of the performance of the external auditors and on the planning and execution of the annual audit, the Committee
has recommended to the Board that a resolution to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Company has a policy for determining the types of non-audit work for which
it is appropriate to use the external auditors, including a clearance procedure for fees. The Committee is satisﬁed that these procedures have been
followed during the year, and that the external auditors have in place robust procedures, including the rotation of audit staff and partners, to ensure
their independence, preserve objectivity and comply with regulatory and professional requirements.
As stated in note 5 to the ﬁnancial statements, audit fees of £353,000 were payable to Deloitte together with non-audit fees of £6,000 relating
to interim review procedures. The Audit Committee considers that this balance is appropriate and does not constitute a threat to the auditors’
independence.

Section 3:Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and
the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). The Regulations require the auditors to report on the “auditable part”
of the remuneration report. The audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the model published by the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which are available on the Company’s website and include the following:
 determination of the policy for remuneration of the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 determination of individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 consideration of executive directors’ service agreements, pensions and related matters;
 making recommendations to the Board on the design of share incentive plans; and
 exercise of all powers and discretions of the directors in connection with the Company’s savings-related and executive share option schemes.
MEMBERSHIP
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Robin Southwell (Chairman), Norman Broadhurst, Gary Bullard, Paul Lester
(appointed 25 October 2007) and Eric Tracey. On Robin Southwell’s retirement as a director on 29 July 2008, Gary Bullard will take over the
Chairmanship of the Committee.
ADVISERS
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief
Executive and the Director of Human Resources, neither of whom took part in the determination of their own remuneration. Advice was also
received from the Company Secretary in relation to the operation of the Company’s share-based incentive plans. Advice was obtained from Hewitt
New Bridge Street (HNBS), who were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on executive remuneration, and long-term incentive
arrangements, including employee share schemes. HNBS has no other connection with the Company.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed its performance through the process outlined on the corporate governance report on
page 37 . The Remuneration Committee considered that it had the skills and experience to perform its responsibilities. It identiﬁed a need for more
advice from HNBS on market practice for executive remuneration, which was addressed during the year.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
POLICY ON REMUNERATION
The fees of non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board and were reviewed during the year. The policy is to set fees
at the median level relative to companies with a comparable market capitalisation. Fees do not contain any performance-related element and the
non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option or performance share schemes. Additional fees
are paid for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, reﬂecting the additional workload and responsibility of these appointments.
Non-executive directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment, and take no part in the
determination of their own remuneration.
Details of the fees paid during the year are included in the table headed “Summary of remuneration” on page 46.
Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 April 2008. The annual fee level for 2008/09 is as follows:
Fee
Office £000
Chairman 115.0
Non-executive director 36.5
Remuneration Committee chairmanship additional fee 5.0
Audit Committee chairmanship additional fee 6.0 42 ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Section 3:Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
TERM OF APPOINTMENT
The non-executive directors are appointed for speciﬁed terms of approximately three years. Their letters of appointment have no contractual notice
period, and the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every
two years, or every year in the case of a director aged 65 or over. The dates on which the respective letters of appointment came into effect are
as follows: Norman Broadhurst – 3 April 2007; Gary Bullard and Eric Tracey – 1 September 2005; Paul Lester – 1 September 2007 . Robin Southwell’s
term of appointment expired on 20 January 2008, and was extended to 29 July 2008, the date of the Annual General Meeting.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
POLICY ON REMUNERATION
The policy is to provide a combination of salary, short and long-term incentives and beneﬁts, which form a competitive and fair total
remuneration package. Performance-related remuneration in the form of annual bonus, together with share options and performance shares,
comprises a signiﬁcant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets, which
require substantial improvement in ﬁnancial performance and, in the case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.
COMPONENTS OFTHE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
BASE SALARY
The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together
with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable industry sectors. In particular, base salaries recognise salary levels
in a group of comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar sectors. Details of salaries, bonuses and beneﬁts paid to
executive directors during the year are included in the table headed “summary of remuneration” on page 46.
The basic annual salaries of Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner with effect from 1 April 2008 are:
K H Hodgkinson – £385,000
N W Warner – £250,000
These represent an increase of approximately 3% for Keith Hodgkinson and 4% for Neil Warner since 2007/2008.
Tim Cobbold takes up his appointment as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer with effect from 29 July 2008. His salary is at the annual rate of £250,000
from 1 April until 29 July 2008, (an increase of approximately 4%) and at the annual rate of £350,000 from 30 July 2008.
ANNUAL BONUS
Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees, including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the
measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key business issues. For the year under review, the ﬁnancial measure
applicable to the incentive plans for executive directors was actual adjusted earnings per share compared with the previous year, with on-target
performance at 17% growth and maximum bonus payable at 21% growth. In 2007/08 for the Group Finance Director, Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and
other senior executives, up to 15% of maximum bonus was dependent on achievement of personal objectives, in addition to the ﬁnancial target.
For the executive directors, the maximum award under the 2007/08 annual incentive plan was 75% of base salary. Bonus amounts earned up to
55% of base salary are paid in cash. If the bonus earned exceeds 55% of base salary, the bonus above a threshold of 50% is deferred into shares
which are released after two years, subject to the executive director remaining in the Company’s employment. Bonus shares earned by the
executive directors under the deferred bonus plan and not yet released by the Company are included in the table headed “Interests under share
plans” starting on page 47 . Bonuses earned by the executive directors under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the annual incentive plan for the directors and two senior executives. It concluded that for
2008/09, the maximum award for these participants should be increased to 100% of base salary to bring the bonus potential into line with market
practice for executives at this level in the organisation. 50% of salary will be payable for achieving target. Bonus earned up to 55% of base salary
is payable in cash. If the bonus earned exceeds 55% of base salary, the bonus earned between 50% and 75% of base salary is deferred into
shares which are released after two years, subject to the executive director remaining in the Company’s employment. Bonus payable in excess
of 75% of base salary is payable in cash.
The amount of bonus payable under this scheme is dependent on achievement of stretching ﬁnancial targets and personal objectives. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 43
SIGNING ON ARRANGEMENTS
Tim Cobbold joined the Company on 1 June 2007 as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and as an executive director. In addition to participating in the
performance-related long and short-term incentive plans, life insurance and pension scheme and receiving beneﬁts in kind, he is entitled to receive the
following additional payments in each of the ﬁrst two calendar years of his employment, to assist with the transition from his previous employment:
A bonus of £50,000, net of income tax (c. £85,000 gross).
A relocation allowance of £42,000.
The Committee considers these payments, which total c. £127 ,000 per annum gross, to be reasonable having regard to the need to attract
the best candidate for this demanding role. The payments made during the year to 31 March 2008 are included in the table headed “Summary
of remuneration” on page 46.
Mr Cobbold is also entitled to reimbursement of certain costs if he decides to purchase a property closer to the Group head ofﬁce in London.
BENEFITS IN KIND
The taxable beneﬁts provided to executive directors during the year under review were use of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance
and medical cover.
PENSIONS
During the year, the executive directors were members of the ﬁnal salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme (the 1996 Scheme).
This Scheme is a funded, contributory, HMRC-approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State Earnings-Related
Pension Scheme. It provides a pension of up to two-thirds of ﬁnal pensionable earnings (up to normal retirement age under the Scheme),
depending on service. The 1996 Scheme also provides for dependants’ pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed “Pension entitlements” on page 46 shows the retirement beneﬁts, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the
deﬁned beneﬁt section of the 1996 Scheme to the executive directors during the year, together with the total accrued annual pension to which each
of them would be entitled under deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements on leaving service.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the 1996 Scheme adopted a cap on pensionable salary in place of the statutory earnings cap, which is cost neutral
to the Company. The pension beneﬁts of the executive directors are subject to this cap and they each received salary supplements in relation to
salary in excess of the cap. The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 46 headed “Summary of remuneration” .
EXECUTIVE SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES
POLICY
The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for increased
share ownership which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests of
shareholders and executive directors. The policy is to make annual grants of share options and/or performance shares, with a combined annual
aggregate limit on the value of shares under award of two times basic salary. The effect of this overall limit is that an individual cannot receive more
value under a combination of Performance Share Plan awards and Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) grants than he could have under only
one plan. In calculating the value of awards, a performance share is deemed equal to two ESOS awards. For example, an individual could receive
a maximum ESOS grant of 200% of salary or a performance share grant of 100% of salary. Alternatively, he could receive a 100% ESOS grant
and a 50% performance share grant to receive the maximum level of award per annum.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The current share option scheme is the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted under this scheme are normally
exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that the Company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
growth over a period of at least three consecutive ﬁnancial years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by:
 3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of base salary;
 4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not more than 150% of base salary; and
 7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of base salary. 44 ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Section 3:Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
In the case of options granted after 31 March 2004, options will lapse if the performance condition is not achieved by the third anniversary of grant.
Adjusted EPS as disclosed in the report and accounts was chosen as the basis for the performance condition because achievement of the growth
in EPS necessary before options may be exercised would require a substantial improvement in the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance.
No options were granted to the executive directors under this Scheme during the year and no options will be granted to them in 2008/2009.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The Company also operates a Performance Share Plan (PSP). The maximum annual value of shares which can be granted under the PSP is 100%
of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder
return (TSR) performance target is met over a ﬁxed performance period of three ﬁnancial years. The TSR target for the years to 31 March 2008
compares the Company’s TSR with that of constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding Investment Trusts). As the Company is now
a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts), the Committee has decided that the Company’s TSR should be measured
against that index for awards granted from June 2008 onwards.
Awards vest as follows:
Chloride’s ranking % of awards which vest
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Between median and upper quartile straight line between 30% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
In addition, no awards will vest under the PSP unless the Company’s EPS growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus
2% p.a. over the performance period.
PREVIOUS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 ESOS and the PSP , the Company operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share
Option Scheme, under which HMRC-approved options and, in the case of the 1996 Scheme, unapproved options were granted to executive
directors as well as senior executives and are still exercisable. No further options can be granted under the 1994 or 1996 schemes. Options granted
under the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to meeting the
performance measures stated in the notes to the table headed “Interests under share plans” on page 47 .
SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Company operates a savings-related share option scheme – the 2007 Scheme, which expires in July 2017 . Under the Scheme, options – which
are available to eligible UK employees who contract to save a speciﬁed monthly amount – are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or,
depending on an individual’s initial election, ﬁve years from the contract start date.
The 1997 savings-related share option scheme expired in July 2007 , and no further options can be granted under it.
The outstanding interests of the executive directors under all executive share option schemes, the savings-related share schemes and the PSP
are set out in the table starting on page 47 headed “Interests under share plans” . ANNUAL REPORT 2008 45
CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment, terminable on 12 months’ notice if terminated by the Company and six months’
notice if terminated by the director.
The executive directors’ current contracts of employment became effective on the following dates:
Keith Hodgkinson – 1 December 1991
Neil Warner – 23 April 1997
Tim Cobbold – 1 June 2007
Mr Cobbold subsequently signed a new contract of employment on 2 April 2008, effective 29 July 2008.
In the event of termination by the Company, each of the executive directors would be entitled to 12 months’ salary, pension beneﬁts, salary
supplement and beneﬁts in kind. In an appropriate case the Company would have regard to the departing director’s duty to mitigate loss. However,
the contracts of employment of the directors contain special terms relating to dismissal following a change of control of the Company, under which
they would each be entitled to receive a prescribed payment made up of 12 months’ salary and beneﬁts including a bonus payment of 20% of basic
salary. Four senior executives also have contracts of employment containing this formula for a prescribed compensation payment on dismissal
following a change of control.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors during the year.
POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval
of the Board. Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained by the individual. During the year, fees received and retained
were as follows:
Fee
£000 Company
Keith Hodgkinson 44.5 De La Rue plc
Neil Warner 28.5 Dechra Pharmaceuticals plc
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The graphs set out below show the performance of the Company over the last ﬁve ﬁnancial years in terms of TSR, relative to the FTSE Small
Cap Index and the FTSE 250 Index (both excluding investment trusts). As the Company is now a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index the directors
consider it appropriate to benchmark the Company’s performance against movements in that Index. The graphs demonstrate the comparative
TSR in terms of annual movements.

Notes
1 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement under the terms of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme based on service to 31 March 2008.
2 The transfer values (and their increases) in columns 6, 8, 9 and 10 have been calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 .
3 The difference between the transfer value increase shown in column 6 and column 10 arises from a change in the date of calculation of transfer values.
4 The normal retirement age for directors is 65. The transfer values assume that Mr Warner can receive his benefits accrued before 1 April 2006 at age 60 and his benefits accrued
after 31 March 2006 at age 65, that Mr Cobbold receives his benefits at age 65 and that Mr Hodgkinson retires immediately.
The transfer values shown in the above table are a liability of the 1996 Scheme. The above table combines the disclosures required by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations 2002. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 47

Section 3:Governance
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
UK company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. The directors are required by the IAS Regulation to
prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and have also
elected to prepare the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial statements
are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the Company’s ﬁnancial position,
ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in
accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements” . In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved
by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 prepare information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRS is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the impact
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 50 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CHLORIDE GROUP PLC
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the consolidated income
statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂow statement,
and the related notes 1 to 33. These Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also
audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group ﬁnancial statements
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements. The information given
in the directors’ report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the risk management report
and the corporate social responsibility report that is cross referred from the business review section of the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited Group ﬁnancial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the annual report.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
 the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
 the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
 the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March
1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
Chloride Group PLC is a UK-listed electronics company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as “the Company” .
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as adopted by the European Union for its accounting period beginning on 1 April 2006.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements under IFRS requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions
are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time, and are used to make judgements about the carrying value
of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. These estimates
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements
in the period in which they are made.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND AREAS OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In applying the Company’s accounting policies as set out in note 2, management has made accounting judgements in the determination of the
carrying value of deferred tax assets, intangible assets, the quantiﬁcation of provisions including retirement beneﬁt obligations and the impairment
of goodwill. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes will differ from those assumptions
and estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty is provided below.
DEFERREDTAX ASSETS
The carrying value of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts being generated in certain territories in future periods.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
To determine the net present value of certain customer relationships and trade names, management has estimated the additional future cash ﬂows
arising from these intangibles. In the case of customer relationships, management has applied an estimated attrition factor to its forecast sales for
the relevant unit and in the case of trade names has applied a notional royalty rate.
PROVISIONS
The quantiﬁcation of certain liabilities within provisions (for environmental remediation obligations and for legal costs in relation to certain claims)
have been estimated. Such liabilities depend on the actions of third parties and on the speciﬁc circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither
of which is controlled by the Company.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS
To determine whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been
allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit
and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
In assessing the Company’s obligations relating to retirement beneﬁts, management made key assumptions relating to current and future mortality,
expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.
PRESENTATION UNDER IFRS
The statements are presented in pounds sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention.
The Company therefore complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations, adjusted by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities to fair value.
The nature of these adjustments are set out in the policies below.
During the period, the Company adopted the following accounting statements:
– IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures
– IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinﬂationary Economies
– IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2
– IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
– IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment
– IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions ANNUAL REPORT 2008 55

The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards/revisions to Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material
impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group except for additional segment disclosure when IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing
on or after 1 January 2009 and the ﬁnancial statement presentation changes under IAS 1 (revised 2007/2008) which also comes into effect for
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
These are the Company’s third ﬁnancial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Company’s transition date for adoption of IFRS
was 1 April 2005.
IFRS 1 (First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards) allows companies adopting IFRS for the ﬁrst time to take certain
exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS. Accordingly, the Company took advantage of the following key exemptions on transition to IFRS:
A) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:
The Company chose not to restate to IFRS business combinations and the resultant acquisition goodwill for acquisitions made prior to the
transition date.
B) CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES:
IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates) requires that the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised directly in
equity for foreign operations are transferred to the income statement as part of the proﬁt or loss on any subsequent disposal. As permitted by IFRS 1
the Company reset these cumulative foreign exchange translation differences to zero at the transition date.
C) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS:
The Company applied IFRS 2 (Share-based payments) only to awards made after 7 November 2002 and which have not vested by 1 January 2005.
D) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
The Company took the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation), and IAS 39
(Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement).
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made
up to 31 March each year. Subsidiaries are those companies in which the Company has control, directly or indirectly, over the operations so as
to obtain beneﬁts from those companies’ activities. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses
on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated. 56 ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Section 4: Financial statements and notes
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Company in exchange for
control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current
assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination
over the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment,
the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities recognised.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
1) REVENUE
Revenue represents the amounts, excluding VAT and similar sales-related taxes, receivable by the Company for goods and services supplied to
outside customers in the ordinary course of business. Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists,
products have been delivered or services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised under the percentage to completion method of accounting and is calculated based on the ratio
of costs incurred to date compared with the total expected costs for that contract.
Revenue from long-term service provision contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet
date. This is normally determined by the proportion of the contract that has elapsed at the balance sheet date. Revenue from services provided
on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.
2) INTEREST INCOME
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues by reference to the effective yield on the asset.
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating proﬁt is stated after restructuring costs but before investment income and ﬁnance cost.
INCOMETAX
Income tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and is calculated using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax
bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt. Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than
a business combination, that affects neither the taxable nor accounting proﬁt is not recognised.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of the distribution of overseas retained earnings by subsidiaries to the extent that the subsidiary, at the balance
sheet date, has entered into a binding agreement to do so. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 57
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable proﬁts available to offset it and is reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse
based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
1) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
2) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income statements of foreign entities are translated to sterling at the average exchange rates for the year, approximating the foreign exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from the translation of shareholders’ equity to sterling at year-end
exchange rates are taken to the translation reserve. These differences are recognised as income or expense on disposal of the related subsidiary.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage operational exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate price risks. These
derivatives entered into by the Company consist mainly of currency forwards and interest rate swaps. The Company’s policy prohibits the use
of derivatives for speculation and therefore does not hold or issue ﬁnancial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are
recognised as assets and liabilities and measured at their fair values at the date at which such contracts are entered into. Subsequently derivative
ﬁnancial instruments are re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in proﬁt immediately unless
the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument in which case the timing of recognition in the proﬁt and loss depends on the
nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting is applied to derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or in cash ﬂows of the
hedged items. Under hedge accounting of ﬁnancial assets or liabilities changes in fair value of the ﬁnancial derivative are recognised in the
income statement where they are matched with changes in the fair value of the hedged item which are also recognised in the income statement.
Cash ﬂow hedges are entered into where a derivative ﬁnancial instrument is used to hedge the currency risks of anticipated future export sales,
cash ﬂow risks of anticipated future purchases and the cash ﬂow risk from changes in interest rates. The effective part of the changes in fair
value of cash ﬂow hedges are recognised in equity, while any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the income statement. When the ﬁrm
commitment or forecasted transaction results in recognition of an asset or liability, the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included
in the initial measurement of that asset or liability. Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income
statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative unrealised
gain or loss (at that point) remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged
transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative ﬁnancial instruments
where their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with
changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
At the inception of a hedged relationship the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction
together with its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also documents at inception and
on an ongoing basis as to whether the derivatives used are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash ﬂows of the hedged item. 58 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
1) POST -EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Most Company undertakings have pension or retirement beneﬁt arrangements. These vary but are appropriate to the legal requirements and local
practices of the countries concerned.
Contributions to deﬁned contribution plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. For deﬁned beneﬁt plans, pension charges are determined
separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the balance sheet date. The amounts
charged to the income statement consist of current service costs, interest costs, the expected returns on plan assets and past service costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately where they have already vested and over the average period until they vest where they have not.
The Company has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 issued in December 2004. Accordingly amounts recognised in the statement of recognised
income and expense represent actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actuarial assumptions used in previous valuations and
the actual outcome and changes in actuarial assumptions.
Pension obligations recognised in the balance sheet represent the present value of deﬁned beneﬁt obligations adjusted for any past service costs
not yet recognised and the fair value of any plan assets.
2) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company operates share option programmes to allow employees to acquire shares in the Company at a price ﬁxed at the time of the award.
The Company also operates share award programmes which grant shares to certain employees. These programmes are subject to both market
related and non-market related vesting conditions. For grants made after 7 November 2002 and remaining unvested at 1 January 2005 these
awards are measured at their fair value at the date of grant. This fair value is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reﬂect expected and actual forfeiture during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service
conditions or non-market performance conditions. This fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of the net identiﬁable assets of the acquired
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. This goodwill is carried in the balance sheet and is reviewed annually for impairment. Any impairment is
recognised in the income statement and will not be subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is expressed in the currency of the subsidiary to which it relates and is translated to sterling using the year-end exchange rate.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the UK GAAP amounts. Goodwill written off to
reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent proﬁt and loss on disposal.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
1) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientiﬁc or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised
in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred except where it relates to the
development of a new or signiﬁcantly improved product or process that is technically and commercially feasible, where the Company has sufﬁcient
resources to complete the development and where the related costs can be reliably measured.
Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development
expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
2) COMPUTER SOFTWARE
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is recognised separately as an asset and is stated at cost less
subsequent amortisation.
3) OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets, acquired by the Company, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 59
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
AMORTISATION
Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The rates generally used are:
Computer software Three to seven years
Other Two to ten years
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
With the exception of certain freehold properties, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
recognised impairment losses. Assets under construction are not depreciated. Certain of the Company’s freehold properties were revalued
in 1993. These properties are held at this valuation/deemed cost plus any subsequent capital expenditure and less cumulative depreciation.
Depreciation is charged on the straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets. The rates generally in use are as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 2% to 5%
Leasehold buildings 2% to 5% (or over remaining life of lease if shorter)
Plant, machinery and other equipment 5% to 33%
Depreciation is calculated on the cost together with subsequent additions at cost. Under UK GAAP , certain assets were revalued in 1993
and have been deemed at cost on transition to IFRS.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets.
Gains/losses on disposal of an asset represent the difference between sales proceeds and the net carrying amount.
IMPAIRMENT
Acquired goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The carrying amounts of the Company’s other assets are reviewed at each balance sheet
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the
impairment is recognised as a revaluation decrease.
1) CALCULATION OF THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT
The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash
ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. For an asset that does not generate independent cash inﬂows, the recoverable amount is determined for
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
2) REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT
With the exception of acquisition goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined on a ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out basis and in the case of
products manufactured by the Group, consists of direct material and labour costs together with related factory overheads. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

FINANCIAL ASSETS
INVESTMENTS
Investments other than those in associated companies and joint ventures are initially recognised at their fair value at the date of the transaction and
are subsequently measured at each reporting date at their fair value. The Company’s investments comprise equity stakes in partnership enterprises.
These investments are classiﬁed as held for resale and the resultant gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of assets held for sale are
directly recognised in equity until such assets are de-recognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is
included in the net proﬁt or loss for the period. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement if there is objective evidence that the
asset is impaired.
TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are stated at their fair value by reference to invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful
accounts is recognised when it becomes likely that the originally invoiced amount is not fully realisable.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity
on acquisition of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right
of offset with cash balances.
TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are stated at fair value.
BORROWING
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at cost, less attributable transaction costs. Borrowing costs including premiums
payable on settlement are recognised in the income statement on the accruals basis.
EQUITY
Equity is recorded in the balance sheet at the proceeds received less transaction costs.
LEASING
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as
ﬁnance leases. Assets held under ﬁnance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, and are measured at the lower of fair value
and the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Interest is charged to the income statement
as a ﬁnance charge over the lease period. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the life of the lease.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate
of the amount of this obligation can be made.
1) WARRANTY
Provision for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale to reﬂect the likely costs of meeting such obligations.
2) RESTRUCTURING
Provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has
either commenced or has been announced publicly.
3) ONEROUS CONTRACTS
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected beneﬁts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 61
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. Such assets
must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset which,
when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months.
An extension of the period required to complete the sale does not preclude the asset from being classiﬁed as held for sale, provided the delay was
for reasons beyond the Company’s control and management remains committed to its plan to sell the asset. Assets that are classiﬁed as held for
sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of, or satisﬁes the criteria to be classiﬁed as held for sale,
and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to disposal.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. Value in use calculations are used to calculate recoverable amount. Value in use
is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax free cash ﬂows of the cash generating unit in which the goodwill is
contained, applying a discount rate of the Company post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7 .68%. This approximates to applying a pre-tax
discount rate to pre-tax cash ﬂows.These cash ﬂow projections are made over a 20-year period and are consistent with approved budgets, and market
growth rates projected by Frost & Sullivan over the ﬁrst ﬁve years and a growth rate in line with an inﬂation assumption of 2% per annum thereafter. 68 ANNUAL REPORT 2008

From 3 July 2007 the Company acquired a further 10% of the share capital of DB Power Electronics PVT . Limited, a power protection company
registered in India, bringing its total share holding to 20%, and subsequently acquired a further 12% of the share holding of the company
in October. From 1 July DB Power has been accounted for as an associate and 20% of its net proﬁt has been taken to proﬁt for the period
to 30 September, subsequently this percentage has increased to 32%.
JOINT VENTURE
In October the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Phoenixtec Power Company to set up a manufacturing company in China.
Under the agreement the Company is obliged to make good its share of the start up losses, which at 31 March 2008 amounted to £126,000
and an appropriate accrual has therefore been made in the balance sheet for this amount.

The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The average consolidated term for trade debtors was 73 days (2007: 75 days). Included in the Company’s trade debtors are debtors with a carrying
value of £14,094,000 (2007: £11,061,000) which were past their due date at the reporting date, for which the Company has not provided. As there
has been no overall change in the underlying credit risk associated with these debts, the Company believes that these are recoverable. The average
term by which these debtors exceed their due date is 15 days (2007: 15 days).
Trade receivables are not normally interest bearing, although the Company may exercise the right to charge interest on overdue accounts.
Allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the
recoverability of the cash ﬂows. Movement in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:

CREDIT RISK
The Company’s principal ﬁnancial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances
for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based on previous experience,
is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ﬂows.
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited
because the counter-parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Company has no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Company trades mainly with other companies with strong credit ratings and there is a good history of collection and cash generation
with a limited history of impairment.

Borrowings and cash balances have been offset where the legal right of offset exists. The Company’s Articles of Association limit the external
borrowings of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to an amount equal to twice the share capital and consolidated reserves.
At 31 March 2008 the Company had £92.0 million (including a £2.0 million overdraft facility) of committed facilities (2007: £77 .0 million, including
a £2.0 million overdraft facility), of which £50.4 million (2007: £41 .2 million) was unutilised. Of this amount, £30.0 million expires within one

CURRENCY RISK
The Company has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the fair value of the Company’s ﬁnancial instruments,
to the income statement and to equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable
at 31 March 2008, with all other variables remaining constant. A 10% variation in the valuation of sterling at the balance sheet date would have
an impact of £0.4 million (2007: £0.1 million). All of this would be taken to the income statement.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that speciﬁed changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global ﬁnancial markets which may cause
ﬂuctuations in exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future
events and losses. ANNUAL REPORT 2008 77

The Company’s core borrowings comprise three year committed facilities with a number of banks. Typically the Company draws under these
facilities for periods between one week and three months and the interest rates applicable, LIBOR (or equivalent), are determined at the outset
of each drawing. The above table is drawn up on the assumption that the Company will continue to draw on these loans until the expiry of the
facility and that interest rates have been set at the rate applicable at 31 March.
The Company holds ﬁnancial assets which mature within one year of £107 ,225,000 (2007: £91,841,000) and £699,000 (2007: £1,500,000),

31 POST -EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Company has a number of pension or retirement beneﬁt arrangements, which are established to meet local legal requirements and practices
in the countries in which it operates. These arrangements comprise both deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. At 31 March 2008,
the Company had a net deﬁcit of £7 .0 million (2007: £6.4 million) in respect of its obligations under these arrangements.
The principal deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are operated in the UK and Germany, and in Italy the Company participates in the statutory Trattamento
a Fine Rapporto (TFR) scheme. The bases of these schemes are as follows:
UK
In the UK the Company operates a hybrid pension scheme with both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution sections (the Chloride 1996 Scheme).
At 31 March 2006 the deﬁned contribution section of the scheme was separately identiﬁed within the scheme, with a separate investment pool.
The disclosures below for 2008 therefore represent only the deﬁned beneﬁts element. The deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Chloride 1996 Scheme
has been closed to new members since 1 April 1998. Funding is set after formal funding valuations carried out every three years by independent
actuaries. Following the last such valuation which was carried out as of 31 March 2005 the Company committed to make a special contribution
of £3.5 million, of which £2.5 million was paid in 2007 (2006: £1 .0 million).
GERMANY
In Germany the Company operates a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme which, in accordance with local practice, is unfunded. Provision for future liabilities
is made in the balance sheet in accordance with advice given by an independent actuary.
ITAL Y
In Italy the Company participates in the statutory TFR scheme which, in accordance with local practice, was unfunded. With effect from 1 January
2007 the administration of the scheme was changed so that entitlements for future service are funded and cease to be classiﬁed as deﬁned
beneﬁts. Provision for past service, for which the employee has not elected to take payment, continue to be accounted for as a deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation. These changes have resulted in a curtailment credit in the year of £329,000 which has been taken to the income statement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CHLORIDE GROUP PLC
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the balance
sheet, the cash ﬂow statement and the related notes 1 to 15. These parent company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008 and on the information
in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent company
ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the directors’ report
includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the risk management report and the corporate
social responsibility report that is cross referred from the business review section of the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited parent company ﬁnancial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside
the annual report.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company ﬁnancial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in
the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2008;
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

11 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
CURRENCY RISK
The Company has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments,
to the income statement and to equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at
31 March 2008, with all other variables remaining constant. A 10% variation in the valuation of sterling at the balance sheet date would have an
impact of £2.9 million (2007: £28.1 million). All of this would be taken to the income statement.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that speciﬁed changes occur. Actual results
in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global ﬁnancial markets which may cause ﬂuctuations in exchange
rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Detailed commentary on the Company’s liquidity position are set out on page 23 of the ﬁnancial review. Contractual liabilities related to the
Company’s ﬁnancial liabilities are:

facilities for periods between one week and three months and the interest rates applicable is LIBOR (or equivalent) is determined at the outset
of each drawing. The above table is drawn up on the assumption that the Company will continue to draw on these loans until the expiry of the
facility and that interest rates have been set at the rate applicable at 31 March.

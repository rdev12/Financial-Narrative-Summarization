1 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating  
for 200 years
De La Rue
Over the past 200 years, De La Rue  
has established an unparalleled record  
of innovation that continues today.
Founded by Thomas de la Rue in 
Guernsey in February 1813, De La Rue is 
a trusted partner of governments, central 
banks, issuing authorities and commercial 
organisations operating in over 150 
countries across the world.  2 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovation  
milestones
1813
Thomas de la Rue’s first commercial 
venture was in 1813, when he published 
the first edition of Le Miroir Politique 
newspaper in Guernsey.
1846
In 1846 De La Rue registered its patent 
for the first envelope folding machine. 
In one hour the machine could produce 
2,700 envelopes. It was exhibited, with 
several other De La Rue innovations, at 
the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London.
1853
De La Rue was awarded the contract to 
print adhesive fiscal stamps for the UK’s 
Board of Inland Revenue. Not only the 
first stamps to be surface printed, they 
were also the first perforated stamps  
to be issued.
1881
De La Rue developed the first practical 
fountain pens in 1881, which were later  
to be developed into the famous  
Onoto pen.
1831
The modern playing card was evolved 
with the invention of a new process – 
the typographical method. As a result 
Thomas de la Rue was awarded a Royal 
Letters Patent from King William IV for  
the manufacture of playing cards.
1838
To celebrate the Coronation of  
Queen Victoria, Thomas de la Rue  
printed a special golden edition  
of The Sun newspaper. Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements

1984
Building on earlier innovations in security 
thread technology, in 1984 Portals 
pioneered the revolutionary process for 
incorporating a windowed thread into 
a banknote. This has become a well 
established feature in many banknotes 
around the world. 
1967
De La Rue jointly developed and installed 
the world’s first through the wall ATM  
at Barclays Bank in Enfield, UK. 
Photo below used with kind permission of Barclays Bank PLC
1940s
During World War II, Portals, De La Rue’s 
subsidiary, developed the incorporation 
of an embedded metallic thread into 
banknotes to defend against the threat  
of counterfeit notes.
2009
In June 2009, De La Rue secured a 10 year 
contract to design and produce the new 
UK ePassport, one of the most secure 
identity documents in the world today. 
The design is based on a theme of ‘Scenic 
United Kingdom’, capturing images from  
across the UK. Sitting behind these images  
are highly sophisticated layers of security 
features to ensure the passport’s integrity. 
In November 2012, just 24 months after 
production commenced, the ten millionth 
ePassport was issued. 
2013
In April 2013 De La Rue won the  
Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation 
for its super wide Optiks™ banknote 
security thread with a clear window 
in the banknote, and the associated 
papermaking process.
Optiks™ represents a step change in 
both security thread and papermaking 
technology.
This is the twelfth time that De La Rue  
has been honoured with a Queen’s Award.  4 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovative 
technologies
Safeguard™
Safeguard™, De La Rue’s polymer 
substrate, is the result of an intensive 
four year development and investment 
programme and provides customers  
with an alternative substrate offering 
improved durability.
De La Rue is the only supplier to  
offer full vertical integration of polymer 
design, substrate manufacture and 
printing expertise. Our award winning 
design expertise ensures that Safeguard™  
notes meet the customers’ aesthetic and 
security criteria including novel design 
elements using clear window areas in the 
note. Established banknote print processes 
are all compatible with Safeguard™.
To mark our 200th anniversary, we have 
produced a sample house banknote using 
Safeguard™ which depicts a Grey Heron, 
with the clear window used as a design 
feature to depict its aquatic habitat. Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
5 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Spectrum™
Spectrum™ is a new print feature which 
builds on proven latent image technology. 
The printed image changes as the angle of 
view is shifted, revealing additional images 
and colours. Spectrum™ is available in 
a range of colours and effects, offering 
considerable design flexibility.
Cornerstone
®
In response to the problem of folded 
corners on banknotes in circulation 
which reduces their useful life, De La Rue 
launched Cornerstone
®
 in 2003. This 
innovative approach reinforces and stiffens 
the corners of the banknote as an integral 
part of the papermaking process. In the 
past 10 years Cornerstone
®
 has been 
incorporated in over 22 billion banknotes.
Cornerstone
®
 has also been successfully 
introduced as a feature in passports, 
providing additional durability to the paper 
of the personal data page. In addition, 
Cornerstone
®
 provides increased security 
against counterfeiting or substitution of  
the data page.

a new effect has been created where a 
bright ring appears to slip freely within the 
print area. This is a security feature that is 
easy for the public to see and understand. 
It can be developed in a range of designs 
and colour combinations, has a wide 
number of applications and is suitable  
for both paper and polymer substrates. Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
7 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Banded fibres
In 2009 De La Rue developed a new 
system for incorporating bands of visible 
or fluorescent fibres in a tightly controlled 
area of passport paper. Typically seen 
next to the spine of a passport book, 
these bands present a simple but effective 
countermeasure to page insertion or 
counterfeiting. The UK ePassport was 
the first identity document to include this 
feature, which has since been adopted  
by other countries.
Government  
revenue solutions
De La Rue has successfully implemented 
a product authentication system for the 
Cameroon government. The system is a 
dual language, web based solution which 
allows the Ministry of Finance to order  
and monitor the delivery of tax stamps. 
The traceability of every stamp is assured 
by the use of unique codes and handheld 
scanners, deployed by Customs and 
Trade inspectors to scan products in real 
time. This checks whether a label is valid 
and applied to the correct product. 
With many years of experience 
implementing tax stamp schemes, 
De La Rue was able to implement this 
highly complex solution involving numerous 
products, countries and stakeholders.  
For our customer this is the first step 
towards a wider consumer and revenue 
protection programme and demonstrates 
real leadership in the reduction of illicit  
and potentially dangerous goods. 8 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovative 
design
Design
De La Rue’s award winning design and 
origination department is the largest of any 
commercial banknote and security printer 
in the world. It provides an industry leading 
centre of excellence for the design of 
banknotes and security documents. 
Banknote design is a complex process 
which begins with a concept agreed 
with the customer. The design realisation 
process must then accommodate all 
aspects of banknote production including 
the choice of substrate, multiple overt and 
covert security features as well as sorting 
and authentication requirements. 
Our team of highly experienced banknote 
designers has been consistently 
successful in winning design awards,  
both for banknotes designed entirely  
in house and for collaborative projects  
with central banks. 
Our security print experts, using  
specialist software, handle more than 
100 complex design projects a year, from 
personal identification documents such  
as passports, to authentication labels  
and a varied range of other secure  
print products. Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements

Kazakhstan  
5000 tenge
De La Rue’s track record of winning 
international recognition for banknote 
design has continued, with the 
International Bank Note Society selecting 
the Kazakhstan 5000 tenge note as their 
2012 Banknote of the Year. 
This banknote was jointly designed by 
the National Bank of Kazakhstan and 
De La Rue working in close collaboration. 
In keeping with other Kazakh banknotes, 
this denomination has a portrait  
orientation on the front of the note and  
a more traditional landscape orientation  
on the back.
The front of the note depicts the Kazakh 
Eli monument, the national emblem and 
the national flag, along with images of 
flying doves. 
High level holographic features include 
De La Rue’s Depth™ security thread, 
which appears on the surface of the front 
of the note, and Depth™ stripe which 
appears on the back.
Holographics
De La Rue has been designing and 
producing secure holograms since 
1987, pioneering and refining classical 
holography techniques to bring stunning 
colour and depth effects recognisable  
in their holographic images. 
Commencing with secure labels for video 
cassettes, De La Rue produced its first 
banknote holograms in 1993. This led  
to holograms being specified for other 
secure documents such as payment 
cards, identity documents, fiscal stamps 
and brand authentication devices.  10 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Group results
Against a backdrop of a more challenging 
currency market, including delays in 
expected orders, the Group has reported 
an 8 per cent reduction in revenue to 
£483.7m (2011/12: £528.3m). 
Operating profit before exceptional items 
was in line with the prior year at £63.2m 
(2011/12: £63.1m). Profit before tax and 
exceptional items increased by 2 per cent 
to £59.1m (2011/12: £57.7m) reflecting 
lower finance costs. 
Exceptional charges in the year totalled 
£7.6m (2011/12: £24.8m) predominantly  
in relation to the ongoing implementation  
of the Improvement Plan.
Headline earnings per share, before 
exceptional items, increased by 2 per cent 
to 44.4p (2011/12: 43.5p). Basic earnings 
per share was 43.3p (2011/12: 31.8p).
De La Rue has continued its track  
record of good cash generation with 
net cash of £40.4m generated from 
operations. At the year end, the Group 
had a modest level of net debt of £76.7m 
(2011/12: £24.8m). Interest cover, before 
exceptional items, remained strong at  
18 times (2011/12: 15 times).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a  
final dividend of 28.2p per share  
(2011/12: 28.2p per share), reflecting  
its continuing confidence in both the 
strength of the business and in delivering 
the Improvement Plan. Together with the  
interim dividend paid in January 2013,  
this will give a total dividend for the year of  
42.3p per share (2011/12: 42.3p per share).  
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final  
dividend will be paid on 1 August 2013 to  
shareholders on the register on 5 July 2013.
Strategy
In May 2011 the Group announced the 
three year Improvement Plan, and focus on 
this will remain the priority for the business 
until the conclusion of the 2013/14 
financial year. In the year to March 2013 
we continued to build on De La Rue’s 
fundamental strengths and on addressing 
the opportunities for improvement in many 
parts of the business. As is reported below, 
significant progress, particularly on process 
improvement and cost reduction, has been 
delivered and will continue in the 2013/14 
financial year.
We enter the year with increased cost savings identified and  
a strong pipeline of order opportunities, which must of course  
be secured for delivery in the year. As a result, the Board remains 
confident of achieving the 2013/14 Improvement Plan target.
Philip Rogerson
Non-executive Chairman 15 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
We are, however, well advanced in 
developing the Group strategy for the 
period following completion of the 
Improvement Plan and expect to be 
able to share conclusions with investors 
during the later part of the financial 
year. The strategy will build further on 
the Group’s fundamental strengths of 
brand, market access, innovation and 
geographic reach and will also leverage 
leaner operating capability, further cost 
reduction opportunities and enhanced R&D 
performance post the Improvement Plan.
2010 paper production issues
Discussions remain ongoing with the 
principal customer concerned and the 
authorities, and therefore there remains 
uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome 
of these issues, including their financial 
impact (described more fully in note 25).
Board changes
Sir Julian Horn-Smith, who was appointed 
a Non-executive Director of the Company 
on 1 September 2009, stepped down as 
a Director on 31 December 2012 owing 
to his other business commitments. The 
Board would like to thank Julian for his 
wise counsel and significant contribution  
to the business. 
Andrew Stevens joined as a Non-executive 
Director of the Company on 2 January 2013, 
bringing extensive international experience 
in the technology and engineering sectors, 
having spent over 30 years operating 
across the globe.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who was 
appointed a Non-executive Director of 
the Company on 1 March 2005, and has 
served as the Senior Independent Director 
since January 2010, has decided to retire 
from the Board following the AGM in  
July 2013. Jeremy has made an invaluable 
contribution during his time on the Board 
and the Group has benefited greatly 
from his sound advice and international 
experience. The Board thanks Jeremy for 
his commitment and guidance and wishes 
him well. 
Warren East will become the Senior 
Independent Director with effect from  
25 July 2013.
Outlook
We enter the new financial year with 
increased cost savings identified and a 
strong pipeline of order opportunities, more 
than 10 per cent higher than at the same 
time last year. Whilst these opportunities 
must be secured for delivery in the year, 
the Board remains confident of achieving 
the 2013/14 Improvement Plan target of 
an operating profit in excess of £100m 
(excluding the impact of IAS 19).

Chief Executive’s review
Introduction
During the year, we have made good 
progress on the Improvement Plan and 
enter the third year of the Plan with real 
momentum. The benefits gained in cost 
savings and process improvement have 
helped improve our operating margin 
notwithstanding the challenging market 
conditions.
The Group has reported an  
8 per cent reduction in revenue to  
£483.7m (2011/12: £528.3m) largely 
reflecting lower trading volumes in the 
Currency business unit. Operating profit 
(before exceptional items) was £63.2m 
(2011/12: £63.1m). 
Savings of £12m were realised in the 
period bringing the annual cost reductions 
under the Improvement Plan to £20m. 
Order intake in the period was lower than 
originally expected, reflecting delays in a 
number of important Currency contracts, 
lower overspill and the challenging currency 
market. At the year end, the Group  
12 month order book, excluding currently 
suspended orders, was down 17 per cent 
at £207m (2011/12: £248m).
However, the pipeline of order opportunities 
is strong, with an increased level of overspill 
prospects compared with the low level 
experienced in 2012/13. We expect that  
an appropriate proportion of this pipeline 
will be converted into orders for delivery  
in 2013/14.
Delivering the Improvement Plan
We have continued to make good progress 
on the implementation of the Plan, the 
benefits of which have become more 
important in the increasingly challenging 
currency market. The improvements 
generated through the revenue initiatives 
have helped in part to mitigate these 
challenges. The cost reduction programme 
is ahead of schedule and is now expected 
to exceed our original target by £10m and 
deliver annual savings of £40m by the end 
of the Plan. We have identified further cost 
reduction opportunities that will be pursued 
in the periods beyond 2013/14.
The Plan includes an investment 
programme to improve manufacturing 
capability, quality and efficiency with capital 
expenditure in the period of £37.1m, 
bringing the cumulative spend in the first 
two years of the Plan to £69.2m. Over 
the three years of the Plan we expect 
to have invested c£100m. This ongoing 
programme will give the Group greater 
flexibility and improve its competitive 
position, allowing it to respond better  
to market opportunities.
Given the fundamental strengths of the business and real 
momentum on the Improvement Plan, I believe that the Group  
has a strong foundation from which to achieve sustainable  
growth over the long term.

Revenue growth 
Customer focus and innovation are two 
key elements of the Improvement Plan 
designed to generate sustainable long 
term growth. Both aspects are now 
well established and have considerable 
momentum throughout the organisation.
Country plans
•  These are now an established part  
of our sales planning process and are 
in use throughout the business. They 
ensure that the Group’s sales activities 
are coordinated as well as providing a 
strategic perspective on the opportunities 
in a country or region. As a result we 
have combined sales responsibilities  
in a number of territories 
Innovation 
•  R&D has become a key focus for the 
business and this year more qualified 
ideas have progressed through the 
development process. We expect the 
level of investment in R&D to increase  
to ensure we have a strong pipeline  
of new technologies, solutions and 
security features
•  Construction of the new technology 
centre is well advanced and will  
be completed on schedule during  
the summer
•  The development of Safeguard™, our 
polymer banknote substrate, and related 
security features, has been a priority. 
Three polymer note orders have been 
received during the year from both 
banknote and substrate customers 
and the first banknote produced on 
the Safeguard™ substrate, the Fiji $5, 
entered circulation in 2013  
•  We have established several promising 
technical partnerships to accelerate the 
rate of idea generation and development 
and to access technologies new to  
the industry
•  Insight™, the next generation of 
Optiks™, was launched in the year and 
we were honoured to receive the Queen’s 
Award for Enterprise: Innovation this year  
for the Optiks™ product. This is the 
twelfth time De La Rue has received  
a Queen’s Award 18 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Process improvement
•  Significant investment programmes, 
particularly in Westhoughton and 
Gateshead, are well underway and 
proceeding to plan. These, combined 
with a continued focus on lean 
manufacturing, are providing enhanced 
capability and capacity, reduced cost  
and improved quality as more up to  
date technologies are introduced
•  Excellent progress continues to be 
made in establishing a continuous 
improvement culture and in creating 
an industry leading supply chain with 
the operational flexibility to meet the 
variability in demand which is a feature 
of this ‘lumpy’ market. A key element of 
this flexibility has been the negotiation of 
new labour agreements in some facilities 
with discussions ongoing in others. 
These have been complemented by new, 
flatter management structures where 
responsibilities and accountabilities are 
much clearer
•  The strengthened quality team remains 
focused on implementing world class 
systems and processes, introducing 
proven tools and techniques from other 
industries. This has already delivered 
a significant improvement in all quality 
measures, both external and internal. 
These initiatives have been supported 
with investment in new, industry leading 
environmentally controlled quality 
laboratories and equipment
•  The Improvement Plan anticipated an 
investment programme of c£100m over 
the three year period to facilitate quality 
and productivity improvements. The 
investment programme is proceeding 
well with capital expenditure of £37m  
in the year and tangible benefits already 
being delivered
  
People
De La Rue is proud of the quality of 
its employees who are relied upon by 
customers around the world for their 
knowledge, dedication and expertise.  
In a period of ongoing change they have 
continued to meet the needs of our 
customers and embrace the necessary 
changes in the business and I thank them 
for their contribution and support.
Conclusion
We enter 2013/14 with increased cost 
savings identified and a strong pipeline  
of order opportunities which must of 
course be secured for delivery in the year. 
As a consequence, I remain confident  
of achieving the 2013/14 Improvement 
Plan target of an operating profit in  
excess of £100m.
Given the fundamental strengths of  
the business and real momentum on the 
Improvement Plan, I believe that the Group 
has a strong foundation from which to 
achieve sustainable growth over the  
long term.
Chief Executive’s review
Continued
Cost reduction
The Improvement Plan included targeted 
cost reductions of £30m (excluding 
movements in cotton comber pricing) from 
process improvement, procurement and 
facility optimisation. Excellent progress 
has been made in all areas, and with the 
experience gained from these initiatives we 
have now identified opportunities for further 
savings primarily in process improvement 
and procurement. Based on current 
volume expectations, these opportunities 
are targeted to generate an additional 
£10m of annual cost reductions by the  
end of the Plan. 
Facility optimisation
•  The relocation of operations from the 
Stroudley Road and Dunstable factories 
into the Westhoughton and Gateshead 
facilities respectively is now complete. 
This consolidation is generating savings 
of £6m per annum and we are already 
benefiting from improvements in the 
operating performance of the transferred 
processes in their new locations
Procurement
•  A strong procurement team has been 
established and is proving effective at 
generating cost reductions in the supply 
chain by deploying skills and techniques 
developed outside the industry
•  As a result the procurement cost 
reduction target has been raised  
by 25 per cent to £15m per annum
•  Supplier quality improvement and 
relationship management programmes 
have been introduced, we believe for 
the first time in the industry. These have 
already been successful in driving quality 
improvement, accelerating innovation  
and delivering cost reduction in the 
supply base

Improvement Plan
Our three year Improvement Plan was launched in May 2011  
to deliver revenue growth and cost reduction. The Plan leverages 
De La Rue’s fundamental strengths of brand, reputation, customer 
relationships and innovation. 
We have made good progress during the first two years of the  
Plan and enter the third year with considerable momentum. 
The Improvement Plan will provide a strong foundation on which  
to build the Group’s future strategy.

Libya
Following the revolution in Libya in 2011, one 
of the first tasks of the Central Bank of Libya 
was to replace the banknotes to reflect the new 
regime. In late 2012 De La Rue was awarded 
the contract following a robust international 
tender process and work on the new banknotes 
began in earnest. Libyan designers provided the 
original design concepts reflecting iconic images 
of the country. Working in close cooperation 
with De La Rue’s design team these were 
transformed into the final banknote designs. 
On 17 February 2013, to mark the second 
anniversary of the revolution, the first of the  
new banknotes was introduced into circulation.
Operational review
Currency 
Provides market leading printed 
banknotes, banknote paper 
and a comprehensive portfolio 
of banknote security features. 
Working in partnership with its 
customers to provide effective 
currency solutions, the business 
also advises on critical issues 
of currency strategy such as 
design, demand forecasting, 
denominational structure and 
protection against counterfeiting. 
Performance in 2012/13
Banknote print volume at 6.3bn notes was 
similar to the prior year (2011/12: 6.4bn) 
notwithstanding delayed orders and  
lower overspill volumes in the market. 
Paper output volume was, as expected, 
down 21 per cent at 8,700 tonnes 
(2011/12: 11,000 tonnes) primarily 
reflecting more challenging market 
conditions as a result of excess  
market capacity. 
Revenue decreased by 12 per cent 
to £298.1m (2011/12: £340.6m) with 
operating profit down 16 per cent at 
£38.0m (2011/12: £45.5m). These results 
reflect the reduced paper and component 
volumes, a less favourable product mix and 
pricing pressure in the currency market as 
a whole. These adverse factors have been 
mitigated in part by the further benefits 
of the Improvement Plan and lower raw 
material and component costs, most 
notably on cotton, which had a favourable 
impact of £6m compared with 2011/12. 
Order intake in the period was lower  
than originally expected, reflecting delays 
in a number of important contracts, lower 
overspill and the challenging currency 
market. At the year end, the Currency  
12 month order book, excluding currently 
suspended orders, was down 14 per cent 
at £158m (2011/12: £183m). However,  
the pipeline of order opportunities is strong, 
more than 10 per cent higher than the prior 
year, with an increased level of overspill 
prospects compared with the low level 
experienced in 2012/13. We expect that  
an appropriate proportion of this pipeline 
will be converted into orders for delivery  
in 2013/14.
Barbados
A new family of banknotes was issued in 
Barbados on 2 May 2013. This is the first major 
redesign of Barbados’ banknotes since the first 
series was issued in 1973. 
The six denominations – $2, $5, $10, $20, 
$50 and $100 – have been retained in this 
new issue. The imaginative design of the new 
series includes portraits on the front of famous 
Barbadians who have made a significant 
contribution to society, with new reverse images 
celebrating their achievements. De La Rue has  
worked closely with the Central Bank of Barbados 
since it was established, and was delighted to 
be asked to contribute to the design of the new 
banknote series. 
In addition to designing and producing 
banknotes for Barbados, De La Rue 
manufactures the Barbados passport.

Market
The key drivers determining the 
requirement for, and the type of, banknotes 
used around the world remain the need to 
provide security in the banknote ahead of 
the counterfeiter’s capabilities, the durability 
and efficiency of the banknote in circulation 
and the level of economic activity. 
Market demand for banknotes continues 
to grow on average at about 4 per cent 
annually although the rate varies around the 
world reflecting local circumstances. The 
market available to commercial providers 
of banknotes and their components is 
expected to grow at a broadly similar  
trend rate. 
Variability in demand is a feature of  
the market, with short term fluctuations 
in the timing and size of orders reflecting 
the decisions taken by central banks. This 
has the potential to create material volume 
variation year on year for commercial 
providers such as De La Rue. 
De La Rue has continued to invest in R&D 
to ensure that it can offer its customers the 
very best security features and innovations. 
The focus has been on durability and 
printed features including: 
•  Safeguard™, De La Rue’s polymer 
substrate product (see page 4 for  
further information). Our first customer  
for this product, Fiji, has issued its 
polymer denomination into circulation 
(see case study, right) and a number  
of other customers, one of which has 
its own printing works, have purchased 
Safeguard™. Their banknotes will be 
issued during the course of 2013
•  SPARK
®
 Orbital™ (see page 6 for further 
details). This feature is designed for use 
on both paper and polymer substrates
•  Spectrum™, a new print feature building 
on proven latent technology (see page 5 
for further details)
De La Rue has also improved its capability 
in thread making, foil application and paper  
coatings to give more options for customers. 
The demand for effective, good value 
security features remains a strong driver  
in the market and De La Rue’s focus on its 
R&D portfolio reflects this. During 2012/13 
nearly twice as many Currency related 
patents were filed compared with the 
previous year.
Fiji
In December 2012 the Reserve Bank of Fiji 
unveiled its new series of banknotes based 
on flora and fauna designs celebrating Fiji’s 
biodiversity. The entire series, comprising vibrant 
and elegant images, was designed and printed 
by De La Rue and incorporates the latest security 
features. The $5 denomination within this 
series is the first banknote in circulation using 
De La Rue’s Safeguard™ polymer substrate.

Solutions
Provides specialist physical and 
digital products and services, 
including cash processing, 
revenue and brand protection, 
identity solutions, and financial 
and secure documents. 
Cash Processing Solutions (CPS)
Performance in 2012/13
The decreased revenue and operating 
profit mainly reflect reduced second half 
volumes and in particular customer related 
delays in large sorter installations straddling 
the period end. Service revenues were 
slightly lower than the prior year but remain 
an important source of income. The first 
two DLR 9000 single note inspection 
machines are now in operation in the 
Gateshead Currency print facility, with  
a further machine planned for 2013/14. 
The level of customer enquiries for this  
new product has been encouraging.
Market
Maintaining a currency’s integrity and 
minimising the cost of handling cash  
is an important element of a central  
or commercial bank’s operation.
With the increasing volumes of cash in 
circulation, both central and commercial 
banks are under pressure to provide 
efficient, secure cash processing solutions. 
Using sophisticated vault software and 
hardware solutions, much of the process 
can be automated while also providing the 
data and controls needed to minimise cost 
and ensure the quality and integrity of the 
notes processed. 
De La Rue addresses these needs with 
both its advanced cash sorting machines 
and market leading vault management 
software. De La Rue supports and 
maintains customer solutions via a global 
network of engineers, often working at 
customer sites.
Operational review
Continued
Vaultex reaps benefits of ECM™
Vaultex is one of the largest commercial  
cash processing operations in the UK and has 
established a longstanding strategic partnership 
with De La Rue. This close relationship has 
enabled us to work together to deliver Vaultex’s 
objectives of reducing operational costs and 
increasing productivity. De La Rue installed 
its ECM™ Business Intelligence software to 
identify production inefficiencies and monitor 
improvements. This targeted deployment of  
new technology increased processing capacity 
by over 15 per cent since implementation  
18 months ago. The key partnership benefit  
is that both Vaultex and De La Rue use the  
same data to manage both the process and  
the infrastructure.
Security Products 
Performance in 2012/13
Revenues were adversely affected by 
reduced volumes but this was more than 
offset by an improved product mix and 
the benefits of the Improvement Plan. 
Notably, the project to move the Dunstable 
operation into the Gateshead factory was 
successfully completed ahead of schedule. 
To meet the customer need for a flexible 
solution, in a market that we expect to 
grow strongly, a significantly enhanced  
tax stamp track and trace solution is  
being developed. This project is well 
advanced and the solution is expected 
to be available to customers during the 
2013/14 financial year.
Market
Governments and commercial brand 
owners continue to come under attack 
from criminal activity that affects revenue 
streams and consumer confidence. 
Governments continue to work hard to 
protect indirect tax revenues on products 
such as alcohol and tobacco by minimising 
illicit trade. In 2012, 135 countries signed  
up to the World Health Organization 
Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control, which is committed to eliminating 
illicit trade in tobacco products. This will  
require governments to implement unique  
and secure codes onto cigarette packs 
and also the ability to track and trace 
the products through the supply chain. 
De La Rue is strongly placed to address 
this market having delivered its flexible track 
and trace solution for several customers. 
Revenue loss from counterfeit goods 
remains a real threat to global brands. 
Advanced product technology within 
labels, linked to digital authentication  
and tracking solutions, ensures brands  
are protected and that consumers can  
be confident of buying genuine products.

Identity Systems (IDS)
Performance in 2012/13
The Identity Systems operation has 
performed strongly throughout the year, 
reflecting increased revenues and operating 
profit within the international part of the 
business. Performance on the underlying 
UK ePassport contract remained 
strong, benefiting from further process 
improvements within the Improvement 
Plan. In addition the roll out of a local  
print solution to Her Majesty’s Passport  
Office’s seven UK regional issuing offices  
was completed. During the period the 
business achieved the notable milestone  
of producing the ten millionth UK ePassport 
since the contract commenced.
Market
The passport and identity market is 
increasingly seeking complete integrated 
solutions, with highly secure passports and 
ID cards, full and robust integration with 
other government systems and processes 
and efficient and reliable personalisation 
and issuance procedures.
Countries continue to adopt ePassports, 
which is driving not only the demand for 
further system integration, but also the 
need for expertise to take them on the 
journey and manage the project efficiently 
and without undue risk. 
De La Rue is a leading provider of passport 
and ID solutions and continues to deliver 
complex projects globally. It is able to 
offer an in house passport design and 
production capability as well as issuance 
and passport personalisation systems. 
Additionally, De La Rue’s experienced 
project managers are well versed in 
complex system roll out and integration 
projects globally. 
Identity Systems is a contract based 
business focused on government 
customers. The nature of this business  
is such that revenues can be variable and 
subject to cancellation or delay. Maintaining 
as broad a portfolio of business as possible 
and a strong pipeline of opportunities helps 
mitigate this risk.
UK ePassport – local print solutions
Between March and July 2012 De La Rue rolled 
out a local passport personalisation solution 
which is critical to Her Majesty’s Passport 
Office’s seven regional issuing offices. This 
enables HM Passport Office to provide eligible 
customers with a full passport in as little as four 
hours, for an additional fee.
Working closely with HM Passport Office, the 
local print solution was designed, implemented 
and deployed using core functionality from  
De La Rue’s MIDIS™ software product. 
Microsoft Windows 8 launch
Working in partnership in the fight against 
intellectual property and brand piracy, De La Rue 
began supplying a new security label in July 2012  
to support the launch of Windows 8.
The new brand focused security label was jointly 
developed to reflect the branding for Windows 8 
while also incorporating a number of secure 
features which, when layered together, provide 
a visual method of authentication. De La Rue 
worked under an extremely tight schedule to 
deliver the new label on time to support the 
global launch date and to accommodate the  
pre launch build requirements.

Introduction
The 2012/13 year has proved a more 
difficult one than expected, with order 
delays and a more competitive market 
place impacting the Group’s results. 
However, good progress has been  
made on the Improvement Plan which  
has helped to mitigate the challenging  
market environment. 
Financial results
The Group has reported an 8 per cent 
reduction in revenue to £483.7m  
(2011/12: £528.3m). This reduction 
primarily reflects lower trading volumes  
in the Currency business unit.
Operating profit before exceptional items 
was in line with the prior year at £63.2m 
(2011/12: £63.1m) with lower material 
costs and Improvement Plan savings 
offsetting the reduced trading volumes  
and a less favourable product mix. The 
Improvement Plan savings of £12m realised  
in the period bring the annual cost reductions  
under the Plan to £20m. As a result, the 
Group operating profit margin (before 
exceptional items) improved to 13.1 per cent 
(2011/12: 11.9 per cent). Foreign exchange 
movements adversely impacted revenue  
by £3m and operating profit by £2m 
(2011/12: £1m and £1m respectively). 
Profit before tax and exceptional items 
increased by 2 per cent to £59.1m 
(2011/12: £57.7m) reflecting lower finance 
costs of £4.1m (2011/12: £5.4m). Headline 
earnings per share, before exceptional 
items, also increased by 2 per cent to 
44.4p (2011/12: 43.5p). 
Exceptional charges in the year totalled 
£7.6m (2011/12: £24.8m) predominantly  
in relation to the ongoing implementation  
of the Improvement Plan. Basic earnings 
per share was 43.3p (2011/12: 31.8p).
De La Rue has continued its track record 
of good cash generation with net cash of 
£40.4m generated from operations. At the 
year end, the Group had a modest level  
of net debt of £76.7m (2011/12: £24.8m).

Exceptional items
Exceptional costs of £7.6m were incurred 
in 2012/13 in connection with the ongoing 
costs of implementing the Improvement 
Plan (2011/12: £24.8m). This brings the 
cumulative exceptional charges taken in 
respect of the Improvement Plan to a total 
of £31.7m. The cash cost of exceptional 
items in the period was £17.3m  
(2011/12: £3.7m) bringing the cumulative 
cash cost under the Improvement Plan  
to date to £21.0m.
The £7.6m exceptional operating charge 
reported in 2012/13 (2011/12: £24.8m) 
comprised £0.8m (2011/12: £11.3m) in  
staff compensation, £0.2m (2011/12: £1.1m)  
of fixed asset impairment charges, £4.3m  
(2011/12: £8.8m) for site exit costs and  
£2.3m (2011/12: £2.9m) in other associated  
reorganisation costs. The exceptional 
charge in 2011/12 also included additional 
costs of £0.7m associated with the paper 
quality issue that arose in 2010/11.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 28.2p per share which, 
together with the interim dividend  
paid in January 2013, will give a total 
dividend for the year of 42.3p per share 
(2011/12: 42.3p per share). 
The Board’s normal dividend policy  
is to maintain a cover of 1.75 times on 
underlying earnings. The proposed total 
dividend for the year is covered 1.05 times 
which, although below the policy level, 
reflects the Board’s confidence in delivering 
the Improvement Plan.

Taxation
The net tax charge for the year was 
£7.4m (2011/12: £0.7m). The effective 
tax rate, before exceptional items, was 
23.5 per cent (2011/12: 24.1 per cent), 
predominantly reflecting the reduction  
in the UK statutory tax rates. 
A credit of £2.1m (2011/12: £6.2m) arises 
on the exceptional items noted above. In 
addition there was an exceptional credit of 
£4.4m (2011/12: £7.0m) in respect of the 
determination of the tax treatment of prior 
year exceptional items. 
Cash flow and borrowings
Cash inflow from operations was £40.4m 
(2011/12: £78.4m) primarily reflecting the 
high level of cash spend on exceptional 
items and an increase in year end working 
capital. The movement in working capital 
predominantly reflects an increase in  
trade debtors resulting from the timing  
of shipments around the year end. 
Advance payments increased to £42.7m 
(2011/12: £40.9m). Capital expenditure 
of £37.1m (2011/12: £32.1m) was higher 
than depreciation, reflecting expenditure  
on Improvement Plan projects.
The Group ended the year with modest  
net debt of £76.7m (2011/12: £24.8m). 
During the period the Group renewed and 
increased its revolving credit facility from 
£175m to £200m. As the draw downs 
on this facility are typically rolled over on 
terms of between one and three months 
the borrowings are disclosed as a current 
liability. This is notwithstanding the long 
term nature of this facility which expires  
in December 2016.
The key financial covenants on this facility 
remain unchanged and require that the 
ratio of EBIT to net interest payable be 
greater than four times and the net debt  
to EBITDA ratio be less than three times. 
At the year end the specific bank covenant 
tests were as follows:
EBIT/Net interest payable: 16.1 times
Net debt/EBITDA: 0.97 times

Capital structure
At 30 March 2013 the Group had net 
liabilities of £66.6m (31 March 2012: £45.6m), 
predominantly reflecting the increase  
in retirement benefit obligations and 
dividends paid.
The Company had shareholders’ funds 
of £273.0m (2011/12: £204.8m) and had 
99.7m fully paid ordinary shares in issue 
(2011/12: 99.5m) at the year end.
Interest charge
The Group’s net interest charge  
was £3.6m, down on the prior year 
(2011/12: £4.1m). The IAS 19 related 
finance cost, which represents the difference  
between the interest on pension liabilities 
and the expected return on assets,  
has reduced to £0.5m (2011/12: £1.3m)  
as a result of the lower discount rate used  
to calculate the interest charge.

Pension deficit and funding
During 2012/13, special funding  
payments of £16.2m were made to  
the Group’s defined benefit pension  
fund (closed to new members in 2010  
and future accrual from April 2013).  
The Group’s latest formal (triennial) funding 
valuation of the UK defined benefit pension 
scheme took place on 5 April 2012 and 
identified the scheme had a deficit of 
£180m (5 April 2009: £204m deficit).  
The arrangements in respect of the special 
funding payments remain unchanged and 
are expected to eliminate the deficit in line 
with the original timetable by 2022.
 
IAS 19 – Employee Benefits
The valuation of the UK pension scheme 
under IAS 19 principles indicates a 
scheme deficit pre tax at 30 March 2013 
of £166.7m (31 March 2012: £143.3m), 
an increase of £23.4m. This change 
primarily reflects increased scheme 
liabilities resulting from increased longevity 
assumptions and reduced discount rates 
applied to the scheme valuation being 
partly offset by asset growth. The charge 
to operating profit in respect of the UK 
pension scheme for 2012/13 was £7.8m 
(2011/12: £7.8m). In addition, under IAS 19 
there was a finance charge of £0.5m arising  
from the difference between the expected 
return on assets and the interest on 
liabilities (2011/12: £1.3m).
Amendments to the IAS 19 accounting 
standard will be effective for the 2013/14 
financial year. This requires the replacement 
of the expected return on assets and 
interest charge on pension scheme 
liabilities with a net financing cost based 
on the discount rate. IAS 19 requires 
retrospective adoption and therefore prior 
periods will be restated. 
The Group estimates the impact of the 
change, had it been effective in 2012/13, 
would have been to increase operating 
costs by £1.4m, increase the net interest 
expense by £6.2m, with compensating 
adjustments in other comprehensive 
income leaving equity unchanged.  
This would therefore reduce profit after  
tax by £7.6m and reduce headline and 
basic EPS by 7.6p. 
The estimated impact for the 2013/14  
year is to reduce operating profits by 
£1.7m (the Improvement Plan operating 
profit target will be impacted by the same 
amount) and increase the net interest 
expense by £6.7m and hence reduce 
headline and basic EPS by 8.4p.
The IAS 19 calculation is sensitive to small 
changes in the base assumptions used in 
the valuation. An indication of the sensitivity 
is as follows:
 Change in Change in 
 assumption liability
Discount rate +0.1% +£15m
 -0.1% -£15m
Inflation rate +0.1% +£12m
 -0.1% -£12m 27 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Risk and risk management
During the year, the Board carried out its 
annual review which covered all material 
controls including financial, operational, 
legal and technology controls and risk 
management systems. The Board also 
received information about the Group’s 
operations throughout the year enabling it 
to evaluate regularly the nature and extent 
of the risks to which the Group is exposed. 
An Ethics Committee was established by 
the Board, further details of which can be 
found on page 45.
Committed to effective  
risk management
Effective risk management requires 
collective responsibility and engagement 
across the entire business. 
In addition to risk management being  
a Board level responsibility, members  
of De La Rue’s senior management team, 
operating through the Risk Committee, are 
accountable for identifying, mitigating and 
managing risk in their areas of responsibility. 
The Risk Committee assists management 
in conducting risk reviews, analysing risk 
information and reviewing De La Rue’s risk 
management. The internal audit function 
plays an important role in advising and 
producing guidance on risk related matters 
and integrating risk management into 
business processes.
The UK Corporate Governance 
Code requires the Board to 
maintain a sound system of 
internal control to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and 
the Group’s assets and at least 
annually to conduct a review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control.
Risk management processes
With the appointment of a Group Director 
of Risk and Internal Audit in April 2012, the 
Group’s risk management framework has 
been enhanced to provide greater clarity on 
key risks, the effectiveness of key controls 
and accountability for actions. 
De La Rue management conducted  
a number of risk reviews throughout the 
year in preparation for the Board’s annual 
internal controls and risk management 
assessment. In 2012/13 risk review 
activities included the following:
•  Business unit risk workshops focused  
on operational risks and uncertainties 
which could affect the achievement  
of business objectives
•  Functional risk workshops with various 
centralised departments, including central 
finance, security, legal, human resources 
and information services 
•  Updating the consolidated risk register, 
discussed and approved by the Risk 
Committee, which paid particular 
attention to ensuring that additional 
mitigating actions were determined  
and agreed as appropriate

Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. It relies on the 
Audit and Risk Committees to assist in 
this process. Details of these Committees 
are set out in the corporate governance 
statement on page 45 and 46.
Management is responsible for 
implementing the controls which are 
designed to meet the particular needs 
of the Group, and the risks to which it 
is exposed, with procedures intended 
to provide effective internal control. The 
controls by their nature are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk and can 
only provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. 
System of internal control
The principal elements of the Group’s 
system of internal control are:
•  An organisation and management 
structure which operates across the 
business to enable both the delivery  
of products and services to our 
customers and operational control  
of business activities
•  Management reporting including  
monthly finance, operational and 
development reports
•  Group wide policies and procedures 
which define expected standards 
and behaviours and which have been 
redefined and updated. Our policy 
framework includes policies on finance, 
operations, people, regulatory and IT 
business controls
•  The Board and its various Committees, 
which define financial authorities and 
operational responsibilities, designed  
to enable effective decision making  
and organisational control
•  Group central functions: finance, human 
resources, company secretariat and legal, 
health, safety and environment, security 
and information services, which have 
responsibility to manage and improve 
standards in their respective areas of 
responsibility across all our operations
A formal risk identification process  
takes place to evaluate and manage  
the significant risks faced by the Group  
in accordance with the requirements  
of the UK corporate governance codes.  
A Group risk register identifies the risks  
the business faces, their potential impact 
and likelihood of occurrence. The key 
controls and management processes 
established to mitigate these risks include:
•  The Risk Committee, which meets twice 
each year to review the management  
of risk arising out of the Group’s activities 
and to monitor the status of key risks  
and actions
•  Risk registers maintained by each of 
the Group’s business units and central 
functions. The management team 
together with the Group Director of  
Risk and Internal Audit meet to consider 
the status of risks and progress against 
implementing actions on a quarterly basis
•  Annual compliance statements in the 
form of self audit questionnaires and 
management certification, which are 
completed for each of De La Rue’s main 
sites on the operation of financial control
•  Reviews by the Audit Committee,  
which assist the Board in discharging  
its responsibility to review the system  
of internal control (see page 46 for  
further details)
•  An internal audit function, which is  
subject to the controlling direction  
of the Audit Committee, and which 
provides the Audit Committee with an  
assessment of the Group’s system of  
internal control, through reviewing how  
effectively key risks are being managed, 
and assists management in the effective 
discharge of their responsibilities by  
carrying out appraisals and making  
recommendations for improvement  
(see page 46 for further details)
The overall system of internal control is 
supplemented by an operating financial 
control framework which includes the 
following key features:
• An annual strategic planning process
• An annual budget
•  A system of monthly reporting by each 
operating unit which involves comparison 
of actual results with the original budget 
and the regular updating of full year 
forecasts
•  Monthly reporting of performance  
to the Board
•  Audited annual financial statements
•  Interim financial statements reviewed  
by the auditors
•  Capital management (see note 12  
to the accounts for further information)
•  Treasury, foreign exchange and borrowing 
facilities (see note 12 to the accounts for 
further information)
The main controls, which address the 
financial implications of the major business 
risks, are centred on strict approval 
procedures. These are reviewed annually, 
approved by the Board and apply to all 
subsidiaries. They include:
•  Executive Directors’ approval of all major 
non routine revenue expenditure
•  Board approval of all major capital 
expenditure
•  Board approval of all acquisitions and 
disposals
•  A system of authorisation limits which 
cascades throughout the Group
•  Board consideration of any matter likely 
to have a material effect on the Group 29 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Risk Exposure Mitigation/Comment
Strategic risks
Failure to maintain 
competitive and 
technologically 
advanced products 
and services
The Group operates in competitive 
markets and our products and services are 
characterised by continually evolving industry 
standards and changing technology, driven  
by the demands of our customers
Failure to maintain technical innovation  
may result in loss of market share and  
lower margins
The Group invests in R&D to create new technologies, products and 
services to sustain or improve its competitive position
The Group has made a number of improvements to the organisation  
of R&D including: centralising innovation expertise, developing a product 
roadmap, investing £4m in a new R&D technology centre and formalising 
a new technology management process
The Group regularly reviews its R&D portfolio as part of the strategic 
planning process
Financial risks
The timing and 
frequency of 
substantial contract 
awards can be 
uneven
The timing of contract awards can be uncertain 
and delays in awards may result in volatility in 
the order book and our operating performance
Political factors can also delay government 
procurement decisions for sensitive products 
like banknotes and passports
Close and regular contact is maintained with customers so that any 
changes in requirements are recognised promptly
The Group monitors its sales activity, order pipeline and forward order 
book in order to ensure that our production planning is optimised to 
deliver on time and in full to our customers
Any delays in order confirmation are monitored on a weekly basis to 
ensure that supply chain remains flexible and is able to accommodate 
required production planning changes
Failure to win or renew 
a material contract
Failure to win or renew a material contract 
could restrict growth opportunities and/or have 
an adverse impact on the Group’s financial 
performance and reputation
Our relationship with issuers, many of whom are currently or have  
been customers, together with our detailed country plans, ensures  
we are aware of opportunities as they arise. Our sales and commercial 
management teams focus on tender responses which are governed 
through a stage gate process which includes financial, technical, 
production, commercial and contractual reviews
Our track record of delivering product innovation and our commitment  
to quality, when combined with a commercial approach to tendering, 
places us in a good position to win or renew strategic or significant 
contract opportunities
Operational risks
Financial loss and/or 
damage to reputation 
as a result of failing 
to deliver product to 
customer specification
Each of our contracts requires a unique product 
to be specified and delivered. Some of these 
contracts demand a high degree of technical 
specification. On a contract by contract basis 
we will be required to deliver to exacting 
quality standards and any shortfall in quality 
management may expose us to additional  
cost to remake and/or warranty costs
The Group has an established quality management system operating 
across all of our supply chain manufacturing sites which are all certified  
to ISO9001 quality management standards
Supplier failure The Group has close trading relationships  
with a number of key suppliers
Loss or failure of a key supplier, the inability 
to source critical materials or poor supplier 
performance in terms of quality or delivery 
could disrupt the Group’s supply and ability  
to deliver on time and in full
Our exposure is reduced by the fact that the Group can source many  
of its components from within the De La Rue supply chain
Where external supply is required, either at the request of the customer 
or where the Group does not have the required manufacturing capability, 
the Group has established procedures for identifying possible risks for 
each supplier. Key suppliers are managed through a supplier relationship 
management programme that includes checks on their creditworthiness, 
ability to deliver to our quality standards and security and business 
continuity arrangements. Suppliers are audited on a rotational basis
As a contingency, alternative suppliers are pre qualified wherever possible 
and where necessary we retain higher levels of stocks
Principal risks and uncertainties
The following pages set out the principal risks affecting the Group, which are not listed in any order of materiality. In addition there may 
be other risks which are currently believed to be immaterial, which could turn out to be material to the Group. These risks, whether they 
materialise individually or simultaneously, could significantly affect the Group’s business and financial results. Due to the very nature of 
risks, mitigating factors stated should not be viewed as assurances that actions taken or planned will be wholly effective. 30 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Risk and risk management
Continued
Risk Exposure Mitigation/Comment
Operational risks continued
Product security There is the potential for reputational and 
financial damage in the event of the loss of 
materials from a manufacturing site as a result 
of negligence or theft. Loss of product while 
in transit, particularly during transhipment, 
through the failure of freight companies or 
through the loss of an aircraft or vessel as  
a result of an accident or natural disaster,  
is also possible. Under its contracts with  
its customers, the Group may be liable  
for those losses
Robust physical and audit security procedures at production sites reduce 
the risk of an inadvertent loss or theft during manufacturing. Movements 
of security materials between Group sites and onward delivery to 
customers are conducted applying stringent operational procedures 
using carefully selected carriers and suitably screened personnel. All 
movements are risk managed and monitored globally on a 24/7 basis. 
The Group maintains a comprehensive global insurance programme
Health, safety or 
environmental failure
All of De La Rue’s activities are subject 
to extensive internal health, safety and 
environmental (HSE) procedures, processes 
and controls. Nevertheless, there is a risk  
that failure of process could, in the worst  
case, lead to a serious or fatal injury or  
an environmental breach
The Group operates a robust HSE management system which is 
internally audited and certified to the OHSAS18001 and ISO14001 
standards in all major facilities. The Group HSE Committee regularly 
reviews HSE performance which is also monitored monthly by the supply 
chain leadership and reported to the Board monthly. Each manufacturing 
facility has clear HSE action plans which are prioritised, monitored and 
subject to review by local senior management to ensure that health and 
safety standards are maintained
Loss of a key site There are a number of key manufacturing sites 
across the business. The total loss of any one 
of these key sites could have a major financial 
impact, particularly where the site forms a 
single source of supply for the business
The business has a high degree of interoperability between sites for 
banknote production and security printing. We aim to minimise risk  
by adopting the highest standards of risk engineering in our production 
processes, particularly to reduce risks from fire hazards and the use  
of flammable solvents
In anticipation of increasing customer requirements we continue to 
enhance our business continuity resilience to a consistent good practice 
standard across all of our major facilities
Legal and regulatory risks
Breach of legal 
and regulatory 
requirements
It is possible that employees acting either 
individually or in collusion with others could 
act in contravention of the Group’s stringent 
requirements in relation to bribery and 
corruption, competition and third party partners 
(TPPs), resulting in major reputational and 
financial damage to the business
The ethical tone of the business is articulated in the Code of Business 
Principles which is supported by underlying policies, regularly reviewed 
and enforced robustly. Non compliances are dealt with through 
disciplinary procedures where necessary
The Group’s whistleblowing policy and procedure forms an integral part 
of the compliance framework. Particular focus is given to the operation 
and development of our anti bribery and corruption and competition law 
control frameworks
The Group has a process for the appointment, management and 
remuneration of TPPs which operates independently of the sales 
function. The behaviours of TPPs are strictly monitored and the TPP 
process is overseen by the General Counsel and Company Secretary 
who reports directly to the Board on these matters
Competition law compliance is driven through regular training for sales 
personnel and senior managers together with oversight by the Group 
legal function
Information risks
Breach of data 
security or 
confidentiality
The confidentiality and integrity of our 
customer, employee and business data could 
be affected by factors that include human  
error, ineffective design or operation of key  
data security controls or through breakdown  
of IT control processes. Any compromise of the 
confidentiality of information could impact our 
reputation with current and potential customers
The Group keeps all aspects of information security arrangements  
under regular review. There are a number of controls in place to  
manage this risk including network segregation, access restrictions,  
system monitoring, security reviews and vulnerability assessments  
of infrastructure and applications
Loss of core IT 
systems availability
Outages and interruptions could affect 
the Group’s ability to conduct day to day 
operations. These could be caused by physical 
damage to the main data centres or malicious 
cyber activities
Our data centres are resilient and secure. Disaster recovery plans are  
in place to assist in prompt recovery from any significant system outages 
or interruptions. Business continuity arrangements, including business 
impact assessments and regular testing, are kept under regular review 
and are subject to independent external verification

Corporate responsibility
Our approach to corporate 
responsibility
We take seriously our responsibility to 
manage the business in an ethical and 
sustainable way for the benefit of the 
business and all our stakeholders.
We have:
•  Maintained our membership of the 
FTSE4Good Index which identifies 
companies that meet recognised 
standards of corporate responsibility
•  Supported the Institute of Business Ethics 
(IBE) which was founded to encourage 
high standards in ethical behaviour and is 
supported by donations from companies 
and individuals. Through our donation we 
help to promote ethical business practice 
and add to the work of the IBE through 
the sharing of good practice and their 
experience of ethical issues
•  Continued to report our greenhouse 
gas emissions to the Carbon Disclosure 
Project
We are always keen to improve our 
practices and during the year an 
independent third party was commissioned 
to conduct a corporate responsibility audit 
to review how we compare to current 
best practice. We will be using the results 
as a gap analysis to inform our corporate 
responsibility focus during 2013/14; our 
initial focus will be on improving internal 
and external communication of our wide 
range of corporate responsibility activities 
to improve awareness and understanding 
and promote employee engagement.
Accountability and management 
processes
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for assessing the impact of corporate 
responsibility issues on the Group’ s business 
and for setting appropriate policies. During 
the year a new Ethics Committee was 
formed made up entirely of Non-executive 
Directors. This Committee is responsible 
for advising the Board on the development 
of strategy and policy on ethical matters. 
Further details about the Ethics Committee 
can be found on page 45. 
The Chief Executive is the Board member 
with designated responsibility for corporate 
responsibility supported by: 
• The Executive Committee 
•  The Risk Committee, which discusses 
corporate responsibility at its meetings 
in the context of monitoring the 
effectiveness of internal control systems 
•  The Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee, whose responsibilities 
include making recommendations on 
health, safety and environmental strategy 
and identifying areas for improvement
Ethical framework
Code of Business Principles 
All employees are required to follow 
the Code of Business Principles (CBP) 
approved by the Board when performing 
their duties as employees. Employees and 
business partners worldwide must follow 
this CBP when they are representing  
the Group.
Areas covered by the CBP , which is 
available on our website, are shown in  
the ethical framework diagram on page 32. 
The CBP is a key part of the new employee 
induction process worldwide and refresher 
training was given at a number of internal 
conferences and departmental meetings 
during 2012/13. This will be extended 
during 2013/14 to ensure that the 
messages are being delivered consistently 
across the business. Ethics champions  
will also be appointed across the Group  
to provide a point of contact and focus  
in the sites. 
Whistleblowing
The Group’s whistleblowing procedures 
enable employees who have concerns 
about the application of the CBP or 
business practices within the Group to raise 
them internally or anonymously through an 
independently run telephone helpline, the 
De La Rue CodeLine. The Board and Audit 
Committee receive details about any issue 
raised and how it has been followed up. 
Each year the Audit Committee reviews  
the policy and procedures. 
Third party partners
The Group third party partner (TPP) 
team continues to develop and refine 
the processes and procedures for the 
appointment and reappointment of 
distributors, sales agents and consultants. 
These processes are subject to audit and 
external verification. All applications for 
appointment, reappointment and renewal 
of TPPs are managed by this central 
team which reports directly to the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary. 
All TPPs:
•  Are subject to an appropriate level  
of due diligence
•  Receive training on the CBP and the 
standards of ethical behaviour expected 
by De La Rue 
•  Receive training covering anti bribery 
and corruption, competition law and TPP 
policy. More than 75 per cent of partners 
receive this training online, with the 
remainder receiving one to one training 
Relevant employees also participate  
in online training which covers working  
with TPPs.
We recognise that good 
corporate responsibility practices 
are key to our business success. 
We work within a robust ethical 
framework and strive to ensure 
the health and safety of our 
employees, minimise our impact 
on the environment and play a 
positive role in the communities 
in which we operate. 
Celebrating 300 years of papermaking
As part of our celebrations of 300 years of 
papermaking a ‘Design a banknote’ competition 
was held in schools local to our Overton mill site 
(see winning entry pictured above). The winners 
visited our design team and were presented with 
a professionally produced version of their design. 
Other activities to mark the tercentenary included 
a customer seminar covering a wide range of 
banknote related topics and employee events. 32 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Continued
Health and safety 
We have a responsibility to safeguard 
the health and safety of all stakeholders 
affected by our operations and keeping 
employees safe and secure when they  
are at work and travelling on business  
is a priority. Clearly defined responsibilities, 
good communication and training, 
hazard spotting, risk assessments and 
implementing appropriate controls at  
all facilities help us to achieve this.
All of our supply chain manufacturing  
sites have maintained OHSAS18001:2007 
certification for their health and safety 
management systems, which is externally 
audited by accredited providers. 
During the year no De La Rue operation 
has been prosecuted for infringing any 
health and safety laws or regulations.
The Executive Committee and the Board 
receive confirmation that the business units 
and functions comply with Group policy and 
applicable laws through external and internal 
audits on their management systems, 
reports and measurement against action 
plans. These reports are used to develop 
effective improvement programmes. 
De La Rue works with its main suppliers 
and contractors to ensure their health 
and safety processes are robust. This 
year, in response to the many changes 
and upgrades at our sites, including the 
relocation of holographic and security 
printing operations and the installation of 
many new machines, we have continued 
to put a strong focus on our machinery 
safety standards and on managing our 
contractors. We have continued to improve 
our fire risk management controls with 
several sites upgrading sprinkler systems. 
Our health and safety KPIs are shown 
opposite. Disappointingly, the number 
of lost time accidents and the total days 
lost due to accidental injuries have both 
increased slightly this year with lost days 
exceeding our target by 17 per cent and 
injuries by 12 per cent. These results are 
attributable in large part to structural and 
organisational changes in our business. 
With more organisational changes in the 
short term, we expect that the coming year 
will be challenging as we drive to retain 
our strong safety culture, excellent internal 
reporting processes and engage employees 
in our safety programmes. We will continue 
to set robust health and safety targets. 
Liverpool Football Club Community 
Coaching Team visit Malta
In April 2012 the Liverpool Football Club 
Community Coaching Team visited Malta  
to deliver a variety of community activities.  
A De La Rue Malta employee helped to facilitate 
the visit and the site supported this initiative 
by providing footballs and all the equipment 
required to hold a training session for children 
with additional needs. We also supported 
school visits in Rabat and Bir ˙ zebbu ˙ ga which 
included disability awareness sessions and 
‘Truth for Youth’ assemblies, promoting hard 
hitting social messages. All children participating 
in these events were presented with gifts to 
commemorate the event, funded by De La Rue. 33 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Other objectives for 2012/13 related to 
legal compliance audits and occupational 
health provision. Our health, safety and 
environment legal compliance audit 
programme was completed earlier than 
planned and we continued to raise the 
standards of occupational health provision 
at our main sites.
Our health and safety objectives for 
2013/14 are:
•  To align our HSE internal audit 
programme with the new combined 
assurance audits for security and quality
•  To maintain a reportable injury rate per 
100,000 employees of 325 or lower 
•  To ensure that all new machinery installed 
meets the latest EU safety standards
•  To maintain our OSHAS18001 certification 
at all supply chain manufacturing sites
Employees
Employee survey 
With the recent organisational changes 
it has been important to focus on staff 
engagement and an employee survey  
was launched in June 2012. All employees 
were invited to participate, responding to 
questions designed to test opinions and 
engagement across the organisation in  
four key areas:
•  Do employees understand the direction 
and objectives of the organisation?
• Do they believe in it?
• Are they able to contribute to it?
• Do those around them contribute to it?
The results were encouraging, with  
70 per cent of all employees across the 
organisation responding to the survey.
Training and development
Aligned to the feedback from the employee 
survey, training has been focused on the 
areas of leadership capability, involving 
people in the business and improving 
our listening and communication skills, 
improving the interfaces between the 
businesses and aligning vision, behaviours 
and objectives across the Group. 
Across our manufacturing operations 
a structured line management training 
programme was launched. The 
programme’s initial focus includes 
coaching, team performance and quality 
training. Individual units of the programme 
are aligned to the National Occupational 
Standards for Leadership and 
Management. With over 100 managers 
worldwide participating in the programme, 
the aim is to raise leadership capability, 
engage employees in our process 
improvement initiatives and embed and 
maintain a high performance culture.
In our non manufacturing operations  
we have initiated a programme to develop 
leadership capability. Starting with the 
Executive Committee, the programme 
will be cascaded through the senior 
management team during 2013/14. This 
will provide a useful tool for performance 
development and support our talent review 
succession programme.
Communication
As well as regular briefings for employees 
based at our supply chain sites, the 
Solutions business unit runs “all hands” 
calls every two or three months and 
Solutions and Currency produce 
newsletters to keep colleagues informed 
of business developments. These activities 
are supplemented by internal conferences 
and team briefings across the business. 
The Chief Executive hosts regular 
conference calls in which all employees 
have the opportunity to participate and  
ask questions. 
Improving communication at our 
manufacturing sites was identified as  
an area requiring focus following feedback 
from the 2012 employee survey. Initiatives 
successfully implemented include 
questions being raised and answered 
through question boxes and meetings  
with site management teams so employees 
can ask questions about, and comment 
on, the business in an informal setting.
De La Rue communicates regularly with 
the unions representing its employees 
and its UK and European Works Councils. 
The UK National Employee Forum 
and European Employee Forum are 
both composed of elected employees, 
management representatives and 
employee nominated full time trade union 
officers. The Unite Union branch official 
with national responsibility for De La Rue 
serves as a permanent member of the UK 
and European Works Councils. A General 
Workers Union official from Malta is also 
a permanent member of the European 
Works Council.
A joint UK and European Forum 
meeting was held during the year. The 
meeting received a detailed briefing on 
the Improvement Plan from the Chief 
Executive and included information on 
how we are developing our front line 
managers. In addition to the joint meeting, 
steering group meetings for both forums 
are held throughout the year and can 
be called for any special requirements. 
Both forums receive formal updates on 
strategic business performance from 
senior managers and Executive Committee 
members. Open discussion and questions 
are encouraged.

Equality and diversity
De La Rue’s policy is to treat all employees 
fairly and equally, regardless of their sex, 
transgender status, sexual orientation, 
religion or belief, marital status, civil 
partnership status, age or perceived age,  
race, colour, nationality, national origins, 
ethnic origin, disability, trade union 
membership or affiliation.
Equal opportunity is about good 
employment practices and efficient use  
of our most valuable asset, our employees. 
Every manager and employee has personal 
responsibility for the implementation of our 
equal opportunity policy.
De La Rue provides training to employees 
and newly appointed line managers 
in equal opportunities and associated 
policies and procedures, such as 
stress management, grievance and anti 
harassment. Through these policies and 
our CBP , De La Rue encourages a culture 
of openness whereby concerns related to 
equal opportunities can be raised in a non 
threatening and supportive environment.
To the extent permitted by relevant local 
laws, the Group collects certain data on 
staff diversity.
For information about Board diversity,  
see page 43.
Gender diversity
De La Rue currently has two female  
Non-executive Directors (25 per cent  
of the Board), and one female Executive 
Committee member (12 per cent). 
Approximately 26 per cent of the workforce 
and 22 per cent of managerial grade 
employees are female.
Environment
The Group endeavours to operate in a 
manner that minimises the environmental 
impact of our activities, products and 
services. None of the Group’s operations 
has been prosecuted for infringing any 
environmental laws or regulations  
during 2012/13.
The organisation has a mature 
environmental management system and 
all of our supply chain manufacturing sites 
have achieved ISO14001:2004 certification. 
The Group continues to measure 
greenhouse gas emissions and has now 
adopted methods contained in DEFRA 
guidance in advance of mandatory 
reporting. This year the organisation has 
included all six main greenhouse gases 
covered by the Kyoto Protocol and 
improved the way in which significant 
scope 3 emissions are calculated.  
Corporate responsibility
Continued
This, combined with a change in fuel  
mix affecting scope 1 and 2 emissions,  
resulted in an increase in calculated 
greenhouse gas emissions of 2.3 per cent.  
The emissions intensity, which is now 
reported relative to Group revenue, 
therefore increased by 11.7 per cent. 
However, energy consumption across  
the Group was unchanged from 2011/12.
Water used per gross tonne of banknote 
paper produced is dependent on volume 
and detailed specifications. Water usage 
increased by 4.3 per cent compared with 
the prior year reflecting lower production 
volumes, which impacted efficiency, and 
changes in the mix of paper manufactured.
Supply chain manufacturing sites continued  
the ‘War on Waste’ initiative to improve 
resource efficiency and reduced the total 
amount of solid waste by 3.3 per cent while 
continuing to evaluate alternative waste 
management options. The percentage of 
solid waste recycled or recovered dropped 
slightly to 71 per cent primarily due to 
product mix and anti counterfeiting features 
which reduced the amount of waste that 
could be composted.
Examples of environmental achievements 
over the past year include:
•  Successful trials of a new effluent 
treatment process in Gateshead 
•  Process improvements enabling the 
permanent closure of a thermal oxidizer 
used for the abatement of solvent from 
printing activities, reducing both energy 
consumption and scope 1 greenhouse 
gas emissions
•  Introduction of an energy management 
programme to reduce energy 
consumption and costs across 
the Group, and promote ongoing 
improvements in operating efficiencies 
Environmental objectives for 2013/14  
are to:
•  Maintain ISO14001 certification for  
all supply chain manufacturing sites
•  Reduce waste sent to landfill by  
3 per cent each year during the three 
year period ending in 2013/14 
•  Reduce energy consumption related 
to Group revenue by 3 per cent each 
year during the three year period ending 
in 2013/14. In absolute terms energy 
consumption across the Group has 
decreased by 6.0 per cent to date,  
and energy intensity has decreased  
by 9.9 per cent over the past two years

Community and charitable donations
De La Rue supports a variety of charitable 
causes. In 2012/13 Group donations 
for charitable and community purposes 
amounted to £66,000 (2011/12: £93,000) 
and donations from the De La Rue 
Charitable Trust totalled £66,000  
(2011/12: £59,000).
The De La Rue Charitable Trust aims 
to direct funds to appropriate causes 
worldwide emphasising educational 
projects promoting relevant skills, self help 
initiatives or relieving suffering. The Trust 
also matches funds raised by employees 
for charitable causes. In the past year 
over 90 employees in the UK took part 
in sponsored activities and received 
donations for their chosen charity from  
the Charitable Trust. 
Our employees, facilities and factories 
continue to engage widely with local 
communities. Examples of activities during 
2012/13 include making donations of 
warm clothing and sleeping bags to a local 
homeless centre, a relay run in the UK from 
our Debden site to our head office and 
providing footballs and training equipment 
for an initiative run in Malta by Liverpool 
Football Club Community Coaching for 
children with additional needs (see case 
study on page 32).
As part of our 200 year celebrations  
all sites are being encouraged to support 
local community and charitable causes. 
These initiatives will be reported in the 
2014 annual report.
The Group operates a Give As You 
Earn scheme in the UK which enables 
employees to make regular donations  
to charity from their pre tax monthly salary. 
Donations are matched by De La Rue up 
to £500 per employee per annum and are 
included in the donation figure given above.
Customers
Customer focus is a key commitment  
of our Improvement Plan. 
During the year Currency and Cash 
Processing Solutions conducted a survey 
of their central bank and state print work 
customers. Preliminary results of the survey 
show an increase in customer satisfaction, 
with the majority of customers who 
responded being very likely to recommend 
De La Rue to a colleague or associate with 
similar needs. We were recognised as being 
particularly strong in our customer service 
and responsiveness. The final results of 
our analysis will be used to inform detailed 
action plans to improve our offering. 
In November 2012 the Solutions  
business unit opened a new training 
centre at our Dublin facility. As well as 
being a key investment for our employees’ 
development it also offers new operator 
training products to help customers in their 
drive for productivity and efficiency. 
Regional conferences and user group 
meetings are held on a regular basis  
and we run an annual ‘Advanced  
Banknote Manager’ course which is 
available to our central bank and state  
print work customers.
Suppliers
De La Rue continues to apply a consistent 
set of procurement policies and processes 
to deliver accountability, sustainable value 
for money and continuous improvement 
while enabling the Group to fulfil its legal 
and financial obligations and effectively 
manage risk. In particular, De La Rue 
expects its suppliers to share the Group’s 
commitment to best practice standards in 
health and safety, environmental protection, 
quality, product security and business 
continuity management. 
Suppliers are obliged to abide by the CBP 
and the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and International Labour 
Organisation Conventions 138 and 182. 
During 2012/13 on a sample of key 
suppliers of cotton comber, we carried  
out audits to ensure that labour and 
working conditions are suitable and comply 
with the Group’s policies relating to child 
labour. As part of our ongoing procurement 
programme we will continue to monitor our 
key cotton comber and linter suppliers.

power of Directors to allot shares pursuant 
to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 
will be sought from shareholders at the 
AGM. The Company was granted authority 
by its shareholders at the 2012 AGM to 
purchase a maximum of 10 per cent of its 
own ordinary shares either for cancellation 
or to be held in treasury (or a combination 
of these). No purchases have been made 
pursuant to this authority and a resolution 
will be put to shareholders to renew the 
authority for a further period of one year.
 
Rights and restrictions on shares  
and transfers of shares
Certain restrictions, which are customary 
for a listed company, apply to the rights 
and transfers of shares in the Company. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary and deferred shares, in 
addition to those conferred on their holders 
by law, are set out in the Company’s 
articles of association, copies of which can 
be obtained from Companies House in the 
UK or by writing to the Company Secretary. 
The key points are summarised below.
Ordinary shares
Notices of meetings must be given to every 
shareholder and to any person entitled 
to a share unless the articles or the rights 
of the shares say they are not entitled 
to receive them from the Company. The 
Board can decide that only people who are 
entered on the register of members at the 
close of business on a particular day are 
entitled to receive the notice. On a show 
of hands, each holder of shares present in 
person and entitled to vote has one vote 
and, upon a poll, each such holder who is 
present in person or by proxy and entitled 
to vote has one vote for every share held. 
Dividends and distributions on winding  
up to shareholders
Holders of ordinary shares may receive 
interim dividends approved by Directors 
and dividends declared in general meetings. 
On a liquidation and subject to a special 
resolution of the Company the liquidator 
may divide among members in specie  
the whole or any part of the assets of  
the Company and may, for such purpose, 
value any assets and may determine how 
such division shall be carried out.
 
Shareholders and share capital
Transfers of shares
The Company’s articles place no 
restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares or on the exercise of voting rights 
attached to them except: (i) in very limited 
circumstances (such as a transfer to more 
than four persons), (ii) where the Company 
has exercised its rights to suspend their 
voting rights or to prohibit their transfer 
following the omission by their holder or 
any person interested in them to provide 
the Company with information requested 
by it in accordance with part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006, or (iii) where the 
holder is precluded from exercising rights 
by the Financial Services Authority’s Listing 
Rules, the City Code on Takeovers and 
Mergers or any other regulations.
Dealings subject to the Model Code  
of the Listing Rules
Pursuant to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, Directors  
and other persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities and certain employees 
require the approval of the Company to 
deal in the ordinary shares of the Company.
Exercise of rights of shares in employee 
share schemes
Awards held by relevant participants under 
the Company’s various share plans carry 
no voting rights until the shares are issued. 
The Trustee of the De La Rue Employee 
Share Ownership Trust does not seek to 
exercise voting rights on existing shares 
held in the employee trust. No shares are 
currently held in trust. 39 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Relationship with shareholders 
The Company places great importance  
on communications with and accountability 
to shareholders. A fully audited annual 
report and accounts is made available to  
shareholders either in hard copy by post 
or via the Group’s website and the interim 
statement is posted on the Group’ s website. 
Announcements are also regularly made  
by the Company through a Regulatory  
Information Service to the London Stock  
Exchange. The Chairman and the Senior  
Independent Director are available  
to meet key shareholders to discuss  
strategy, governance and other matters.  
All holders of ordinary shares are entitled  
to attend the AGM and receive the notice 
of meeting which is posted at least 20  
working days before the AGM. 
They are also entitled to speak at general 
meetings of the Company, to appoint one 
or more proxies or, if they are corporations, 
corporate representatives, and to exercise 
voting rights. Shareholders may vote and 
appoint proxies electronically. 
At this year’s AGM, voting on resolutions 
will be conducted on a poll, the results 
of which will be made available to 
shareholders on the Group’s website.  
At the meeting, the Chairman will provide 
a trading update and the Chairmen of the 
Board Committees will also be present to 
answer questions on any matters relating 
to the Group’s business. Shareholders 
also have an opportunity to meet Directors 
informally after the meeting. 
The share register is actively monitored. 
During the year meetings take place with 
individual institutional shareholders and 
analysts, and presentations are made 
at the time of major announcements. 
Additionally, the Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director, Executive Directors 
and some Non-executive Directors 
together with members of the Executive 
Committee met with major shareholders 
and analysts in June 2012. The views of 
shareholders and analysts’ and brokers’ 
reports are reported to the Board and 
from time to time a survey of institutional 
shareholders’ views is carried out by the 
Company’s brokers.
Additional information to shareholders
Processes for the appointment and 
replacement of Directors are governed 
by the Company’s articles of association, 
The UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. The articles of association  
may be amended by special resolution  
of shareholders. The powers of the Board 
are described in the corporate governance 
report on pages 42 to 47.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 10:30 on Thursday

Introduction
De La Rue plc is incorporated as a public 
limited company and is registered in 
England and Wales under the Companies 
Act 1985 with registered number 3834125 
and has its registered office at De La Rue 
House, Jays Close, Viables, Basingstoke, 
Hampshire, RG22 4BS.
The Directors present their annual report  
for the period ended 30 March 2013, which 
includes the business review, corporate 
governance report and audited financial 
statements for the period. Pages 1 to 58 
inclusive of this annual report comprise a 
Directors’ report which has been drawn up 
and presented in accordance with English 
law and the liabilities of the Directors in 
connection with that report are subject  
to the limitations and restrictions of such 
law. This Directors’ report also represents 
the management report for the purpose  
of compliance with DTR 4.1.5R of the  
UK Listing Authority disclosure rules.
The business review contains certain 
forward looking statements which 
are subject to assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties; actual future results may 
differ materially from those expressed in or 
implied in such statements. Many of these 
assumptions, risks and uncertainties relate 
to factors that are beyond De La Rue’s 
ability to control or estimate precisely.  
The forward looking statements reflect the 
knowledge and information available at the 
date of preparation of this annual report, 
and will not be updated during the year. 
Nothing in this annual report should be 
construed as a profit forecast. 
Payments to suppliers
As the Company is a holding company 
and does not trade, it owed no amounts 
to trade creditors at 30 March 2013 
and therefore the number of creditor 
days required to be shown in this report 
to comply with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 is nil.
The Group subscribes to the policies in 
the UK Government’s Prompt Payment 
Scheme and undertakes to pay suppliers 
on time, give clear guidance and 
encourage good practice. More details  
can be found on the Group’s website.
Change of control 
Contracts
There are a number of contracts which 
allow the counterparties to alter or 
terminate those arrangements in the event 
of a change of control of the Company. 
These arrangements are commercially 
sensitive and confidential and their 
disclosure could be seriously prejudicial  
to the Group.
Banking facilities
The £200m credit facility between the 
Company and its key relationship banks 
contains a provision such that, in the event 
of a change of control, any lender may, if it 
so requires, notify the agent that it wishes 
to cancel its commitment whereupon the 
commitment of that lender will be cancelled 
and all its outstanding loans, together with 
accrued interest, will become immediately 
due and payable.
Employee share plans
In the event of a change of control, 
automatic vesting would occur in 
accordance with the relevant scheme  
or plan rules. 
Political donations
The Group’s policy is not to make any 
political donations and none were made 
during the year. The Company will propose 
to shareholders at this year’s AGM that the 
precautionary authority granted at the 2012 
AGM, pursuant to the Companies Act 
2006, be renewed and details are included 
in the notice of meeting.
Essential contracts or other 
arrangements
The Group has a number of suppliers  
of key components, the loss of which 
could disrupt the Group’s ability to deliver 
on time and in full. However, none of these 
arrangements are so vital that their loss 
would affect the viability of the Group  
as a whole. 
Other statutory information 41 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report and the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors  
to prepare Group and Parent Company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance  
with UK accounting standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of 
the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•  Select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently
•  Make judgements and estimates that  
are reasonable and prudent
•  For the Group financial statements,  
state whether they have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted  
by the EU
•  For the Parent Company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the Parent Company financial statements
•  Prepare the financial statements  
on the going concern basis unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Parent Company will 
continue in business 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
Directors are also responsible for preparing 
a Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration 
report and corporate governance 
statement that comply with that law and 
those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on 
the Group’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors who held office at the date  
of approval of this report confirm to the 
best of their knowledge:
•  The Group financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
•  The management report represented by 
the Directors’ report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Group and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face
 
Provision of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date 
of approval of this Directors’ report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
each Director has taken all the steps that 
he or she ought to have taken as a Director 
to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
Auditors
Our auditors, KPMG Audit Plc have 
instigated an orderly transfer of its business 
to its parent company, KPMG LLP . The 
Board has decided to put KPMG LLP 
forward to be appointed as auditors and  
a resolution concerning their appointment 
will be put to the forthcoming AGM of  
the Company.
By order of the Board
Edward Peppiatt
Company Secretary
29 May 2013 42 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
In the period to 30 March 2013, as 
detailed below and in the risk and risk 
management report and the remuneration 
report on pages 27 to 30 and 48 to 58 
respectively, the Company complied fully 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (June 2010) (the Code). 
We explain in the report below and in 
the risk and risk management report and 
remuneration report how we have applied 
the provisions of the FSA Listing Rules, the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the 
Code. The Code is publicly available at  
www.frc.org.uk 
The Group’s corporate governance 
procedures, which are approved by the 
Board, define the matters reserved to the 
Board, the terms of reference of various 
Committees of the Board and the functions 
delegated to these Committees, as well 
as defining the jobs of the Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director and 
Non-executive Directors. The Company 
reviews and amends its corporate 
governance policies to reflect changes  
to legislation and good practice.
Business ethics
The Group delivers high profile security 
print products to customers across the 
world, offering them security, confidence 
and efficiency. It is essential that the Group 
maintains the trust and confidence of its 
customers, and everyone it deals with, 
both inside and outside the Group, by 
demonstrating complete integrity in the way 
the Group and its business partners behave.
The Group has clear core values and 
principles which govern how the Group 
does business and which everyone within 
the Group must follow. The way the Group 
delivers these will be reflected in the way 
the Group competes for business and 
delivers its services.
Regular external audits are undertaken  
of the Group’s anti bribery and corruption 
policies and processes. These audits have 
confirmed that the Group is following best 
practice and compares well with similar 
companies, reflecting the work undertaken 
in this area in recent years. 
An Ethics Committee has been established, 
consisting of the Non-executive Directors 
of the Company. Further information on this 
Committee is set out on page 45 and the 
terms of reference of the Ethics Committee 
are on the Group’s website.
Further information on the Group’s ethical 
framework can be found on pages 31 to 32.
The Board 
The Board is collectively accountable  
to the Company’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance and all Directors 
are responsible for complying with their 
legal and fiduciary obligations. The 
Board is firmly committed to complying 
with the highest standards of corporate 
governance, which is the system of 
internal principles, controls and processes 
it approves and by which the Group is 
run in order to achieve its objectives while 
complying with the required standards  
of accountability and probity.
The core objectives of the Board are:
•  Delivering value to shareholders and 
other stakeholders
•  Maintaining the Company’s reputation 
for integrity as the Company’s foundation 
of its relationship with stakeholders, 
shareholders, customers, staff and 
suppliers
•  Building long term success through 
innovation, quality and sound 
management
Board composition and responsibilities 
The Board comprises five independent 
Non-executive Directors, the Non-executive 
Chairman and two Executive Directors. The 
Board has concluded that its composition 
throughout the year was and remains 
appropriately balanced. 
There is a clear division between the 
management of the Board and the 
Executive Directors’ responsibility for 
managing the Group’s business. However, 
no individual or small group can dominate 
decision making. The roles of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive are separated and 
clearly defined. 
The Chairman is primarily responsible for 
the working and leadership of the Board 
and he provides continuity, experience  
and governance to the Board process.  
In particular the Chairman will act in such  
a way as to ensure that:
•  The Board takes balanced and objective 
decisions in the performance of its 
agreed role and functions
•  The Board sets a strategy for the future 
of the business and recruits and retains 
the people in the Group it needs to 
implement that strategy
•  High standards of probity throughout the 
Group are established
•  Shareholders are kept properly informed 
on all important matters 
The Chief Executive is responsible for 
running the business and implementing 
Board strategy and policy. In particular 
the Chief Executive has operational 
responsibility to:
•  Maintain a senior management team with 
the appropriate knowledge, experience, 
skills, attitude and motivation to achieve 
the Company’s objectives
•  Exercise personal leadership and 
develop, on an ongoing basis, a 
management style which encourages 
excellent and open working relationships 
at all levels within the Group
•  Ensure through the Group Finance 
Director, the implementation, control and 
coordination of the Group’s financial and 
funding policies approved by the Board
•  In conjunction with the Executive 
Committee, comprising business unit 
managing directors and other senior 
executives, present strategic options  
for growth in shareholder value 
•  Set the operating plans and budgets 
required to deliver the agreed strategy 
The role and responsibilities of the 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, Senior Independent Director and 
other Directors are also clearly defined. Full 
details are set out on the Group’s website. 
The Executive Directors and the Executive 
Committee operate within clearly defined 
limits of authority delegated by the Board.
Board changes
Nicholas Brookes retired as Chairman  
and as a Non-executive Director on  
26 July 2012. He was succeeded by  
Philip Rogerson, who joined the Board  
as Chairman designate on 1 March 2012. 
Sir Julian Horn-Smith resigned from the 
Board on 31 December 2012. 
Andrew Stevens joined the Board as a 
Non-executive Director on 2 January 2013. 
As he was appointed a Director since the 
last AGM he will, being eligible, offer himself 
for election at the AGM. 
Sir Jeremy Greenstock will retire from the 
Board following the AGM in July 2013. 
The Non-executive Directors hold letters 
of appointment which will be displayed 
at the AGM, together with the Executive 
Directors’ service agreements and 
Directors’ indemnification agreements. 
Role and operation of the Board 
The Board has a programme of meetings 
during the year and it also meets on an 
ad hoc basis as required. The Board’s 
core procedures are set out in the terms 
of reference for the Board, its Committees 
and Directors and include the control  
of risk.
Corporate governance statement 43 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
The Board has also reserved certain 
matters to itself to reinforce its control  
of the Group. Full details are set out  
on the Group’s website. These include: 
•  Determining the responsibilities of 
Directors, in particular those of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive
•  Approving internal control processes 
•  Approving the final and interim financial 
statements 
•  Approving, in conjunction with the  
Audit Committee, the recommendation  
of dividends
•  Approving appointments to, and 
removals from, the Board and the terms 
of reference and membership of Board 
Committees
•  Approving the Group’s strategy and 
annual budget 
•  Authorisation of authority levels, financial 
and treasury policies and any acquisition 
or disposal
Subject to the provisions of relevant 
statutes, the Company’s articles of 
association and any directions given  
by special resolution, the Directors may 
exercise all the powers of the Company.
Role of Non-executive Directors 
The Non-executive Directors, all of 
whom are considered by the Board to be 
independent as at 30 March 2013, have 
an appropriate range of business, financial 
and international experience which is 
relevant to the Company’s activities and 
which allows them constructively to assist 
in the development of strategy. None 
of the Non-executive Directors holds a 
material shareholding in the Company. 
Under the Code, Philip Rogerson ceased 
to be independent after his appointment 
as Chairman on 26 July 2012 but the 
Board considers that his contribution 
and objectivity in Board and Committee 
discussions were fully consistent with those 
of an independent director. 
Sir Jeremy Greenstock is the Senior 
Independent Director until his retirement 
from the Board at the conclusion of the 
2013 AGM when he will be succeeded  
by Warren East. Shareholders may contact 
the Senior Independent Director if they 
consider that their concerns are not being 
addressed through normal channels. 
Non-executive Directors confirm on 
appointment, and any reappointment,  
that they are able to allocate sufficient time 
to enable them to discharge their duties 
properly. Directors who have been unable 
to attend Board or Committee meetings 
have made known their views on pertinent 
matters before the meeting.
Non-executive Directors are expected  
to participate actively in Board discussions 
involving the following key elements: 
•  Strategy: constructively challenge and 
contribute to the development of strategy
•  Performance: review the performance  
of management in meeting agreed goals 
and objectives 
•  Risk: ensure that the financial and other 
information is accurate and appropriate 
to enable the Non-executive Directors to 
fulfil their roles and that financial controls 
and systems of risk management are 
robust and defensible
•  People: contribute to the development of 
appropriate levels of senior management 
(including Executive Directors) and 
succession planning
Board evaluation and effectiveness review 
A performance evaluation of the Board and 
each of the Nomination, Remuneration and 
Audit Committees is carried out annually. 
The performance evaluation for 2013 
involved the use of an external independent 
facilitator, Linstock Limited. 
The 2013 effectiveness review 
process involved completion of online 
questionnaires which focused on Board 
composition, expertise and dynamics, 
Board support and process, structure, 
behaviours and key issues, such as 
strategy and succession, against delivery  
of the Board’s objectives and addressing 
any issues identified during the previous 
review or which became relevant during 
the year. A report on the performance 
of the Board and each of the principal 
Committees was compiled and presented 
to the Board and each relevant Committee 
as a basis for discussing and agreeing 
appropriate actions for the forthcoming 
year. The Risk Committee was evaluated 
by the Board.
The Chairman and each Committee 
Chairman has discussions with each 
Director or Committee member based  
on the responses. The Senior Independent 
Director is responsible for appraising the 
Chairman’s performance in discussions 
with the Non-executive Directors in the 
absence of the Chairman. The Chairman 
and the Non-executive Directors also meet 
in the absence of the Executive Directors. 
The Board and individual Committees 
considered the output from the review 
in May 2013 and concluded that the 
performance of the Board, its Committees 
and individual directors were effective.  
Any areas for improvement are agreed  
by the Board. 
Commitment 
The Directors’ biographies and other 
appointments appear on pages 36 and 37. 
The Board’s policy is that the Chairman 
and Executive Directors should accept 
appointments to the boards of other 
companies only with the prior approval of 
the Board. Non-executive Directors must 
seek the agreement of the Chairman and 
confirmation by the Board before accepting 
additional commitments that may affect  
the time they devote to their role. The 
Board is satisfied that these commitments 
do not conflict with their ability to carry  
out effectively their duties as Directors  
of the Company. 
Board diversity
The Board recognises and understands 
the importance and benefits of gender 
diversity and currently has two female 
Non-executive Directors (25 per cent of the 
Board). The Board expects to maintain the 
proportion of women Directors to at least 
the current level, while maintaining flexibility 
to ensure that all appointments are made 
on merit, regardless of gender. 
The Group’s equality and diversity policy 
is discussed further in the corporate 
responsibility report on page 34.
Succession planning 
The Board reviews its composition at 
least annually, assessing the skills profile, 
diversity, type and number of Non-
executive Directors required to enable the 
Board to perform effectively. The Board 
also reviews the Group’s internal talent 
review process in planning Executive 
Director and senior management 
succession. 
Induction and training 
All new Directors receive an induction 
on joining the Company, for which the 
Chairman is responsible. This covers 
such matters as the strategy, operation 
and activities of the Group (including 
key financial data, and business, social 
and environmental risks to the Group’s 
activities), corporate governance matters 
such as the role of the Board and individual 
Committees, and the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures as outlined in this 
report. They are advised on the duties and 
obligations of directors of a listed company. 
Site visits and meetings with senior 
management are also arranged. Any newly 
appointed Director, who has not previously 
been a director of a listed company, is 
invited to attend external training covering 
such duties and responsibilities. 44 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Directors are briefed, where appropriate, 
by the Company’s external advisers and 
functional management on changes to 
legislation, regulation or market practice. 
Briefings from individual businesses are 
also received throughout the year. The 
Directors have the opportunity of attending 
appropriate training sessions. 
The Board visits at least one operational 
site each year (Malta and Overton in 
2012/13). Directors are also encouraged  
to visit other sites and meet with staff.  
The General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, in conjunction with the 
Chairman, ensures that there is proper 
communication between the Board and 
its Committees and senior management 
and that Non-executive Directors receive 
appropriate information. The Chairman 
reviews and the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary facilitates induction 
and other professional development  
as required. 
Directors may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, although no such advice was 
sought during the year.
Board protocol
The Board timetable ensures that the Board 
receives regular reports and presentations 
from the Executive Directors, operational 
managing directors and key functions. 
Directors receive agendas and Board 
papers generally five days before each 
Board meeting; minutes are circulated as 
soon as possible after the meeting. The 
Board reviews progress on implementing 
actions arising from the Board and its 
Committee meetings each month.
There is also a defined procedure for 
dealing with urgent matters between  
Board meetings. 
Any Director can request additional 
information from management at any 
time. All Directors have direct access to 
the advice and services of the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary who 
is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed. The Board 
decides the appointment and removal  
of the Company Secretary. 
Appointments and annual election
All Directors are required to submit 
themselves for annual re-election. New 
Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity after their 
appointment. Non-executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial period of three years 
with the expectation of two such three year 
terms subject to satisfactory performance. 
The Board may invite a Non-executive 
Director to serve a further term after six 
years following a detailed review at the  
end of this period, subject to re-election. 
The Board, having carried out the 
effectiveness and evaluation process, 
considers the performance of each of 
the Directors standing for election and 
re-election at this year’s AGM to be fully 
satisfactory and is of the opinion that they 
have demonstrated ongoing effectiveness 
and continued commitment to the role.
The Board strongly supports their 
election and re-election and recommends 
that shareholders vote in favour of the 
resolutions at the AGM. 
Conflicts of interests
Directors have a duty to avoid a direct  
or indirect interest which conflicts, or may 
conflict, with the interests of the Group 
unless that conflict has been authorised 
by the Board. Such conflict may arise 
by reason of a situation or a specific 
transaction. The Board has established a 
process to review at least annually and, if 
thought appropriate, authorise any conflict 
of interest and has carried out such review 
and authorised all Directors’ situational 
conflicts. Any transactional conflicts are 
reviewed as they arise. Directors are asked 
to review and confirm reported conflicts of 
interests as part of the year end process.
Indemnity
To the extent permitted by the Companies 
Act 2006 and the FSA Listing Rules the 
Company indemnifies certain officers so 
that the Company may advance defence 
costs in civil or regulatory proceedings on 
such terms as the Board may reasonably 
determine but any advance must be 
refunded if the Director or officer is 
subsequently convicted. The indemnity  
will not provide cover where the Director or 
officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Corporate responsibility
Information on the Group’s initiatives and 
commitment to corporate responsibility 
can be found in the corporate responsibility 
report on pages 31 to 35.

Committees of the Board
The Board has established Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination, General 
Business, Ethics and Risk Committees  
with appointed Chairmen and fixed terms 
of reference which are reviewed annually. 
The terms of reference and duties of the 
Board and its Committees appear on the 
Group’s website and are also available  
on request. The Board is satisfied that the 
Committees have the appropriate balance 
of skills, experience and independence and 
that they discharged their responsibilities 
satisfactorily. Membership of these 
Committees is given in the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 36 and 37. Further 
details of Committees and key activities 
performed during the year are given 
elsewhere in this annual report. 
Ethics Committee
The Board established the Ethics 
Committee in September 2012 comprising 
all Non-executive Directors and chaired 
by the Chairman with the Chief Executive 
Officer in attendance. The General Counsel 
and Company Secretary is secretary to the 
Committee and advises on governance.
The main responsibilities of the Ethics 
Committee are to:
•  Advise the Board on the development  
of strategy and policy on ethical matters
•  Advise the Board on steps to be taken to 
embed a culture of integrity and honesty 
in all of the Group’s business dealings
•  Oversee the Group’s policies and 
procedures for the identification, 
assessment, management and reporting 
of ethical risk
•  Oversee the development and 
adoption of, and compliance with, the 
Group’s ethical due diligence policies 
and procedures covering business 
relationships, including third party 
partners and mergers, acquisitions  
and major new projects
•  Oversee the investigation of any 
material irregularities of an ethical nature 
and review subsequent findings and 
recommendations
The Ethics Committee will bring an 
impartial viewpoint and best practice from 
other industries and underlines the Group’s 
commitment to ensuring that business 
ethics are a fundamental and enduring  
part of the Group’s culture.
Nomination Committee
The Committee consists of five 
independent Non-executive Directors  
at the date of this report together with  
the Chairman (who chairs the Committee)  
and the Chief Executive. 
The Committee meets at least once a year 
and otherwise as necessary and makes 
recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any vacancies for Executive or 
Non-executive Directors or other changes 
to the composition of the Board that are 
considered necessary. The Committee has 
the power to employ the services of such 
advisers as it deems necessary in order to 
carry out its responsibilities. The Committee 
also reviews the time commitment required 
of Non-executive Directors at least once 
a year. The Board, as a whole, approves 
the appointment and removal of Directors 
and retains appropriate executive search 
consultants, having prepared a job 
specification for the particular role to be 
filled. The principal activity of the Committee 
during the year was succession planning 
and the recruitment of Andrew Stevens, 
our new Non-executive Director, following a 
rigorous recruitment process in conjunction 
with an external search consultant. 
Remuneration Committee 
Gill Rider was appointed to the 
Remuneration Committee in July 2006  
and she has been the Committee 
Chairman since 26 July 2007. Details  
of the Committee and of the remuneration 
policy can be found in the remuneration 
report on pages 48 to 58. 
Risk Committee 
Core responsibilities of the Risk Committee 
are to:
•  Assist the Board by assessing and 
reporting on the effectiveness, and 
promoting awareness of, the Group’s 
internal control and risk management 
systems
•  Assist the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities by reviewing the framework 
for managing risks throughout the Group
•  Provide an appropriate level of reporting 
on the status of risk management within 
the Group
•  Provide an appropriate level of reporting 
to the Board, which retains the overall 
responsibility, on the status of internal  
risk management 
The Committee, chaired by the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary, meets 
and reports to the Board at least twice a 
year. Other members of the Committee 
include the Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, heads of the principal functions, 
all divisional managing directors, the Group 
Director of Risk and Internal Audit and the 
Group Director of Security. Any Director 
is entitled to attend any meeting. At the 
year end, following review by the Audit 
Committee of internal financial controls and 
of the processes covering these controls, 
the Board evaluates the results of the risk 
management procedures conducted by 
senior management.
The Committee is assisted by Group  
wide committees which deal with specific 
areas of risk such as the Health, Safety  
and Environment Committee and the 
Security Committee. 
Details of risk management and particular 
risks within the Group are set out on pages 
27 to 30. 
Internal controls 
The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code relating to internal 
control, which require the Board to review 
the effectiveness of internal controls and 
to have in place an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the key risks including financial and non 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. 
Further details are contained in the risk and 
risk management report on pages 27 to 30. 
This process has been in place throughout 
the year and up to the date of approval 
by the Board of the annual report and 
accounts. The Board concluded its latest 
review in May 2013. 
This does not extend to associated 
companies or joint ventures where the 
Group does not have management control.  46 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Report of the Audit Committee  
of the Board 
I am pleased to present the report of the 
Audit Committee for the period. 
The role of the Audit Committee is to 
review and report to the Board on the 
Group’s financial reporting, internal control 
and risk management processes and the 
independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditor KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG).
The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee are available on the Group’s 
website.
The following report details the 
Committee’s responsibilities and key tasks 
during the period.
Warren East
Chairman of the Audit Committee
29 May 2013
Composition of the Audit Committee
Warren East was appointed Chairman  
of the Audit Committee on 1 April 2009. 
He has been the chief executive of a listed 
company and therefore has strong financial 
experience. In addition, Victoria Jarman 
is a chartered accountant and is chair of 
the audit committee at Hays plc and has 
relevant financial experience. All members 
of the Audit Committee are independent 
Non-executive Directors. At the invitation 
of the Committee Chairman, meetings are 
attended by the Chairman, Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director, General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, Group Director 
of Risk and Internal Audit and the external 
and internal auditors. The internal and 
external auditors each meet the Committee 
without Executive Directors or employees 
of the Company being present.
The Audit Committee provides an 
independent overview of the effectiveness 
of the internal financial control systems and 
financial reporting processes. Its principal 
responsibilities include: 
•  The appointment of the external 
auditor and the agreement of terms of 
engagement at the start of each audit 
and the external audit fee
•  Approving and reviewing progress  
on audit plans across the businesses  
and the effectiveness of internal audit
•  Reviewing the integrity of the interim  
and full year financial statements
•  Reviewing and monitoring the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity
•  Reviewing reports on the effectiveness  
of the Group’s whistleblowing procedures 
and arrangements, details of which are 
set out on page 31
During the year, the Audit Committee  
met on four occasions and dealt with  
the following additional matters:
•  A review of the Group’s business 
continuity arrangements 
•  Plans to further develop the Group’s 
internal control framework
•  Appointment of a new internal audit 
service provider
Internal audit 
Assurance over the design and operation 
of internal controls across the Group 
is provided through a combination of 
techniques. The Board through the Audit 
Committee monitors the effectiveness of 
internal control systems through reports 
received from the internal audit function 
during the year. The internal audit function 
has been outsourced to Ernst & Young LLP 
since 2009. As part of the regular review 
process, during 2012/13, it was decided to 
put the contract for the provision of internal 
audit services out to tender. Following the 
tender exercise, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP was appointed as our outsourced 
internal audit provider with effect from  
the start of 2013/14.
Internal audit continued to ensure 
that efforts were better aligned to the 
operational risks that the Group faces  
while maintaining an emphasis on  
reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness 
of general finance and IT controls across 
the Group on a cyclical basis. In addition  
to internal audit work, there is a system  
of self assessment internal control 
reviews by which management are 
required to detail and certify that controls 
are in operation to ensure the control 
environment in their business areas is 
appropriate. Actions agreed are followed 
up by senior management to ensure that 
satisfactory control is maintained. The 
internal audit plan is set and reviewed  
by the Audit Committee. Additionally,  
the Audit Committee reviews reports from 
KPMG on internal control matters noted  
as part of their audit work. 
Auditors 
The Audit Committee assesses annually 
the qualification, expertise and resources 
and independence of the external auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Audit Committee’s assessment 
is performed by an audit satisfaction 
questionnaire completed by the Chairman, 
relevant senior management and Audit 
Committee members. 
KPMG have been the Company’s auditors 
since 11 October 2006. The Audit 
Committee considers that the relationship 
with the auditors is working well and 
remains satisfied with their effectiveness. 
During the year, the Audit Committee 
considered the tenure, performance and 
audit fees of the external auditor, and 
the level of non audit work undertaken, 
and recommended to the Board that a 
resolution for the reappointment of KPMG 
for a further year as the Company’s auditor 
be proposed to shareholders at the AGM.
Corporate governance statement 
Continued 47 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Following completion of the 2011/12 
audit KPMG’s audit engagement partner 
was rotated. The new audit engagement 
partner undertook a thorough introduction 
programme to ensure he was fully familiar 
with the Group’s business.
The Audit Committee places great 
emphasis on the objectivity of the  
Group’s auditors, KPMG, in reporting  
to shareholders.
The KPMG audit partner is present  
at Audit Committee meetings to ensure 
communication of matters relating to the 
audit. The Audit Committee has discussions 
with the auditors, without management 
being present, on the adequacy of controls 
and on judgemental areas and receives 
and reviews the auditors’ highlights reports 
and management letters which are one of 
the main outputs from the external audit.
The scope and key focus of the 
forthcoming year’s audit is discussed with, 
and approved by, the Audit Committee. 
Independence and objectivity of auditors
The Audit Committee has a detailed policy 
covering: 
•  Choosing the statutory auditor and 
approving the audit fee
•  Commissioning non audit work
•  Defining circumstances in which it is 
appropriate or inappropriate for incumbent 
auditors to be allowed to provide or 
prohibited from providing non audit work
•  De La Rue’s procedures for procuring 
non audit services from external sources, 
which specifically prohibits KPMG from 
undertaking certain types of service 
(including but not limited to services 
where it would audit its own work,  
where it would act in an advocacy  
role for the Group or where it would 
participate in activities normally 
undertaken by management) 
It may be cost effective for KPMG to 
perform certain non audit services, in 
particular where the skills and experience 
required make KPMG the most suitable 
supplier. Certain categories of non 
audit services, including corporation tax 
compliance and due diligence services, 
must be subject to competitive tender 
unless it is justifiable in the circumstances 
not to do so. Areas which would not 
normally be acceptable non audit services 
but in exceptional circumstances may be 
considered appropriate, such as litigation 
and compliance services, require the 
specific prior approval of the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. The selection criteria 
include detailed proposals, timescales, 
local resource, cost and the safeguards 
put in place by KPMG. In addition, any 
individual assignment to be undertaken 
by KPMG where the fee is likely to be in 
excess of £50,000 must be approved by 
the Audit Committee Chairman prior to any 
commencement of work. During 2012/13 
the amount of non audit fees paid to 
KPMG was £0.1m.
The safeguards KPMG put in place 
avoid compromising their objectivity and 
independence. They report to the Audit 
Committee on how they comply with 
professional and regulatory requirements 
and best practice designed to ensure their 
independence. Key members of the KPMG 
audit team rotate and the firm ensures, 
where appropriate, that confidentiality is 
maintained between different parts of the 
firm providing services to De La Rue.
A copy of the corporate governance 
statement will be made available on  
the Group’s website.

Remuneration Committee 
Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to 
present our Directors’ remuneration report 
for 2013, which sets out the remuneration 
policy for the Directors of De La Rue plc 
and the amounts earned in respect of the 
year ended 30 March 2013. 
The approach and structure for executive 
remuneration for the 2013/14 financial year 
is similar to that adopted for 2012/13. The 
Remuneration Committee aims to keep 
executive reward simple, proportionate and 
aligned directly with business performance 
and this principle runs through the 
decisions outlined below. 
Context for decisions
In its decision making for 2013/14 the 
Remuneration Committee took account  
of the following business context for  
the Group:
•  The Group’s operating performance  
in 2012/13 was similar to that reported  
in 2011/12
•  As a consequence of the 2012/13 
performance:
 –  No annual cash or share based bonus 
will be paid in respect of 2012/13 as the 
performance targets were not achieved
 –  Executive Directors and other  
members of the Executive Committee 
have decided not to take an increase  
in salary for 2013/14
•  2013/14 is the third and final year of  
the Group’s Improvement Plan which  
has a well publicised target of delivering  
a 2013/14 operating profit in excess  
of £100m. The priority for the business  
is to deliver this target
Executive remuneration changes 2012/13
Last year I consulted with De La Rue’s 
largest shareholders and we also spoke to 
the Association of British Insurers, National 
Association of Pension Fund Managers 
and RREV-ISS Governance Services. 
Following this consultation process, the 
Remuneration Committee reflected the 
consensus views of shareholders in the 
2012/13 awards under the Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) and decided to:
•  Set the maximum level of awards  
at 100 per cent of salary
•  Implement a claw back policy to allow 
the Company to reclaim payments where 
there has been a misstatement of the 
accounts or misconduct
•  Select two performance metrics of 
EPS and cash conversion to determine 
vesting of awards 
The Remuneration Committee believes  
that the performance metrics and targets 
are demanding and are entirely consistent 
with the Group’s current objectives. This 
also reflects the Remuneration Committee’s 
commitment to simple and transparent 
measures designed to reward exceptional 
performance and align the interests of 
Executive Directors and other members  
of the Executive Committee with those  
of shareholders. 
We recognise the need for transparency 
in relation to remuneration reporting. 
Therefore, we have, as far as practicable, 
changed the format of this report to  
provide increased clarity on past pay  
and future policy.
Our main aims in the year have been 
to ensure simplicity and transparency 
of design in our pay arrangements and 
to continue the focus on achieving the 
Improvement Plan.
Gill Rider
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
29 May 2013
 
Introduction to the remuneration 
report
The remuneration report provides the 
information required by the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008  
and describes how the Company applied 
the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. An advisory shareholder 
vote and ordinary resolution to approve 
the Directors’ remuneration report will be 
proposed at the AGM on 25 July 2013.
Remuneration Committee members 
The Remuneration Committee comprises: 
Gill Rider (Chairman), Philip Rogerson, 
Warren East, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, 
Victoria Jarman and Andrew Stevens. 
The Remuneration Committee consists 
exclusively of Non-executive Directors,  
all of whom are regarded as independent, 
and the Chairman of the Board, who 
was regarded as independent on his 
appointment as Chairman. 
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the Group’s policy 
regarding executive remuneration and 
determines, on the Board’s behalf, the 
specific remuneration packages of the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors and 
senior executives who report to the Chief 
Executive. A copy of the Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference is available 
on the Group’s website. 
The Remuneration Committee met  
three times during the period and details  
of attendance can be found on page 44. 
The Chief Executive and the Group HR 
Director also attended meetings. The 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
who is also secretary to the Committee, 
advised on governance issues.
No Executive Director or employee  
is present or takes part in discussions  
in respect of matters relating directly  
to their own responsibilities.
 
Remuneration report 49 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Performance related elements of remuneration form a significant proportion of the total remuneration packages and are based on the 
following key principles:
Key principles Remuneration policy
Competitive rewards to attract, retain  
and develop high calibre employees
Employees are rewarded according to their skills, experience, responsibilities and ability 
to drive the performance of the Group
Variable performance related pay Annual and longer term incentive arrangements are designed to be fair, competitive, 
simple, proportionate and transparent and are subject to challenging performance 
targets. Incentive schemes are designed to provide maximum rewards for exceptional 
performance
Alignment with shareholder interests A significant proportion of the senior executives’ remuneration is share based to 
ensure that their interests and those of shareholders are aligned. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews regularly the Group’s remuneration structure to incentivise 
executives to deliver and sustain value over the medium to longer term
Pay conditions elsewhere Prudent use is made of survey data on companies of a similar size and complexity in 
the FTSE 250. The Remuneration Committee tracks the five year history of executive 
rewards to ensure they are proportionate and in line with the Group’s performance
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to consider other factors, such as ethical behaviours, corporate responsibility, environment 
and health and safety matters as it sees fit when determining awards.
Remuneration advice
During 2012/13 the Remuneration 
Committee received advice from:
•  Towers Watson UK Limited (Towers 
Watson)
•  New Bridge Street (an Aon Hewitt 
company)
Both advisers have been formally appointed 
by the Remuneration Committee.
Towers Watson advised on executive 
remuneration during the year. New Bridge 
Street advised on whether the performance 
targets which determine vesting of share 
based awards were achieved. 
Both Towers Watson and New Bridge 
Street are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group which oversees the 
Code of Conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consultancy in the UK. 
Remuneration Policy
In determining appropriate remuneration, 
the Remuneration Committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors to ensure 
that arrangements are in the best interests 
of both the Group and its shareholders.
The Group operates in a competitive 
market and is focused on achieving 
sustained improvements in performance. 
This depends on the contributions of each 
of the executive team and of employees  
at all levels. 
The Remuneration Committee believes 
that performance related pay and 
incentives should account for a significant 
proportion of the overall remuneration 
package of Executive Directors so that their 
remuneration is aligned with shareholder 
interests and the Group’s performance, 
without encouraging excessive risk taking.
New appointments
When appointing new Executive 
Directors and senior executives, the 
Remuneration Committee will typically 
align the remuneration package with the 
above remuneration policy. However, the 
Remuneration Committee retains the 
discretion to make remuneration decisions 
which are outside the policy to facilitate 
the recruitment of candidates of the 
appropriate calibre and where, appropriate, 
retention of existing employees. Such 
decisions will be taken with due 
consideration to business requirements 
and shareholder interests. 50 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
The Remuneration Committee aims to keep executive reward simple and proportionate. We are also  
committed to transparent measures designed to reward exceptional performance and align the interests  
of Executive Directors with those of shareholders.

Annual Bonus Plan and 
Performance Share Plan
The intention continues that both plans 
will be used to make annual, performance 
linked awards to executives. 
Annual Bonus Plan (ABP)
Under the ABP the annual bonus is paid  
as a combination of cash, and share based  
elements deferred for three years, calculated  
as a percentage of salary and is based 
on achieving business targets for the year 
set by the Remuneration Committee. The 
maximum bonus opportunity is 135 per cent  
of salary for the Chief Executive (being  
100 per cent cash and 35 per cent shares) 
and 115 per cent for the Group Finance 
Director (being 80 per cent cash and  
35 per cent shares). 
In 2012/13, the ABP had a single 
performance criterion of EPS. 
No annual cash or share bonus will 
be made in respect of performance in 
2012/13 because the performance targets 
were not achieved.
ABP performance 2013/14
The Remuneration Committee has  
decided that operating profit will be used 
as the performance measure for the ABP . 
The rationale for using operating profit as 
the performance measure, and not EPS  
(as has been used in the previous two years) 
is that the Improvement Plan operating 
profit target for 2013/14 of £100m is a 
longstanding, visible, well communicated 
and understood measure for investors 
and participants alike. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that use of operating 
profit provides alignment between investors 
and participants. 
The maximum opportunity will remain 
at 135 per cent of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 115 per cent for the Group 
Finance Director.
Subject to the scheme rules, which provide 
for Remuneration Committee discretion, 
a cash bonus will become payable if the 
Group achieves an operating profit in 
excess of £90m with payments increasing 
on a straight line basis from £90m to a 
maximum at £100m. Deferred shares 
will be awarded on a similar basis for 
achievement of operating profit between 
£100m and £105m. 
An operating profit of £90m would 
represent a 42 per cent increase, and 
£100m a 58 per cent increase, on the 
operating profit of £63.2m reported  
for 2012/13.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The purpose of the PSP is to provide 
Executive Directors and selected senior 
managers with a long term incentive 
that promotes annual and long term 
performance and reinforces alignment 
between the participants and shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee has decided 
that PSP awards for 2013/14 will be made 
once the Group’s strategy for the period 
following the Improvement Plan has been 
more clearly defined and communicated  
to shareholders. 
PSP performance 
For awards in 2013/14, the Remuneration 
Committee is planning to continue using 
the performance measures agreed with 
major shareholders after consultation, 
namely EPS (75 per cent of award) and 
cash conversion (25 per cent of award).  
The Remuneration Committee may 
consider excluding capital expenditure  
in the cash conversion calculation, which 
would be more consistent with the definition 
used by many other listed companies.

Notes
1 EPS is defined as the fully diluted (undiluted for 2012 awards) post tax earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items (although exceptional items which are attributable  
to management may be taken into account). EPS was chosen because it is a key performance indicator for shareholders 
2 Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is measured relative to the TSR of the companies in the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts. TSR was chosen because it is a widely 
accepted measure that is recognised by our institutional shareholders
3 Threshold target operating profit is linked to the 2013/14 Improvement Plan target of an operating profit in excess of £100m
4 Cash conversion is defined as the operating cash flow (as per the cash flow statement) excluding exceptional items, special pension contributions and movement in 
advanced payments, less cash capital expenditure, divided by operating profit (before exceptional items). To avoid distortion from one year to the next, cash conversion will  
be measured as an average over a three year performance period

Share retention policy
The Remuneration Committee believes it 
is important that the interests of Executive 
Directors should be closely aligned with 
those of shareholders. The Committee 
adopted a policy that Executive Directors, 
and other members of the Executive 
Committee, should be encouraged to 
build up a shareholding over five years, 
equivalent to one times salary. This may 
be achieved either through market share 
purchases or retention of vested share 
awards. The Directors’ share interests  
table is shown below.

Remuneration and share schemes  
for employees
When determining the remuneration 
arrangements for Executive Directors, 
the Remuneration Committee takes into 
consideration the pay and conditions  
of employees throughout the Group.  
In particular, the Remuneration Committee 
is kept informed of:
•  Salary increases for the general employee 
population
• Overall spend on annual bonus
• Participation levels in the ABP

Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
The Remuneration Committee consults with  
the Chief Executive on the remuneration 
of executives directly reporting to him 
and other senior executives and seeks 
to ensure a consistent approach across 
the Group taking account of seniority and 
market practice and the key remuneration 
policies outlined above. Employees in 
De La Rue (excluding Executive Directors 
and members of the Executive Committee 
who decided not to take an increase) 
received pay rises of up to 2 per cent  
for 2013/14. 
Employees have the opportunity to benefit 
from the Group’s success and share 
price growth. All UK employees may join 
the Company’s HM Revenue & Customs 
approved Sharesave scheme. Options 
are granted over De La Rue plc shares, 
at an exercise price equal to 80 per cent 
of the prevailing market share price at the 
time of grant. Eligible US employees may 
participate in the US Employee Share 
Purchase Plan. The purchase price is  
85 per cent of the lower of the market 
value of a De La Rue plc share either at  
the beginning or end of the offering period.
All UK employees are entitled to participate 
in the defined contribution pension 
scheme.
The work of the Remuneration 
Committee during 2012/13
The Remuneration Committee follows a 
clear cycle of activities during the year and 
in 2012/13 this covered amongst other 
things the following matters:
•  Approved ABP bonus awards in respect 
of 2011/12 performance
•  Agreed pay awards for Executive 
Directors and Executive Committee 
•  Consulted with major shareholders on the 
performance measures for PSP awards 
in 2012/13
•  Approved a draft of the remuneration 
report 
•  Carried out an effectiveness review  
of the Committee 
•  Reviewed and agreed the remuneration 
policy statement
•  Agreed renewal of Sharesave and  
US employee share schemes
 
Service contracts and termination payments
In determining compensation for early termination of a service contract, the Remuneration 
Committee carefully considers the specific circumstances, the Company’s commitments 
under the individual’s contract and the individual’s obligation to mitigate loss. The table 
below outlines the framework for contracts for Executive Directors:
Policy
Notice period on termination 
by the Company
12 calendar months
Termination payment at the 
Company’s sole discretion
Payment not exceeding 12 months’ basic salary, 
excluding bonus but including benefits
Change of control One year’s salary (excluding bonus) plus contractual 
benefits on the executive giving no less than one 
month’s notice (applies to Tim Cobbold only)
Under the ABP , awards will vest in full on change of 
control. Under the PSP , performance conditions and 
apportionment for the time that the award has been 
held will be applied 
Vesting of incentives  
for leavers
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion  
to determine appropriate bonus amounts taking  
into consideration the circumstances in which  
an Executive Director leaves
The vesting of share awards is governed by the  
rules of the appropriate incentive plan approved  
by shareholders. Typically for ‘good leavers’:
•  Under the ABP the provisions allow awards to vest 
in full at the normal vesting date or earlier at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee
•  Under the PSP , awards, pro rated to the date of 
departure, will vest at the normal vesting date if the 
relevant performance targets have been met unless 
the Remuneration Committee decides to test the 
performance targets early and accelerate vesting

Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors do not have 
service contracts but are appointed for 
fixed terms of three years renewable for  
a further three years, if both parties agree. 
The Board may invite Non-executive 
Directors to serve a further term after a  
six year term following a detailed review.
The Board determines the fees paid 
to Non-executive Directors and the 
remuneration of the Chairman is set 
by the Remuneration Committee in all 
cases taking into account market norms, 
comparator companies and the duties 
required of Non-executive Directors. 
All reasonable expenses for attending Board  
meetings are reimbursed. The annual fee 
of £41,200 to Non-executive Directors 
(excluding the Chairman) was increased 
with effect from 1 October 2012 to 
£45,000. The Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees and the Senior 
Independent Director receive an additional 
fee of £7,200 per annum to reflect their 
additional responsibilities.
Details of fees to the Chairman and other 
Non-executive Directors are set out in the 
Directors’ emoluments table below. 
Non-executive Directors are not eligible  
for pension scheme membership and do 
not participate in any of the Group’s annual 
incentive arrangements, or share option 
schemes. No compensation is payable 
to the Chairman or to any Non-executive 
Directors if the appointment is terminated.
The Non-executive Directors’ current terms of appointment are detailed below:

Recruitment Share Award/Retention Share Award
• The value of awards on grant was 100 per cent of salary
• Shares will vest three years after award date and in Colin Child’s case provided he remains with the Company
• The shares will vest in the event of a change of control
• The awards are not pensionable
•  The award under the Recruitment Share Award will vest after termination of service, provided that the termination was not for cause. The Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to accelerate vesting after termination
•  Awards may be satisfied with either new or existing shares. No firm commitment has been entered into to issue shares, nor has any decision to do so yet been made.  
The choice need not be made until the time at which an award is exercised, but the authority to allot any such new shares on a pre emptive basis would be that conferred  
by shareholders on 25 July 2012
Dividend shares
An additional award of shares may be released on the vesting date in respect of awards under the ABP , PSP , Recruitment Share Award and Retention Share Award equivalent  
in value to the amount of dividends that would have been received since the award date in respect of the number of shares that the executives acquire. As at 30 March 2013  
and based on the prevailing market share price on the respective dividend record date the dividend shares accrued and assuming full vesting as appropriate pursuant to the 
relevant plan rules were as follows:
Tim Cobbold: 22,784 ordinary shares
Colin Child:  15,946 ordinary shares
The closing mid market price of De La Rue plc shares at 30 March 2013 was 976p and the highest and lowest mid market prices during the year were 1075p and  
885.5p respectively.

Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
We have audited the financial statements 
of De La Rue plc for the 52 week period 
ended 30 March 2013 set out on pages 60 
to 100. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Group financial statements is applicable 
law and international financial reporting 
standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. 
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of

This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of  
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the

and express an opinion on, the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and international standards on auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the auditing practices 
board’s ethical standards for auditors.

Share premium account
This reserve arises from the issuance of shares for consideration in excess of their nominal value.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve represents the nominal value of shares redeemed by the Company.
Hedge reserve
This reserve records the portion of any gain or loss on hedging instruments that are determined to be effective cash flow hedges.  
When the hedged transaction occurs, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is transferred out of equity to the income statement.  
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss on the related hedging instrument previously recognised in  
equity is transferred to the income statement. An analysis of the movements in the hedge reserve is shown in note 12.
Cumulative translation adjustment
This reserve records cumulative exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign entities since 
transition to IFRS. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income 
statement. This reserve also records the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
Other reserve
On 1 February 2000, the Company issued and credited as fully paid 191,646,873 ordinary shares of 25p each and paid cash of 
£103.7m to acquire the issued share capital of De La Rue plc (now De La Rue Holdings plc), following the approval of a High Court 
Scheme of Arrangement. In exchange for every 20 ordinary shares in De La Rue plc, shareholders received 17 ordinary shares plus  
920p in cash. The other reserve of £83.8m arose as a result of this transaction and is a permanent adjustment to the consolidated 
financial statements.

Group cash flow statement
For the period ended 30 March 2013 65 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
De La Rue plc (the Company) is a  
public limited company incorporated  
and domiciled in the United Kingdom.  
The address of its registered office is 
disclosed on page 102 of this annual 
report. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company for the period 
ended 30 March 2013 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the Group) and the Group’s 
interest in associates. The Company 
financial statements present information 
about the Company as a separate entity 
and not about its Group. The principal 
activities of the Group are described 
in note 1. The principal accounting 
policies adopted in the preparation of 
these consolidated financial statements 
are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.
Statement of compliance
European Union (EU) law (IAS Regulation 
EC 1606/2002) requires that the 
consolidated financial statements, for the 
period ended 30 March 2013, be prepared 
in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the EU (Adopted IFRS). These consolidated 
financial statements have been approved 
by the Directors and prepared in 
accordance with Adopted IFRS including 
interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The Company has elected to prepare  
its financial statements in accordance with 
UK generally accepted accounting practice 
(UK GAAP).
During the year a number of amendments 
to IFRS became effective and were 
adopted by the Group, none of which 
had a material impact on the Group’s 
net cash flows, financial position, total 
comprehensive income or earnings 
per share. A number of other new and 
amended IFRS were issued during the year 
which do not become effective until after 
30 March 2013, other than revisions to 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, none of these 
are likely to have a material impact on the 
Group for the 2013/14 year. 
Note 22 to the consolidated financial 
statements describes in greater detail how 
the revised IAS 19 would have impacted 
2012/13 had the amendments been 
applied and also estimates the impact  
on the 2013/14 year. 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements  
have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention with the exception of 
certain items which are measured at 
fair value as disclosed in the accounting 
policies below. The accounts have been 
prepared as at 30 March 2013, being the 
last Saturday in March. The comparatives 
for the 2011/12 financial year are for the 
period ended 31 March 2012.
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out on pages 20 to 23 and 27 to 
30 of the business review. The accounting 
policies used in the preparation of the 
financial position are described in pages 
65 to 70. In addition, pages 79 to 84 
include the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for financial risk management, 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposure to credit 
risk, liquidity risk and commodity pricing 
risk. The financial position of the Group, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described on pages 24 to 26 
of the business review. 
As described on page 26, the Group 
meets its funding requirements through 
cash generated from operations and a 
revolving credit facility which expires in 
December 2016. The Group’s forecasts 
and projections, which cover a period of 
more than 12 months, taking into account 
reasonably possible changes in normal 
trading performance, show that the 
Group should be able to operate within 
its currently available facilities. The Group 
has sufficient financial resources together 
with assets that are expected to generate 
cash flow in the normal course of business. 
As a consequence and notwithstanding 
the net liability position being reported in 
the consolidated balance sheet, which 
has primarily arisen due to the value 
of the deficit in the retirement benefit 
obligations, or the uncertainty as to the 
outcome of the paper production issues 
noted on page 15, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group are well placed to manage 
their business risks and to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the Directors continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and accounts.
 
Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements  
of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries) up to 
30 March 2013. Control exists when the 
Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable are taken 
into account. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control 
commences or until the date that control 
ceases. The majority of the subsidiaries 
prepare their financial statements up to 
30 March except for certain subsidiaries 
whose year end is 31 December.  
In the case of the subsidiaries whose  
financial statements are made up to  
31 December 2012, results for the  
period to 30 March 2013 and the balance 
sheet as at 30 March 2013 have been 
consolidated.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities  
and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary  
are measured at their fair values at the  
date of acquisition. Any excess of the  
cost of acquisition over the fair values  
of the identifiable net assets acquired  
is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency  
of the cost of acquisition below the 
fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired (ie discount on acquisition) is 
credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. 
All intra Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation. 66 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Significant accounting policies  
and judgements applied
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
These financial statements are presented 
in sterling, which is the functional and 
presentational currency of the Company. 
The functional currency of Group entities 
is principally determined by the primary 
economic environment in which the 
respective entity operates. 
Transactions in foreign currencies entered 
into by Group entities are translated into 
the functional currencies of those entities 
at the rates of exchange at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the  
balance sheet date are translated at the  
rate of exchange ruling at that date. Foreign  
exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency non monetary items 
measured in terms of historical cost are 
translated at the rate of exchange at 
the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences on non monetary items are 
recognised in line with whether the gain  
or loss on the non monetary item itself  
is recognised in the income statement  
or in equity. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain 
foreign exchange risks, the Group enters 
into forward contracts (refer to the 
accounting policy on derivative financial 
instruments below for details of the Group’s 
accounting policies in respect of such 
derivative financial instruments).
Financial statements of foreign operations
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, 
including goodwill and intangible assets, 
are translated at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expenses are translated 
at average exchange rates (which 
approximate to actual rates). Exchange 
differences arising on retranslation are 
recognised in the Group’s translation 
reserve, which is a component of equity. 
When a foreign operation is sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the income statement as part 
of the gain or loss on sale.
Exchange differences in respect of foreign 
operations that arose before 27 March 2004, 
the date of transition to Adopted IFRS,  
are presented as part of retained earnings, 
as permitted by IFRS 1.
 
Net investment in foreign operations
Foreign currency differences arising  
on the retranslation of a financial liability 
designated as a hedge of a net investment 
in foreign operations are recognised in the 
translation reserve to the extent the hedge 
is effective. To the extent that the hedge  
is ineffective, such differences are 
recognised as finance income or costs  
in the income statement. Cumulative gains 
or losses in equity arising since the date  
of transition to Adopted IFRS are taken  
to the income statement on disposal  
of the foreign operation.
Financial instruments
The Group’s operating activities expose 
it to financial risks of changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Group uses a range of derivative 
instruments, including forward contracts 
and swaps to hedge its risk to changes  
in foreign exchange rates and interest 
rates. Derivative financial instruments  
are only used for hedging purposes.  
The use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the Group’s risk management policies 
approved by the Board, which provide 
written principles on the use of financial 
derivatives consistent with the Group’s  
risk management strategy.
Derivative financial instruments are 
recognised at fair value at the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently re-measured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. 
The gain or loss on subsequent fair value 
measurement is recognised in the income 
statement unless the derivative qualifies  
for hedge accounting when recognition  
of any resultant gain or loss depends  
on the nature of the item being hedged. 
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments that are designated 
and are effective as hedges of future cash 
flows are recognised directly in equity 
and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are 
recycled to the income statement in the 
period in which the hedged item also 
affects the income statement. 
 
Accounting policies
Continued
However, if the hedged item results in 
the recognition of a non financial asset or 
liability, the amounts accumulated in equity 
on the hedging instrument are transferred 
from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the asset or 
liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued 
when the hedging instrument expires or  
is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, 
for forecast transactions, any cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained in equity 
until the forecasted transaction occurs.  
If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred  
to the income statement. Changes in the 
fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are recognised in the income statement  
as they arise.
Fair value hedges 
For an effective hedge of an exposure 
to changes in fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm 
commitment, the hedged item is adjusted 
for changes in fair value attributable to the 
risk being hedged with the corresponding 
entry in net income. Gains or losses  
from re-measuring the derivative or,  
for non derivatives, the foreign currency 
component of its carrying value, are 
recognised in net income.
Embedded derivatives 
Derivatives embedded in other financial 
instruments or other non financial 
host contracts are treated as separate 
derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to 
those of the host contracts and the host 
contracts are not carried at fair value. 
Any unrealised gains or losses on such 
separated derivatives are reported in the 
income statement.
Revenue recognition
Group revenue predominantly represents 
sales to external customers of 
manufactured products which fall within  
the Group’s ordinary trading activities.  
This excludes VAT and other sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised in the income 
statement to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated  
with the transaction will flow into the Group 
and the amount can be reliably measured. 
In practice this means that revenue is 
recognised when goods are supplied

When goods are supplied, this is when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership 
are transferred to the buyer.
Revenues and costs on project based 
contracts are recognised by reference  
to the stage of completion, based on the 
work performed to date and the overall 
contract profitability. The assessment of 
the stage of completion is dependent on 
the nature of the contract and is assessed 
by reference to reviews of work performed, 
achievement of contractual milestones  
and costs incurred. 
Revenue on service based contracts  
is recognised as services are provided.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, 
by reference to the principal outstanding 
and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount.
Intangible assets
All intangible assets, except goodwill, 
are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any impairment losses. 
Goodwill is not amortised and is stated  
at cost less any accumulated  
impairment losses.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation 
represents the excess of the fair value  
of consideration transferred in a business 
combination over the Group’s share of the 
fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the business 
acquired at the date of acquisition. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. At the date of acquisition, the 
goodwill is allocated to cash generating 
units for the purpose of impairment testing 
and is tested annually for impairment or 
when there are indications of impairment. 
Any impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement  
and is not subsequently reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a 
business include the carrying amount of 
goodwill relating to the business. Goodwill 
arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries  
is presented in goodwill and goodwill 
arising on the acquisition of associates  
is presented in investments in associates. 
Internally generated goodwill is not 
recognised as an asset.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before  
27 March 2004 (the date of transition to 
IFRS) has been retained at the previous  
UK GAAP amounts subject to being  
tested for impairment at that date.
Development costs
Expenditure incurred in the development 
of products or enhancements to existing 
product ranges is capitalised as an 
intangible asset only when the future 
economic benefits expected to arise are 
deemed probable and the costs can be 
reliably measured. Development costs not 
meeting these criteria are expensed in the 
income statement as incurred. Capitalised 
development costs are amortised on a 
straight line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives, which vary between 
five and ten years, once the product or 
enhancement is available for use. Product 
research costs are written off as incurred.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets purchased separately, 
such as software licences that do not 
form an integral part of related hardware, 
are capitalised at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. 
Software intangibles are amortised on a 
straight line basis over the shorter of their 
useful economic life or their licence period 
at rates which vary between three and  
five years.
Distribution rights are capitalised at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses and are amortised over their useful 
economic lives as determined by the life  
of the products to which they relate.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated 
at cost or valuation, less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated 
provision for impairment in value. Assets in 
the course of construction are included in 
property, plant and equipment on the basis 
of expenditure incurred at the balance 
sheet date.
No depreciation is provided on freehold 
land. Freehold and long leasehold buildings 
are depreciated over their estimated useful 
economic lives of 50 years. Other leasehold 
interests are depreciated over the lesser  
of the unexpired period of the lease and  
50 years.
The Group’s policy is to write off the  
cost or valuation of all other plant and 
equipment evenly over their estimated 
remaining useful life at rates which vary 
between 8 per cent and 50 per cent 
per annum. The principal annual rate of 
depreciation used is 10 per cent on plant 
and machinery and on fixtures and fittings. 
No depreciation is provided for assets in 
the course of construction.
Depreciation methods, residual values  
and useful lives are reviewed at least at 
each financial year end, taking into account 
commercial and technical obsolescence 
as well as normal wear and tear, provision 
being made where the carrying value 
exceeds the recoverable amount. 
Borrowing costs
Where borrowing costs are attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset, such costs are 
capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Impairment
Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there 
is any objective evidence that it is impaired. 
A financial asset is considered to be 
impaired if objective evidence indicates  
that one or more events have had a 
negative effect on the estimated future 
cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial 
asset measured at amortised cost is 
calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount and the present value of 
the estimated future cash flows discounted 
at the original effective interest rate.
Individually significant assets are tested 
 for impairment on an individual basis.  
The remaining financial assets are 
assessed collectively in groups that  
share similar credit risk characteristics.  
All impairment losses are recognised  
in the income statement. 68 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Non financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non 
financial assets, other than inventories and 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If 
any such indication exists then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. For 
goodwill and intangible assets that have 
indefinite useful lives or that are not yet 
ready for use, the recoverable amount  
is estimated at each reporting date.
Assets that are subject to amortisation  
are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or circumstances indicate that  
the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
In addition, goodwill is tested at least 
annually for impairment. Impairment tests 
are performed for all cash generating 
units (CGUs) to which goodwill has been 
allocated at the balance sheet date or 
whenever there is indication of impairment. 
For all other intangible assets, an 
impairment test is performed whenever  
an indicator of impairment exists.
An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement for 
the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
value exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the latter being the higher of the asset’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in 
use and, in the case of goodwill, is not 
subsequently reversed. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a 
pre tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset 
for which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted.
For other intangible assets, at each  
balance sheet date an assessment is made  
to determine whether there is any indication 
that an impairment loss recognised in 
prior periods may no longer exist or has 
decreased. Where such an indication exists,  
an impairment loss is reversed to the extent 
that the asset’s carrying value does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised.
 
Associated companies
An associate is an entity over which the 
Group is in a position to exercise significant 
influence, but not control or joint control, 
through participation in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist 
when the Group holds between 20 and  
50 per cent of the voting power of  
another entity. 
The Group’s share of the results, assets 
and liabilities of associated companies 
are included in these financial statements 
using the equity method of accounting, 
except when classified as held for sale. 
The results are presented after interest, tax 
and non controlling interest. Investments in 
associates are carried in the balance sheet 
at cost as adjusted by the post acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets 
of the associate, less any impairment in the  
value of the individual investment. Losses  
of the associate in excess of the Group’s  
interest in that associate are not recognised  
unless the Group has a legal or constructive  
obligation to fund those losses. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over 
the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
at the date of acquisition of the associate  
is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency  
of the cost of acquisition below the 
fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired (ie discount on acquisition) is 
credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. 
Where a Group company transacts with an 
associate of the Group, profits and losses 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the associate. Losses may 
provide evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred in which case appropriate 
provision is made for impairment. 
Associated companies prepare their 
financial information as at 31 December. 
Results for the period to 30 March and the 
balance sheet as at 30 March have been 
included in the consolidated statements.
Leasing
A lease is defined as an agreement 
whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee 
the right to use a specific asset for an 
agreed period of time in return for a 
payment or a series of payments.
Leases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases.
Accounting policies
Continued
Assets held under finance leases are 
initially recognised as property, plant and 
equipment at an amount equal to the 
fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, 
the present value of minimum lease 
payments at the inception of the lease, 
and then depreciated over their useful 
economic lives. Lease payments are 
apportioned between repayment of capital 
and interest. The capital element of future 
lease payments is included in the balance 
sheet as a liability. Interest is charged to 
the income statement so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases 
are charged to the income statement on 
a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Benefits received and receivable as an 
incentive to enter into an operating lease 
are also spread on a straight line basis  
over the lease term. 
Where a leasehold property is vacant,  
or sublet under terms such that the 
rental income is less than the head lease 
rental cost, provision is made for the best 
estimate of unavoidable lease payments 
during the vacancy or on the anticipated 
future shortfall of sub lease income 
compared with the head lease expense.
Taxation
The tax expense included in the income 
statement comprises current and deferred 
tax. Current tax is the expected tax  
payable on the taxable income for the  
year, including adjustments in respect  
of prior periods, using tax rates enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised directly in equity, in which case 
it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method, providing for 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is 
measured using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and that are expected 
to apply when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled. 
  69 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the temporary difference can 
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are 
not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill, not deductible for tax 
purposes, or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor  
the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, 
except where the Group is able to control 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities are only offset to the extent that 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets and current tax liabilities, 
they relate to taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends  
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis or to realise an asset and 
settle a liability simultaneously.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are valued 
at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is determined on a weighted 
average cost basis and comprises directly 
attributable purchase and conversion 
costs, including direct labour and an 
allocation of production overheads based 
on normal operating capacity that have 
been incurred in bringing those inventories 
to their present location and condition. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price less estimated costs of completion 
and selling costs.
 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise 
bank balances and cash held by the 
Group and short term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand and form part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component 
of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the cash flow statement.
Loans
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised 
initially at fair value less attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest bearing borrowings are 
stated at amortised cost with any difference 
between cost and redemption value being 
recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the borrowings on an effective 
interest basis.
Employment benefits
Pensions
The Group operates a number of retirement 
benefit schemes. The major schemes are 
defined benefit pension funds with assets 
held separately from the Group. The cost 
of providing benefits under each scheme  
is determined using the projected unit 
credit actuarial valuation method.
The current service cost and gains and 
losses on settlements and curtailments  
are included in operating costs in the Group 
income statement. Past service costs are 
similarly included where the benefits have 
vested, otherwise they are amortised on  
a straight line basis over the vesting period. 
The expected return on assets of funded 
defined benefit pension schemes and 
the imputed interest on pension scheme 
liabilities are disclosed as retirement benefit 
obligation finance income and retirement 
benefit obligation finance expense 
respectively in the income statement.
Differences between the actual and 
expected return on assets, changes 
in the retirement benefit obligation due 
to experience and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are included in the statement 
of comprehensive income in full in the 
period in which they arise.
The liability recognised in respect of defined 
benefit pension plans is the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation less the fair 
value of the scheme assets, as determined 
by actuarial valuations carried out at the 
balance sheet date.
The Group’s contributions to defined 
contribution plans are charged to the 
income statement in the period to which 
the contributions relate.
Share based payments
The Group operates various equity settled 
and cash settled option schemes. For 
equity settled share options, the services 
received from employees are measured 
by reference to the fair value of the share 
options. The fair value is calculated at grant 
date and recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, together with a 
corresponding increase in shareholders’ 
equity, on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the number of 
shares that are actually expected to vest, 
taking into account non market vesting 
conditions (including service conditions). 
Vesting conditions, other than non market 
based conditions, are not taken into 
account when estimating the fair value.
For cash settled share options, the 
services received from employees are 
measured at the fair value of the liability for 
options outstanding and recognised in the 
consolidated income statement on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period. The fair 
value of the liability is re-measured at each 
reporting date and at the date of settlement 
with changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Share option schemes
The De La Rue Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (Trust) is a separately administered 
trust. Liabilities of the trust are guaranteed 
by the Company and the assets of the Trust 
mainly comprise shares in the Company. 
The own shares held by the Trust are 
shown as a reduction in shareholders’ 
funds. The shares will be held at historical 
rates until such time as they are disposed 
of. Any profit or loss on the disposal of 
own shares is treated as a movement 
in reserves rather than as an income 
statement item.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the  
Group has a present obligation in respect 
of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation, and where the amount 
can be reliably estimated. Provisions are 
measured at the Directors’ best estimate  
of the amount required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date and 
are discounted where the time value of 
money is considered material.
Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the Board and 
unpaid at the year end are not recognised 
in the financial statements until they have 
been approved by the shareholders at the 
AGM. Interim dividends are recognised  
in the period that they are paid. 70 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group’s accounting policies are set out 
above. Management is required to exercise 
significant judgement in the application of 
these policies. Areas which management 
believe require the most critical accounting 
judgements or which involve estimation are 
set out below. 
Critical accounting judgements  
in applying the Group’s accounting 
policies
Cash flow hedge accounting
The Group enters into forward contracts 
to hedge the risk of movements in 
foreign exchange and interest rates. 
These contracts fall within the definition 
of derivative financial instruments and 
accordingly have to be recorded at fair 
value. Accounting for these contracts as 
cash flow hedges allows, to the extent the 
hedges are effective, the change in values 
of the derivatives to be recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated 
in equity. In order to achieve cash flow 
hedge accounting it is necessary for the 
Group to determine, on an ongoing basis, 
whether a forecast transaction being 
hedged is highly probable and whether  
the hedge is effective.
Exceptional items
The Directors consider items of income 
and expenditure which are both material 
by size and/or by nature and non recurring 
should be disclosed separately in the 
financial statements so as to help provide 
an indication of the Group’s underlying 
business performance. The Directors label 
these items collectively as ‘exceptional 
items’. Determining which transactions 
are to be considered exceptional in nature 
is often a subjective matter. However, 
circumstances that the Directors believe 
would give rise to exceptional items for 
separate disclosure would include: gains  
or losses on the disposal of businesses 
(other than those within the scope of 
IFRS 5), curtailments on defined benefit 
pension arrangements, restructuring  
of businesses and asset impairments. 
All exceptional items are included on the 
appropriate income statement category  
to which they relate. 
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes 
in numerous jurisdictions and significant 
judgement is required in determining the 
worldwide provision for those taxes. The 
level of current and deferred tax recognised 
is dependent on subjective judgements as 
to the outcome of decisions to be made 
by the tax authorities in the various tax 
jurisdictions around the world in which  
the Group operates. It is necessary to 
consider which deferred tax assets should 
be recognised based on an assessment  
of the extent to which they are regarded  
as recoverable, which involves assessment 
of the future trading prospects of individual 
statutory entities. The actual outcome 
may vary from that anticipated. Where the 
final tax outcomes differ from the amounts 
initially recorded, there will be impacts upon 
income tax and deferred tax provisions and 
on the income statement in the period in 
which such determination is made.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill 
and other assets that have indefinite 
useful lives are impaired. Other assets are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of an asset or a cash generating 
unit is determined based on value in use 
calculations prepared on the basis of 
management’ s assumptions and estimates 
of future cash flows, discounted at  
suitable rates.
Provisions for liabilities and charges
The Group measures provisions at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the amount 
required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date, discounted where the 
time value of money is considered material. 
These estimates take account of available 
information, historical experience and the 
likelihood of different possible outcomes. 
Both the amount and the maturity of  
these liabilities could be different from  
those estimated.
Accounting policies
Continued
Pension obligations
Pension costs within the income statement 
and the pension obligations as stated in 
the balance sheet are both dependent 
upon a number of assumptions chosen by 
management. These include the expected 
long term rate of return on the relevant plan 
assets, the rate used to discount future 
liabilities, the expected longevity for current 
and future pensioners and estimates of 
future rates of inflation.
The expected return on plan assets 
assumption is determined on a uniform 
basis, taking into consideration long term 
historical returns, asset allocation and 
future estimates of long term investment 
returns. The discount rate is the interest 
rate that should be used to determine  
the present value of estimated future cash 
outflows expected to be required to settle 
the pension obligations. In determining 
the appropriate discount rate, the Group 
considers the interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will 
be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related 
pension liability. See page 26 for details 
of the relative sensitivity of the value of 
the scheme liabilities to changes in the 
discount and inflation rates. 71 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
1 Segmental analysis
The Group has two business units, Currency and Solutions. Currency is a single operating unit. Solutions consists of three operating 
units: Cash Processing Solutions, Security Products and Identity Systems. The Board, which is the Group’s chief operating decision 
maker, monitors the performance of the Group at an operating unit level and there are therefore four reportable segments. The principal 
financial information reviewed by the Board is revenue and operating profit before exceptional items, measured on an IFRS basis. 
The Holographics operation, previously part of Security Products, became part of the Currency business, on which it largely depends, 
from the first day of the 2012/13 financial year and comparatives have been re-presented accordingly.
The Group’s segments are:
Currency
• provides printed banknotes, banknote paper and banknote security features
Solutions
•  Cash Processing Solutions – primarily focused on the production of large banknote sorters and authentication machines for central 
banks, complementing the Currency business
•  Security Products – produces security documents, including authentication labels, brand licensing products, government documents, 
cheques and postage stamps
• Identity Systems – involved in the provision of passport, ePassport, national ID and eID, driving licence and voter registration schemes

Exceptional costs of £7.6m have been incurred in 2012/13 mainly in connection with the ongoing costs of implementing the 
Improvement Plan (2011/12: £24.8m). This brings the cumulative exceptional charges taken in respect of the Improvement Plan  
to a total of £31.7m.
The £7.6m exceptional operating charge reported in 2012/13 (2011/12: £24.8m) comprised £0.8m (2011/12: £11.3m) in staff 
compensation, £0.2m (2011/12: £1.1m) of fixed asset impairment charges, £4.3m (2011/12: £8.8m) for site exit costs and £2.3m 
(2011/12: £2.9m) in other associated reorganisation costs. The exceptional charge in 2011/12 also included additional costs  
(reported under the Currency business unit) of £0.7m associated with the paper quality issue that arose in 2010/11.
Tax credits relating to exceptional items arising in the period were £2.1m (2011/12: £6.2m). In addition there was an exceptional

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of the dilutive effect  
of share options.
The Directors are of the opinion that the publication of the headline earnings per share, before exceptional items, is useful to readers  
of the accounts as it gives an indication of underlying business performance.

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) identified according to business segment and country of operation.
A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below:
        2013 2012 
        £m £m
Currency        4.3 4.3
Cash Processing Solutions        3.5 3.4
        7.8 7.7
The majority of the goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc in 2001 which was allocated to Currency and Cash Processing Solutions 
on the basis that the acquired business generated synergies for both CGUs. The estimates of recoverable amounts are based on value 
in use calculations which utilise cash flow projections covering a five year period using the latest projections approved by management 
plus a terminal value. The key assumptions underlying these projections are summarised below:
(a) Currency: the volume and price of orders secured, particularly in respect of banknotes and banknote papers, are based  
on a combination of the current order book and past experience, taking into account: 
  (i) Expectations in respect of economic growth and the banknote circulation policies of central banks
  (ii) The Group’s knowledge of its customer base, gained through its longstanding relationships with them
Material input prices and foreign exchange rates are also factors but are not considered significant in the context of the headroom 
available in the calculations.
(b) Cash Processing Solutions: unit sales of large sorters and the extent of maintenance income generated from these sales are based 
on a combination of orders on hand and past experience 
The pre tax discount rate used for both Currency and Cash Processing Solutions was 13.0 per cent (2011/12: 13.2 per cent). The  
discount rates applied take into account the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the relative risks associated with  
the CGUs’ operations. The post tax discount rate used is unchanged compared to the prior year, reflecting the fact that the Group’s 
WACC has not changed and the risks associated with the CGUs in question have not materially changed. Cash flows beyond the  
period covered by the projections have been held constant.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed and management do not consider there to be any reasonably possible change in assumptions 
that could result in the assets’ recoverable amounts falling below their book values.  78 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Balance at end of year        (4.5) (4.7)
The provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables are used to record losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery  
of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.
At 30 March 2013, the Group does not have any collective impairment on its trade receivables (2011/12: £nil).
Based on past experience, the Group believes that no further impairment is required for financial assets that are neither past due  
nor impaired.

12 Financial risk
Financial risk management
Overview
The Group’s treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is responsible for the management of 
financial risks faced by the Group. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are liquidity 
risk, market risk and credit risk.
The Group’s financial risk management policies are established and reviewed regularly to identify and analyse the risks faced by the 
Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. 
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and in certain cases hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating units. 
Group Treasury provides written principles for overall financial risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash 
equivalents. The level of headroom needed is reviewed annually as part of the Group’s planning process. 
A maturity analysis of the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings is shown below in the reporting of financial risk section together 
with associated fair values.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income 
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return:
(a) Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with 
respect to the US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, 
unrecognised firm commitments and investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the 
Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or 
recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. Group Treasury is responsible  
for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Group’s risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures 
in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. The Group’s 
policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations primarily through borrowings 
denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
The Group’s policy is not to hedge net investments in subsidiaries or the translation of profits or losses generated in overseas 
subsidiaries.
(b) Interest rate risk
All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at floating rates of interest. Where the Group has forecast average levels  
of net debt above £50m on a continuing basis, floating to fixed interest rate swaps will be used to fix the interest rate on a minimum  
of 50 per cent of the Group’s net debt for a period of at least 12 months.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the 
Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on 
credit risk. Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk. Where appropriate, letters of credit are used to mitigate the credit risk 
from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit 
history. The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk. Derivative 
counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the 
amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. 80 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Fair value measurement basis for derivative financial instruments
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest  
at the reporting date.
The valuation bases are classified according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the fair values. Level 1 valuations  
are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 2 valuations use observable inputs  
for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, while level 3 valuations are not based on observable market data and are subject  
to management estimates.
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging
The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank confirmations and discounted cash flows using the yield curves  
in effect at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives
The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales  
and purchase contracts and using quoted forward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The movement in fair value  
of embedded derivatives is shown within revenue or operating expenses as appropriate, depending on the nature of the transaction.
Determination of fair values of non derivative financial assets and liabilities
Trade and other receivables and payables
Due to their short maturities, trade and other payables, and trade and other receivables have been stated at their book values which 
approximate to their fair values.
Non derivative financial liabilities
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest  
at the reporting date. The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on sterling LIBOR.
At 30 March 2013 the discount rate used was 1.0 per cent (31 March 2012: 1.0 per cent).
Hedge reserves
Net movements in the hedge reserve are shown in the Group statement of changes in equity. 
Comprehensive income after tax was £0.9m comprising a gain of £0.9m of fair value movements on new and continuing cash flow 
hedges, and a £2.1m charge to the income statement on maturing cash flow hedges. Deferred tax on the net charge of £1.2m 
amounted to £0.3m.
The hedge reserve balance on 30 March 2013 was (£0.3m) (31 March 2012: (£1.2m)).

The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more 
than 12 months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
As at 30 March 2013, the Group has a total of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, all maturing in more than one year, of £93.0m  
(31 March 2012: £127.7m in more than one year). The amount of loans drawn on the £200m facility is £98.4m. Guarantees of £8.9m 
have also been drawn using the facility. 82 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain  
future development of the business. 
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, which represent the Group’s definition  
of capital for this purpose:
        2013 2012 
       Note £m £m
Total equity attributable to shareholders of the Company      (71.3) (49.5)
Net debt       20 (76.7) (24.8)
Group capital        (148.0) (74.3)
The Group’s debt financing is also analysed in notes 16 and 20. 
Included within the Group’s net debt are cash and cash equivalent balances that are not readily available for use by the Group.  
These balances are not significant, and are not readily available due to restrictions within some of the countries in which we operate.
Earnings per share and dividend payments are the two measures which, in the Board’s view, summarise best whether the Group’s 
objectives regarding equity management are being met. The Group’s earnings and dividends per share and relative rates of growth 
illustrate the extent to which equity attributable to shareholders has changed. Both measures are disclosed and discussed within  
the business review and notes 6 and 7. 
The Group’s objective is to maximise sustainable long term growth of the earnings per share. 
De La Rue’s dividend policy is to provide shareholders with a competitive return on their investment, while assuring sufficient 
reinvestment of profits to enable the Group to achieve its strategy. The dividend per share objective is monitored against the target  
of a full year dividend cover of 1.75 times. The proposed total dividend for the year is covered 1.05 times, which although below  
the policy level, as in the previous year, reflects the Board’s confidence in delivering the Improvement Plan. 
The decision to pay dividends, and the amount of the dividends, will depend on, among other things the earnings, financial position, 
capital requirements, general business conditions, cash flows, net debt levels and share buy back plans. 
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.

Other deferred assets and liabilities predominantly relate to tax associated with provisions (£4.7m) and overseas tax credits (£3.9m).
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses available to carry forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £1.7m (2011/12: £1.7m) in respect of losses amounting to £6.6m  
(2011/12: £7.0m) that can be carried forward against future taxable income. Similarly, the Group has not recognised deferred  
tax assets of £15.7m (2011/12: £16.3m) in respect of overseas tax credits that are carried forward for utilisation in future periods.
Unremitted earnings totalled £483m at 30 March 2013 (2011/12: £444m). Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the 
withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal 
can be controlled and it was considered unlikely that dividends would be paid from those subsidiaries.
UK capital losses of £330.2m are carried forward at 30 March 2013 (2011/12: £330.2m). No deferred tax asset has been recognised  
in respect of these losses.  86 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
14 Deferred taxation continued
UK tax rate
A reduction in the UK tax rate from 24 per cent to 23 per cent (effective from 1 April 2013) was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012. 
This will reduce the UK Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 March 2013 have 
been calculated based on the rate of 23 per cent substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
It was announced at the 2012 Autumn Statement and 2013 Budget that the main rate of UK corporation tax shall be reduced to  
21 per cent from April 2014 and 20 per cent from April 2015. These amendments were not substantively enacted at 30 March 2013  
and therefore have not been reflected in the deferred tax figures on the balance sheet.

Restructuring provisions represent amounts principally provided in 2011/12 for various reorganisations, in Currency and Security 
Products, involving the closure of three sites and the relocation of manufacturing activity to our facilities in Gateshead and Westhoughton. 
These provisions include amounts for staff compensation and site exit costs, which are expected to be utilised over three years reflecting 
the contractual commitments to which they relate. 
Business disposal provisions represent amounts provided for warranties and indemnities in respect of businesses sold by the Group.  
The majority of these provisions are expected to be utilised within one year.
Warranty provisions relate to present obligations for defective products and include known claims as well as anticipated claims that  
had not been reported at the balance sheet date. The provisions are management judgements based on information currently available, 
past history and experience of the products sold. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business that the actual liabilities may differ 
from the provisions. The precise timing of the utilisation of these provisions is uncertain but is generally expected to fall within one year. 
Warranty provisions include £4.8m in respect of the 2010 paper production quality issues described in note 25, which are expected  
to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates. There are no individually material provisions  
within this total.

19 Share based payments 
At 30 March 2013, the Group has a number of share based payment plans, which are described below. These plans have been 
accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2, Share Based Payments, which means that IFRS 2 has 
been applied to all grants of employee share based payments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 
and cash settled awards outstanding at 1 January 2005. 
The compensation cost and related liability that have been recognised for the Group’s share based plans are set out in the table below:

An expected volatility rate of 30 per cent (2011/12: 35 per cent) has been used for grants in the period. This rate is based on historical 
volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield  
on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. The rate applied during the year was 0.5  
or 1.0 per cent depending on the vesting period.

Deferred Bonus and Matching Share Plan
The plan was open to eligible senior executives throughout the Group until it was superseded. The plan is a combination of three 
elements: deferred allocation, dividend allocation and matching allocation. The matching allocation is linked to the deferred allocation  
and is subject to the following performance condition: up to 50 per cent of the award is released subject to an earnings per share test 
and up to 50 per cent is released based on the performance of the total shareholder return test (TSR) against the companies in the  
FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts. The TSR performance condition has been incorporated into the Monte Carlo simulation  
model used to estimate the fair value of these options.

Executive Share Option Plan
The Executive Share Option Plan was open to eligible senior executives throughout the Group. Options were granted at a price equal  
to the average market price of a share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant, with a performance condition 
based on the achievement of an earnings per share growth target. The performance condition relates to the achievement over three 
years of 3 per cent per annum earnings per share growth over the rate of increase in the Retail Prices Index. If this condition is not met  
at the end of the performance period the options will lapse. A pre vesting forfeiture rate of 5 per cent per annum has been assumed.

discount to the market price) to employees who agree to save between £5 and £250 per month over a period of three or five years. 
There are no performance conditions attaching to the options. After the three or five year term has expired, employees normally have  
six months in which to decide whether or not to exercise their options. A pre vesting forfeiture rate of 5 per cent has been assumed.

US Employee Share Purchase Plan
De La Rue operates a US Employee Share Purchase Plan for US employees. Under the plan, employees have an option to  
purchase De La Rue plc shares at the end of each 12 month savings period at a price which is the lower of the market value of the 
De La Rue plc share either at the beginning or the end of the offering period, less a 15 per cent discount. In 2012/13, 14,198 shares 
(2011/12: 12,745 shares) were allotted pursuant to the plan. It is estimated that 14,800 shares will be required to satisfy the Company’s 
2013/14 obligations in respect of employees’ savings under the plan as at 30 March 2013. 
Market share purchase of shares by Trustee De La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust 
The De La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust was established to administer shares granted under the various De La Rue Executive 
Share Option Schemes (ESOS) and the De La Rue Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) (or any other share option plan established by 
the Company) to Executive Directors and senior employees. Ardel Trust Company (Guernsey) Limited is the Trustee. The Trustee held  
no shares at 30 March 2013.

The expected rate of return on plan assets has been determined following advice from the plans’ independent actuary and is based  
on the expected return on each asset class together with consideration of the long term asset strategy.
The mortality assumptions used to assess the defined benefit obligation for the UK plan are based on tables issued by the Continuous 
Mortality Investigation Bureau. At 30 March 2013 mortality assumptions were based on the SAPS All lives tables, with future improvements 
in line with the CMI model, CMI_2011 and a long term rate of 1.0 per cent per annum. At 31 March 2012 mortality assumptions were 
based on the PxA92 birth year tables multiplied by a rating of 125 per cent and allowance for medium cohort mortality improvements 
in future, with a 0.5 per cent mortality improvement underpin. The resulting life expectancy for a 65 year old pensioner is 22.1 years 
(2011/12: 20.6 years).
In July 2010, the UK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases (both for pensions  
in payment and pensions in deferment) to apply to private sector pension schemes. This has resulted in a small actuarial gain during  
the prior period in respect of the De La Rue pension plans in the UK. History of experience gains and losses:

The Group expects to contribute c£10m to its UK pension fund in 2013/14 in respect of the special funding payments designed  
to eliminate the scheme deficit.
(b) Defined contribution pension plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans for which the charge in the consolidated income statement for the year  
was £4.1m (2011/12: £2.2m).
(c) IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (revised)
Amendments to IAS 19 will be effective for the 2013/14 financial year and require the replacement of the expected return on assets and 
interest charge on pension scheme liabilities with a net financing cost based on the discount rate. IAS 19 requires retrospective adoption 
and therefore prior periods will be restated. 
The Group estimates the impact of the change, had it been effective in 2012/13, would have been to increase operating costs by £1.4m, 
increase the net interest expense by £6.2m, with compensating adjustments in other comprehensive income leaving equity unchanged. 
This would therefore reduce profit after tax by £7.6m, and reduce headline and basic EPS by 7.6p. 
The estimated impact for the 2013/14 year is to reduce operating profits by £1.7m (the Improvement Plan operating profit target will  
be impacted by the same amount) and increase the net interest expense by £6.7m and hence reduce headline and basic EPS by 8.4p.  94 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

25 Contingent liabilities
De La Rue has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation 
matters. While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received 
and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that adequate provision has been made  
to cover these matters. The Group provides guarantees and performance bonds which are issued in the ordinary course of business.  
In the event that a guarantee or bond is called, provision may be required subject to the particular circumstances, including an 
assessment of its recoverability.
In July 2010 the Board commissioned an investigation by external lawyers into issues that had been brought to its attention internally. 
The investigation, which was completed in October 2010, found nothing of substance to support the matters raised other than in 
respect of some paper production issues where it was found that a small number of the many detailed specification parameters of 
some paper had fallen marginally short of specification. It was also established that certain paper specification test certificates had been 
deliberately falsified. The Board reported the findings of the investigation to the appropriate authorities, who are considering the matter, 
and has implemented a number of measures arising from the findings of the investigation.
Provision has been made in prior years for the costs associated with the paper production issues identified at this stage including  
the write off of trade receivables and other costs relating to the investigation, production and rectification of these matters.
Provision has not been made for the potential cost of resolutions or for potential fines from regulatory authorities. The nature and extent 
of these resolutions will be the subject of ongoing discussions, the outcome of which cannot be estimated reliably at present. The timing, 
response and outcome of the consideration by the authorities of the reported findings of the investigation is also uncertain and the 
financial consequences, if any, cannot be estimated reliably at present.

Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of De La Rue plc 
(the Company) have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention and have 
been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable  
UK accounting standards. 
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 
2006, the Company is exempt from the 
requirement to present its own profit and 
loss account. The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption in Financial 
Reporting Standard (FRS) 29 (IFRS 7), 
Financial Instruments: Disclosures, not to 
prepare a financial instrument note as the 
information is available in the published 
consolidated financial statements of  
the Group.
The Company has taken advantage  
of the exemption from preparing a cash 
flow statement under the terms of FRS 1, 
Cash Flow Statements.
The accounts have been prepared as at 
30 March 2013, being the last Saturday in 
March. The comparatives for the 2011/12 
financial year are for the period ended  
31 March 2012.
The following accounting policies have been 
applied consistently in dealing with items 
which are considered material in relation  
to the Company financial statements. 
Foreign currencies
Amounts receivable from overseas 
subsidiaries which are denominated  
in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the appropriate year end rates 
of exchange. Exchange gains and losses 
on translating foreign currency amounts 
are included within the interest section 
of the profit and loss account except for 
exchange gains and losses associated with 
hedging loans that are taken to reserves.
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at the dates 
of the individual transactions. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are subsequently retranslated at 
the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Such exchange differences  
are taken to the profit and loss account.
 
Other receivables
Other receivables are measured at 
amortised cost less any provision for 
impairment. Trade and other receivables 
are discounted when the time value of 
money is considered material.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost or valuation 
in the balance sheet, less provision for  
any permanent diminution in the value  
of the investment.
Retirement benefits
The pension rights of the Company 
employees are dealt with through a 
self administered scheme, the assets 
of which are held independently of the 
Group’s finances. The scheme is a 
defined benefit scheme that is funded 
partly by contributions from members 
and partly by contributions from the 
Company and its subsidiaries at rates 
advised by independent professionally 
qualified actuaries. In accordance with 
FRS 17, the Company accounts for its 
contributions as though it were a defined 
contribution scheme. This is because 
the underlying assets and liabilities of the 
scheme cover the Company and a number 
of its subsidiaries and those assets and 
liabilities cannot be split between each 
subsidiary on a consistent and reasonable 
basis. Full details of the scheme and its 
deficit (measured on an IAS 19 basis) can 
be found in note 22 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Share based payments
The Company operates various equity  
and cash settled option schemes although 
the majority of plans are settled by the 
issue of shares. The services received  
from employees are measured by reference  
to the fair value of the share options.  
The fair value is calculated at grant date 
and recognised in the profit and loss 
account, together with a corresponding 
increase in shareholders’ funds, on a 
straight line basis over the vesting period, 
based on an estimate of the number of 
shares that will eventually vest. Vesting 
conditions, other than market conditions, 
are not taken into account when estimating 
the fair value. FRS 20 has been applied to 
share settled share options granted after  
7 November 2002.
 
Where the Company grants options  
over its own shares to the employees  
of its subsidiary undertakings these  
awards are accounted for by the  
Company, as an additional investment  
in its subsidiary. The costs are determined 
in accordance with FRS 20 share based 
payments. Any payments made by the 
subsidiary undertaking in respect of these 
arrangements are treated as a return of  
this investment.
Share based payments recharged 
to subsidiaries are recorded via the 
intercompany loan account.
Dividends
Under FRS 21, final ordinary dividends 
payable to the shareholders of the 
Company are recognised in the period  
that they are approved by the shareholders. 
Interim ordinary dividends are recognised  
in the period that they are paid.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the 
result for the period and takes into account 
taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without 
discounting, in respect of all timing 
differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes 
which have arisen but not reversed by the 
balance sheet date, except as otherwise 
required by FRS 19.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial 
guarantee contracts to guarantee the 
indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers 
these to be insurance arrangements and 
accounts for them as such. In this respect, 
the Company treats the guarantee contract 
as a contingent liability until such time as  
it becomes probable that the Company  
will be required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.

chairman’s statement
Total property return increased by 31% to £35.9m (2012: 
£27.5m) and included growing net rents of £24.5m (up 7.0% 
from £22.9m in 2012) and development profits of £7.0m 
(2012: £0.7m). Diluted EPRA net asset value per share 
increased 5.6% to 264p (2012: 250p). Total Shareholder 
Return for the year to 31 March 2013 was 28.4%, compared 
to returns for the Listed Real Estate Sector of 21.8% and for 
the UK Equity Market as a whole of 16.8%. These results 
allow the Board to continue its progressive dividend policy 
and to recommend to shareholders a final dividend of 3.70p, 
taking the total for the year to 5.55p, an increase of 7.8%.
The year has seen many successes in the Company’s 
investment portfolio and development programme. Asset 
management initiatives have driven the net income of the 
Group forward and, at 31 March 2013, passing net rents were 
£28.7m (2012: £25.9m). Our share of the surplus on revaluation 
of investment properties, including those held in joint ventures, 
was £6.8m (2012: £4.2m) and the investment portfolio is now 
valued at £407.0m (2012: £394.1m). On the development 
side we have delivered against many of the milestones set 
at the beginning of the financial year, most notably at 200 
Aldersgate Street, London EC1, where we have as of today 
let 90% of the 348,000 sq ft refurbished office building (with 
a further 6% under offer), at our 1.5m sq ft development at 
Brickfields, White City where we have received planning 
consent and contracts have been exchanged for a sale of the 
site, and at our 450,000 sq ft redevelopment of Barts Square, 
London EC1, where we have received a resolution to grant 
planning consent. 
Despite frequent commentary that banks are not lending 
enough to the private sector, there is clearly an appetite 
amongst banks to lend to well managed, profitable and 
stable public companies in the real estate sector. We continue 
to enjoy excellent relationships with our banking partners 
with c. £290m of new or renewed facilities agreed since the 
beginning of 2012, extending our debt maturity to 3.3 years. 
With interest rates continuing at historic lows, we have 
been able to ensure that we are adequately protected against 
future interest rate rises, thereby securing growing income 
surpluses, strong cash flows and good interest cover. 
During the year we consulted with shareholders on  
a proposed new annual bonus scheme, designed to codify  
the existing discretionary scheme, rewarding participants 
based on the results of the business and seeking greater 
alignment of executive remuneration with shareholders’ 
interests. The resulting bonus scheme, incorporating the 
feedback received from shareholders holding more than 50% 
of our share register, was approved by over 95% of 
shareholders who voted at the 2012 AGM. I am delighted 
this year’s results have allowed participants in the scheme 
to receive bonuses in the form of cash payments and 
deferred shares. 
Consultation with shareholders was also undertaken with 
regard to changes to the Board during the year. Richard 
Gillingwater, Senior Independent Director, and Richard 
Grant, Audit Committee Chairman, joined as independent 
non-executive directors and I welcome both of them to the 
Board. I congratulate my former deputy, Tim Murphy, who 
replaced me as Finance Director when I became Chairman, 
having served as Finance Director for the last 25 years. Our 
former Chairman, Giles Weaver, served with distinction 
during his time on the Board and I would like to thank him 
as well as Antony Beevor and Wilf Weeks, who have also 
retired, for their invaluable contributions to the Board and 
its Committees.
After a challenging five years, I believe we are on the cusp  
of returning to delivering outperformance. Looking forward, 
we will benefit from a rebalanced portfolio with a strong and 
growing income stream which we intend to increase 
significantly in the next year. In addition, our development 
portfolio is expected to deliver substantial profits and cash 
returns over the same period and in the following years.  
We look forward to these two elements of our business 
combining to generate strong returns and value on behalf  
of all our shareholders.

Your Company has had a very good year against  
a backdrop of challenging, albeit improving, 
economic conditions. The total unleveraged return 
of its property portfolio, as measured by IPD, was 
8.6%, the Company’s best return since 31 March 
2007, compared to the IPD Universe of March 
valued funds of 3.9%.  helical bar plc 2013

Helical’s strategy 
•  Our investment portfolio includes high yielding multi-let 
retail located throughout the UK and offices in central 
London. Through intensive property management we 
have been able to grow income and enhance capital 
values. An analysis of the properties we hold demonstrates 
how we have managed to circumvent the well documented 
pitfalls in the UK’s retail sector to maintain positive rental 
returns. We can now look forward to capital growth for 
good quality secondary stock as those investors seeking 
better yields now move up the risk curve. The balance  
of our investment portfolio has increased its weighting 
towards central London office investments where we have 
concentrated our efforts over the last two years and where 
our main focus now lies. 
•  Having created stable positive income returns the 
Company is now able to progress with a number of new 
developments and refurbishments where by carrying  
out land assembly, planning and in some cases securing 
pre-letting or pre-funding, we can create significant returns 
with little capital or balance-sheet exposure. It should be 
noted that projects at 200 Aldersgate EC1, in partnership 
with the Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, and the Brickfields, 
White City W12 development, acting as development 
partner with Aviva Investors, have involved limited use 
of your Company’s capital. We shall remain focussed  
on central London schemes for the length of the current 
market cycle. 
•  In previous reports I have referred to Helical Retail’s success 
in securing a number of foodstore-led developments 
throughout the Midlands and the South East. Acting with 
our long standing partners at Oswin Developments, we 
have now optioned or have exclusivity over eight projects 
with further deals in the pipeline. Despite recent reports of 
retrenchment by the major foodstore companies, our 
outstanding relationships and reputation have enabled  
us to obtain sites in those areas still under-serviced and  
in demand from foodstore retailers. The projects will be 
pre-sold to investment partners. 
•  It would be wrong not to acknowledge our position as 
one of the UK’s leading developers of retirement villages. 
These take the form of 150+ units set around a clubhouse 
in parkland settings for sale to those over 55 years of age. 
With the benefit of advantageous bank facilities, we have 
embarked on three new projects comprising of 467 units 
on sites near Horsham in Sussex, Stratford-upon-Avon in 
Warwickshire and Exeter in Devon. Success at Liphook 
(151 units), despite the challenges of the last five years, 
gives us the encouragement to continue with this specialist 
sector in partnership with Urban Renaissance Villages. 
•  We remain grateful to our supportive bankers who have 
proved ever-willing to respond positively and quickly to 
requests we put to them. This enables us to be quick to 
take advantage of opportunities that arise. You will note 
that we have successfully increased our banking facilities 
during the year, extending their maturity dates. This 
process will continue and we will look to further extend 
and diversify our sources of funding.
Our market
Our path through the next three years becomes clearer  
by the day. We will maintain our high yielding investment 
portfolio and look to reinvest cash receipts from sales of our 
trading and development stock into accretive acquisitions 
with a strong emphasis on central London. I regard our 
successful investment in foodstore development and the 
retirement village business as valuable profit generators 
that sit beside our main focus on the opportunities we see 
in central London. 
Overseas equity continues to be a vital element in today’s 
property market. It is not and never has been our role to 
compete to invest in prime stock, but rather to use our 
expertise to create prime investments for sale into a strong 
market. We are confident that given the skills and experience 
we provide and the financial partners with whom we are 
involved, the next few years will see enhanced profits.
It is worth restating the Company’s strategy to re-emphasise 
our focus and differentiate ourselves from our peer group. We 
are a property investment and development company whose 
objective is to maximise shareholder returns by driving income, 
repositioning assets to deliver capital growth and generating 
substantial development gains employing limited amounts of 
our own equity. This simple strategy is once again starting to 
bear fruit and deliver industry outperformance.

directors’ report - annual review
We believe that our market is now moving out of recession, 
albeit slowly. Much of the potential overhaul of bad bank 
debt is being taken out by globally financed debt acquisitions 
and vast sums of ‘equity’ continue to seek to invest in the 
UK, safe in the knowledge that we enjoy the ‘rule of law’ 
and a steady state economy.
Helical’s progress 
We were delighted to announce last week the letting  
of 80,909 sq ft to FTI Consulting at 200 Aldersgate which 
triggers our entitlement to a profit share. In similar vein  
we have announced the sale of the Brickfields, White City 
project where we have acted as development partner on 
behalf of Aviva. Once this sale contract has been completed, 
we will be entitled to a profit share, the details of which we 
will be able to disclose at that time. We anticipate both the 
above transactions will create substantial profits to be 
recognised in the accounts for the year to 31 March 2014.
At Mitre Square, EC3, we have commenced demolition 
and, following granting of planning consent at Barts Square, 
EC1, we are preparing for development in January 2015. 
We are also hopeful of submitting a planning application  
in July for the Hammersmith Town Hall project in partnership 
with Grainger, and anticipate consent for our major 
refurbishment at 207-211 Old Street at “Silicon Roundabout” 
prior to the end of the year. 
As has already been announced we have completed our 
major Polish retail development at Gliwice where we maintain 
a 50% interest with a pre-agreed take-out in approximately 
18 months’ time by our partner, clients of Standard Life. 
Summary 
Happily the ‘Helical Model’ is alive and well. My thanks to 
the Helical team, our investment partners, our bankers, the 
many property agents and corporate advisors with whom 
we have the pleasure of dealing with day to day. Last but 
by no means least, our thanks to you, our shareholders, for 
your support.

strategy and performance
Investment strategy
The investment portfolio, which is mainly let and income 
producing, has two main purposes:
•  To provide a steady income stream to cover overheads, interest and 
dividends;
•  To produce above average capital growth over the cycle to contribute 
to growth in the Group’s net asset value.
We seek to achieve these aims through careful, disciplined selection of 
properties, generally comprising multi-let offices in London, shopping 
centres, industrial estates and mixed-use portfolios. Our key aim, when 
undertaking this selection process, is to seek to ensure that there is 
sustainable demand from potential occupiers for all of our assets.
We frequently refurbish and/or extend our properties. We also work 
closely with tenants with the aim of maintaining maximum occupancy 
in our portfolio properties. Our relationships with these tenants can lead 
to opportunities to increase value through re-gearing leases or moving 
tenants within a building as their respective businesses expand or 
contract. 
Additionally, we may purchase entirely vacant buildings (such as the 
Morgan Quarter, Cardiff or Shepherds Building, London W14) with a 
view to carrying out a major refurbishment and, where we are confident 
that the occupational market is strong enough to allow the majority of 
the building to be let quickly.
Development strategy
We employ a wide variety of approaches to our 
development activities. The Group aims to limit the 
amount of equity that it deploys into development 
situations through a variety of different structures which 
are explained below. These aim to maximise the Group’s 
share of profits in a development by leveraging the 
capital employed by the Group and with a view to 
managing the risks inherent in the development process. 
•  Participation in profit share situations where no equity investment is 
required, where we will seek to minimise our ongoing fee to maximise 
our profit share so that our interests are completely aligned with our 
partners. In this way, for minimal equity commitments, we can benefit 
from a significant profit share if we contribute to a project’s success 
by using our skills and experience through the entire development 
process. This participation method was used in connection with our 
investments in the Fulham Wharf and 200 Aldersgate developments. 
•  Reduce up-front equity required by entering into conditional contracts 
or options. We have used this approach in the context of our Mitre 
Square development (where Helical has entered into conditional 
contracts) and our foodstore led supermarket development 
programme (where land is optioned or put under contract conditional 
on achieving planning permission and pre-let to a supermarket 
operator) thereby mitigating the risks of the developments.
•  Co-investment alongside a larger partner where we have a minority 
equity stake, where we will typically receive a “waterfall” payment 
subject to certain conditions being met. Such waterfall payments tend 
to be structured in a manner where we receive a greater profit share 
than our percentage investment depending upon the success of the 
project. This investment method is used in our investments in the Barts 
Square, Old Street and White City developments.
•  Traditional forward funding, where the cost of the development overrun 
is one to be borne by the developer for a commensurate profit participation. 
In such a case, we have no equity in the property but underwrite a 
maximum build cost and bear the risk of costs being in excess of an 
agreed maximum construction price. helical bar plc 2013

Our risk strategy
Risk is an integral part of any Group’s business activities 
and Helical’s ability to identify, assess, monitor and 
manage each risk to which it is exposed is fundamental 
to its financial stability, current and future financial 
performance and reputation. As well as seeing changes 
in our internal and external environment as potential 
risks, we also see them as being opportunities which can 
drive performance.
Risk management starts at Board level where the Directors set the overall 
risk appetite of the Group and the individual risk policies. These risk policies 
are the framework used by Helical’s management to run the business. 
Part of management’s role is to act within these policies and to report to 
the Board on how these policies are being operated.
The Group’s risk appetite and specific risk policies are continually assessed 
by the Board to ensure that they are appropriate and consistent with the 
Group’ s overall strategy and the external market conditions. The effectiveness 
of the Group’ s risk management strategy is reviewed annually by the Directors.
The risks faced by the Group do not change significantly from year to year 
but their importance and the Group’s response to them vary in accordance 
with the changes in the internal and external environment. The Board 
considers not only the current situation but also potential future scenarios 
and how these might impact our business when setting the Group’ s policies.
Helical sees its principal uncertainties as falling within the following 
categories:
Market risks are risks specific to the economy as a whole and to the 
property sector. These include the UK economy falling into recession 
again and falling property prices.
Strategic risk includes the risk that Helical’s business strategy or capital 
structure results in the Group underperforming the rest of the property 
sector, or being unable to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. 
Helical’s strategy is regularly discussed by the Board to ensure that it is 
appropriate.
Helical is subject to a number of financial risks due to the way it is 
funded. These include the risk that interest rates rise, the risk that Helical 
does not have ability to access cash as it is required and the risk that the 
Group’s lenders no longer wish to offer loans to it. These risks are carefully 
managed by arranging debt repayment dates to spread the maturity 
profile of bank loans over several years, seeking medium to long term 
debt, limiting the impact of potential interest rate rises through the use of 
interest rate swaps and caps, ensuring the availability of resources 
through the preparation of detailed medium and long term cash forecasts, 
retaining a significant level of cash or undrawn committed bank facilities and 
ensuring strong relationships are maintained with all the major real estate 
lenders.
Helical’s continued success is reliant on our management and staff and 
successful relationships with our joint venture partners. People risks include 
the inability of Helical to find the right personnel to carry out our strategy. 
The retention and incentivisation of our staff is of great importance to Helical 
and executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate 
and retain directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the Group’ s position 
as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value 
and returns. We insist that our employees and joint venture partners act 
with both ethical and health & safety considerations at the forefront of 
their decision making processes.
The Group derives a significant part of its results from development activity. 
Development profits are more likely to be subject to fluctuation due to external 
factors as they are more opportunistic in nature. Development risks 
include: changes in planning legislation, difficulty in managing current 
developments and a scarcity in future development opportunities. Helical has 
an experienced development team with an excellent track record and a 
well established network of joint venture partners, contractors and 
professional advisors. Helical has no set formula for managing its 
developments and delivers development projects through a variety of 
means including using our own capital, bringing in joint venture partners 
and forward funding development projects. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk within the business. However 
the small size of our team and our flat management structure allows the 
Executive Directors to have close contact with all aspects of the business 
and allows us to ensure that the identification and management of risks 
and opportunities is part of the mindset of all decision makers at Helical.
A more detailed analysis of these risks and what steps the Group takes 
to mitigate these risks can be found in appendix II on page 104. Europa Centralna, Gliwice

Performance 
A property company’s share price should reflect growth  
in net assets per share. Our Group’s main objective is to 
maximise growth in assets from increases in investment 
portfolio values and from retained earnings from other 
property related activities.
Key performance indicators and benchmarks
We incentivise management to outperform the Group’s competitors by 
setting the right levels for performance indicators against which rewards 
are measured. We also design our remuneration packages to align 
management’s interests with shareholders’ aspirations. Key to this is the 
monitoring and reporting against identifiable performance targets and 
benchmarks. For a number of years we have reported on these, the most 
important of which are:
Investment Property Databank
The Investment Property Databank (“IPD”) produces a number of 
independent benchmarks of property returns which are regarded as  
the main industry indices. 
IPD has compared the ungeared performance of Helical’s total property 
portfolio against that of portfolios within IPD for the last 20 years. The 
Group’s annual performance target is to exceed the top quartile of the 
IPD database. Helical’s ungeared performance for the year to 31 March 
2013 was 8.6% (2012: 5.6%) compared to the IPD median benchmark of 
3.9% (2012: 6.4%) and upper quartile benchmark of 4.7% (2012: 7.0%).
The three years to 31 March 2013 was a period during which the Group 
continued to transform its property holdings and this has had an impact 
on performance in that period. However, over five, ten and twenty years 
the Group’s property portfolio continued to outperform the IPD benchmark.
Net asset value
Net asset value per share represents the share of net assets attributable 
to each ordinary share. Whilst the basic and diluted net asset per share 
calculations provide a guide to performance, the property industry prefers 
to use an adjusted diluted net asset per share. The adjustments 
necessary to arrive at this figure are shown in note 32 to these accounts. 
Management is incentivised to exceed 15% p.a. growth in net asset value 
per share. The diluted net asset value per share, excluding trading stock 
surplus, at 31 March 2013 was 217p (2012: 217p).
Including the surplus on valuation of trading and development stock, the 
diluted EPRA net asset value per share at 31 March 2013 was 264p 
(2012: 250p). Diluted EPRA triple net asset value per share was 259p 
(2012: 246p).
Other key performance indicators include:
•  a surplus of net rental income over finance costs, overheads  
and dividends;
•  staff retention and average length of service; and
• inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index. Europa Centralna, Gliwice

Our £407m investment portfolio provides 
income to cover all operational and finance 
costs and dividends. We have a strong 
focus on asset management, maximising 
net operating income and working 
closely with our tenants. 
It is our aim to grow our investment 
portfolio from 71% now to 75% of our 
assets further increasing our net 
cash flow.
Our income stream is diverse and secure 
with no tenant accounting for more than 
5.5% of the rent roll. Our average weighted 
unexpired lease term is 6.4 years. 
The income stream has grown steadily 
since 2010 and is highly reversionary. 
The passing rent from our investment 
portfolio is £28.7m and the estimated 
rental value of our portfolio £32.4m 
(Helical share). This reversionary 
income will be captured 
through letting vacant  
units and rent reviews. 
Through judicious buying  
of under-rented buildings  
in growth areas, securing  
lettings and undertaking  
refurbishments, we aim  
to generate substantial  
capital growth in our  
property values.

directors’ report - annual review
Asset management 
During the year contracted income increased by £0.38m.
There was significant activity within the investment portfolio with a lease 
event on nearly 300 leases.
We lost £0.75m of rent at lease end or break (2.5% rent roll) and a further 
£0.73m through tenant administrations (2.5% rent roll). Our biggest 
exposures to administrations were Clintons, Peacocks and JJB Sport. We 
did not have any units let to HMV, Jessops or Comet and only one each 
of Blockbuster and Dreams. 
We concluded £1.48m of new lettings (5.3% rent roll) and benefitted from 
uplifts at rent reviews of £0.38m. 
Rent lost at break/expiry -£0.75m
Rent lost to administrations -£0.73m
Rent reviews +£0.38m
Lease renewals and new lettings +£1.48m
Total change +£0.38m
We also managed to substantially reduce the number of tenants that were 
holding over (in occupation beyond their lease expiry) from 57 tenants at 
31 March 2012 (3.6% rent roll) to 29 at 31 March 2013 (1.1% of rent roll). 
Overall we have seen good letting demand across the portfolio, reducing 
our vacancy rate from 8.8% (31 March 2012) to 5.7%. We have seen 
strong take up and rental growth in our London office portfolio and in 
particular in our retail holding in Cardiff. Across the portfolio we have seen 
ERV growth of 0.4%, with a marginal fall in the retail portfolio (-1.3%) 
being more than offset by our London offices (5.9%). Note that this 
occupancy and ERV analysis ignores Barts Square and Old Street, both of 
which have redevelopment opportunities. 
Sales
Since 31 March 2012 we have sold £50.8m of property (£83.2m year to 
31 March 2012). Our sales are lower than previous years principally because 
the majority of our non-income producing assets with limited growth 
prospects had already been sold.
Significant sales include £10.6m of units at our retirement village at 
Bramshott Place, Liphook and part of our site at Exeter for £7.6m. We 
also sold our retirement village site at Milton, Cambridgeshire, having 
achieved planning consent for open market housing, for £6.8m. 
We sold the remainder of our industrial development site in Stockport for 
£4.5m bringing our joint venture with Chancerygate to a conclusion. 
We also sold properties in East Kilbride for £4.8m, Ashford for £7.4m, 
Merlin Park, Manchester for £3.6m and Southwark for £6.5m. 
Acquisitions
It has been a relatively quiet year for acquisitions with much focus on 
delivering value from the existing portfolio.
We did however acquire 207-211 Old Street in joint venture with Crosstree 
(Helical 33.3% interest) for £60.8m. A planning application for a major 
refurbishment and creation of extra floor area as well as significant public 
realm works will be submitted shortly. Whilst plans are being developed, 
we are benefiting from a 4.2% running yield. 
Future investment acquisitions 
The focus remains on London for future acquisitions albeit competition is 
strong. With continued efforts we are confident that we will be able to 
acquire reasonably priced assets with significant potential to add value 
through repositioning and refurbishment with the potential to increase 
rents. These assets are likely to be multi-let (or have the ability to be so) 
in fringe central London locations such as Hammersmith, Islington, 
Camden, Southwark and Shoreditch.  helical bar plc 2013

principal investment properties
Our strategy is to acquire multi-tenanted 
properties where there is significant 
opportunity to increase net operating income 
and capital values. In both our office and retail 
investments we acquire properties with rents 
which are low compared to equivalent 
buildings providing scope for rental growth 
and low total occupational costs. We spend 
a considerable amount of time talking to 
our tenants both prior to acquiring buildings 
and during the course of our ownership to 
ensure that the space they occupy continues 
to be fit for their purpose. We continue to 
enjoy very strong cash on cash returns from 
many of our high yielding retail assets.
Corby Town Centre 
Corby 
This asset, comprising nearly 40 acres, is virtually 
the entirety of the commercial centre of Corby. It 
was acquired in 2011 and, since acquisition, 40 
new leases or lease renewals have been concluded. 
Anchor tenants include Primark, TK Maxx, H&M, 
Argos and Wilkinsons. We enjoy cash on cash 
returns of 15.0% and have increased income 
since its acquisition. 
The first phase of cosmetic refurbishment works 
has completed, substantially improving the look and 
feel of the centre and driving strong letting interest.
Tenant performance remains good with both the 
Dreams and Blockbusters on the Oasis Retail Park 
being included in the package acquired by their 
respective new owners and remaining open 
for trade. 
Significant projects are now planned to convert 
vacant upper parts of the town to residential with 
a planning application having been submitted for 
the first phase of these works.
The Morgan Quarter  
Cardiff 
Acquired empty in 2005 this asset was 
comprehensively refurbished and let to retailers 
including Urban Outfitters, TK Maxx and Molton 
Brown. During the year we let a unit to Jack Wills 
setting new zone A evidence of £175 per sq ft. 
Since the opening of St Davids 2 in 2009, The 
Hayes has become one of Cardiff’s principal 
retailing pitches. We have benefited from a 
number of new lettings and positive rent reviews 
increasing passing rent to £3.3m, continuing the 
progression towards an ERV of £4.2m. The rent 
reviews concluded in the year have shown a 
25% rental growth from 2007 to 2012.

60% economic interest in the centre and 
undertakes all of the asset management 
activities. Since its acquisition, the rental income 
attributable to this asset has increased by nine per 
cent and more than 30 new lettings to tenants 
including The Post Office, Trespass, Watt Brothers

We have had strong tenant demand at our 
shopping centre in Newmarket and since the 
year end is now fully let for the first time in at

Shepherds Building, 
Shepherds Bush, W14 
This 151,000 multi-let office building close 
to Westfield Shopping Centre has enjoyed an

There is currently just 2.6% vacant and rental 
growth prospects are strong. Average rent in  
the building is £24.25 psf with recent letting 
evidence in the locality from £27.50 to £30.00. 
ERV for the building stands at £4.2m compared 
to a passing rent of £3.6m.
We are planning to undertake a major 
refurbishment of the common parts of the 
building during the course of the year with  
a view to driving rental values forward.

This 3.12 acre asset was acquired in 
November 2012 for £60.8m in joint 
venture with Crosstree Real Estate 
Partners LLP (Helical interest 33.3%). The 
site is in the heart of “T ech City”, an area 
of London which is a hub for technology, 
media and telecommunications 
companies and is benefitting from 
substantial investment in infrastructure.
Since acquisition plans have been 
developed to substantially increase  
the amount of space on site, refurbish 
existing areas and significantly upgrade 
the public realm. A planning application 
has recently been submitted. 
Whilst working on our refurbishment

principal investment properties 
In joint venture with The Baupost Group LLC (Baupost 66.7%, Helical 33.3%) we own the 
freehold interest in land and buildings at Bartholomew Close, Little Britain and Montague Street, 
a 3.2 acre site adjacent to the new Barts Hospital and just south of Smithfield Market. The 
current buildings comprise 420,000 sq ft let to the NHS for circa £3.5m per annum on a number 
of short term leases that expire between 2014 and 2016. In November 2012, a resolution to 
grant planning permission was obtained and planning consent has now been issued following 
signing of the s.106 agreement. The scheme will bring much needed regeneration to this area of 
the City and will seek to retain some of the existing buildings and complement them with a 
sympathetic redevelopment of the site. It will comprise circa 230,000 sq ft of office space in two 
buildings and 215 high quality residential apartments in 17 buildings with retail space at ground 
floor level. Significant public realm improvements are planned, which will be incorporated into the 
wider Smithfield Area Strategy being worked up by the City. We estimate a total development 
value of circa £470m.

In the year to 31 March 2013, profits 
from the Group’s development 
programme of £7.7m (2012: £5.2m) 
were partially offset by provisions of 
£0.7m (2012: £4.5m) made against the 
carrying value of development stock, 
leaving net development profits of 
£7.0m, up from £0.7m in 2012. 
Looking at the individual schemes, 
profits of £6.1m were recognised in 
respect of our share of the result at 
Fulham Wharf, London SW6 and £1.4m 
was generated at our retirement village 
scheme at Bramshott Place, Liphook. 
At 200 Aldersgate, London EC1, we 
were able to recognise £1.0m of an 
additional management fee in addition 
to the development management fees 
of £0.25m. However, the sales of land 
at Stockport, Milton and Exeter and 
units at Hailsham for total sale proceeds 
of £19.6m, created a loss of £0.3m, 
mainly arising from sale expenses.  
In addition, we wrote off the overheads 
of our retail development programme 
in Poland and reduced the carrying 
value of the completed development 
at Wroclaw, pending renewal of leases 
in 2013, with a resulting charge of 
£1.7m from our Polish operations.

Helical was appointed asset and development 
manager by Deutsche Pfandbriefbank in May 
2010. Our brief was to refurbish and let this 
office building, vacant since 2005 when the 
previous tenant, Clifford Chance, relocated to 
Canary Wharf. We have refreshed and re-clad 
parts of the building, creating a “vertical village” 
for office users comprising a variety of floor-plates 
to suit a range of different occupiers, as well as 
exceptional tenant facilities, including a concierge 
cycle store service, an on-site gym and a café 
and business lounge. Refurbishment works 
were completed and the building re-launched 
in January 2011.The building now comprises 
348,000 sq ft of offices, 16,673 sq ft of retail 
and 39,601 sq ft of basement space. The 
refurbishment works were completed within 
budget in December 2010 and we have been 
seeking tenants for the vacant space since 
that date. By 31 March 2013 we had let 
208,261 sq ft of office space, 9,000 sq ft of 
retail and the whole of the basement space to 
Virgin Active. Since then we have let 103,323 
sq ft of space and have under offer a further 
21,430 sq ft feet of offices and the remaining 
7,673 sq ft of retail. This leaves just 14,714 sq ft 
of office space to let. Rents of £40 to £45 psf 
have been achieved on the larger floors 
(20,000 sq ft to 40,000 sq ft) and £50 to £55 psf 
on the smaller upper floors. Now the building is 
over 80% let our right to receive a development 
management profit share is triggered. We 
anticipate receiving our profit share in 2013.

Mitre Square is a landmark City office scheme in the heart of the insurance sector in London. 
We have signed agreements to purchase two adjoining sites from the City of London and 
SFL2 Limited (previously Ansbacher) and will complete the purchase of 1 Mitre Square in 
the Summer of 2013. The s.106 agreement, which enabled the planning permission to be 
issued, was signed in 2011. We have commenced the demolition of the existing buildings to 
facilitate the construction of a new building comprising offices of 273,000 sq ft NIA and 
3,000 sq ft of retail/restaurant use. It is anticipated that construction will not commence until 
a substantial pre-let is agreed or a forward funding is obtained and the finished development 
will have a capital value of circa £250m.

We have a development agreement with the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham, in 
partnership with residential specialist Grainger plc, for the regeneration of the west end of King 
Street, Hammersmith. Despite obtaining a resolution to grant planning consent in November 
2011, its referral to the Mayor was withdrawn pending further discussions with the Greater 
London Authority. We have revised our plans, following detailed consultation with interested 
parties, and intend submitting a new planning application in the Summer of 2013.

At Sands End, Fulham Wharf, on behalf of landowner Sainsbury’s, 
we secured planning permission for a new 100,000 sq ft food store, 
together with 463 residential units (590,000 sq ft) and 11,000 sq ft 
of restaurant, retail and community use. In June 2012, the site 
was sold to a joint venture between housebuilder, Barratts, and 
London & Quadrant housing association. Construction of the first 
phase, consisting of the food store and 267 residential units has 
commenced. Helical received a fee of £1.5m in 2011 for obtaining 
planning permission for the scheme and has recognised a profit 
share from the sale of the site and will receive the cash as phased 
payments are made to Sainsbury’ s. In accordance with the Group’ s 
income recognition policies and IFRS, the Group has recognised 
this additional income in these accounts.

We continue to work closely with the main 
food retailers with a view to satisfying their 
ongoing new store requirements. Whilst 
there is no doubt the heat has come out of 
the occupier market, their appetite for 
stores in key locations, where a quality 
proposal can be delivered, is likely to 
continue going forward.
Parkgate, Shirley,  
West Midlands
At Parkgate Shirley, where we have a 50% 
interest, we continue to make good progress 
with the construction of an 80,000 sq ft Asda 
foodstore, and 78,000 sq ft of retail and leisure 
accommodation, 50% of which is in solicitors’ 
hands. The scheme is due to open for trade 
April in 2014. The private residential element of 
the scheme is under offer to a major housebuilder 
and the site for 51 Extracare units is being 
purchased by a local Housing Association.

A retirement village is a private residential 
community in which active over-55s are able 
to live independently in retirement. Residents 
have typically down-sized from a larger family 
home into a cottage or apartment which 
provides no maintenance or security issues.
With access to a central clubhouse containing 
a bar and restaurant facilities, health and 
fitness rooms and surrounded by maintained 
grounds, this retirement option is proving 
increasingly popular.
Bramshott Place, 
Liphook, Hampshire
The original Bramshott Place Village was an 
Elizabethan mansion built in 1580, although now 
only the original Grade II listed Tudor Gatehouse 
remains, which we have fully restored. The land 
and buildings were derelict when Helical acquired 
them in 2001. Changing planning from its previously 
designated employment use to a retirement 
village took several years but was eventually 
achieved in 2006.
The development of 151 cottages and apartments, 
and the new clubhouse, started in late 2007 and 
has proceeded in phases as units are sold. 
Construction of the final phase of 55 units completed 
in late 2012. To date, we have sold 115 units 
(£44.25m of proceeds) with reservations on 
a further 14 units, with just 22 units, mainly 
apartments, left to sell. 
Durrants Village, 
Faygate, Horsham, West Sussex
Durrants Village, a 30 acre site, had operated as 
a sawmill with outside storage for many years. 
We were granted planning permission, at appeal, 
in May 2009 following a public inquiry where the 
Inspector allowed a development comprising a 
retirement village of 148 units, eight affordable 
housing units, a 50 bed residential care home 
and a central facilities clubhouse building. 
Following changes to the scheme the development 
will be for 171 units. The first phase (43 units) 
started in May 2012 for the construction of a 
retirement village and clubhouse and we have 
exchanged on one sale and have reservations 
on 16 units with up-field reservations on a 
further 13 units in future phases.
Maudslay Park, 
Great Alne, Warwickshire
This is a Green Belt site which has 320,000 sq ft 
of built footprint and benefits from Major 
Development Site planning policy. Measuring 
82 acres this site received outline planning 
permission in April 2011 for a retirement village 
of 132 units plus 47 extra care units. Demolition 
and enabling works have completed with 
construction to follow in autumn 2013. 
Millbrook Village,
Exeter
This 19 acre site was acquired in 2007 from 
the St Loye’s Foundation, a long established 
rehabilitation college in the city of Exeter. 
Resolution to grant planning permission was 
obtained in October 2009 for a retirement village 
of 206 units, a 50 bed residential care home, 
an affordable extra-care block of 50 units and a 
central facilities clubhouse building. Demolition, 
site clearance and archaeological survey work 
have been completed. In 2011 we received 
planning consent for 63 open market housing 
units on part of the site and sold this part in 
summer 2012. Construction of a retirement 
village and clubhouse in phases on the 
remainder of the site is expected to commence 
in summer 2013.
Ely Road, 
Milton, Cambridge
This 21 acre site was acquired from EDF in 
2006 and was previously used as a training 
centre and depot. Located within the Green 
Belt, planning permission had been obtained for 
a retirement village of 101 units and a central 
facilities clubhouse building. In 2011, we 
received consent for 89 open market housing 
units and sold the whole site in summer 2012.

financial review
Helical’s business model
Helical aims to deliver market leading returns by acquiring high yielding 
investment properties, applying a rigorous approach to asset management 
and deploying limited equity into development situations which have the 
potential to be highly profitable. We have set a target balance between 
the income producing portfolio and non-income producing development 
stock of 75:25, and have an active asset management programme for 
the investment portfolio with a clear strategy of increasing net operating 
income. Risks associated with our development programme are mitigated 
through limited equity exposure, options, forward funding, conditional 
contracts and joint ventures with major UK and global institutions. Our 
aim is to have a stable platform with all recurring operational and finance 
costs and dividends fully covered by revenue streams from our investment 
portfolio, as supplemented by short term rental income from the development 
programme. Gearing is used on a tactical basis, being raised to accentuate 
property performance when property returns are judged to materially 
outperform the cost of debt. 
Joint ventures
Increasingly, we are entering into joint ventures with partners who provide 
the majority of the equity for an acquisition, in return for accessing Helical’s 
asset management or development expertise, thereby reducing Helical’s 
financial risk but allowing exceptional returns to be made. We are bound 
by accounting convention to account for our share of the net results and 
net assets of joint ventures in limited detail in the income statement and 
balance sheet, as supplemented in the notes to the financial statements. 
In this review we have incorporated the separate components into a more 
detailed “See-through” analysis of our property portfolio and debt profile 
and the associated income streams and financing costs, to assist in 
providing a more comprehensive overview of the Group’s activities.
European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”)
The European Public Real Estate Association is a body which aims, through 
its best practice recommendations, to make the financial statements of public 
real estate companies clearer, more transparent and comparable across 
Europe. Earnings reported in the income statement as required under IFRS 
do not provide stakeholders with the most relevant information on the operating 
performance of the underlying property portfolio of real estate companies. 
A key measure of a company’s operational performance and the extent to 
which its dividend payments to shareholders are underpinned by earnings is 
the level of recurring income arising from core operational activities. Unrealised 
changes in valuation, gains or losses on disposals of properties and certain 
other items do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of the company’ s 
underlying operational performance and are, therefore, excluded from this 
measure. 
Net asset value is a key performance measure used in the real estate industry. 
However, net asset value as reported in the financial statements under IFRS 
does not provide stakeholders with the most relevant information on the fair 
value of the assets and liabilities within an ongoing real estate investment 
company with a long term investment strategy. The objective of the EPRA 
NAV measure is to highlight the fair value of net assets on an ongoing, 
long-term basis. Assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in 
normal circumstances such as the fair value of financial derivatives and deferred 
taxes on property valuation surpluses are therefore excluded. Similarly 
trading properties and development are adjusted to their fair value under 
EPRA’s measure.

EPRA Earnings
Adjusted EPRA Earnings per share, before performance related awards, increased by 116% to 8.2p per share (2012: 3.8p), reflecting increased 
development profits of £7.0m (2012: £0.7m) and the Group’s share of net rental income of £24.5m (2012: £22.9m). After taking into account 
performance related bonuses and share awards of £6.8m (2012: £0.4m), EPRA Earnings per share reduced to 2.4p (2012: 3.4p).

surplus in the joint ventures.

Income Statement
The main focus of the year was on targeting and working towards the many development milestones that were set in early 2012. Whilst these had little 
effect on the income statement for the year under review, they are expected to have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group in future years. 
Apart from these milestones, we continued to dispose of investment properties which had reached their short to medium term potential as well as 
selling those development sites that were surplus to our development plans. We added to our investment portfolio through a major acquisition with a 
new joint venture partner and continued towards the Group’s stated target balance between the income producing property portfolio and non-income 
producing development stock of 75:25. 
Rental income and property overheads
Gross rental income receivable by the group in respect of wholly owned properties increased by 11.7% to £25.8m (2012: £23.1m), mainly reflecting the 
additions made towards the end of the previous financial year. The Group’s share of gross rents receivable in joint ventures fell 6.0% to £6.2m 
(2012: £6.6m). The see-through gross rents totalled £32.0m, an increase of 7.8% on 2012. After taking account of head rents payable on those 
properties held on long leases, and the costs of managing the assets, void costs and the amortisation of annual letting costs, see-through net rents 
increased by 7.0% to £24.5m (2012: £22.9m). Bad debts from tenant administrations and failures remained low at 2.4% of gross rents (2012: 2.0%). helical bar plc 2013

Development programme
Looking at the development programme, our success at Fulham Wharf, London SW6, enabled the Company to recognise further profits of £6.1m 
arising out of the development management agreement with Sainsbury’s. At 200 Aldersgate Street, London EC1, the success in letting space enables 
us to recognise £1.0m of an additional management fee receivable due when the property is sold, when we expect further substantial profits to be 
recognised based on our post year end performance. In addition, we completed the sale of the remaining units at our industrial development at 
Stockport and sold two of the remaining industrial units at Ropemaker Park, Hailsham, at their book value of £5m. The retirement village development 
programme was financed with sales of our undeveloped retirement village site at Milton, Cambridge, part of the site at Millbrook Village, Exeter and 
continued sales of units at Bramshott Place, Liphook, generating over £24m of net sale proceeds during the year. These sales, together with 
development finance agreed with our banks, provide the funding for the completion of works at Bramshott Place, the commencement of construction 
at Durrants Village, Faygate, as well as financing enabling works at Great Alne and Exeter. Profits of £1.4m were generated from the sales at Bramshott 
Place. 
Offsetting these profits we made a £0.8m provision against the carrying value of our fully let retail development at Wroclaw, Poland and have expensed 
the running costs of our Warsaw office, charging £1.7m in total from our Polish operations. Other provisions against stock totalled £0.7m (2012: 
£4.5m).
Share of results of joint ventures
As mentioned above, Helical has increasingly sought to acquire larger assets in joint venture with funds that provide the majority of the equity required 
to purchase the assets, whilst relying on the Group to provide the asset management or development expertise. These joint ventures include our share 
of the investment properties at Clyde Shopping Centre, Clydebank; Barts Square, London EC1 and 207-211 Old Street, London EC1, and our development 
schemes at Europa Centralna, Gliwice, Poland; Shirley Town Centre, West Midlands; Leisure Plaza, Milton Keynes and King Street, Hammersmith. 
Detailed analysis of the financial position of our share of these joint ventures is provided in note 19 to these accounts and the see-through analysis on 
pages 37 and 38. In the year under review, net rents of £4.9m (2012: £5.1m) were received, offset by net finance costs of £2.2m (2012: £2.2m). A gain 
on revaluation of the investment portfolio of £3.1m (2012: £0.6m), primarily arose in respect of Barts Square. Net of taxes, our joint ventures 
contributed £3.9m (2012: £2.5m). 
Administration costs
Administration costs, before performance related awards, increased by 9%, from £7.4m to £8.1m, mainly arising from an average salary rise of 5% 
for UK employees of the group. 
Performance related share awards and bonus payments increased to £6.8m (2012: £0.4m) for the year. Of this amount, the £1.9m (2012: £0.03m) 
charge for share awards under the Performance Share Plan is expensed through the Income Statement but added back to shareholders funds through 
the Statement of Changes in Equity. The £4.1m accrual for bonus payments comprises £2.7m which will be paid in June 2013, £0.8m which will be 
carried forward to next year in accordance with the terms of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and £0.6m which will be paid in deferred shares to be 
held for a minimum of three years. In addition, National Insurance of £0.6m has been accrued for.

Finance costs, finance income and derivative financial instruments
Interest payable on bank loans including our share of loans on assets held in joint ventures but before capitalised interest, fell marginally to £12.7m 
(2012: £13.0m). Capitalised interest reduced from £3.3m to £2.5m reflecting the lower level of development stock held during the year. Other interest 
payable increased from £0.9m to £1.7m. As a consequence of these movements, total finance costs increased by £1.2m from £10.6m to £11.8m. 
Finance income earned on cash deposits increased to £0.9m (2012:£0.6m).
Derivative financial instruments have been valued on a mark to market basis and a charge of £2.6m (2012: £0.3m) has been recognised in the 
Income Statement.
Taxation 
The deferred tax asset is principally derived from tax losses which the Group believe will be utilised against profits in the foreseeable future.
Investment portfolio
Sales of over £23m of investment assets, where our asset management initiatives were completed, provided funds, net of loan repayments, for the 
acquisition of our office refurbishment scheme in Old Street, London EC1, in joint venture with Crosstree, and for £5.1m of value enhancing capital 
expenditure on our investment portfolio. The sales of these investment assets generated a loss of £2.4m of which £0.6m represented transaction costs 
and £1.0m was in respect of our industrial estate at East Kilbride, which had suffered a number of tenant losses. The remaining assets were sold at 
c.98% of book value. 
Helical acquired no new wholly owned investment properties during the year. The capital expenditure of £5.1m added to the revaluation surplus of 
£3.7m was more than offset by the book value of properties sold of £23.9m, thereby reducing the value of the wholly owned investment properties 
from £326.9m to £312.0m. In joint venture we purchased 207-211 Old Street, London EC1 and this purchase, together with our share of a valuation 
uplift on the investment properties held in joint venture of £3.1m, took the Group’s share of the total investment portfolio, on a see-through basis, from 
£394.1m to £407.0m.  helical bar plc 2013

Borrowings and financial risk
The Group is well positioned to face the future with a sound financial base, having increased its income stream by replacing low growth assets with 
higher yielding retail properties, refinanced maturing debt with longer term bank facilities and reduced its exposure to any future interest rate rises by 
entering into new hedging instruments, taking advantage of current low interest rates. In addition, and with the backing of the major property lending 
banks, the Group has access to a number of new bank facilities which, when added to its cash balances, provides a level of liquidity and resources 
that enable it to deal with the current economic uncertainties and to continue to rebalance its portfolio through the acquisition of new income producing 
investment properties.

The Group arranges its bank borrowings to suit its investment and development intentions as follows:
Investment facilities
These are typically for four to five years, financing the Group’s investment portfolio and a fully let retail development at Wroclaw in Poland with loan to 
value and income covenants. The value of the Group’s properties secured on these facilities at 31 March 2013 was £319,035,000 (2012: 
£330,251,000) with a corresponding loan to value of 63% (2012: 64%). Of the £7.8m due for repayment in the year to 31 March 2014, £6.2m has 
been refinanced and is now due for repayment in the year to 31 March 2017. The remaining amounts due in the two years to 31 March 2015 represent 
amortisation of loans during that period. The average maturity of the Group’s investment facilities at 31 March 2013 was 3.6 years, extended to 4.1 
years since that date. Since the year end £49.0m of debt, in three facilities maturing in the period to 31 March 2016, have been replaced by a £75m 
revolving credit facility, £49.3 drawn, repayable in the period to 31 March 2018.
Development and site holding facilities
These facilities finance the construction of the retirement villages at Bramshott Place, Liphook and Durrants Village, Horsham and the office 
development at The Hub, Glasgow. They also include site holding facilities at Exeter and Telford and fund the holding of the completed developments 
at Hedge End, Southampton and Ropemaker Park, Hailsham. Of the £23.1m due for repayment in the year to 31 March 2014, £6.0m has been 
refinanced into a five year facility and £10.1m is due for repayment in December 2013 and we shall look to enter into discussions with the relevant bank 
in the near future. We anticipate refinancing the remaining £7.0m in the near future. The average maturity of the Group’s development and site holding 
facilities at 31 March 2013 was 1.9 years.
Short term working capital facilities
These facilities provide working capital for the Group and c. £3.0m has been repaid since the year end. 
Joint venture bank facilities
As noted above we hold a number of investment and development properties in joint venture with third parties and include in the above table our share, 
in proportion to our economic interest, of the debt associated with each asset. Of the amount due to be repaid in the year to 31 March 2015, £11.7m 
is in respect of the investment holding facility for Barts Square, and timed for a potential redevelopment of the site. In the year to 31 March 2016, there 
are three facilities due to be repaid. In April 2015, our investment facility on the Clyde Shopping Centre, Clydebank, is repayable. In December 2015 we 
are due to repay the loan on 207-211 Old Street, London EC1, this repayment being timed to fit into plans for the refurbishment of the properties 
acquired in December 2012. The remaining debt repayable in this year relates to the development of the shopping centre and retail park at Europa 
Centralna, Gliwice. This development has been partly financed with a development facility due to convert into an investment facility, on satisfaction of a 
number of conditions precedent, by December 2013. At the option of the joint venture, the investment facility will be repayable within either three or five 
years. For the purposes of this debt maturity analysis we have assumed that all conditions precedent will be met and a term of three years is agreed 
with the bank. The average maturity of the Group’s share of bank facilities in joint ventures at 31 March 2013 was 2.4 years.
Cash and cash flow
At 31 March 2013,the Group had over £80m (2012: £65m) of cash and agreed, undrawn, committed bank facilities including its share in joint ventures 
as well as £27m (2012: £16m) of uncharged property on which it could borrow funds. helical bar plc 2013

At 31 March 2013 the Group had £135.6m (2012: £120.3m) of fixed rate debt with an average effective interest rate of 4.34% (2012: 4.80%), and 
£124.1m (2012: £142.9m) of floating rate debt with an average effective interest rate of 3.31% (2012: 3.47%). In addition, the Group had £82m of 
interest rate caps at an average of 4.00% (2012: £125m at 4.70%). In the joint ventures, the Group’s share of fixed rate debt was £27.5m (2012: 
£18.0m) with an average effective interest rate of 5.12% (2012: 5.20%), and £45.8m (2012: £37.8m) of floating rate debt with an effective rate of 
3.76% (2012: £3.54%). In addition, the joint ventures benefitted from £51.5m (2012: £49.0m) of interest rate caps at an average of 5.00% (2012: 
5.00%).
Interest cover
In assessing the results of the Group for each financial year, Helical considers its interest cover as a measure of its performance and its ability to finance 
its annual interest payments from its net operating income, before revaluation gains or losses on the investment portfolio and net realisable provisions

corporate responsibility
Introduction
Helical recognises that our business activities impact on the environment 
and the wider communities in which we operate. As our business involves 
working with joint ventures and outsourcing partners, our direct impacts 
as a business are relatively small. However, we are aware of the influence 
we can exert through the implementation of responsible environmental and 
social practices via our partners, contractors and suppliers.
An endorsement of Helical’s commitment to managing environmental and 
social impact is our continued listing in the FTSE4Good Index. The 
FTSE4Good Index measures the performance of companies that meet 
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards and facilitates 
investment in those companies. Maintaining listed status on this Index 
remains a key priority for Helical, and shows our evolving approach to 
Corporate Responsibility. 
Managing corporate responsibility
Each year we review and update our environmental management system, 
which has been in place since 2003, and the updated environmental 
management system, available on our website, is embedded within the 
operations of Helical. Key elements of the system include:
•  ‘Environment’ and ‘Corporate Responsibility’ policies which set out 
Helical’s high-level commitment across a number of impact areas. 
These are reviewed at Board level annually and are implemented by 
our senior management team. 
•  Annual (and rolling) performance targets to enable us to focus our 
efforts throughout the year on measurable, yet achievable performance 
goals. This year we have continued to report on energy and water 
consumption at our large managed multi-let assets and head office, 
and measured our performance against quantitative targets set in 
2012/3. In addition, we have measured the proportion of waste at our 
managed assets as well as within our developments.
•  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help us monitor progress towards 
these targets and to ensure that we are able to report in line with 
investor disclosure requirements, notably FTSE4Good. It should be 
acknowledged that our particular business model with regard to the 
buying and selling of assets means that absolute performance 
measures can be difficult to compare year on year, hence this year we 
also report selected intensity KPIs.
•  A checklist to assist us in applying minimum sustainability requirements 
across our development activities. In collaboration with our consultants, 
we developed a sustainability project management checklist to ensure 
that sustainability issues are incorporated into all decisions throughout 
the development lifecycle. Introduced last year was a Contractor’ s Checklist 
that is issued to individual contractors in order to address our 
corporate goals at the construction stage. 
•  Effective use of internal audit and review through quarterly meetings of 
key Helical personnel, their external corporate responsibility advisors 
and principal managing agents to ensure effective delivery of the 
objectives and targets.
The management system we have developed has been designed specifically 
to reflect the flexibility of Helical’s business model. It also reflects the key 
role that our partners play in delivering enhanced sustainability outcomes 
in all our business ventures, be they developments/refurbishments of which 
there have only been small scale refurbishments during 2012/3, or in the 
management of individual multi-let assets such as at Shepherds Building 
or Battersea Studios. 
Review of progress in the year to 31 March 2013
We manage our environmental and social impacts because there are 
business benefits in doing so. These benefits include increased ability to 
secure planning consent, improved marketability of assets to prospective 
tenants, reduced operating costs of assets, mitigating the risk of future 
legislation and regulation, and enhanced corporate reputation.
Below we outline our progress in relation to the each of our Corporate 
Responsibility impact areas. 
Environment
Our high-level corporate commitments to environmental issues are outlined 
in the Group’s Environmental Policy which can be found on our website. 
The Policy details our commitments across a range of impact areas and our 
development and property management activities. In 2012-13, we set 
ourselves 24 targets to guide the Environmental element of our Corporate 
Responsibility programme over the following 12 months. These targets 
address a range of impacts arising from our development and property 
management activities, including resource use and waste production, 
pollution, biodiversity, timber sourcing, tenant engagement, flood risk and 
sustainable design and construction. A full list of these targets can be 
found on our website. The performance against the key targets is 
summarised below.
•  At our Head office at Farm Street, we aimed to maintain our current 
performance given the significant improvement achieved in previous 
years. Usage of water and electricity were consistent with last year’s 
low level of consumption but there was a 40% increase in gas use 
reflecting the need for more heating due to the inclement weather 
over the past year.
•  At our managed multi-let offices, we continue to improve energy and 
water efficiency through the implementation of low and no cost measures. 
The specific target for 2012 was to achieve a 5% improvement against 
the 2010 baseline. A review of the data in the table below shows that 
performance is variable across the portfolio with the properties generally 
showing an overall increase in consumption. This reflects increasing 
occupancy and changes to the portfolio structure. An additional performance 
measure of average utilisation of kWh/ sq m for electricity and gas is 
provided for the portfolio and shows a general trend of a year on year 
increase reflecting again the increased occupancy and activity. An 
equivalent assessment is made of average water consumption which 
shows a consistent usage at between 0.5 and 0.67 m
3
 per square meter. 
•  At our managed shopping centres, comparative figures where available 
indicate a similar story that the performance is allied to overall occupancy. 
Although, it is pleasing to note that the replacement of all fluorescent 
light bulbs with light emitting diodes (LED) resulted in a 22% reduction 
in energy consumption year on year at Idlewells Shopping Centre. 
•  We continue to offer recycling facilities at all our managed assets. The 
success of our approach has been particularly demonstrated at Farm 
Street, the Shepherds Building, and Corby Town Centre Shopping 
Centre where 100% of waste is diverted from landfill. In addition, 
Ashdown Philips, the managing agents at Corby Town Centre were 
awarded a Gold Star in November 2012 at the National Recycling 
Awards. At other of our managed assets we comfortably exceeded our 
ongoing target of a recycling rate of at least 35%.  helical bar plc 2013

directors’ report - annual review
•  One ongoing target is to proactively engage with our tenants to encourage 
improvements in efficient use of the buildings. A tenants’ engagement 
poster has been designed for use within each of the principal managed 
assets and is displayed in public areas to help achieve this aim. It is 
regularly reviewed to reflect changing performance data. Following this, 
individual property managers have engaged with tenants to try and see 
if there are ways in which efficiency initiatives can be introduced and to 
particularly encourage increased recycling within the portfolio. An example 
is Idlewells Shopping Centre where retailers were briefed on a new 
waste system by the waste contractor and advised on which skip 
could be used for which waste stream. Leaflets and signage were 
issued to all retailers and staff to guide correct disposal. Ongoing 
training and support has been offered by the waste management 
company and centre management team for retailers who have 
complex waste such as charity shops.
•  The success of a holistic approach to environmental management was 
again demonstrated by Clydebank Shopping Centre which followed its 
Green Apple Gold Award in the retail category for Scotland with a 
Bronze Award for retail in the UK wide Green Apple Awards for the 
ongoing ‘Big Steps – Smaller Footprints’ initiative. Through a combination 
of regular communication with tenants and staff, promoting good practice 
with regard to recycling and energy use and encouraging eco friendly 
groups to use the centre to promote the message, significant reductions 
were achieved in both electricity consumption and waste disposed to 
landfill. A particularly pertinent initiative this year is the keeping of bees 
at the Centre to highlight to customers the importance of bees and the 
threat to their ongoing wellbeing through Colony Collapse Disorder.
•  There was limited activity throughout 2012-13 with regard to construction 
projects. Key corporate objectives including maximising waste recycling 
and addressing ecological considerations were achieved.
In addition, the Group has maintained our registration with CRC (Carbon 
Reduction Commitment) and has purchased 5,198 carbon allowances 
for the year 2012-13 based on the reported emissions for the portfolio as 
a whole. We have also reported for the first time to the Carbon Disclosure 
Project.

Employees
As at 31 March 2013, we employed a team of 24 people in our head 
office, 38% of whom are women. We continue to enforce our equal 
opportunities, harassment and sexual discrimination policies. We also 
continue to monitor compliance with our whistle blowing policy. No 
incidents were reported against these policies in the year under review.
High levels of staff retention remain a key feature of our business. We retain 
a highly skilled and experienced team and the table below shows a breakdown 
of our staff by length of service.
Total number 
of staff
Average length of 
service (years)
Directors and management 11 12
Finance 6 12
Administration 7 5
Our staff retention levels not only reflect competitive remuneration and benefits 
packages but also our commitment to enhancing the professional and 
personal skills of our team. During 2012/3 we provided an average of 
13.15 hours of training per employee, an increase on last year. As in 
previous years, we continue to evaluate training needs in line with business 
objectives.
Communities
Helical takes a strong interest in community issues. Community engagement 
is an on-going concern throughout the development process, from planning 
until development completion and operation. The following examples 
demonstrate how community engagement has benefited the communities 
that we work with over the past year. 
•  We have made a number of in-kind contributions through our Clyde 
Shopping Centre including supporting a project to donate electronic 
equipment through a competition for 20 local schools and sponsorship 
of the local youth football tournament. In the context of working with 
and protecting children Clyde Shopping Centre is the first centre in the 
UK to achieve accreditation to the Safer Retailer Award for all stores 
within the centre which sell age restricted products. The award, which 
assesses the Policies, Training and Procedures revolving around the 
sale of age restricted goods is supported by The Scottish Government, 
Police Scotland, The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and the Trading 
Standards Institute. 
•  Idlewells Shopping Centre has enjoyed a long running relationship with 
a major local educational facility, Sutton Centre Community College, 
and this has recently undergone a transformation to become Sutton 
Community Academy. Individual initiatives have included work with 
Sutton Town Centre Group to organise and host themed events in the 
town, such as a Diamond Jubilee celebration and a Christmas light 
switch-on, as well as work with both mainstream and adult education 
students on enterprising activities focused on the theme of ‘learning 
and earning’. Centre management have supported with mock interviews 
to help give students experience of the work environment, and even set 
one business studies group a challenge of helping to create part of the 
shopping centre’ s marketing and events strategy. The most long-standing 
project has been a free of charge agreement for the Community Academy 
to utilise a shop unit within Idlewells to showcase the work of the adult 
education classes including nail art, paintings, fashion accessories 
and clothing.
During the year to 31 March 2013 Helical donated £13,055 to charities 
including: LandAid Charitable Trust, The Story of Christmas Appeal, 
Oxford Childrens Hospital, The Cure and Action for Tay-Sachs 
Foundation, East Anglian Air Ambulance and Great Ormond Street 
Hospital Children’s Charity.
In addition, on Land Aid day, a Helical team raised £7,500 by dressing up 
as Alice in Wonderland characters and visiting other companies’ offices in 
the locality.
Health & safety
Helical’s Health & Safety policy aims to develop a corporate culture that is 
committed to the prevention of injuries and ill health to our employees or 
others that may be affected by our activities. The Board of Directors and 
senior staff are responsible for implementing this policy and ensure that 
health and safety considerations are always given priority in planning and 
in day-to-day activities. Our Health & Safety Policy was reviewed and 
updated in January 2012 to reflect the latest legislative and regulatory 
developments. There have been no reportable RIDDOR incidents within 
the portfolio during 2012 -13. Our Health & Safety policy can be found 
on our website. 
Suppliers
Fair treatment of suppliers remains a key priority for Helical, particularly in 
challenging market conditions where smaller suppliers in particular may 
rely on our payments for balanced cash flow. The Group’s policy is to 
settle all agreed liabilities within the terms established with suppliers. helical bar plc 2013

corporate governance review
At Helical we believe that Corporate Governance is of fundamental importance 
in delivering, for shareholders, long-term success through the effective, 
entrepreneurial and prudent management of the Company. The Board of 
Helical is collectively responsible for providing the entrepreneurial leadership 
of the Company within a framework of controls and reporting structures 
which assist in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”)
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good corporate 
governance. 
We believe in applying the highest principles of corporate governance 
and have complied throughout the year with the principles as set out in 
the section of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“Code”) headed “The 
Main Principles of the Code” and, except where stated below, have 
complied with the provisions of the Code. The Group also takes into 
account the corporate governance guidelines of institutional shareholders 
and their representative bodies.
– Appointment of Chairman
  Following the retirement as Chairman of Giles Weaver at last year’s 
AGM, the Nominations Committee indicated its intention to appoint 
then Finance Director, Nigel McNair Scott, as Chairman of the Company, 
subject to his being re-appointed a director at the AGM. The Code 
requires that a new chairman should satisfy, on appointment, the 
independence criteria set out in provision B.1.1 and Nigel McNair Scott 
did not satisfy this Code provision on appointment. The Committee 
engaged in an extensive consultation process with shareholders and 
representative bodies, explaining its reasons for the appointment and 
received indications that there would be considerable support for his 
re-election at the AGM and his appointment as Chairman at the 
conclusion of the AGM. In proposing this appointment, the Committee 
was conscious of non-compliance with the Code and sought to 
strengthen shareholder protections by the appointment of two new, 
independent, non-executive directors, Richard Gillingwater and Richard 
Grant. Richard Gillingwater, who has an exceptional record of service 
on the Boards of many of the UK’s listed companies, details of which 
are noted in his biography on page 51, became the Senior 
Independent Director. Richard Grant is the Finance Director of 
Cadogan Estates Limited and a former partner of PwC. He was 
appointed the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In his role as Senior 
Independent Director, Richard Gillingwater has taken on the 
responsibility for liaising with shareholders and their representative 
bodies regarding the governance of the Company and is also responsible 
for undertaking the annual directors’ evaluation process. He holds 
meetings of the independent non-executive directors separately from 
the rest of the Board to ensure that any issues may be discussed 
without the presence of a non-independent director. The Committee 
believes this will provide shareholders with sufficient comfort that the 
governance of the Company and the review of its Board procedures 
and processes are not compromised by a perceived lack of 
independence. 
– Composition of the Board
  The Code requires a Board to have an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to enable it 
to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. Helical operates 
with a strong management team of senior decision-makers backed up 
by finance and other support staff. Given its size the Board does not 
consider it appropriate to operate both a main board and a separate 
executive committee, a structure commonly seen in larger companies. 
However, despite its size, the Group is keen to promote exceptional 
talent to Board level at the earliest opportunity to expose such individuals 
to the broader issues facing the business, encourage their long term 
commitment to the Group and to provide for future succession. It is for 
these reasons that Helical’s Board of six executive directors’ is larger 
than those of other comparable listed real estate companies.
  
  Provision B.1.2 of the Code notes that companies such as Helical, which 
are below the FTSE350, are required to have at least two independent 
non-executive directors. The Board has determined, however, that in 
Helical’s case a total of four independent non-executive directors is 
appropriate to balance the current executive team, to provide the experience 
and advice that the executive team seeks and to ensure the interests 
of shareholders and other stakeholders are adequately protected. The 
independent non-executive directors are Richard Gillingwater (Senior 
Independent Director), Andrew Gulliford, Michael O’Donnell and 
Richard Grant. 
  In the Board’s view, the composition of the Board has an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Company as required by the Code.
– Notice of Annual General Meeting
  The code recommends that the Notice of AGM and related papers be 
sent to shareholders at least 20 workings days before the meeting. For 
the 2012 AGM the Notice and related papers were sent out 16 
working days before the AGM. 
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Chairman and the Chief Executive collectively are responsible for the 
leadership of the Company. The Chairman’ s primary responsibility is for leading 
the Board and ensuring its effectiveness, whilst the Chief Executive is 
responsible for running the Company’ s business. The division of responsibilities 
is clearly established at Helical, is set out in writing and is approved by 
the Board. 
Board responsibilities
The main purpose of the Board of Helical Bar plc is to create and deliver 
the long term success of the Group and returns for its shareholders. The 
Board is collectively responsible for providing the entrepreneurial leadership 
of the Group within a framework of controls and reporting structures which 
assist the Group in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. 
The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims, ensures that the necessary 
financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its 
objectives and reviews management performance. The Board sets the 
Group’s values and standards and ensures that the Group’s obligations 
to its shareholders and others are understood and met.
All directors take decisions objectively in the interests of the Group. As part 
of their roles as members of the Board, non-executive directors constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and the risk appetite of 
the Group. Non-executive directors scrutinise the performance of management 
in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of 
performance. They satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information 
and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust 
and defensible. They are responsible for determining appropriate levels 
of remuneration of executive directors and have a prime role in appointing 
and, where necessary, removing executive directors, and in succession 
planning. In addition to Boardroom discussions, the Chairman contacts 
other non-executive directors by telephone and, if appropriate, will hold 
meetings with the non executive directors without the executive 
directors present. helical bar plc 2013

Annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees
The annual evaluation process involves each director submitting an appraisal 
in respect of the performance of the main Board and, by each non-executive 
director, in respect of each Board Committee of which they are a member. 
During the year the Board undertook a formal evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees and the Senior Independant 
Director reported the results of that evaluation process to the Board. 
Individual evaluations of directors were conducted by the Chief Executive, 
and Chairman. helical bar plc 2013

Directors – information and professional development
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in a form and 
of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties and its directors 
are free to seek any further information they consider necessary. Under 
the direction of the Chairman, the Company Secretary’s responsibilities 
include ensuring good information flows within the Board and its Committees 
and between senior management and non-executive directors, as well as 
facilitating induction and assisting with professional development as required. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board through the 
Chairman on all governance matters.
The Board ensures that directors, especially non-executive directors, have 
access to independent professional advice at the Group’s expense where 
they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as directors. 
Training is available for new directors and other directors as necessary. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that board 
procedures are complied with.

The Group values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest 
in the Group’s strategy and performance, Board membership and quality 
of management. It therefore holds regular meetings with, and presentations 
to, its institutional shareholders to discuss its results and objectives. The 
Group also regularly meets, with the help of its brokers, institutions that 
do not currently hold shares in the Group to inform them of its objectives. 
Michael Slade, as Chief Executive, attends most of these meetings and 
is usually accompanied by one of the other executive directors. 
During the year under review, Andrew Gulliford, as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, engaged with principal shareholders (holding 
more than 3% of the Company’s shares) and shareholder representative 
bodies, to seek their approval for the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012. 
The former Chairman, Giles Weaver, also engaged with principal 
shareholders and shareholder representative bodies during the year, 
regarding the proposed changes to the Board which became effective on 
the date of the 2012 Annual General Meeting. 
The AGM is used to communicate with private investors and they are 
encouraged to participate. The Chairman, Senior Independent Director 
and members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees 
are available to answer questions. Separate resolutions are proposed on 
each issue so that they can be given proper consideration and there is a 
resolution to consider the annual report and accounts. The Group counts 
all proxy votes and will indicate the level of proxies lodged on each resolution, 
after it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
The Group communicates with all shareholders through the issue of regular 
press releases and through its website at www.helical.co.uk.
The Group receives regular reports from sector analysts and its investor 
relations advisors on how it is viewed by its shareholders.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control 
to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. Such a 
system is designed to manage, but cannot eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. There are inherent limitations in any control 
system and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control are as follows:
•  clearly defined organisational responsibilities and limits of authority. 
The day-to-day involvement of the executive directors in the running of 
the business ensures that these responsibilities and limits are adhered to;
•  financial controls and review procedures;
•  financial information systems including cash flow, profit and capital 
expenditure forecasts. The Board receives regular and comprehensive 
reports on the day-to-day running of the business;
•  an Audit Committee which meets with the auditors and deals with any 
significant internal control matter. In the year under review the Committee 
met with the Auditors on two occasions.
The Board is responsible for the management of the Group’s risk profile. 
An analysis of the Group’s risk strategy can be found on page 9.
Internal audit
The Board reviewed its position during the year to 31 March 2013 and 
reaffirmed its stance that in view of the relatively small size of the Group 
it does not consider that an Internal Audit function would provide any 
significant additional assistance in maintaining a system of internal controls.
Charitable and political donations
The Company continues to support charitable causes and in the year to 
31 March 2013, made charitable donations of £13,055. Further details 
are provided in the Corporate Responsibility Report on page 42. The 
Company’s policy with regard to political donations is to ensure that 
shareholder approval is sought before making any such payments. No 
shareholder approval has been sought and, accordingly, the Company 
made no political donations in the year to 31 March 2013. 
Going concern
The directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of 
the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are:
• Timing and value of property sales
• Availability of loan finance and related cash flows
•  Future property valuations and their impact on covenants and 
potential loan repayments
• Committed future expenditure
• Future rental income and bad debts
• Payment timings and the value of trade receivables
The forecast cash flows have been sensitised to eliminate those cash 
inflows which are less certain and to take account of a further deterioration 
of property valuations. From their review the directors believe that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue to be operational as a going 
concern for the foreseeable future. helical bar plc 2013

directors’ report - governance
Dear shareholder,
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the role of the 
Committee, and my primary responsibility as its Chairman, is to ensure 
that the Company is headed by an effective Board which is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the Company. This is best 
achieved through the provision of entrepreneurial leadership and a 
talented executive team, supported by committees with an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
company to be able to constructively challenge and assist the executive 
team in achieving its objectives. Alongside me, the Committee comprises 
Andrew Gulliford, Michael O’Donnell, Richard Gillingwater and Richard 
Grant. 
During the year, the main focus of the Committee was succession planning, 
both for the executive team and the non-executive directors. In early 2012, 
the Committee identified a need for additional independent non-executive 
directors in view of the intention of the Group’s then Chairman and two 
other non-executive directors to step down from the Board at the 2012 
AGM. Accordingly, the Group appointed search firm Norman Broadbent 
to assist in this process. After considering a number of candidates, the 
Committee recommended the appointments of Richard Gillingwater and 
Richard Grant, both of whom were appointed to the Board on 24 July 
2012, immediately following the 2012 AGM. At the same time the Committee 
also recommended to the Board the promotion of Tim Murphy to Finance 
Director and, following an extensive consultation process with shareholders 
and representative bodies, my appointment as Chairman after stepping 
down as Finance Director at the 2012 AGM.
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2013, the following 
resolutions relating to the appointment of directors are being proposed: 
• The re-election of Nigel McNair Scott as non-executive Chairman;
•  The re-election, as executive directors, of Michael Slade, Tim Murphy, 
Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook, Jack Pitman and Duncan 
Walker; and,
•  The re-election, as independent non-executive directors, of Andrew 
Gulliford, Michael O’Donnell, Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions. 
Nigel McNair Scott 
Chairman of the Nominations Committee

the nominations committee helical bar plc 2013

report of the nominations committee
The nominations committee 
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Nigel McNair Scott (from 24 
July 2012). The other members of the Committee are Andrew Gulliford, 
Michael O’Donnell, Richard Gillingwater (from 24 July 2012) and Richard 
Grant (from 24 July 2012). Giles Weaver (former chairman), Antony 
Beevor and Wilf Weeks stepped down from the Committee on 24 July 
2012. 
None of the Committee members has any personal or financial interest in 
the matters to be decided (other than as shareholders), potential conflicts 
of interest arising from cross-directorships nor any day-to-day 
involvement in running the business. 
Board appointments
Appointments to the Board and its Committees are made on merit and 
against objective criteria. Care is taken to ensure that appointees have 
enough time available to devote to the job. The Nominations Committee 
controls the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board.
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee are available by 
request and are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
Advisors to the Committee
During the year under review the Committee appointed search 
consultants Norman Broadbent to assist in identifying candidates for 
appointment to the Board as non-executive directors. 
The work of the Nominations Committee in the year
The Committee met 3 times during the period and a record of attendance 
at these meetings is shown on page 47. Including the matters referred to 
in the Letter from the Chairman of the Nominations Committee on page 49, 
the Committee considered the following matters during the year:
• The results of the annual directors’ evaluation process;
• The retirement of Giles Weaver, Antony Beevor and Wilf Weeks;
• The appointment of Nigel McNair Scott as non-executive Chairman;
• The appointment of Tim Murphy as Finance Director on 24 July 2012;
•  The appointment of search consultants Norman Broadbent and the 
subsequent appointment of Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant as 
independent non-executive directors on 24 July 2012;
• The re-election of directors at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. 
Shareholder consultation
On appointment as the new Chairman of the Company, Nigel McNair 
Scott was not regarded as independent by shareholders and their 
representative bodies. In the light of this, the previous Chairman, Giles 
Weaver, conducted an extensive consultation exercise with the 
Company’s largest investors and representative bodies, to explain the 
rationale behind this appointment. Whilst concern was expressed by 
some shareholders that such an appointment was not in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee confirmed their 
view that Nigel McNair Scott was the most appropriate candidate for the 
role. This role specifically requires him to ensure that the long term 
succession issue of who replaces Michael Slade as Chief Executive is 
handled in the best interests of shareholders. In discharging this task, he 
will be assisted by four independent non-executive directors. At the 2012 
AGM, 91% of votes cast were in favour of the re-election of Nigel McNair 
Scott. The Committee believes that this successful result reflects the 
constructive consultation exercise undertaken with shareholders. 
Directors’ re-election
The Board believes that the requirements of Code Provision B.7.I of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code should be fulfilled. This provision 
requires all directors of FTSE350 companies be subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. Whilst the Company is no longer in the 
FTSE350 the Board has chosen to comply with this provision as it 
accepts that shareholders should annually have the right to vote on each 
director’s re-election to the board. The Nominations Committee confirms 
to shareholders that, following the annual formal performance evaluation, 
these directors continue to be effective and demonstrate commitment to 
their roles. Biographical details of the directors are given on page 51. helical bar plc 2013

directors’ report - governance
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s Report on 
directors’ remuneration for the year to 31 March 2013. This report has 
been approved by the Board of Helical Bar plc. 
I am Chairman of the Committee which also comprises Michael 
O’Donnell and, following their appointment immediately after the 2012 
AGM, Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant. Each member of the 
Committee is an independent non-executive director. 
The main duty of the Committee is to determine and agree with the 
Board, the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the executive directors and, subject to proposals being 
submitted by the Chief Executive, recommend and monitor the level and 
structure of remuneration for such other members of the executive 
management as report directly to the Chief Executive. The remuneration 
of non-executive directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and 
executive members of the Board. 
During the last year, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
(“BIS”) issued consultation papers on revised directors’ remuneration 
reporting regulations. Full compliance with these new regulations will not 
apply until the 2014 Report and Accounts but we have sought, in this 
report, to include some of the regulations early to further improve the 
level and transparency of disclosure and better illustrate the link between 
performance and remuneration. In particular, the report has been divided 
into the following two sections:
•  Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of executive and non-executive directors; and,
•  Implementation Report, which discloses how the remuneration policy 
has been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2013. 
A single advisory vote on both parts of the report will be tabled at the 
forthcoming 2013 AGM. 
Remuneration issues dealt with during the year
In the year under review, the Committee undertook consultations with 
shareholders and shareholder representative bodies on changes to the 
remuneration of executive directors, in particular with respect to the 
introduction of a new Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012. At the 
2012 AGM, 95 per cent of votes cast were in favour of the adoption of 
this new bonus scheme. The Directors’ Remuneration Report also 
received 95 percent of votes cast in favour. The Committee believes that 
these successful results reflect the constructive consultation exercise 
undertaken with shareholders. 
In addition, the Committee considered a number of other matters during 
the financial year under review and the following decisions were taken:
•  basic salaries were reviewed in July 2012 and inflationary increases of 
3 per cent were awarded with effect from 1 July 2012 to Gerald Kaye, 
Matthew Bonning-Snook and Jack Pitman. Michael Slade waived his 
entitlement to an inflationary increase;
•  On appointment to the Board as Finance Director, Tim Murphy’s salary 
was set at £250,000pa;
•  On appointment as Chairman of the Company, Nigel McNair Scott’s 
fee was set at £150,000pa;
•  The Helical Bar 2002 Approved Share Incentive Plan was renewed for a 
further 10 years. At the 2012 AGM, 100 per cent of votes cast were in 
favour of the renewal of this HMRC approved all employee share scheme;
•  The Committee reviewed the awards made in accordance with the terms of 
the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) in 2009 and considered the 
performance of the Company during the three year performance period to 
31 March 2012. Despite a return to profitability, the performance conditions 
required for vesting of the shares were not met and no shares vested; 
•  The Committee resolved in May 2012 to make a further award of 
shares under the terms of the PSP; and,
•  The Committee resolved that the provision of long-term incentives 
through the PSP , which was approved by shareholders in 2004, should 
continue in its present form until expiry in 2014.
The implementation of these decisions is detailed in this report, together 
with additional information on the fixed and variable remuneration paid 
and payable to the directors of the Group. 
Performance and reward during 2013
As noted in the business review on pages 1 to 44, the Group has delivered 
an increase in EPRA net assets per share of 5.6% and a total portfolio 
return, as reported by IPD, of 8.6%. Pre-tax profits of the Group, before 
performance related awards, increased by 51% to £11.8m (2012: £7.8m).
Subsequent to the year end and in accordance with the rules of the 
Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and the Executive Bonus Plan 
2011, cash bonuses have been approved for inclusion in the financial 
statements for the year to 31 March 2013. Details of the bonuses 
payable are disclosed in the Implementation Report below.
Remuneration policy for 2014
The Remuneration Committee of Helical Bar plc is committed to ensuring 
that its remuneration policy remains aligned to the interest of shareholders, 
incentivising management to increase total returns and growing net asset 
value per share whilst ensuring that an appropriate balance is maintained 
between the targets set for management and the risk profile of the Group. 
The Committee believes that it has struck the right balance between fixed 
annual remuneration and an incentive structure with challenging targets 
which seeks to reward outperformance with a mixture of cash-based 
annual bonus payments and longer term share awards. 
Reviewing the current remuneration the Committee has determined that the 
basic salaries of the executive directors should again be increased by 3%, 
reflecting current inflation levels, which is below the 5% awarded to all other 
employees of the Group. The Committee has also determined that the basic 
salary levels of the two recently appointed directors, Duncan Walker and Tim 
Murphy, be increased by 10% (including the annual inflationary increase) to 
move them towards market norms as their respective contributions increase. 
These increases will be effective from 1 July 2013. 
The two annual bonus schemes were approved by shareholders in 2011 
and 2012 and will not be reviewed during the forthcoming year. However, 
the long-term share incentive plan, the Helical Bar Performance Share 
Plan, was introduced in 2004 and will need to be reviewed during the 
year with a view to assessing its continuing suitability within the framework 
of the Group’s remuneration structure. The Committee will seek to 
consult with major shareholders and representative bodies on this matter 
before proposing any replacement of this long-term incentive plan. 
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2013 the following 
resolution relating to remuneration is being proposed:
•  The approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 March 2013. 
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour of 
this resolution.

Remuneration policy report
This section of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy 
of the Group with effect from 1 April 2013. There have been no changes 
to this policy since 1 April 2012 and the Committee believes that the 
policy continues to support the Group’s strategy and is aligned with 
shareholders interests. 
Remuneration policy
Helical’s approach to the remuneration of its executive directors is to 
provide a basic remuneration package below the median level of its peers 
within the listed real estate sector combined with an incentive based 
bonus and share scheme structure aligned with the interests of its 
shareholders. Remuneration within the real estate sector is monitored 
and reviewed regularly to ensure that the Group’s positioning of its 
remuneration remains in line with these objectives. In addition to this 
external view, the Committee also monitors the remuneration levels of 
senior management below Board level and the remuneration of other 
employees to ensure that these are taken into account in determining the 
remuneration of executive directors and considers environmental, social, 
governance and risk issues.
The Board recognises that directors’ remuneration is of legitimate 
concern to shareholders and is committed to following current best 
practice. This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the 
Listing and Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as they relate to directors’ remuneration. In addition, a 
number of disclosures which will be required under the draft BIS reporting 
regime from next year have been adopted early. It has been approved by  helical bar plc 2013

the Board and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the 
Group’s Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2013. Grant 
Thornton UK LLP has audited the disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
and share awards on pages 58 to 62. 
In determining such policy, the Committee shall take into account all 
factors which it deems necessary. The objective of the remuneration 
policy shall be to ensure that executive directors and senior management 
are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of the Group. Within the terms of 
the agreed policy, the Committee shall determine, for the executive 
directors:
•  the total individual remuneration packages of each executive director 
including, where appropriate, basic salaries, bonuses, share awards, 
and other benefits;
• targets for any performance related remuneration schemes; and,
•  service agreements incorporating termination payments and 
compensation commitments.
In determining such packages and arrangements the Committee gives 
due regard to the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on 
request and are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.

directors’ remuneration report 
Executive directors’ basic annual salary and benefits-in-kind
The basic package of salary and benefits is designed to match the experience 
and responsibilities of each director and is reviewed annually to ensure that it is 
consistent and appropriate to their responsibilities and expectations. The 
Group does not provide any separate pension provision for executive 
directors and expects individuals to provide for their retirement through 
their basic salaries and incentive payments. Basic salary levels were last 
reviewed in July 2012. Executive directors’ current basic annual salaries, 
together with salaries for the prior year, are as follows:
1 April 2012
£ 
1 April 2013
£
Michael Slade 500,000 500,000
Tim Murphy n/a 250,000
Gerald Kaye 375,000 386,250
Matthew Bonning-Snook 300,000 309,000
Jack Pitman 300,000 309,000
Duncan Walker 250,000 250,000
In 2012, the Committee resolved that the basic salaries of executive 
directors should be reviewed annually and increased to reflect an appropriate 
level of salary inflation. Accordingly, the basic salary levels of Gerald Kaye, 
Matthew Bonning-Snook and Jack Pitman were increased by 3% from 1 
July 2012. Mr Slade waived his entitlement to an inflationary increase, 
thereby retaining his previous salary level. Duncan Walker was not eligible 
for the 2012 inflationary increase given the increase in his basic salary he 
received on 1 April 2012 following his earlier appointment to the Board. 
Reviewing the current remuneration the Committee has determined that 
the basic salaries of the executive directors should again be increased by 
3%, reflecting current inflation levels, which is below the 5% awarded to 
all other employees of the Group. The Committee has also determined that 
the basic salary levels of the two recently appointed directors, Duncan Walker 
and Tim Murphy, be increased by 10% (including the annual inflationary 
increase) to move them towards market norms as their contribution 
increases. These increases will be effective from 1 July 2013. Benefits-in-
kind provided to executive directors comprise the provision of a company 
car or car allowance and health insurance.
Non-executive directors’ fees
In 2012, the Board resolved that with effect from 1 July 2012, the fees 
payable to non-executive directors will comprise a basic £40,000 plus an 
additional £10,000 for the Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees and the Senior Independent Director. On his appointment as 
Chairman, Nigel McNair Scott’s annual fee was fixed at £150,000.
Non-executive directors’ current annual fees, together with fees for the 
prior year, are as follows:
1 April 2012

Committee

Service contracts 
The service contract of Michael Slade operates from 1 April 2007, those 
of Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Jack Pitman from 1 March 
2010, that of Duncan Walker from 24 June 2011 and of Tim Murphy from 
24 July 2012. No service contract provides for more than a one year notice 
period. On termination of employment each director is entitled to a payment 
in lieu of notice of basic salary and other contractual entitlements i.e. 
provision of car and health insurance. The Group may make payments in 
lieu of notice as one lump sum or in instalments, at its own discretion. If 
the Group chooses to pay in instalments the director is obliged to seek 
alternative income over the relevant period and to disclose the amount to 
the Group. Instalment payments will be reduced by any alternative 
income.
Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are appointed by a Letter of Appointment and 
their remuneration is determined by the Board. The appointment of 
non-executive directors is terminable on three months’ notice. Non-
executive directors do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus or 
share award schemes.
Share ownership guidelines
Senior executives will not normally be permitted to sell shares received 
through the PSP , other than to meet taxation (and national insurance 
contributions) liabilities, for at least two years and until they own shares to 
the value of 200% of basic salary for executive directors and 100% of 
salary for other executives. To date, all shares received by the executive 
directors under the terms of the group’s Performance Share Plan and 
Share Incentive Plan have been retained, net of taxes paid, thereby 
increasing the management’s shareholding in Helical.
Alignment with shareholder interests
The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may 
be made by executives (directors and those below Board level) through 
the PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place. It has 
concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Group 
(measured as the increase in the net asset value plus cash returned as 
dividends to shareholders) that could accrue to all executives through the 
Group’s long and short-term incentive and bonus plans at the point at 
which the maximum awards vest over the term of the plans might be of 
the order of 20%. At this point, in absolute terms, the Group will have 
increased its triple net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the 
Group’s relative performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD, over 
each three year period.  helical bar plc 2013

Michael Slade was the highest paid director during the year with a total remuneration of £1,523,000 (2012: £541,000).
At the 2012 AGM on 24 July 2012, Giles Weaver (Chairman), Antony Beevor and Wilf Weeks retired as non-executive directors and Nigel McNair Scott 
stepped down as Finance Director and was appointed Chairman. Immediately after the 2012 AGM Tim Murphy was appointed Finance Director and 
Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant were appointed non-executive directors.  helical bar plc 2013

Annual cash bonus payments 
Executive Bonus Plan
In 2011, shareholders approved the renewal of the Executive Bonus Plan 
(the “2011 Plan”) for a further five years. Michael Slade, Nigel McNair 
Scott and Tim Murphy were eligible for 2011 Plan bonuses during the 
year. Total 2011 Plan bonuses for the year to 31 March 2013 of 
£1,297,000 (2012: nil) have been accrued in the financial statements for 
the year to 31 March 2013 and are payable in June 2013. During the 
year, Tim Murphy replaced Nigel McNair Scott as a participant in the 
2011 Plan. 
The Committee may, at its discretion, award bonuses in respect of a 
financial year subject to performance conditions, the aim of which is to 
link the size of bonuses paid to the financial growth of the Group over 
that financial year. No bonus will be payable unless the following 
conditions are satisfied:
•  Increase in net asset value; net asset value at the end of the financial 
year exceeds net asset value at the beginning of the financial year;
•  Absolute performance of the portfolio – un-geared total return; the 
percentage increase in the total return on property assets of the Group 
over the financial year (the “Performance Period”) is greater than the 
percentage increase achieved by the portfolio ranked nearest to 
three-quarters up the performance table (taken in ascending order of 
return) (the “Upper Quartile”) of the portfolios of all quarterly valued 
funds measured by the Investment Property Databank at the beginning 
of the relevant Performance Period and compounded monthly during 
the Performance Period (the “IPD Total Return Benchmark”); and,
•  Performance of the net asset value per share; the percentage increase 
in net asset value per share for the Performance Period must be 
greater than the percentage increase achieved by the Upper Quartile of 
the portfolios of all quarterly valued funds measured by the Investment 
Property Databank at the beginning of the relevant Performance Period 
and compounded monthly during the Performance Period (the “IPD 
Capital Growth Benchmark”).
The Committee will recommend the size of the bonus payable by 
reference to the same sliding scale based on the amount by which the 
increase in net asset value per share exceeds the increase in the Upper 
Quartile of the IPD Capital Growth Benchmark, subject to a £2m cap. 
The total amount of the bonuses payable in any one year shall be 
determined by: 
•  Calculating the difference between the percentage increase in net 
asset value per share for the Performance Period and the percentage 
increase in the Upper Quartile of the IPD Capital Growth Benchmark 
over the same period (the “Difference”); and,
•  Calculating the sum of the amounts payable in relation to each 1% of 
the Difference on the following basis:
Amount of difference
% of base net asset
value payable
Less than 1% 0.01
1% to less than 2% 0.02
And thereafter for every additional 1% An increment of 0.01
For example: From 4% to less than 5% 0.05
If the net asset value at the end of a financial year is less than the net 
asset value at the beginning of that year, the bonus payable for any 
subsequent year will be calculated by reference to the highest net asset 
value in the preceding year.
The total amount payable under the 2011 Plan in any one year is limited 
to £2m (2012: £2m). An individual employee’s participation in the 2011 
Plan is limited so that the bonus which may be paid to him under the 
2011 Plan will not exceed £1.5m per annum. There is a further limit that 
payments under the 2011 Plan in any year may not exceed 20% of the 
Group’s pre-tax profits plus any payments under the 2011 Plan. This limit 
operated in the year restricting the total bonus paid under the 2011 plan 
to £1,297,000. Among other constraints the Committee could restrict the 
bonuses if payment would affect the financial or trading position of the 
Group.
Following feedback received during the investor consultation in respect of 
the codification of the bonus arrangement set out below, the Committee 
agreed that future participants in this scheme who do not have a 
minimum shareholding in the Company of 200% of basic salary should 
receive up to one third of any bonus in deferred shares for three years.
Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012
The Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 was approved by 
Shareholders at the 2012 AGM. This scheme provides annual cash 
bonuses based on the performance of the Group’s property portfolio and 
is aligned with shareholders through a profit sharing model, with 
appropriate hurdles and shareholder protections (including deferral and 
clawback). Total 2012 Bonus Scheme Bonuses have been accrued in the 
financial statements for the year to 31 March 2013 and the cash element 
will be payable in June 2013. 
 The main features of the 2012 Bonus Scheme are as follows:
• The 2012 Bonus Scheme is effective from 1 April 2012;
•  The initial scheme participants are Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-
Snook, Jack Pitman and Duncan Walker. It is not intended that either 
the Chief Executive or Finance Director participate in the Scheme given 
their participation in the 2011 Plan;
•  All current and future property assets will be allocated to one of two 
pools namely an “Investment Pool” and a “Development Pool” (“Profit 
Pools”);
•  Investment assets are included at valuation as at 31 March 2012 with 
subsequent valuation movements increasing or decreasing the size of 
the relevant Profit Pool. Development assets are also included at 
valuation as at 31 March 2012 with subsequent valuation movements 
increasing or decreasing the size of the Profit Pool. Any opening 
surpluses or deficits in the value of the trading and development assets 
as at 31 March 2012 will only be included in the Profit Pools once they 
are realised;
•  Development profits, development management fees, net rents, other 
income and profits/losses on the sale of property assets will be 
allocated to the relevant Profit Pools; and,
•  Profits in the two Profit Pools will be eligible for the award of bonuses 
once they are sufficient to exceed the recovery of all related finance 
costs, a charge for the use of the Company’s equity at a rate 
equivalent to the Company’s weighted average cost of debt plus a 
margin (reviewed regularly to reflect any changes in the cost of debt 
and the risk profile of the Company’s activities), the Group’s total 
administrative costs (excluding performance related remuneration) and 
any unallocated losses from the previous three financial years. helical bar plc 2013

directors’ remuneration report 
Shareholder Protections 
•  Consistent with the existing arrangement, no more than 10% of profits 
will be available to participants for distribution (“Bonus Award Pool”) at 
the end of the relevant financial year. Pool allocations between 
participants will be based on a set formula agreed at the start of the 
financial year;
•  The distribution of the Bonus Award Pools to participants will be 
restricted in any financial year to the lower of 70% of the balance of the 
Bonus Award Pool and 300% of salary (except in years five and ten as 
noted below). Any excess will be deferred and carried forward to the 
subsequent year to form part of the Bonus Award Pool for the 
subsequent year(s);
•  Two thirds of any payment will be made in cash after the relevant 
financial year end and one third will be deferred for three years into 
Helical Bar plc shares;
•  In addition to any annual payments, at the end of the fifth and tenth 
years of operating the scheme, any Bonus Award Pool not paid out will 
be distributed to participants in the form of deferred shares for 3 years, 
subject to an individual limit of 300% of salary each time;
•  No payments will be made where the Company has not generated a 
profit (amounts will be deferred until a profit is generated). In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to increase the 
deferred share amount (up to 100% of the payment) or not to make a 
payment at all (with any amounts reverting back to the Company rather 
than remaining in the Bonus Award Pool) where it is considered 
appropriate to do so;
•  Net losses will be carried forward in Profit Pools for offset against 
future net profits. Carry forward of losses will be for a minimum of three 
years, subject to extension at the request of the Remuneration 
Committee;
•  The scheme will operate a clawback provision whereby amounts 
deferred, amounts held in Bonus Award Pools or the net of tax 
amounts paid may be recovered in the event of a misstatement of 
results, an error being made in assessing the calculation of Bonus 
Award Pools or in the event of gross misconduct; and,
•  The share of any increase in value of the Company (measured as the 
increase in net asset value plus cash returned as dividends) that could 
accrue to all executives through the Group’s long and short-term 
incentive and bonus plans at maximum vesting/payouts during the 
lifetime of the plans will continue to be no more than 20%.
Other matters
•  Shareholder approval for the Plan was obtained for 10 years from 1 
April 2012, although the Remuneration Committee will review the 
operation of the Plan after 5 years; 
•  Awards may be satisfied through shares purchased in the market or by 
new issue or Treasury Shares. Where new issue or treasury shares are 
used, the ABI’s 5% in 10 year dilution limit will apply;
•  Bad leavers will lose their entitlement to future distributions of Bonus 
Award Pools or unvested deferred shares. Good leavers (e.g. 
retirement with the Company’s agreement, redundancy or any other 
reason at the discretion of the Committee) would cease to accrue 
future amounts into future Bonus Award Pools although would 
continue to receive deferred share awards and any remaining amounts 
held in the Bonus Award Pools for a period of 3 years from cessation; 
and,
•  On a change of control of the Company, any amounts accrued over 
the financial year up to the relevant date, and any amounts held within 
the Bonus Award Pools, and any deferred shares would be distributed.
Performance Share plan
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), which was approved by 
shareholders in 2004 and is the Company’s primary long-term incentive 
arrangement, rewards participants for net asset value growth and 
performance relative to an industry comparator over a three year period. 
The Plan is designed to encourage long-term performance and 
participants are required to retain shares acquired for at least two years 
after vesting. The main features of the plan are as follows:
•  Awards will normally vest no earlier than the third anniversary of their 
grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions (see 
below) have been satisfied and the participant is still employed by the 
Group. Once exercisable, awards will remain capable of exercise for a 
period of normally no more than six months.
•  No award may be granted to an individual in any financial year over 
shares worth more than 3 times salary.
•  There are two performance conditions, one based on absolute growth 
in the Group’s net asset value per share and the other based on the 
gross (ungeared) total property return per share relative to other 
property funds as determined by IPD but excluding those funds worth 
less than £50m at the start of the three year period. Performance will 
be measured over the three years following grant.
 o  For the growth in net asset value, the “fully diluted triple net” net 
asset value as at the start of the financial year in which a grant takes 
place will be compared to the value three years later (having added 
back dividends):
Annual compound increase after three years % of award vesting
15% p.a. or more 66.7
Between 7.5% p.a. and 15% p.a. Pro rata between 
6.7 and 66.7 
7.5% p.a. 6.7
Below 7.5% p.a. Zero
If UK inflation (RPI) is higher than 3% per annum over the three year 
period then the required compound increases will be raised by the 
excess over the 3% per annum average.
 o For the Total property return v IPD property funds condition:
Ranking after three years % of award vesting
Upper quartile or above 33.3
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 
3.3 and 33.3
Median 3.3
Less than median Zero
Provided the net value per share (having added back dividends) increases 
over the three year period.
Share awards will lapse where the gross return falls below the IPD 
median and where the growth in triple net asset value is below 7.5% per 
annum over the three year period.
During the year the performance conditions relating to the sixth award, granted 
on 9 July 2009, were considered. The three year performance period to 
31 March 2012 showed that the net asset value per share, calculated in 
accordance with the terms of the PSP , had reduced by 0.9% p.a.
During this three year period the total return of Helical’s property 
portfolio, as determined by IPD, was 5.5% compared to the median of 
the IPD Benchmark which showed a return of 11.1%. Therefore, no 
shares could vest as the performance of the property portfolio was below 
that of the IPD median benchmark. helical bar plc 2013

directors’ report - governance
The audit committee 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Richard Grant, following his appointment 
to the Board on 24 July 2012. The other members of the Committee are 
Andrew Gulliford, Michael O’Donnell and Richard Gillingwater (from his 
appointment to the Board on 24 July 2012). None of the Committee 
members has any personal or financial interest in the matters to be 
decided (other than as shareholders), potential conflicts of interest arising 
from cross-directorships nor any day-to-day involvement in running the 
business. 
The Committee endorses the principles set out in the FRC Guidance on 
Audit Committees. The Board has formal and transparent arrangements 
for considering how it applies the Group’s financial reporting and internal 
control principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with its 
auditor. Whilst all directors have a duty to act in the interests of the Group, 
the Committee has a particular role, acting independently from the executive, 
to ensure that the interests of shareholders are properly protected in relation 
to financial reporting and internal control. Appointments to the Committee 
are made by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations 
Committee in consultation with the Audit Committee Chairman.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are available by request 
and are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
The work of the audit committee in the year
The Committee met three times during the year and a record of attendance 
at these meetings is shown on page 47. It is common practice at Helical 
for Audit Committee meetings to be attended by all Board members who 
are available, whether or not they are members of the Committee so that 
their contribution to the matters discussed may be obtained.
Matters formally reviewed and discussed by the Board during the year 
included:
•    The Group’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
including its whistle-blowing policies;
•  The Group’s compliance with the Bribery Act 2010;
•   Review of the group’s policies on equal opportunities and 
health & safety;
•  Review of the group’s environmental management systems;
•  Review of the group’s internal controls;
•  The group’s principal risks;
•  IT risk and business continuity planning;
•  The financial statements of the Group and the Preliminary Announcement 
of the annual results to 31 March 2012 and the Interim Statement on 
the half year results to 30 September 2012; 
•  The re-appointment of the Group’s external auditor; and,
•  The external auditors independence and the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor.
The Audit Committee met the external auditor on two occasions to discuss 
matters arising from the annual and interim audits.
Audit independence
A policy of reviewing audit independence has been adopted whereby 
non-audit services undertaken by the auditor are approved prior to work 
being carried out. The audit committee considers the external auditor to 
be independent and has satisfied itself of the effectiveness of the 
external auditor.
The Group’s policy on awarding non-audit work to its auditor is designed 
to ensure that the Group receives the most appropriate advice without 
compromising the independence of the auditor. Whilst no fee caps or limits 
have been set by the Committee, the level of fees would be a factor in 
considering whether the auditor’s independence could be affected by the 
award of non-audit work. In the year to 31 March 2013, no fees were paid 
to the auditor for non-audit work. 
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2013 the following 
resolutions relating to the auditor are being proposed: 
•   The re-appointment of Grant Thornton UK LLP as Independent 
Auditor; and, 
•   To authorise the Directors to set the remuneration of the 
Independent Auditor.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions.

Where not provided elsewhere in this Report of the Directors, the following 
provides the additional information required for shareholders as a result of 
the implementation of the Takeovers Directive into English law.
The Company’s share capital consists of both ordinary shares and deferred 
shares. Each class of shares rank pari passu between themselves. Details 
of the Company’s share capital can be found in note 27 to the financial 
statements. There are no restrictions on the transfer of the ordinary shares 
in the Company other than certain restrictions which may from time to 
time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example: insider trading 
laws) and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
whereby certain employees of the Group require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the ordinary shares.
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every holder 
of ordinary shares present in person and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy and entitled 
to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. The Notice of 
the Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights 
and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be 
passed at the meeting. The rules governing the appointment and replacement 
of Directors and changes to the articles of association accord with usual 
English company law provisions.
Subject to the Company’s memorandum of association, the articles of 
association, any statute or subordinate legislation for the time being in 
force concerning companies and affecting the Company, and directions

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have to prepare financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’ s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and article 4 of the IAS Regulations. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The directors confirm that:
•  in so far as the directors are aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and,
•  the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
We, the directors listed below, confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and,
•  the annual report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

We have audited the financial statements of Helical Bar plc for the year

the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
and company balance sheets, the consolidated and company cash flow 
statements, the consolidated and parent company statements of changes

been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set 
out on page 65, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided 
on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 and 
of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; 
and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in Note 1 to the group financial statements, the group in 
addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out 
on pages 46 to 48 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share 
capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the 
company.
• Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 48 in relation to going concern;
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to the shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.

consolidated and company statements 
of changes in equity helical bar plc 2013

1. Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), including 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement 
for the parent company.
The financial statements have been prepared in Sterling (rounded to the nearest thousand) under the historical cost convention as modified by the 
revaluation of investment properties, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments. The measurement bases and principal 
accounting policies of the Group are set out in note 35. These accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the year to 31 March 2012, as 
amended to reflect any new Standards, Amendments to Standards and interpretations which are mandatory for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Status of Adoption of Significant New or Amended IFRS Standards or Interpretations 
IAS 12, Income Taxes - Deferred Tax: Recovery of underlying assets; 
IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers;
There has been no material impact as a result of adopting the above.
The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued but are not yet effective. They will be adopted at the point they are effective:
IAS 1 (amended): Presentation of items of other comprehensive income (effective 1 July 2012); 
IAS 19 (revised): Employee benefits (effective 1 January 2013);  
IAS 27 (revised): Separate financial statements (effective 1 January 2013); 
IAS 28 (revised): Associates and joint ventures (effective 1 January 2013); 
IFRS 7 (amended): Disclosures – transfer of financial assets (effective 1 January 2013); 
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments: Classification and measurement; 
Mandatory effective date and transition disclosures – amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 (effective 1 January 2015); 
IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements (effective 1 January 2013); 
IFRS 11: Joint arrangements (effective 1 January 2013); 
IFRS 12: Disclosures in interests in other entities (effective 1 January 2013); 
IFRS 13: Fair value measurement (effective 1 January 2013); and 
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011 cycle (effective 1 January 2013).
The directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group except for IFRS13, which will impact the disclosure of fair value measurements.
2. Segmental information
IFRS 8 requires the identification of the Group’s operating segments which are defined as being discrete components of the Group’s operations whose 
results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (being the Chief Executive) to allocate resources to those segments and to assess 
their performance. The Group divides its business into the following segments:
• Investment properties, which are owned or leased by the Group for long-term income and for capital appreciation, and trading properties which are 
owned or leased with the intention to sell; and,
• Developments, which include sites, developments in the course of construction, completed developments available for sale, pre-sold developments 
and interest in third party developments.

reconciliation also uses this rate of corporation tax.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The tax charge is expected to be less than the full rate in future years, primarily due to the Group continuing to claim allowances in respect of eligible 
expenditure on investment properties. helical bar plc 2013

Other temporary differences 2,068 945 606 463
Deferred tax asset 10,381 9,050 577 463
Other temporary differences represent deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of the fair value of derivative financial instruments and future tax 
relief available to the Group from capital allowances and when share awards vest.
The Group contains entities with tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised. The total unrecognised losses amount to approximately 
£8.4m. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised because the entities in which the losses have been generated either do not have forecast taxable 
profits or the losses have restrictions whereby their utilisation is considered to be unlikely.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances, the deferred tax provision in respect of capital allowances of 
£2.4m (2012: £2.5m) would be released and further capital allowances of £9.5m (2012: £7.7m) would be available to reduce future tax liabilities.

14. Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year. This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year 
end. Shares held by the ESOP , which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the effect of all dilutive options and awards.
The earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share and the best practice recommendations of the European Public 
Real Estate Association (“EPRA”). Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

At 31 March 5,997 7,003
Included within current available-for-sale investments is an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed–use development and an 
investment of 20% of the equity of this company.
The loan and the equity are classed as an available-for-sale investment and held at fair value. The Group has determined its fair value by considering 
both the loan and the equity element separately. The loan element is valued at the fair value of the expected consideration to be received including 
anticipated future costs of recovering this loan. This amount has been impaired in the year due to a revision in the expected receipt. The equity element 
is given a nil value with the Group valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at £nil as it is believed that this is the most probable outcome. 
This nil valuation is derived because the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the company’s assets, after the repayment of the 
loan payable to the Group, would be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
The Group does not consider that it has significant influence over this company despite having 20% of the equity as another party owns a majority 
shareholding and the Group does not have a representative on the Board of the company.
Of the movement in the fair value of the loan and equity and the associated deferred tax movement, the impairment of £1,304,000 (2012: £3,521,000) 
has been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.

The Group’s capital management objectives are:
–  to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and, 
–  to provide an adequate return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure. It manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the 
light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. Capital 
is defined as being issued share capital, retained earnings, revaluation reserve and other reserves (2013: £246,220,000; 2012: £246,139,000). The 
Group continually monitors its gearing level to ensure that it is appropriate. Gearing decreased from 90% to 88% in the year due to the Group selling 
some of its non-core properties.
The deferred shares were issued on 23 December 2004 to those shareholders electing to receive a dividend, rather than a capital repayment or further 
shares in the Company, as part of the Return of Cash approved by shareholders on 20 December 2004. The deferred shares carry no voting rights and 
have no right to a dividend or capital payment in the event of a winding up of the Company. 
The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company irrevocable authority to purchase all or any of the deferred shares for a maximum aggregate 
total of 1 penny for all deferred shares in issue on the date of such purchase.
28. Share options
At 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2013 there were 34,713 unexercised options over new ordinary 1p shares in the Company. No options over 
purchased ordinary 1p shares held by the ESOP had been granted to directors and employees under the Company’s share option schemes  
(31 March 2012: nil). 
The Company uses a stochastic valuation model to value the share options.

29. Share–based payments
The Group provides share-based payments to employees in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan. The Company

payments.

30. Own shares held
Following approval at the 1997 Annual General Meeting the Company established the Helical Bar Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (the “Trust”) 
to be used as part of the remuneration arrangements for employees. The purpose of the Trust is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares by 
or for the benefit of employees by the acquisition and distribution of shares in the Company.
The Trust purchases shares in the Company to satisfy the Company’s obligations under its Share Option Schemes and Performance Share Plan.
At 31 March 2013 unexercised options over nil (2012: nil) ordinary 1p shares in Helical Bar plc had been granted over shares held by the Trust. 
At 31 March 2013 outstanding awards over 9,310,162 (2012: 7,230,850) ordinary 1p shares in Helical Bar plc had been made under the terms of the 
Performance Share Plan over shares held by the Trust.
At 31 March 2013, the Trust held 1,292,000 shares (2012: 1,292,000).
31. Contingent liabilities
The Company has entered into cross guarantees in respect of the banking facilities of its subsidiaries. These are not considered to have a material value.
Other than these contingent liabilities there were no contingent liabilities at 31 March 2013 for the Group or the Company (2012: £nil). helical bar plc 2013

The carrying value of trade and other payables and borrowings is not deemed to be materially different from the fair value. Financial liabilities are stated 
in accordance with IAS 32.
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale assets, forward 
exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and those designated on initial recognition. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are externally measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and 
discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 
IFRS 7 categorises financial assets and liabilities as being valued in 3 hierarchical levels:
 – Level 1: values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 – Level 2: values are derived from observing market data
 – Level 3: values cannot be derived from observable market data
The derivative financial instruments above have been valued using a Level 2 methodology and the available-for-sale investments, which are described 
in note 21, are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements, being those not based on observable market data. There were no transfers between 
categories in the current or prior year.

financial statements
notes to the financial statements
Credit risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk the Group periodically 
assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
As at 31 March 2013 Helical has total credit risk exposure excluding cash of £48,961,000 of which £5,997,000 is available-for-sale assets and 
£42,964,000 is loans and receivables. Available-for-sale assets are analysed in note 21.
Of the trade receivables held at 31 March 2013, £0.8m related to rent due from tenants which was received post year-end and £1.2m related to 
completion monies due on the sale of a property which was received on 2 April 2013. 
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.
For further information on trade and other receivables, see note 22.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
The Group manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, and 
through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility. Management monitors the Group’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on 
the basis of expected cash flows. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions and the directors regularly 
monitor the financial institutions that the group uses to ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.
For further information on debt facilities, see notes 25 and 26.

Total contracted liabilities 323,900 314,816 166,558 154,867
Of the Group’s contracted financial liabilities due within 3 months £12m of loans have been refinanced and are payable after more than 3 years.
At 31 March 2013 Helical had £35m of undrawn borrowing facilities, £27m of uncharged property assets and cash balances of £37m. The above 
contracted liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date. The management believe that these facilities, together 
with anticipated sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities, mean that the Group can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value of the investments 
and accrued development profits. The Group actively monitors these exposures. helical bar plc 2013

notes to the financial statements
Interest rate risk
It is the Group’s policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on long-term financing. The Group does this by using a number of 
derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. The purpose of these derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks 
arising from the Group’s sources of finance. The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 26.
In the year to 31 March 2013, if interest rates had moved by 0.5%, this would have resulted in the following movement to net profits and equity due to 
movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.

Foreign currency exchange risk
Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, the Group has exposure to exchange movements on foreign 
currencies. Helical’s management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk and reviews any requirements to act to 
minimise these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2013 the Group made foreign exchange gains of £17,000 (2012: losses of £1,064,000) resulting from movements in foreign 
exchange rates during the year affecting its assets and liabilities related to its overseas operations.

notes to the financial statements
35. Principal accounting policies 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of Helical Bar plc (the “Company”) and all of its subsidiary undertakings (together the “Group”) drawn 
up to 31 March 2013. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities over which the Group has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies 
through the exercise of voting rights. Subsidiaries are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet at cost 
and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the Group and are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Group’s share of profit after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement and the Group’s share of the Joint Venture’s net assets are incorporated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for permanent impairment loss is shown in the Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Going concern
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Corporate Governance review on page 48.
Revenue recognition 
Rental income – rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Any incentive for lessees 
to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over the same period.
Sale of goods – assets, such as trading properties, development sites and completed developments, are regarded as sold upon the transfer of the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. This occurs on exchange of unconditional contracts 
for the sale of the site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a 
conditional sale where those conditions are satisfied at completion. Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets are derived from the 
fair value of the consideration received in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Property advisory/development management services – where the Group provides these services to the third party property site owner the Group 
recognises income over the period these services are provided and in accordance with the specific terms of the contract. If the amount of, and 
payment of, the consideration for these services are contingent upon a future event (such as sale of the property) and the Group recognises revenue 
when it has provided the services, it can reliably estimate the fair value of the consideration and upon occurrence of the relevant event.
Investment income – revenue in respect of investment and other income represents investment income, fees and commissions earned on an accruals 
basis and the fair value of the consideration received/receivable on investments held for the short-term. Dividends are recognised when the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and 
the effective interest rate.
Share-based payments 
The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan. These payments are discussed 
in greater detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 62. The fair value of share-based payments related to employees’ service are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at the grant date. All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 
November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 are recognised in the financial statements. The Group uses the stochastic valuation model 
and the resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement (“Income Statement”) over the vesting period of the share-based 
payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, over the vesting period, 
to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if 
there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment 
properties. The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies. Costs incurred in respect of leasehold improvements to the 
Group’s head office at 11–15 Farm Street, London W1J 5RS are capitalised and held as short-term leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements, 
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the 
following basis:
Short leasehold improvements – 10% or length of lease, if shorter 
Plant and equipment  – 25% helical bar plc 2013

notes to the financial statements
Taxation 
The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as 
adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the 
associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The measurement of deferred tax assets 
and liabilities reflects the tax consequences of the manner in which the Group expects, at the balance sheet date, to recover or settle the carrying 
amount of those assets and liabilities. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reflects the estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the awards at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when 
the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. It is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items 
credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
a)  the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and,
b)  it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which dividends are 
approved.
Investment properties 
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for long-term rental income and for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction costs, and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value. These fair values 
are based on market values as determined by professionally qualified external valuers or are determined by the directors of the Group based on their 
knowledge of the property. In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation in the Income Statement 
of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral 
plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property is treated as investment property in accordance with IAS 40. 
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an investment 
property measured at fair value and is not reclassified. Interest is capitalised before tax relief until the date of practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 15.
Goodwill 
Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired, is capitalised 
and reviewed annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately 
after acquisition in the Income Statement.
Land, developments and trading properties 
Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion and estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised. The interest 
capitalised is either based on the interest paid (where a project has a specific loan) or calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of 
borrowings (where there are no specific borrowings for the project). Interest is capitalised from the date of commencement of the development work 
until date of practical completion.  helical bar plc 2013

notes to the financial statements
Investments 
Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the 
Income Statement. Upon disposal, accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the Income Statement. 
Held for sale investments 
Investments are defined as held for sale when the Group intends to sell the investment and if sale is highly probable. Such held for sale investments are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately prior to their classification as held for sale and their fair value less costs to sell. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowing and borrowing costs 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of finance and other costs yet to be amortised.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of new developments and investment properties are added to the costs of 
such properties until the date of completion of the development or investment. After initial recognition borrowings are carried at amortised cost. This 
treatment has been adopted since transition to IFRS.
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate caps and floors, and forward foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risks 
arising from its activities. Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices, estimated 
future cash flows and forward rates as appropriate. Any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Further information on the categorisation of financial instruments can be found in note 34.
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, finance leases of investment property are accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to 
pay future minimum lease payments. The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised finance lease 
liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise. Exchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item which is included in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement. 
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in 
subsidiaries are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if 
applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.  helical bar plc 2013

notes to the financial statements
Net asset values per share 
Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate 
Association (“EPRA”).
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
Shares held in the Helical Bar Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (“ESOP”) are shown as a deduction in arriving at equity funds. Assets, liabilities 
and reserves of the ESOP are included in the statutory headings to which they relate. Purchases and sales of own shares increase or decrease the 
book value of “Own shares held” in the Balance Sheet. At each period end the Group assesses and recognises the value of “Own shares held” with 
reference to the expected cash proceeds and accounts for movement between book value and fair value as a reserves transfer.
Use of estimates and judgements 
To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and 
liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the financial statements. These estimates are based on historical experience and various 
other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these considerations 
form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may significantly impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position are:
–  recognition of property management/development management service income includes subjective assumptions such as assessment of contingent 
events and time value of money for future payments (note 2);
– valuation of investment properties, where external valuers are used to provide third party valuations (note 15);
–  recognition of share–based payments which is dependent upon the estimated number of performance share plan awards that will vest at the end 
of the performance periods (note 29);
–  calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered (note 11);
– valuation of the investment in a property developer which is based on a valuation method (note 21); and,
–  directors’ valuation of land, development and trading properties include subjective assumptions including the results of future planning decisions 
and future sales values and timings (note 20). helical bar plc 2013

Market risk 
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Property values decline Current uncertainties in the world economy mean that future 
performance is difficult to predict 
Helical has been active in disposing of non-performing assets 
and rebalancing its portfolio for the changing market
Keep diversified portfolio to 
prevent being over-exposed 
to one sector
Reduced tenant demand for space Group’s strategy is to avoid doing speculative developments
Focus is on buying well let properties in good locations
Continue to avoid speculative 
developments
Continue to ensure that vacant 
space is kept to a minimum
Strategic risk 
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Group’s strategy is inconsistent with market 
conditions e.g.:
-  Asset concentration/lot size impacts on 
liquidity (e.g. if investments become difficult 
to sell does this affect our liquidity)
-  Asset concentration/mix creates excessive 
volatility in property revaluation movements
Management constantly monitors the Group’s strategy and 
changes it where market conditions dictate. Management 
team is very experienced and has a strong track record in 
the property market
Due to the small size of the Group and the management team, 
changes to the strategy can be effected quickly.
Inappropriate capital structure (i.e. too highly 
geared) leading to financial underperformance
The group’s gearing was 88% at March 2013
The group’s gearing is constantly monitored to ensure that 
it remains appropriate relative to the economic cycle
Continue monitoring 
capital structure
Take gearing level into 
account when making 
business decisions
Financial risk 
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Inability to roll over loans Good relationship with the majority of real estate lending 
institutions
Maturity profile of the Group’s loans at 31 March 2013 is:  
£40m maturing within 1 year  
£11m maturing between 1 to 2 years  
£63m maturing between 2 and 3 years  
£99m maturing between 3 and 4 years  
£48m maturing after 4 years
Since 31 March 2013 of the loans expiring within one year, £8m 
has been repaid, £6m has been refinanced until 2017 and £6m 
until 2018. 
Maturity profile of the Group’s share of joint venture loans 
at 31 March 2013 is:  
£1m maturing within 1 year  
£14m maturing between 1 to 2 years  
£59m maturing between 2 and 3 years
Borrowing is spread between a number of different institutions
Focus on refinancing loans 
due to be repaid before 
31 March 2014
Foreign exchange risk Helical’s exposure to foreign exchange risk has been reduced 
due to borrowing on developments in local currencies where 
possible.  As at 31 March 2013 the Group’s net euro assets are 
worth £19.2m, net Polish zloty assets £0.2m and net US dollars 
assets £6.0m.
Increase in cost of borrowing At 31 March 2013 the Group and its share of joint ventures 
had £163m of fixed rate debt and interest rates caps of 
£133m at an average rate of 4.71%
Hedge effectiveness regularly monitored
Ensure that hedging % 
remains at an appropriate level

Financial risk (continued)
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Breaching loan covenants Adherence to loan covenants is constantly  
monitored with reference to current compliance  
and forecast compliance.
Continue monitoring loan covenants
Insufficient liquidity to take advantage of 
opportunities
As at 31 March 13 the Group had £37m  
of cash, £35m of undrawn borrowings and  
£27m of uncharged property.
Maintain overdraft facilities
Ensure that cash resources do not fall below 
currently forecast levels
Tenant default Tenant covenant strength is considered when  
making property decisions. Currently no tenant  
represents more than 5.5% of the Group’s  
share of total rent roll.
Bad debts were 2% of gross rent in the year  
to 31 March 2013. 
Maintain dialogue with tenants to reduce risk  
of unexpected non-payment 
Ensure no over reliance on individual tenants
Loss of deposits due to banking counterparty 
failure
All deposits are held at high quality financial  
institutions 
No significant deposits held outside the UK
Regular monitoring of financial institutions
Ensure that all deposits remain at well 
capitalised institutions
People risk 
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Lack of the right personnel to ensure the 
Group’s strategy is adhered to
Senior management team are very experienced
Employee turnover is low
Remuneration is set to attract and retain 
high calibre staff
Monitor staff resources to ensure appropriate to 
any changes in the business
Health & safety issues Health and safety policy updated annually
Use of specialist professional advice
Not involved in high risk activities
No significant issues reported in the year
Monitor compliance with policy
Continue to use specialist advice
Bribery and corruption risk Anti-bribery policy and procedures in place 
which is distributed to all staff and all 
significant Joint Venture partners
The Board is firmly behind the prohibition 
of giving or receiving of bribes or facilitation 
payments
Continue to identify and monitor projects with  
a greater exposure to bribery and corruption
Avoid doing business in high risk territories
Development risk 
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Inability to add to the current development 
pipeline
Experienced development team with an 
excellent track record
Good reputation in property sector
Changes in legislation leading to delays 
in receiving planning permission
Good relationships with planning consultants 
and local authorities
Keep up to date with planning legislation
Continue to use specialist professional advisors
Lack of demand for new property Group’s strategy is to avoid doing speculative 
developments
Continue to avoid speculative developments
Inability to find suitable contractors/JV partners Well established network of joint venture  
partners which it has worked with in the past
As Helical nears the construction of key  
projects (e.g. White City, Barts Square,  
Old Street) this risk increase

Unsolicited investment advice – warning to shareholders
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have 
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ 
who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to 
be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be 
very persistent and extremely persuasive. It is not just the novice investor 
that has been duped in this way; many of the victims had been 
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be 
very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or 
offers of free reports into the company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
•  Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA (Financial  
Conduct Authority) before getting involved. You can check at  
www.fca.org.uk/consumers.
•  Report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or by 
completing an online form at: 
www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/investment-scams/share-fraud-
and-boiler-room-scams/reporting-form.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Also keep 
in mind that some fraudsters use the name of genuine firms or individuals 
on the FCA Register to suggest that they are legitimate. However, 
authorised firms are unlikely to contact you out of the blue offering to buy 
or sell shares.

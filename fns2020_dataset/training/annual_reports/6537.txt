02 Company Overview
Chairman’s Statement
Bob Lawson
I was very proud to become Chairman of Genus last 
November and, in this my first statement to you as 
shareholders, I am pleased to report strong business 
performance and sound underlying strategic progress.
Results
Genus achieved good results for the year ended 30 June 
2011. Revenue rose 9%, compared with only 2% growth 
last year, as customer demand for genetics began to 
recover post the agricultural recession. Adjusted pre-tax 
profits rose 19% to £39.0m and adjusted earnings per 
share were up 22% at 44.8p.
With the major capital investment programme, started two 
years ago, to increase product development capacity now 
complete, cash generation was also strong with net debt 
reducing by £12.1m to £67.9m.
Strategy
The strength of the Group’s strategy lies in the combination of 
the underlying fundamental growth inherent in the markets in 
which the Group operates, the strength of the Group’s global 
sales and distribution network and perhaps most importantly 
of all, the success of its research and product development in 
ensuring the Group’s products remain market leading.
Global population growth and increasing urbanisation are 
driving increased demand for food and protein in diets. The 
growth in demand for Genus’ products that this creates is 
further enhanced by the need for farming to become more 
efficient. Improved animal genetics is a key component in 
meeting these demands.
Against this background, the success of Genus’ research 
and product development programme is vital to ensuring 
that the Group maintains its leading position as the natural 
provider of improved genetics. The Board’s recognition of 
the importance of this is reflected in the emphasis placed 
on the workings of the Group’s Science Committee and the 
regular reporting of progress to the Board. The Science 
Committee is chaired by Professor Barry Furr and oversees 
the allocation of research funds to projects based on their 
importance and likelihood of commercial success as well 
as monitoring progress in global research and product 
development activities. The results to date are impressive, 
with industry leading performance in both our porcine and 
bovine product ranges. To further enhance our competitive 
position, we plan to continue to increase our investment in 
research and product development in the current year.
Genus has an extensive global sales and distribution network 
through which to distribute its products. As reported by 
Richard, much attention is being placed on extending this 
network to take advantage of the opportunities available in 
fast growing emerging markets.
Dividend
The Board is recommending an increase in the final 
dividend for the year ended 30 June 2011 of 10% to 
13.3 pence per share. Subject to shareholder approval 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 10 November 2011, this dividend will be paid on 
25 November 2011 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 11 November 2011.
As the Group has now completed its major investment 
programme to expand its product development and 
production facilities and has returned to being strongly 
cash generative, the Board has reviewed its dividend policy. 
It has concluded that it will introduce an interim dividend. 
As a result, the final dividend for the year just ended is being 
brought forward from January 2012 to November 2011, 
“ I am pleased to report strong 
business performance and sound 
underlying strategic progress.” Genus plc Annual Report 2011

and the Board expects to pay an interim dividend in April 
2012 of approximately one third of the total dividend for 
the year.
Directors and Employees
During the last year, a key task for me and my Board 
colleagues has been to manage the succession of our 
Chief Executive Richard Wood as he approached retirement.
I am pleased to welcome Karim Bitar to the Board. Karim 
joined the Board on 1 September 2011 and will become Chief 
Executive on Richard’s retirement on 30 September 2011.
Karim, a biochemist by training, has an outstanding 
reputation for delivering international growth with market-
leading pharmaceutical products. The Board believes that 
his extensive experience combined with his commitment 
and enthusiasm for innovation will provide further impetus 
to Genus’ development.
Richard has led Genus as Chief Executive for over 14 years. 
During this period Genus has been transformed from a small 
UK operation into a truly global business with growth driven 
by its in-house research and development and worldwide 
distribution. On behalf of the Board and shareholders, 
I would like to thank Richard for the huge commitment and 
contribution that he has made to Genus and wish him a long 
and enjoyable retirement.
As you know, John Hawkins, my predecessor, stepped 
down at last year’s AGM and I would like to record my 
thanks to John for an exemplary handover and for all his 
hard work for Genus during his ten years as a Director.
In my first year as Chairman, I have begun to visit our key 
operations and met many of our people.
My impressions are:
1. The Group operates in a global segment that has 
substantial potential. Demand for quality food efficiently 
produced to meet the growing population needs will 
underpin the Group’s future growth and development.
2. Genus has excellent standards of animal husbandry. The 
animals are well housed and looked after by committed 
and knowledgeable people.
3. Significant expertise resides in the research activities 
of the Group. For us, our primary competitive advantage 
is market leading genetics and these genetics have to 
match the needs of individual countries as well as 
specific customers. I have been most impressed by the 
expertise that we have within the organisation and our 
commitment to provide superior products at attractive 
prices directly from the research activities.
4. We have a global footprint and an increasingly credible 
presence in the important emerging markets. These will be 
the significant profit drivers for the Group in the years ahead.
5. The lasting impression is of the professionalism and 
commitment of everyone in all spheres of activity that I 
have met. This team of people operating in 30 countries 
provides a service to customers which you as owners of 
Genus can justifiably be proud. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank them all for their hard work and 
support in continuing to deliver best in class service to 
customers and another year of record profits.
I am confident that the Group’s global footprint, investment 
in research and product development and industry leading 
product portfolio leaves Genus well placed to continue the 
progress made in the last year and to benefit from the 
long-term growth available in its global markets.

In this my final review of Genus’ progress as Chief Executive 
Officer, I am pleased to be able to report that Genus achieved 
a strong performance in the year to 30 June 2011, delivering 
record results with revenue up 9% to £309.9m and adjusted 
profit before tax increasing by 19% to £39.0m.
The recovery in global agricultural markets that began 
to improve the genetics market in the first half of this year 
continued to progress. This led to improved demand for 
genetics from our customers, especially in Latin America 
and the USA. Genus achieved good volume growth in 
those markets but the Far East porcine market remained 
depressed until the final quarter and the European porcine 
market is yet to recover.
With the benefit of the improved trading and reduced capital 
expenditure, the cash inflow for the year was £10.0m and this 
reduced net debt to below £70m.
Group Performance
Revenue for the year of £309.9m was up 9%. The increase 
was driven principally by growth in sales in both North America 
and Latin America. Growth was particularly noticeable in 
the porcine business where sales of breeding animals 
grew strongly.
Adjusted operating profit, including the contribution from joint 
ventures, increased by 7% to £45.3m. North America and 
Latin America both recorded double digit profit growth, due 
to the strength of the market recovery and, in Latin America, 
underlying market growth. The porcine operations performed 
particularly well delivering 8% volume growth. In Europe where 
the market was more fragile, bovine performed robustly. 
However the region’s profits were held back by the depressed 
state of the European pig market which is also suffering from 
the increased cost and uncertainty associated with imminent 
environmental and welfare legislation. This resulted in lower 
demand for porcine breeding animals. The Far East profitability 
was at a similar level to last year. The Chinese pig market 
was depressed until the final quarter because of widespread 
outbreaks of disease but has recovered and is now strong. 
The region made good progress in bovine with volumes well 
up, particularly in China.
We increased investment in Research and Development 
by 8% to drive further progress in product development 
activities to meet projected future demand and to enhance 
genetic progress.
Finance costs were reduced by £3.0m to £6.3m. Pension 
interest and bank interest costs reduced, with the latter 
benefiting from a tighter control of working capital and 
improved cash generation from trading.
The increased adjusted operating profit and lower finance 
costs combined to produce a 19% increase in adjusted 
profit before tax to £39.0m. Exchange movements had a 
minimal effect in the year with profit before tax up 19% at 
constant currency.
As explained in the Financial Review on page 28, the 
statutory operating profit of £44.8m was 5% lower than last 
year (2010: £47.0m). This result is struck after non-recurring 
“ In this my final year as Chief 
Executive, I am pleased to report 
record results with adjusted 
pre‑tax profits up 19%.” Genus plc Annual Report 2011

exceptional items and certain non-cash items, particularly 
the net IAS 41 valuation movement in biological assets. The 
nature and volatility of these items do not properly reflect the 
underlying performance of the business. It is for this reason 
that we report externally and use internally adjusted profit 
to measure performance. Statutory profit before tax was 
£40.8m (2010: £40.8m) after the benefit of reduced interest 
charges. Statutory earnings per share rose 6% to 49.0 pence 
per share (2010: 46.3 pence).
Strategy
I am pleased to report that the programme to expand 
product development and increase production capacity 
by 30% was successfully completed in the first half of this 
financial year. This new capacity is helping to maintain and 
grow our product lead and is also providing the capacity 
necessary to meet rising demand both in our established 
markets and to open up developing markets, particularly, 
in the RIC countries, Russia, India and China. 
A key plank of the Group’s strategy is to capture growth in 
these fast growing developing markets. Our objective is that 
the Far East and Latin America regions should grow within 
five years to become 40% of earnings from their current 
31%. Good progress has been made in the laying of 
foundations to achieve this growth. 
We have strengthened the management teams in both the 
Far East and Latin America. New regional managers were 
appointed to an enlarged Far East region that now includes 
Russia and to oversee operations in the equally important 
Latin American market. We also recruited a new managing 
director for China in view of the strong growth envisaged for 
that market.
We have also progressed our plans to increase sales of 
domestically produced product in Russia, India and China. 
A newly acquired stud in Russia has been stocked with bulls 
from the USA and became operational in August 2011. We 
commenced the sale of locally produced semen in India and 
in China, we have increased to 48 the number of Australian 
sourced progeny-tested bulls available to support growth in 
that fast developing market. We have also expanded our 
porcine operation in China, albeit at a slower pace than 
originally planned because of the temporarily depressed 
prospects there.
These steps have enabled us to achieve a 9% sales increase 
in the RIC countries and leave us well placed to benefit from 
further growth in these markets.
Outlook
Despite the current economic uncertainties, by the end 
of Genus’ financial year, most global agricultural markets 
were considerably more favourable than a year ago and 
we expect these market conditions to continue.
In July, US bovine sales were reduced by a heatwave 
in some states but this was offset by a much improved 
performance in our porcine business across the Far East. 
Overall trading has been in line with our expectations and 
we look forward confidently to another year of good growth.
I am delighted to be able to hand over such a healthy and 
prosperous business. Genus has an exceptional team of 
managers and staff, all dedicated and hardworking. I have 
enjoyed working with them over the last 14 years and would 
like to thank them for their courtesy, help and support in our 
joint endeavours. I feel sure they will continue to show the 
same resolve for success and commitment to my 
successor, Karim Bitar.

Our Business
Genus is a world leader in applying science to animal 
breeding. Through our extensive research and product 
development we create advances in animal breeding. 
The non-genetically modified organism technology 
used is applicable across all livestock species but is 
only commercialised by Genus in the bovine and porcine 
farming sectors. This enables us to sell semen and breeding 
animals to our customers with superior genetics to those 
animals currently in production. Customers’ animals produce 
offspring with greater production efficiency, milk and meat 
output and quality, and use these to supply the global dairy 
and meat chain.
Genus operates sales and distribution on a regional 
basis across its four major regions of North America, 
Latin America, Europe and the Far East (including Russia 
and Australia). Genus’ worldwide sales are made in seventy 
countries under the trademarks ‘Genus’ or ‘ABS’ (dairy 
and beef cattle) and ‘PIC’ (pigs). Its bovine and porcine 
product sectors are broadly of similar size, with annual 
sales of £310m being split 50% bovine and 50% porcine. 
Research and development is managed centrally on a 
global basis to ensure maximum effectiveness.
Our Business Model
World Demand for Improved Farming Productivity
Genus is a growth business well positioned to benefit from the 
increasing global demand for improved agricultural efficiency.
World-leading Research & Product Development
The lifeblood of the business is its research and product 
development. Approximately £25m per annum is spent 
on research and product development to create 
improved genetics.
Our bovine product development programme is 
designed to create elite bulls whose characteristics 
meet the requirements of farming customers. We achieve 
this through an extensive bull development programme 
involving 400 animals each year entering our five year 
selection and testing programmes located across the 
world. Genome evaluation is increasingly being used 
to supplement traditional progeny testing and thereby 
to extend the Company’s lead in the sector.
The primary objective of our porcine development 
programme is to improve the genetics in the Company’s 
pure lines of animals. These are then used to create elite 
boars and gilts to multiply in order to supply agricultural 
quantities of superior pure-bred and cross-bred animals 
for sale to regional customers. 
Pure line development involves 6,400 sows and boars 
and is undertaken in two nucleus herd facilities located in 
Canada and the USA. The programme is optimised using 
genomic evaluation techniques and the in-house extensive 
database of animal records created through cross-bred 
trials and information obtained from our customers.

Global 
sales and 
distribution
Alongside the development programme we operate a 
fundamental research programme designed to identify 
improvements in techniques and to provide the potential 
for a technological breakthrough.
Global Sales and Distribution
Genus sells and distributes most of its products through thirty 
subsidiaries located in the four operating regions. In a number 
of other countries sales are made through agents. 
The business model is different for bovine and porcine:
In bovine, the elite bulls graduating from product  >
development enter one of our nine studs located 
throughout the world. Semen produced at these studs 
is frozen and distributed to the regional businesses for 
sale to customers. In some countries, we also provide 
related added value products, such as Powerstart silage 
enhancer, and technical services such as genetic mating 
and reproductive management services to assist farmers 
to maximise the benefits of the genetics we sell.
Distribution of porcine genetics is achieved through the  >
sale of live breeding animals and in some cases through 
the sale of fresh semen. Porcine semen has a short life and 
can only be used on farms near our multiplication facilities. 
The elite boars and gilts produced from the two nucleus 
farms are multiplied to produce agricultural quantities for 
supply to our customers.
Genus adds value by continuously increasing the quality 
of the genetics that it provides. Therefore, in order to 
capitalise on its intellectual property whilst minimising the 
Group’s exposure to fluctuations in pig prices involved in 
the extensive multiplication process, Genus subcontracts 
to third party multipliers the vast majority of its multiplication 
requirements. Contracts with multipliers entitle the Group to 
repurchase for onward sale those animals that are required 
to supply its customers. In addition, a number of its larger 
customers undertake their own multiplication.
Sales of breeding animals to customers are increasingly 
being made under royalty contracts rather than by a direct 
and outright sale. Under royalty contracts, breeding animals 
are sold to customers at or near their cost of production 
and customers commit to pay a royalty fee on the number 
of offspring produced from these breeding animals. Direct 
sales involve a significantly larger upfront sales value that 
includes the premium payable for the genetics involved but 
the farmer can continue to use the animals for future 
matings without making any further payments.
The outsourcing of porcine multiplication combined 
with sales being made under royalty contracts produces a 
more robust and consistent profit performance than would 
otherwise be achievable at times when pig prices fluctuate 
and pig production profitability is low. Over 99% of the 
Group’s multiplication requirements are outsourced. 
Approximately 67% of the Group’s porcine sales by 
volume are under royalty contracts, including virtually 
all sales in North America.
At this stage of the development of the Far East markets, 
direct sales rather than royalty contracts are being used 
for the majority of sales. Business Review

Our World Today
An increase in world population and 
urbanisation will drive up consumption 
of beef, pork and milk across the world 
as incomes rise and diets change...
Our population is rising fast. Between 1950 
and 2011, the world population has grown from 
2.6 billion to almost 7 billion: the UN population 
forecast for 2050 is 9.2 billion. 82% of people live 
in the developing world. Here, average growth 
rates are even faster, outstripping growth in the 
developed world by a factor of nine times.
This huge increase in world population will drive a 
rapid expansion in urbanisation. In 1950, only 29% 
of the population lived in an urban environment; 
today it’s about 50% and that’s 3.5 billion people. 
By 2050, forecasts suggest that this will reach 
6.4 billion, around 70% of the population, with 
growth concentrated in the less-developed regions. 
As economies grow and industrialisation
continues, per-capita incomes rise giving people
more disposable income. Households spend
more on higher-value food (meat and dairy) and
this trend is likely to continue, reinforcing both
near and long-term global demand.
Economic prosperity is creating changes in 
global eating patterns. It is not so much the 
billion additional mouths at the bottom of the 
consumption pyramid that are creating pressure, 
but the burgeoning middle class in the emerging 
markets. Significant rises in incomes over the past 
five years in India alone have created 220 million 
consumers of meat, fish, eggs and milk. Company

Genus plc Annual Report 2011
Clearly there will be many more consumers in the 
world to feed, many of these will be considerably 
wealthier and as a result, will demand higher 
quality, added value food.
This accelerating consumption of meat and dairy 
products acts as a catalyst for the industrialisation of 
food production. Greater demand is being placed on 
finite land, water and energy resources by increased 
food consumption and the competing demands on 
these finite resources of alternative energy sources.
Combine this with adverse weather conditions that 
have lead to poor harvests, for example in Russia 
and Australia, and by necessity farming practices 
must evolve.
This is driving the move towards greater
industrialisation of farming. To maintain a
profitable and sustainable operation now and in
the future, farmers have been compelled to seek
new ways to improve both the productivity of
their operations and the overall quality of their
product offering. 
Genus plays an increasingly important 
social and economic role, enabling our 
global customers to produce quality foods 
efficiently and to meet the increasing 
demands of sustainable agriculture.

Genus uses genomics to solve pig 
robustness issues
Pig mortality and scrotal hernia are traits 
where genomic selection can have a large 
impact: lowly heritable, requiring large 
commercial datasets to estimate breeding 
value, and of high economic importance 
to customers. 
Genus researchers last year used high density SNP 
(genetic marker) chips to search for significant marker–
trait associations in porcine data. The result was an 
affordable test that improves the accuracy of selection by 
38.7% for scrotal hernia and 58.6% for finisher mortality. 
Genus R&D in this area has dramatically accelerated 
the rate of improvement delivered to customers.
Product Development
The product development activities are focused on 
using natural selection techniques together with leading 
biotechnology, such a genomic evaluations, continually to 
improve the Company’s proprietary lines of breeding animals.
In bovine, we operate a five year selection and testing 
programme for the identification of new bulls. This 
continuously regenerates and enhances the stud of 
elite animals whose semen is collected for sale. 
The porcine development programme is centred on the 
Group’s two porcine genetic nucleus herds located in the 
USA and Canada. A sophisticated breeding programme is 
operated involving nine major pure lines of animals to develop 
elite boars and gilts to be multiplied to agricultural quantities 
and sold by the Group’s operating businesses. Quantitative 
genetics and cross-bred trials in commercial herds are used 
to enhance the selection process. 
The success of the product development programme is 
demonstrated by Genus’ world leading product range. For 
example, we have 30 of the top 100 bulls in the internationally 
important US bull rankings; well ahead of any competitor. 
In porcine, independent third party trials demonstrate an 
average US$3 per pig advantage compared to competitors.
Research
Research activities are targeted at projects which will both 
enable a reasonable likelihood of a technological breakthrough 
and offer commercial benefits, such as the Genus sexed semen 
project. The Group manages much of its fundamental research 
in educational establishments and with specialist research 
companies. In addition Genus monitors work undertaken in 
more than 500 research establishments around the world. 
Genus spends approximately 8% 
of sales (£25m per annum) on 
research and product 
development.

New Genetic Nucleus facility opens in 
North America
The new state of the art Genetic Nucleus 
(GN) facility became fully operational during 
2011. This complex in South Dakota supports 
our growth strategy by supplying the most 
competitive available PIC genetics. 
The site houses a population of 3,000 sows, and over 
90,000 gilts and boars were on and off tested during the 
first year. Of those, the top 15% selected breeding boars 
and gilts were distributed in over ten countries to provide 
our customers with advanced genetic material.
Results so far match the world-class performance at 
Aurora, our GN facility in Canada.
Over the last two years, the Company has invested US$30m 
in expanding its central product development facilities, 
to increase its product development capabilities and to 
expand production capacity by over 30%.
In the year to 30 June 2011, we completed the final part 
of this investment programme and the new porcine genetic 
nucleus farm in South Dakota, USA became fully operational.
The increase in bovine product development facilities was 
completed in the previous year and has enabled the bovine 
product development programme in the USA to be increased 
to 317 bulls per annum. Worldwide, the bull development 
programme has now been expanded to an annual intake 
of over 400 bulls per annum across the six primary studs 
located in the USA, Canada, Brazil, the UK, Italy and Australia.
Investment in our global product development facilities 
is ongoing.

Capture Growth in  
Developing Markets

Global partnerships satisfy Chinese 
appetite for pork
The 48 million sows in China account for 
50% of the global sow herd, and pork 
remains the meat of choice for China’s 
1.3 billion people. 
Genus has capitalised on these changes by forging 
successful new global partnerships. We are currently 
working with Besun Food Group in Shaanxi Province, 
which produces 100,000 pigs a year, by stocking its 
4,500 sow high health breeding unit from one of our 
nucleus units in China. The partnership also includes 
Pipestone Swine Systems, a US company that is 
managing Besun’s production operations. 
Genus’ business in Latin America and the Far East 
(including Russia) is operating in fast growing agricultural 
markets. The objective is to capture up to 50% of the new 
growth available in these markets.
Genus has already been operating in a number of the 
countries of Latin America for some time including Mexico, 
Brazil, Argentina and Chile. We recently opened a new 
business in Colombia, the third largest cattle market in Latin 
America. Local production facilities such as the bull stud in 
Uberaba in Brazil were established in the region a number of 
years ago. This stud is being used to achieve strong volume 
growth and increased market share across the region.
The successful approach proven in Latin America is being 
emulated in the expansions of business in the Far East 
region, by establishing local production and supply in the 
RIC countries.
The strategy in porcine is to supply quality breeding animals to 
customers from locally owned or sub-contracted production. 
In the large Chinese market, this is being achieved through 
building our own production nucleus farms. We now 
have four such farms in operation and a further two farms 
under development.
In bovine, Genus’ strategy is to provide a differentiated product 
by supplying locally produced semen from progeny-tested 
bulls. These are being marketed alongside imported semen 
from our global studs. We now have 48 bulls providing semen 
in China that were shipped from our Australian stud and nine 
bulls in Russia that were shipped from the USA. In India, we 
are marketing locally sourced semen and are developing plans 
to introduce progeny-tested product into the market.
Strong growth is being achieved across the Latin American 
and Far East regions, with sales up 17% in the year to 
30 June 2011.

GMS system builds genetic value in 
large dairies
With so many inputs and the need for return 
on investment while feed prices are high, 
dairy managers may lose sight of the need 
to invest in the genetic value of their herd. 
Now, by using the Genus Genetic Management System
®
 
and its herd percentile ranking tool, dairy managers can 
see the link between cow performance and an animal’s 
genetic level. This makes it possible to predict a return on 
genetic investment, which enables customers to use 
better genetics and improve profitability.
Our objective is to continue to grow in the developed 
markets of North America and Europe in line with historical 
growth rates. This will be achieved through the successful 
marketing of an improved product offering supported by 
specialist customer services.
Increased emphasis is being placed on our global product 
management to ensure we have the right product ranges 
available for each of the markets in which we operate. For 
example, in the North American porcine business, our 
new CBVPlus programme is being used to provide higher 
quantity genetics to our customers and generate additional 
revenue for Genus. 
In bovine, semen sales are being enhanced by the marketing of 
added value services such as ‘GMS’ genetic mating services 
and ‘RMS’ reproductive management service. These services 
also increase customer loyalty.
Additional business opportunities continue to be exploited, 
such as the Powerline Beef Genetics business, acquired 
in 2010. This provides speciality beef genetics to large 
US suppliers.
In the year to 30 June 2011, the strength of the Genus’ 
product range and additional services provided contributed 
to a 6% growth in sales in the developed market countries.

Market Overview
The recovery in agricultural markets that began in the 
second half of the year to June 2010 became increasingly 
evident during the first half of the current financial year. As 
the year progressed, prices continued to improve in most 
markets and producer profitability was restored, despite the 
significant rise in feed prices that occurred. 
These evolving favourable market conditions encouraged 
producers to return to updating the genetics in their herds. 
As a result, demand for Genus’ products improved steadily 
during the year. This improvement was evident in most 
markets with the exception of the European pig market 
which remained depressed and the Far East market that 
did not pick up until the final quarter.
Dairy and Beef
Milk prices across the world have risen steadily over the last 
two years as markets rebounded from the recession. This 
was particularly noticeable in the US market where prices 
had fallen dramatically during the recession. During the year 
to 30 June 2011 US milk prices rose progressively 24% to 
reach 23ppl at the year end. At this level, farmer profitability 
has been restored.

In the light of these favourable market conditions, demand 
for semen was reasonable in developed markets. In the 
developing markets of Latin America and the Far East, 
there was strong and growing demand. Enlightened farmers 
looking to expand also created increased demand for sexed 
semen to support the rapid growth of their herds.
In beef markets, cattle prices have also been firming.
Pigs
In the US pig market, producers had cut back their herds 
during 2009 and 2010. This together with the recovery in 
demand for pig meat and for exports resulted in significant 
increases in pig prices throughout 2010 and into 2011. 
As a result, pig producers’ profitability was restored.
As feed prices rose during the year, pig prices increased 
further to maintain a profitable outlook for producers. This 
restored producer confidence and consequently producers 
returned to updating the genetics in their herds.

Similar trends occurred across Latin America, other than

However, in Europe, increases in pig prices have been 
insufficient to offset higher feed costs. This means producers 
have been rendered loss-making at a time when many of 
them are assessing the need for investment to upgrade farms 
to meet European welfare legislation being introduced in 
2013. This has adversely affected demand for breeding 
animals as producers held back on investment plans.
In China, pig prices remained depressed for most of the 
year due to disease in their herds that resulted in widespread 
slaughtering. As capacity reduced, pig prices rose strongly 
towards the end of the year and have now reached 19 renminbi 
(£1.80) per kilogram (60% up over the prior year). At these price 
levels, producers are very profitable and there should be high 
demand for good quality genetics to replenish their herds. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

The Americas
The region had a successful year. Market improvements 
particularly in Latin America and the porcine sector in North

Revenue rose 11% to £114.5m and operating profit increased 
by 14%. The improvement in profit was driven by strong sales 
growth in porcine and improved margins and tight cost 
control in bovine.
Market conditions in porcine improved considerably during 
the year. As a result, despite higher feed costs, producer 
profitability was restored and this led to increased sales of 
Genus’ breeding animals as customers returned to updating 
the genetics in their herds. A number of new accounts were 
won and increased business was achieved with existing 
customers. This resulted in an improved market share, up 
from 33% to 35% with more than 50% of the pigs in the US 
market now containing Genus genetics. In addition, increased 
sales of enhanced genetics under the recently introduced 
CBVPlus programme increased royalties and improved 
margins on existing accounts.
In bovine, milk prices improved gradually during the year and 
enabled farmers to return to profitability towards the end of 
the year. Bovine volumes were down 2% but this was entirely 
due to a few accounts being lost last year in Western 
California following a change in sales management in the 
area. Early in the year, a further $2.5m of annualised cost 
savings were implemented and the sales organisation 
reconfigured. The resultant tighter sales management 
enabled the business to stabilise volumes and improve 
average selling prices. These steps resulted in a strong 
increase in profits for the year and the business being well 
positioned for the year ahead.

Latin America achieved another record year with growth in

from the joint venture in Brazil. 
We continued to invest in expanding our presence in this fast 
growing region. A new general manager was appointed to 
oversee both the bovine and porcine activities. This is enabling 
the two sectors to operate together more effectively as they 
grow. For example, key account management for porcine 
customers is now being handled across the region in one 
structure with technical services unified across the Americas. 
As a result, we are using our strongest people to manage key

of 25%. Market share also improved in Mexico and Uruguay. 
More customers were converted to using reproductive 
management services (‘RMS’). This increases customer 
loyalty and was a contributory factor in achieving improved 
average selling prices. A new business unit was opened in 
Colombia, the third largest cattle market in Latin America, 
and has made an encouraging start.
In porcine, the sale of breeding animals was strong as the 
improved market encouraged customers to update the 
genetics in their herds. Mexico and Chile both increased 
market share and important contracts were renewed at 
improved royalty rates. During the year, a new genetic 
transfer centre in Mexico containing 400 boars was 
completed. This is the largest and most modern of its 
kind in Latin America. 
The joint venture in Brazil also had a good year benefiting 
especially from strong pig prices in the first half of the year. 
Progress has been made in converting customer royalty 
contracts from revenue based to volume based royalties.
During this business year, we have 
focused on the CBVPlus programme 
– an innovative strategy that enables 
us to calculate the relative value of 
the boars on our nucleus farms.
Progeny from CBVPlus sires deliver US$1.33 to 
US$1.75 per pig more profit than the average boar, 
and CBVPlus category boars are certified as free of 
reciprocal translocations, a genetic defect that can 
reduce litter size by 50%. 
Sales of CBVPlus have rocketed by over 400% this 
year, as producers are willingly applying technologies 
that improve production costs and increase revenue.

Performance in Europe was held back by the difficult trading 
conditions in porcine and this resulted in profits being 
marginally lower at £18.4m.
With rising milk prices across Europe, Genus’ dairy semen 
revenues increased. Volume rose 10%, aided by strong 
growth in certain distributor markets including Turkey and 
Saudi Arabia. In the higher margin French market, volume rose 
strongly and profitability benefited from an improved mix. Profit 
in Italy also improved because of an improvement in the 
ranking of the bulls in the local stud. In the UK market, volume 
rose more modestly underpinned by good growth in RMS 
sales. Overall, bovine profitability edged ahead, although net 
margins were reduced by higher distribution costs, particularly 
in the UK as fuel and other prices rose steeply.
In porcine, poor market conditions across Europe and 
concerns over 2013 welfare compliance have led to weak 
demand and, as a result, sales of breeding animals were 
lower. Despite this, several markets, including the UK and 
distributors, performed well. However, elsewhere volumes 
fell and overall sales were down 4%. Profits in Genus’ 
small farming operations in the Czech Republic, Poland and 
Romania were also lower. Cost reductions were implemented 
including the closure of the Kingston office in the UK. With the 
expectation of only gradual improvements in the market in the 
short term, plans are being developed for further productivity 
improvements.

Good progress was made in pursuing the growth strategy for 
the region. However, financial performance was held back by 
poor market conditions in the first half of the year particularly 
in the porcine business in China, Korea and Vietnam.
The management team was strengthened by the appointment 
of a new regional manager and the establishment of a regional 
office with support functions in Shanghai. In addition, in 
recognition of the growing importance of our business in 
China, a new country manager was recruited for this business.
In bovine, we established local production in Russia and India 
and extended the number of stud animals in China. In Russia, 
a new stud was acquired and has been refurbished to Genus’ 
standards. The stud became operational in August 2011.

enabled the marketing of semen from locally sourced bulls. 
A further 17 bulls have been shipped from Australia to China 
to bring the total number of progeny-tested bulls available for 
production in China to 48. The above initiatives have driven 
strong volume growth of 29% across the region.
Sales increased in porcine as the additional capacity from our 
new farms in China came on stream. However, profitability in 
the first half of the year was adversely affected by depressed 
pig prices and the temporary impact of widespread disease. 
The reductions in producer herds and supply of animals led 
to rising pig prices and increased demand in the second 
half of the year. This in turn resulted in improved profitability. 
Important new business has been won with the benefit of the 
increased focus being placed on large key accounts, including 
international companies expanding in China. In Russia, lack 
of available funding impacted customer demand, however 
excellent progress has been made with the country’s three 
largest producers in securing new stockings that will yield 
future revenue. 
Genus is the only global producer that 
offers its customers local services in 
the growing markets of Russia, India 
and China. A new Genus bovine 
production facility in Krasnodar firmly 
establishes the Company’s strategic 
expansion strategy in Russia. As in 
India and China, local production will 
supplement imported semen sales.
Target customer farms are advanced large commercial 
operations that require high quality genetics, sourced 
locally, to achieve their breeding goals. 
Nine proven bulls from North America were shipped 
to the Russian stud in May and the sale of imported 
semen is progressing well.

Research & Product 
Development Costs 25.3 23.5 8 7
The cost of the expanded Research and Product 
Development programme increased by 8% to £25.3m. 
Bovine product development rose as a result of the increased 
size of the bull development programme to provide capacity 
for anticipated growth. Porcine development includes 
increased cost as the use of genomics was further extended 
in the development programme. The impact of higher feed 
prices on porcine development costs was offset by improved 
slaughter sales.
Bovine Product Development
The expansion of the bull development programme has 
continued with 278 Holstein bulls joining the programme 
during the year in the USA. This brings our worldwide 
programme to over 400 bulls per annum. We plan to increase 
the animal intake in the USA in the year ahead to 300 bulls 
per annum. The expanded programme is necessary to meet 
the anticipated growth in volumes but will also enhance the 
selection process. In addition, genomics are increasingly being 
used to further improve selection. Our internal evaluations give 
us confidence in the continued improvement in the merit of the 
stud, which we expect to be reflected in future bull rankings.
During the year, 56 bulls graduated from our progeny test 
programmes into our production studs throughout the world. 
We have also developed bulls to be shipped for local supply 
in emerging markets. A further 17 bulls were shipped to China 
from Australia and 9 bulls from the USA to the newly 
established bull stud in Russia.
Porcine Product Development
Independent porcine product trials continue to demonstrate 
the market leadership of Genus’ porcine genetics. The 
new genetic nucleus farm in South Dakota became fully 
operational during the year. The enlarged herd has enabled 
an increase in selection pressure. The dedicated cross-bred 
trials undertaken in our own farms together with the extended 
use of genomics and data from our extensive ‘PIC Traq’ 
database are enabling improved accuracy of selection. The 
combination of increased selection pressure and improved 
accuracy should ensure our products remain world market 
leaders in the porcine sector.
Fundamental Science
The Group manages much of its fundamental research 
in education establishments and with specialist research 
companies. However, as Genus is a market leader in this 
sector, all work on semen physiology and freezing is carried 
out in-house. In addition, Genus monitors work undertaken in 
more than 500 research establishments around the world so 
that it can quickly identify progress in other biotech industries 
that might have potential in Genus’ research programme.

This approach enables Genus to achieve more progress 
than would normally be expected from the current level 
of expenditure directed towards fundamental science.
Research activities continued to be targeted at projects 
that will both enable a reasonable likelihood of technological 
advance and offer significant commercial benefit to the 
business if successful. The Group’s Science Committee 
approves projects for inclusion in the programme and 
monitors overall progress.
In the current year, the use of genomics has shown impressive 
improvements in our ability to calculate accurately estimated 
breeding values, important in our product development 
selection process. Good progress is also being made with 
our sexed semen project.
Genus recently added a globally 
qualified production barn to its new 
facility in Dekorra, Wisconsin. The two 
existing bull rearing barns can house 
180 bulls, while the new facility allows 
the production of over five million 
units of semen. The bulls have roomy, 
individual deep bedded pens, there is 
a hospital room and even underfloor 
heating to combat chilly winters.
In the last twelve months, bulls at Dekorra have 
produced over 1.7 million units of semen, which have 
been shipped and sold in over 70 countries around 
the world.

Key Performance Indicators
We have clear objectives to deliver organic growth in both 
species, drive operating profitability and generate cash. 
The following indicators are used to monitor Genus’ 
progress in achieving its objectives.
Bovine Sales Volume
Cash Conversion
Net Debt to EBITDA Return on Capital Employed
Porcine Sales Volume
Porcine Revenue: % Royalty
Definition
The change in the volume of dairy, beef and sorted units of 
semen delivered in the year.
Performance
Volumes grew 11% to 14.7m doses driven by strong growth in 
volumes in the Far East and Latin America. This included semen 
from the recently established local production facilities in India 
and China. Semen volumes supplied from global studs 
increased by 5%.
Definition
Cash generated from operations before interest and taxes, 
expressed as a percentage of adjusted operating profit.
Performance
Cash conversion continued to be good benefiting from tight 
working capital management and lower capital expenditure. 
This was achieved despite increased investment in the bull 
development programme and additional deficit repair 
contributions paid into the pension schemes.
Definition
The ratio of net debt, being gross debt including finance lease 
obligations less cash held, to earnings (excluding JV income) 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
Performance
The ratio has reduced during the year ended 30 June 2011 from 
1.7 to 1.4, reflecting the strong cash generation that enabled net 
debt to be reduced from £80.0m to £67.9m.
Definition
The change in the volume of both direct and royalty animals on 
which we receive revenue.
Performance
After a slower year last year during the agricultural recession, 
this year has seen a bounce back to growth of 6% as customers 
returned to updating the genetics in their herd. Performance in the 
Far East, where newly established farms came on stream during 
the year, and North America have been particularly strong.
Definition
The proportion of revenue stemming from royalty arrangements 
expressed as a percentage of total porcine revenue. This is a key 
indicator of Genus’ success in converting porcine customers 
from direct sales to the more robust royalty model.
Performance
The proportion of porcine revenue contributed by the royalty 
model grew to 40% in the year ended 30 June 2011 benefiting 
from further progress in converting customers to the royalty 
model in the developing markets.
Definition
Return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) is defined as adjusted 
operating profit expressed as a percentage of historical 
(non IAS 41 adjusted) gross assets.
Performance
ROCE has increased from 15.5% last year to 17.0% as at 30 June 
2011. This improved return reflects the increase in operating profit 
through the year and a consolidation of the asset base after the 
major investments in prior years in extending product 
development capacity. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Sales of products and services analysed by region. The change in 
revenue is also shown on a constant basis to indicate underlying 
sales trends.
Performance
Revenue grew by 9% in both actual and constant currency as a 
result of renewed demand for Genus’ products. In the developing 
markets, sales were up 14%, and in the mature markets focus on 
product management helped achieve growth of 7%.
Definition
Regional operating profit expressed as a percentage of 
regional revenue.
Performance
The regional operating margin reduced slightly from 25.4% 
to 25.1% reflecting the strategy to develop the RIC markets, 
in which locally supplied product has reduced the average 
selling prices.
Definition
Regional operating profit including JV income, stated before 
research and development and central costs, and before the 
impacts of IAS 41 (biological assets), share-based payment 
expense, amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.
Performance
Regional operating performance grew by 7%. Strong growth 
was achieved in North America, particularly in porcine, and Latin 
America in both species. This was partly held back by tough 
trading conditions in porcine Europe and porcine Far East.

Bovine sales increased by 6%. Volumes grew 11% to 14.7m 
doses driven by strong growth in business from the new local 
studs in China and India. Sales volumes from semen supplied 
from our global studs increased by 5%, broadly in line with the 
historic average. The change in mix from the strong growth 
in locally supplied semen resulted in a small reduction in 
average selling prices. The average selling price of product 
supplied from our global studs, which account for over 80% 
of current volume, was up 1%. With overall volume growth 
and cost reductions implemented, particularly in the USA, 
profitability improved.
Porcine revenues grew by 9%, with royalty income up 6% to 
£52.2m. Sales of breeding animals rose by 14% as customers 
returned to updating the genetics in their herds following the 
slowdown experienced during the global recession. Overall 
volume growth was 6%. Costs remained well controlled and 
profits rose as a result of the strong sales growth.
Finance Costs
Net finance costs reduced by £3.0m to £6.3m (2010: £9.3m). 
The net interest cost on pension liabilities was considerably 
lower. In addition, bank interest costs fell through a combination 
of lower net debt, tighter management of working capital and a 
reduced average interest rate as the fixed rate swaps entered 
into at the time of the Sygen acquisition matured.
Exceptional Items
There was a £1.2m (2010: £2.8m) exceptional credit this 
year. This included a £0.6m favourable insurance recovery 
relating to an environmental liability settled a number of 
years ago. In addition, there was a £0.6m curtailment gain 
from the closure of the only remaining defined benefit 
scheme open to future accrual. The Group’s main defined 
benefit scheme closed in 2010 and gave rise to the large 
exceptional credit reported last year.
Statutory Profit Before Tax
Operating profit on a statutory basis was £44.8m compared 
with £47.0m last year and the statutory profit before tax was 
£40.8m (2010: 40.8m). These results include a still significant, 
but smaller increase in the net fair value credit on biological 
assets under IAS 41 of £9.8m (2010: £11.0m) and a higher 
share-based payment expense reflecting the improving 
earnings expected. As noted above, the underlying
performance as measured by adjusted operating profit 
including joint ventures showed growth of 7%, and adjusted 
profit before tax showed growth of 19%.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the year, based on adjusted 
profit before tax, was 31.5% (2010: 33.7%).
The rate reduced in the year as a result of improved utilisation 
of losses previously considered irrecoverable. The effective 
rate remains higher than the UK corporate tax rate due to the 
mix of overseas profits, particularly the proportion of profits 
generated in North America, where the tax rate is 
approximately 40%.
Earnings Per Share
Adjusted basic earnings per share rose by 22% to 44.8 pence 
(2010: 36.7 pence). The increase was slightly higher than the 
improvement in profit before tax reflecting the reduction in the 
Group’s effective tax rate.
Basic earnings per share on a statutory basis were 
49.0 pence per share (2010: 46.3 pence).
Dividend
The Board is recommending to shareholders a 10% 
increase in the dividend to 13.3 pence per ordinary share. 
Subject to shareholder approval at Genus’ forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, this dividend will be paid on 
25 November 2011 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 11 November 2011. As noted in the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Board intends to introduce an 
interim dividend in the year ahead.
Dividend cover remains strong with the dividend covered 
3.4 times by adjusted earnings (2010: 3.0 times).
Biological Assets
A feature of the Group’s net assets is a substantial investment 
in biological assets which are required by IAS 41 to be held 
at fair value. At 30 June 2011, the carrying value of biological 
assets was £238.8m (2010: £235.7m) as set out in the 
table below:

Represented by:
Porcine 74.6 82.3
Bovine 164.2 153.4
Total 238.8 235.7
The small increase in the overall carrying value of biological 
assets masks an underlying increase in value of £13.9m offset 
by exchange rate movements as a result of the weakening of 
the US Dollar. The underlying increase was driven by an 
increase in the bovine biological assets. This arose from higher 
individual bull values as expected output per bull increased 
together with higher anticipated realisations as a result of the 
quality of the stud. The value of porcine biological assets was 
lower due to the impact of increased selection pressure on the 
herd. This results in more of the existing herd being sold for 
slaughter. Under IAS 41, the value of the animals retained for Genus plc Annual Report 2011

The Group had a strong cash flow performance, with a net 
cash inflow of £17 .0m (2010: £12.9m) before the £7 .0m outflow 
relating to the settlement of a US Dollar swap transaction 
hedging the Group’s US Dollar net asset position.
Cash generated from operations was £39.2m compared 
with £40.5m last year. The benefit of improved profits was 
offset by the increased investment in biological assets 
as the bull programme was expanded and by a £1.5m 
increase in pension deficit repair contributions.
Capital investment in the year reduced to £4.8m in line 
with depreciation following the completion of the Group’s 
investment in extending capacity to meet future growth.
Net debt was reduced from £80.0m to £67.9m at 30 June 
2011. In addition to the cash inflow for the year, borrowings 
reduced by £2.9m due to exchange rate movements on 
that part of the Group’s debt denominated in US Dollars.
In March 2011, the Group completed a refinancing of 
its existing facilities to provide £135m of facilities on an 
unsecured basis through to September 2015. The Group 
has substantial headroom under these facilities. The lower 
margins applicable to the new facilities are expected to 
reduce interest costs in the year to 30 June 2012 by £1.5m.
The Group’s financial ratios remained strong. Gearing 
reduced from 32% to 25%. Interest cover, based on net 
interest excluding interest on pension liabilities, improved 
to 7.9 times (2010: 6.3 times).
Retirement Benefit Obligations
The Group’s retirement benefit obligations at 30 June 
2011, calculated in accordance with IAS 39, were £23.6m 
(2010: £28.8m) before tax and £17 .5m (2010: £20.3m) net of 
related deferred tax. The reduction in obligations in the year 
arose from a lower deficit in the Group’s defined benefit 
pension scheme operated as part of the Milk Pension Fund, a 
multi-employer scheme. This deficit fell from £20.3m to £14.3m 
due to a higher than expected return on the scheme assets.
During the year, revised deficit funding contributions 
were agreed with the Milk Pension Scheme, following 
the finalisation of its triennial actuarial valuation at 31 March 
2009. As a result, the total annual deficit contributions 
payable in respect of the Group’s defined benefit scheme 
have increased by £1.2m to £1.9m.
Treasury
The Group has a centralised treasury function to manage 
foreign exchange and interest rate risk following guidelines 
laid down by the Board. Derivative instruments are used 
solely to mitigate risks.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial 
instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and 
liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for 
managing each of these risks.
Interest Rate Risk >
 Interest rate swaps are used to generate the desired 
interest profile and to manage exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations. The Group’s policy is that normally between 
60% and 90% of the Group’s borrowings should be for 
fixed periods in excess of one year up to a maximum of 
five years. At 30 June 2011, 55% (2010: 85%) of the 
Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates.
Foreign Currency Risk >
 The Group is exposed to two principal types of foreign 
currency risk: transaction risk and translation risk. 
Transactional exposures arise from operating units 
selling and/or purchasing goods and services in 
currencies other than their reporting currency. Where 
these exposures are large or other than short-term, they 
are hedged by the use of forward contracts. The Group 
has a policy to settle inter-company trading balances on 
a monthly basis to minimise foreign currency exposure.
 Translation exposure arises on the re-translation of 
overseas subsidiary companies’ profits and net assets 
into sterling for financial reporting purposes. Overseas 
trading is mainly US Dollar-linked and to a lesser extent, 
Euro. Exposures arising from the translation of overseas 
profits are not hedged. Translation exposures in respect 
of the net assets in overseas countries are managed 
by maintaining a percentage of net debt in overseas 
currencies to mitigate the effect of currency fluctuations. 
This is achieved by either borrowing in the relevant 
currency or entering into long-term currency swaps.
 At 30 June 2011, gross debt was held in the following 
currencies: US Dollars 82% (2010: 78%), Euros 7% 
(2010: 10%), Sterling 11% (2010: 12%) after taking into 
account long-term currency swaps.
Liquidity Risk >
 The Group’s objective is to ensure it has committed 
facilities with sufficient headroom to finance funding 
requirements for the foreseeable future. At the year end, 
the Group had undrawn committed facilities of £51m and 
held cash of £18.3m. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Corporate Social Responsibility
Sustainability in World Agriculture
Genus plays a key part in the world’s agricultural economy 
and delivers many benefits to global society. Genus’ unique 
position in the supply of superior natural animal genetics 
enables the world’s farmers and food producers to ensure 
the supply of quality products with increasing output at 
improved production efficiencies. In the context of an ever 
increasing world population and decreasing resources 
available for food production, Genus plays an increasingly 
important social and economic role in the efficient 
production of quality foods.
Genus is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
and individual behaviour and actively considers the 
economic, social and environmental impacts of the Group’s 
activities, wherever it operates in the world. By acting with 
the highest standards of business conduct, Genus earns 
the trust of its customers, shareholders, colleagues, 
suppliers, regulators and the communities in which it 
operates. Maintaining these standards is vital to the 
continued success and development of the Group.
All companies in the Genus Group follow procedures that 
are compliant with local laws and regulations and in many 
cases the Group’s procedures exceed local requirements. 
The Genus Board has overall responsibility for corporate 
responsibility, assessing the needs of Genus’ stakeholders 
regularly, and delegates day to day management of corporate 
responsibility issues to the Company’s Operating Board in 
conjunction with regional management. 
The Genus approach to corporate responsibility applies to 
the following key areas: the environment, our employees, 
health and safety, our stakeholder relationships and our 
community. The Genus principles of corporate 
responsibility apply to all our employees and set the 
minimum standard for their behaviour.
The Environment
Genus recognises that concern for the environment is 
an essential part of its business operations and seeks to 
minimise risk to the environment by effective management 
of the Group’s activities. Genus is committed to conducting 
its business in a manner that is sensitive to the environmental 
needs of the communities in which we operate. Our locations 
integrate environmental management into their operational 
systems and procedures: monitoring and reporting on 
environmental performance is an integral part of the 
Group’s operations and a key part of the Group’s risk 
management programme. 
Genus operates an active policy of environmental compliance 
requiring as a minimum compliance with the laws and 
regulations applicable to its business in each of the countries 
in which it operates. In many cases, the Group’s compliance 
exceeds local requirements. We assess environmental risks 
associated with existing and new facilities and establish 
controls to ensure that any risks remain at an acceptable 
level. Employees at our facilities receive a high level of training 
in environmental compliance matters and comprehensive 
environmental protocols are in operation at our facilities that 
are subject to independent checks. 
Our Employees
Genus places considerable value on the involvement and 
commitment of its employees. Our staff play a vital role in 
building a sustainable business and their skills, qualities 
and well-being underpin the Company’s success.
Genus’ employment policies respect the individual regardless 
of sex, age, race or religion. Full and fair consideration is given 
to applications for employment from disabled people and the 
services of employees who become disabled are retained 
wherever possible.
“ Genus plays an increasingly important 
social and economic role in the efficient 
production of quality foods.”

Training, career development and promotion opportunities 
are provided throughout the Group, for example via the 
internet based Genus Global University. Our training and 
development programmes are designed both to equip 
employees with the necessary skills for their current roles and 
to enhance their careers. Employees are actively encouraged 
to attain a broad understanding of the Group’s businesses to 
give a strong base in the Company’s culture and ethics.
The Group has a well established structure to communicate 
with employees at every level to encourage their involvement 
and interest in the Group’s performance and future activities. 
This is achieved through formal and informal meetings, 
internal communications, the Group’s Genus World 
magazine and the Group’s intranet.
We require all employees to act in an ethical manner both 
within the Group and in dealings with other organisations, 
and to comply with all applicable laws and Group policies. 
Health & Safety
Genus is committed to providing safe systems of work 
for its employees in all countries in which it operates and 
pro-actively monitors compliance with local regulations. 
This commitment is supported by a comprehensive training 
regime for the Group’s employees. Genus has developed 
best practice farm and animal handling protocols that are 
deployed at all farm locations. These deal with the potential 
dangers of working with livestock and operating equipment 
and the provision of a safe working environment. The 
monitoring and reporting on the Group’s health and safety 
performance is an integral part of the Group’s operations 
and a key part of the Group’s risk management programme. 
Maintaining a consistently safe and healthy workplace for our 
people requires effective management. Under the supervision 
of a new Global Health & Safety Officer and strengthened 
regional health and safety teams that were appointed in the 
period, we operate a pro-active network of health and safety 
personnel in our global facilities. Knowledge and experience 
is shared between facilities with the aim of cross-fertilising 
best practice and ensuring consistently high standards of 
safety across the Group. The Global Health and Safety Officer 
is responsible for monitoring and reporting adherence by the 
Company to the Group’s health and safety protocols and 
regular inspections are made of the Company’s sites by 
global health and safety staff. 
Our Stakeholder Relationships
Customers
Genus aims to provide products and services of the highest 
quality and technical standards appropriate to our customers’ 
own requirements. At all times, Genus takes all reasonable 
steps to ensure the safety and quality of the products and 
services that it provides, including compliance with all 
applicable regulatory requirements. 
Suppliers
Genus is committed to working with suppliers in mutually 
beneficial ways, and, so far as is practicable, requires that 
suppliers and contractors act in accordance with Genus’ 
values and policies.
Our Community
As a responsible member of the communities in which it 
operates, Genus actively encourages its operating companies 
to engage positively with the local community in their areas 
of operation and in all aspects of community relations. At a 
Group level, the Company sponsors the Farm Business 
Awards and the John Beckett Foundation, a charity that 
provides business scholarships to young farmers. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

The Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group and currently comprises three 
Executive Directors, the Non-Executive Chairman and three other Non-Executive Directors. Biographies of the Directors 
appear on page 34. The Board considers that the Directors have a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring 
effective judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resourcing and standards of conduct which are vital to 
the success of the Group. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are considered independent. 
The Board met eight times in the period of this report and has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval 
including setting and monitoring Group strategy, reviewing trading performance, ensuring adequate funding, examining 
major capital expenditure projects and acquisition possibilities, approval of material contracts, formulating policy on key 
issues and reporting to shareholders. Additional Board meetings can be held if necessary to consider matters that are time 
critical. The Board delegates authority to the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and the Chief Operating Officers 
and their regional management teams to make day-to-day operating decisions to ensure the proper management of the 
Group’s business and implementation of the Board’s approved strategy. In turn, they recommend strategy and plans to 
the Board, make routine decisions on resources and ensure that robust operational and financial controls are in place. 
Members of the regional management teams are invited on a regular basis to make presentations to the Board and 
participate in certain aspects of strategic reviews.
The Chairman, Bob Lawson, has primary responsibility for running the Board. The Chief Executive, Richard Wood, 
has executive responsibility for achieving operational and financial targets and for executing the Group’s strategy. Clear 
divisions of accountability and responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive have been agreed by the 
Board and are set out in writing. The Company’s Senior Non-Executive Director is Nigel Turner who is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Group 
Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel and to 
independent professional advice as required. In addition, the Company ensures that the Directors receive appropriate 
training as and when necessary. To ensure the Board is able to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and

the Board and making recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes, giving full consideration to succession 
planning for Directors and other senior executives taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the Company

recommending to the Board the Company’s research and development strategy that will allow Genus to extend its leading 
position in livestock breeding by scientific innovation and monitoring progress of individual projects. The Committee met 
three times in the period.
Terms of Reference
The terms of reference for the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee and Science 
Committee are available on the Company’s website: www.genusplc.com.
Board Performance Evaluation
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of the Company. Each year the Board undertakes a formal and 
rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors. The Board, led by the 
Chairman and supported by the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel, carried out in the period an evaluation of 
performance using a system based on the use of a questionnaire and one-to-one meetings between the Chairman and the 
individual Directors. The Board met to discuss the conclusions of the evaluation exercise.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011
42 Corporate Governance
The performance evaluation exercise focused on matters such as the effectiveness, expertise and dynamics of the Board 
together with matters such as Board support, strategic and operational risk management and internal controls, succession 
planning and management of human resources, corporate governance and the effectiveness of the Board’s Committees 
and individual Directors. 
The evaluation exercise showed the Board and its Committees to be working well. Certain recommendations for 
improvement have been agreed and will be implemented in the current financial year. The Board is satisfied that each 
Director has sufficient skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company to fulfil their role; continues to contribute 
effectively and demonstrates commitment to their role. 
The Chairman ensures that the Directors continually update their skills and the knowledge and familiarity with the Company 
required to fulfil their role both on the Board and on Board Committees. The Company provides the necessary resources 
for developing and updating its Directors’ knowledge and capabilities.
Under the direction of the Chairman, the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel’s responsibilities include ensuring 
good information flows within the Board and its Committees and between senior management and Non-Executive 
Directors, as well as facilitating induction and assisting with professional development as required. All Directors receive 
induction on joining the Board. 
As part of their role as members of a unitary Board, Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop 
proposals on strategy. Non-Executive Directors scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and 
objectives and monitor the reporting of performance. They satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and 
that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible. They are responsible for determining 
appropriate levels of remuneration of Executive Directors and have a prime role in appointing, and where necessary 
removing, Executive Directors, and in succession planning.
During the period, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met regularly as a group without the Executive Directors 
present. Under the leadership of the Senior Independent Director, the Non-Executive Directors have also met without the 
Chairman present to discuss appropriate issues and appraise the Chairman’s performance, taking account of the views 
expressed by the Executive Directors.
Shareholder Relations
The Company has a continuing dialogue with institutional investors through a planned programme of investor relations. 
The Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director meet frequently with representatives of institutional shareholders and 
private client brokers. Feedback from these meetings (including that prepared by independent brokers and advisors) is 
discussed at Board meetings enabling all Directors, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, to understand the views 
of major shareholders. The Chairman and Senior Non-Executive Director also maintain contact with major shareholders. 
The Board takes the opportunity at the Annual General Meeting to meet and communicate with private and institutional 
investors and welcomes their involvement. The Business Review on pages 4 to 33 provides a detailed review of the 
Group’s performance and future developments. Bob Lawson, Mike Buzzacott, Nigel Turner and Barry Furr will be 
available to answer questions as Chairmen of the Board and its Committees at the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 10 November 2011. 
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Board has applied the Code by establishing a structured risk management system which identifies, evaluates and 
prioritises risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and actively reviews control and mitigation activities. The system 
applies on an ongoing basis to each business unit of the Group worldwide, divisional management boards, the Company’s 
Operating Board and Main Board. The Company’s management structure is described further below. The Main Board 
has continued to enhance the Group’s risk management system during the year by each of the regional businesses 
conducting externally facilitated risk management workshops, the results of which were reviewed by the Company’s 
Operating Board and Main Board. During the period, the Group’s internal audit activities were outsourced to Ernst & Young LLP 
who were tasked to audit specific key business risks identified by the Company’s risk management system and agreed by 
the Board. In addition, specialist third party consultants are tasked from time to time to perform an internal audit of a specific 
key business risk, for example the Company’s compliance with environmental and health and safety requirements and the 
Company’s business continuity plans. Subsequent to the end of the financial year, the Company appointed a Head of 
Internal Audit to bring in-house the overall management of internal audit and increase the overall resource applied to 
internal audit activities.

The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with the Code, the Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control and the Group’s financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. 
This assessment considered all significant aspects of internal control arising during the period covered by this report. This 
included the work programme of the Company’s internal audit function, and management reports prepared at the time of 
the approval of the Company’s interim and final reports and financial statements, to consider whether significant risks were 
identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses had arisen and the remedial action 
that had been taken. The management reports were based on the output of detailed risk workshops conducted by the 
Group centrally and regionally in the year, and responses received to comprehensive questionnaires issued to each of the 
Group’s business units and regional management. In addition, together with the risk events and controls that had been 
recognised through the Group’s other means of day-to-day risk management, namely the divisional management boards, 
the Operating Board, the Main Board and insurers were considered. Whilst areas are routinely identified for improvement, 
during the course of its review of the system of internal control the Board has neither identified nor been advised of any 
failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be material or significant. 
The key elements of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems are as follows:
Management of Business Risk
The Board is ultimately responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Group. The key risks identified 
as part of this process and the mitigating actions to control such risks are summarised on page 31. The Board, the Chief 
Operating Officers and their regional management teams are tasked with the responsibility for the ongoing identification, 
assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of risks that ensure the significant risks affecting the Company are 
properly identified and managed. Further enhancements were made in the Company’s management of business risk in the 
year by the constructive use of Group wide externally facilitated risk management workshops. 
Management Structure
Authority to operate the Group’s subsidiary companies is delegated to the Chief Operating Officers and their regional 
management teams within limits set by the Board. The appointment of executives to the most senior positions within the 
Group requires the approval of the Board. Formal empowerment levels, which set out delegation of authority, authorisation 
levels and other control procedures are in place. These procedures are supplemented by operating standards set by the 
Chief Operating Officers and their regional management, as required for the type of business and the geographical location 
of each subsidiary.
An Operating Board, chaired by the Chief Executive and comprising the Group Finance Director, the Chief Operating 
Officers, the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel, the Group Financial Controller and other executives by 
invitation meets on a regular basis to review the Group’s performance against its budget, long and short-term strategies, 
risk management and other key business issues, indicators and activities. In addition, monthly business review meetings 
are held between each regional business unit and the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Company 
Secretary & General Counsel and the Group Financial Controller.
Information and Financial Reporting Systems
The Group’s current planning and financial reporting procedures include detailed operational budgets for the year 
ahead together with the preparation of three year strategic plans, which the Board reviews and approves. Performance is 
monitored and relevant action taken throughout the year through monthly reporting of financial results, key performance 
indicators and variances, updated full year forecasts and information on key business risk areas. The main features of internal 
control and risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing consolidated accounts are segregation of duties, 
a robust consolidation and reporting software system, various levels of management review and reconciliation processes.
Quality and Integrity of Personnel
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards enhanced by post-recruitment 
training courses. High quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment as is the maintenance of 
high ethical standards.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011
44 Corporate Governance
Investment Appraisal
Capital expenditure is regulated by a budgetary process and predetermined authorisation levels. For expenditure above 
specific levels, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board. Due diligence work is carried out if a business 
is to be acquired. Major projects and all acquisitions are subject to post-implementation reviews on a timely basis. Areas of 
under performance against expectations and any significant overspends are investigated and corrective action is taken 
where required.

Code. The terms of reference are considered annually by the Audit Committee and are then referred to the Board for approval. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires that at least one member of the Committee should have recent and relevant 
financial experience and the Company fulfils this requirement. All members of the Committee are expected to be 
financially literate. 
The principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee are:
monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s  >
financial performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained therein;
reviewing the Group’s financial systems, internal financial controls and the Group’s internal control and risk management  >
systems;
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function in the context of the Group’s overall risk  >
management system;

meeting, in relation to the appointment of the external auditors and the approval of the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors;
reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process,  >
taking into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements;
reviewing the policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services, taking into account  >
relevant professional and regulatory guidance and monitoring compliance; 
ensuring the Company maintains suitable arrangements for employees to raise matters of concern in confidence; and >
reviewing the Company’s systems and controls for the prevention of bribery. >
 
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of which it considers 
that action or improvement is needed, and make recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet at least three times a year and has an agenda linked to events in the Group’s 
financial calendar in the period. Each Audit Committee member has the right to require reports on matters relevant to its 
terms of reference in addition to the cyclical items.
The Audit Committee invites the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller, the Head of 
Internal Audit and senior representatives of the external auditors to attend its meetings. The Chairman is not a member of 
the Committee but does attend its meetings at the invitation of the Committee. Other members of management are invited 
to present such reports as are required for the Committee to discharge its duties.
Overview of the Actions Taken by the Audit Committee to Discharge its Duties
In the year ended 30 June 2011 and up to the date of this report the Audit Committee has:
reviewed the Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report and the Financial Statements in the 2011 Interim Report.  >
As part of this review the Committee received reports from management on significant issues affecting the Financial 
Statements, and reports from the external auditors on their audit of the Annual Report and Financial Statements and 
review of the Interim Report;
considered the output from the Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks; >

External Auditors
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the independence, objectivity and 
performance of the external auditors, and for making a recommendation to the Board regarding the appointment 
of external auditors on an annual basis.
The Group’s external auditors, Deloitte LLP, were first appointed as external auditor of the Company for the period ended 
30 June 2006 following a formal tender process.
The Group’s policy on non-audit services sets out services which the external auditors will and will not be allowed to provide 
to the Group, addressing both the nature of services and monetary thresholds requiring approval by the Group Finance 
Director and the Audit Committee Chairman. Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) are retained for tax advisory and tax compliance 
services. Note 8 to the Financial Statements sets out the fees paid to Deloitte during the year for audit services, audit 
related services and non-audit services. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the use of Deloitte for such services does 
not impair their independence as the Group’s external auditors. The Company’s Non-Audit Services by Auditors Policy can 
be found on the Company’s website www.genusplc.com.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit Committee has reviewed a report from management on the 
effectiveness of the external audit work based on questionnaires completed by key financial staff and members of the Audit 
Committee covering matters such as:
the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit plan; >
the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements;  >
the content of the external auditors’ reports; and >
cost effectiveness. >
As a consequence of its satisfaction with the results of the activities outlined above, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that the external auditors be reappointed for a further year. A new senior statutory audit 
partner has been selected by the Company due to the previous senior audit partner having held office for five years.
Internal Audit Function
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function in the 
context of the Group’s overall risk management system. During the period the Company’s internal audit function had been 
outsourced to Ernst & Young LLP. Subsequent to the end of the financial year, the Company appointed a Head of Internal 
Audit to bring in-house the overall management of internal audit and increase the overall resource applied to internal audit 
activities. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee has reviewed the following in the period:
the scope, terms of reference, resource and activities of the internal audit function within the Group; >
internal audit’s plans and its achievement of the planned activity; >
the internal auditors’ reports on the results of individual audits and other significant findings, the adequacy  >
of management’s response and the timeliness of resolution of the matters raised in such reports; 
the level and nature of non-audit activity performed by internal audit; and >
the performance of the internal auditors. >
The Group’s Whistleblowing Policy contains arrangements for the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel to receive, 
in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing issues and related matters for reporting to 
the Audit Committee.

Letter to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
5 September 2011
Dear Shareholder
As highlighted in the Business Review, the year ended 30 June 2011 has been one in which Genus has continued to make 
substantial progress.
The increase in profitability achieved during the year, and progress delivered in further establishing operational capabilities 
in a number of our key long-term strategic markets, demonstrates the strength of our business model and, in particular, the 
effective leadership skills of our management team. 
In light of executive management’s achievements during the year, the Remuneration Committee considers the remuneration 
paid to our executive management team to reflect fairly their performance during the year. The annual bonus paid out towards 
the maximum level reflecting an increase in profit before tax of 19%, reduction in net debt of 15% and the substantial progress 
achieved in relation to delivering the Group’s strategic objectives that are described in the Business Review section of this 
Annual Report. The 2008 Performance Share Plan award vested at 91% of the total award as a result of annualised growth in 
adjusted EPS of 12% over the three year performance period, that was towards the maximum vesting criteria attached to the 
award. Given economic circumstances over the past three years, this was considered to be an exceptional result delivered by 
the executive management team.
The Remuneration Report that follows sets out the remuneration policy that will operate during the current year and 
includes details of the remuneration package of our new Chief Executive, Karim Bitar. The Committee believes that the 
policy achieves its overriding objective of enabling the recruitment, retention and motivation of an executive management 
team capable of taking the business forward through its next phase of development. In addition, given that a substantial 
proportion of the total package is linked to appropriately challenging performance conditions, includes clawback provisions 
for annual incentive pay in the event of misstatement of Group results and has a substantial weighting towards long-term 
performance, the Committee is comfortable that the current arrangements do not inadvertently encourage undue risk 
taking and that its policy motivates behaviours that are in the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.
As a result, the Committee looks forward to your support of our remuneration policy at the 2011 AGM.
Yours sincerely
Nigel Turner

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (‘Companies Act’) and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and also 
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. The report also describes how the 
Board has applied the principles relating to Directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code. In accordance 
with the regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to 
be held on 10 November 2011.
The Companies Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited 
and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) which is constituted in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within 
agreed terms of reference, on an overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors, the Chief Operating Officers of 
the Company and the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel. The full terms of reference of the Committee are 
available on the Company’s website at www.genusplc.com.
The Committee comprises independent Non-Executive Directors Nigel Turner (Chairman), Mike Buzzacott and Barry Furr, 
and also the Company’s Non-Executive Chairman, Bob Lawson, who was considered by the Board to be independent at 
the time of his appointment to the Board. John Hawkins, the former Company Chairman, also served on the Committee 
during the year.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board and no Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
During the year to 30 June 2011 the Committee met five times and the following matters were covered:
review of the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and the remuneration arrangements for the Executive  >
Directors and the Chief Operating Officers of the Company;
review of the salary levels for the Executive Directors and the Chief Operating Officers of the Company; >
agreement of the terms of the Executive Annual Bonus Plan and of the individual bonuses payable in the light of the  >
Group’s and individual’s performance;
agreement of the individual long-term share incentive awards under the Company’s 2004 Performance Share Plan  >
and 2004 Executive Share Option Plan;
review of the performance measures and targets to apply to these awards; >
approval of the vesting levels of long-term share incentive awards; >
approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the financial year ending 30 June 2010;  >
review of the current investor guidelines on executive remuneration; and >
remuneration arrangements for the new Chief Executive. >
In determining the Directors’ remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted the Chief Executive about its proposals. 
The Committee also appointed Aon Hewitt Limited (operating through the brand Hewitt New Bridge Street) to provide 
benchmarking advice on the remuneration packages applicable to the Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors and 
the Chief Operating Officers of the Company. Aon Hewitt Limited did not provide other services to the Company during 
the year. 
Remuneration Policy
The Company’s executive and senior management remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain 
individuals of the high calibre required to maintain the Group’s position as a market leader and to reward them for 
enhancing value to shareholders.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011
50 Corporate Governance
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination 
of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee. The main principles are to:
ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level given the calibre and experience of each individual and after  >
taking due account of salary levels in appropriate external comparators;
support a high performance culture and align long-term rewards with shareholders’ interests; >
maintain an appropriate balance of fixed and performance related pay that rewards for the delivery of the Company’s  >
short, medium and longer-term objectives;
to have short, medium and long-term performance targets that are specific, measurable and fully aligned with the  >
Company’s business objectives; and
ensure that the overall package reflects market practice and takes into account levels of remuneration elsewhere  >
in the Group.
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management 
should be based on corporate and individual performance related targets that are challenging and support the Company’s 
strategy and objectives. The policy is intended to create a strong link between business performance and reward and to 
generate value to shareholders, employees and the Company. 
Remuneration policy is reviewed regularly and the Committee is satisfied that the current policy does not encourage 
undue risk taking (e.g. due to the range of performance metrics used in the annual bonus plan, the operation of clawback 
provisions and the proportion of total remuneration that is linked to long-term performance). 
In setting the Executive Directors’ remuneration the Committee took into account the pay and employment conditions 
applicable across the Group in the reported period and no increases were made in the period to 30 June 2011 to Directors’ 
base salary compared against the prior year.
The following table provides a summary of the key elements of the Company’s remuneration package: 
Element Purpose Operation
Salary To provide competitive fixed 
remuneration that will attract and 
retain key employees and reflect their 
experience and position in the Company.
Reviewed annually. Benchmarked against relevant 
market comparators as appropriate reflecting the 
size and nature of the role, individual performance, 
increases awarded to other employees, Company 
performance and broader economic conditions.
Annual bonus Incentivises achievement of annual 
objectives which support the short-term 
performance goals of the Company.
Maximum bonus potential is normally set at 100% 
of basic salary.
Bonus awards are subject to achievement 
against challenging profit, net debt reduction and 
personal objectives. During the year under review, 
exceptionally, the maximum bonus was increased 
to 150% of basic salary with the additional bonus 
subject to challenging strategic targets and deferral 
of any additional bonus earned for a period of one 
year. Payments under the annual bonus plan are 
subject to a clawback in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Company’s financial results.
Long-term share incentives Performance share plan incentivises 
executives to achieve superior returns to 
shareholders over a three year period, to 
retain key individuals and align interests 
with shareholders.
Annual awards are normally made under the plan 
equal to 100% of basic salary to the Executive 
Directors and other senior management and are 
based on the achievement of EPS targets over a 
three year performance period.

Balance Between Fixed and Variable Pay
Based on the remuneration structure that will apply in the Company’s 2011/12 financial year, for achievement of target 
levels of performance, more than 40% of total remuneration will be delivered from business performance related elements 
of our remuneration structure. Should the maximum performance targets be achieved, this proportion increases to 
over 60%. 
The variable elements of remuneration are linked to the key financial and strategic measures of performance that are 
used internally to monitor the performance of the business and, in turn, are considered to underpin value creation 
for shareholders. 
The following charts show the total remuneration packages for the new Chief Executive (Karim Bitar) and the Group Finance 
Director split between fixed pay and pay at risk at both ‘target’ and ‘maximum’ levels of performance. For the new Chief 
Executive, the charts consider the Performance Share Plan award described on page 55 but exclude other transitional 
arrangements that were adopted in relation to facilitating his recruitment which are described on pages 54 and 55. 
Base Salary
The Executive Directors’ basic salary is reviewed by the Committee prior to the beginning of each financial year, taking into 
account individual and corporate performance, an assessment of comparator companies, wider economic conditions and 
levels of increases applicable to other employees in the Company. 
The current salary levels of the Executive Directors (with effect from 1 July 2011) are as follows:
Richard Wood: £450,000 (no increase) >
John Worby: £300,000 (increased from £275,000) >
In setting a revised salary level for John Worby, the Committee was mindful of the need to retain a highly regarded Group 
Finance Director at an important time in the development of the Company that has also included a number of changes 
in the Group’s leadership team. With regard to the specific level of salary that was set, this took due account of salary 
levels in international companies of comparable size, and complexity, and more particularly, the experience, calibre and 
performance in post of the individual. 
With regard to the recent appointment of Karim Bitar, who will replace Richard Wood as Chief Executive from 
30 September 2011, his salary has been set at £500,000 with this level of salary considered appropriate to recruit a 
high calibre candidate with the relevant skills and experience considered necessary to lead Genus through its next 
phase of development.

Annual Bonus
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid. The maximum 
bonus and the proportion paid for on-target performance are considered in the light of market practice for companies of a 
similar size and industry sector. Bonus potential is normally set at a maximum of 100% of basic salary dependent on stretching 
targets relating to profit, net debt reduction and challenging personal objectives. A maximum of 60% of the bonus opportunity 
is normally based on corporate performance as measured by profit before tax, 20% of the bonus opportunity is normally 
based on the achievement of net debt targets and the remaining 20% of the bonus opportunity is normally based on the 
achievement of personal objectives. 50% of salary is normally payable for on-target performance.
For the year ended 30 June 2011 the Committee determined that 86% of the profit before tax performance measure 
included in the annual bonus plan had been achieved (following growth of 19% in profit before tax on the prior year’s result 
which was towards the top end of the range of targets set) and that 100% of the net debt targets had been achieved 
(based on a 15% reduction in net debt which exceeded the maximum target set) and 100% of the short-term personal 
objectives had been met. This resulted in bonuses becoming payable at 91% of salary.
As disclosed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, exceptionally, an additional bonus opportunity of up to 50% 
of salary was available in respect of the year under review. This additional bonus opportunity was considered appropriate 
as a result of a number of key strategic objectives being identified by the Board as crucial to the long-term development of 
the Company. Accordingly, the Committee set an additional bonus opportunity for the year under review to provide a clear 
separate incentive to motivate the Executive Directors to make substantial progress in respect of these objectives.
With regard to the Chief Executive, his strategic objectives included assisting the Board in relation to succession planning 
(with regard to his own position and in key roles in the Company’s emerging markets); the strategic development of the 
Company (with the specific targets relating to the achievements described in the Business Review section of this Annual 
Report); people development targets and the growth of shareholder value. The Group Finance Director’s strategic objectives 
included the strategic development of the Company (as noted for the Chief Executive above, see the Business Review 
section of this Annual Report); targeted financial and management reporting system improvements; people development 
targets and more effective investor relations. 
The Committee determined that the Executive Directors each achieved their specific targets in full. Payments under this 
exceptional criteria shall be deferred for a period of one year save in the case of Richard Wood due to his retirement on 
30 September 2011. 
With regard to the bonus arrangements operating during the current year, the maximum annual bonus available under the 
plan will revert to 100% of salary for each Executive Director and the normal bonus structure described above will apply in 
respect of Karim Bitar and John Worby.
Given Richard Wood is to retire on 30 September 2011, a bonus structure will apply that reflects the period of the current 
financial year during which he will serve as Chief Executive, with a maximum bonus payable of £100,000. 
 
Share Awards & Share Options
Long-term share awards are granted under the Genus plc 2004 Performance Share Plan (the ‘Plan’). Under the Plan, 
incentives can take the form of conditional share awards or nil cost options with vesting determined based on achievement 
against challenging growth in adjusted earnings per share performance normally tested over a three year period. With 
regard to the awards granted to Executive Directors since 15 October 2008, including those granted during the year under 
review, the performance targets that must be satisfied for vesting are shown in the table below:
 
Per annum growth in adjusted EPS* % of award vesting** Per annum growth in adjusted EPS* % of award vesting**
<RPI +4% Nil RPI +7% 70%
RPI +4% 40% RPI +8% 80%
RPI +5% 50% RPI +9% 90%
RPI +6% 60% RPI +10% 100%
* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate. 
** A linear scale will be applied when performance falls between the bands.

For grants of share awards made on and prior to 15 October 2008 the following performance conditions apply: 
Per annum growth in adjusted EPS* % of award vesting** Per annum growth in adjusted EPS* % of award vesting**
<RPI +3% Nil RPI +6% 70%

RPI +5% 60% RPI +9% 100%
* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate. 
** A linear scale will be applied when performance falls between the bands.
Prior to the vesting of any grant, the Remuneration Committee reviews the basis of calculation of growth in adjusted EPS 
to satisfy itself that the performance conditions have been met. The Committee uses audited adjusted EPS as the basis 
for determining any vesting.
With regard to the awards that are anticipated being granted in the current financial year, the Group Finance Director will 
receive an award over shares with a market value of 100% of salary with the new Chief Executive, reflecting what was 
agreed at the time of his appointment, receiving an award over shares with a market value of 125% of salary (see page 54).
The Committee has determined that the performance targets applying to the 2011 awards to the new Chief Executive 
and the Group Finance Director will be toughened relative to those applying to awards granted in prior years. The level of 
performance required for full vesting is being increased at the same time as reducing the proportion of awards vesting at 
the threshold performance level which will fall from 40% of an award to 30% of an award. The full range of revised targets 
are shown in the table below: 
Per annum growth in adjusted EPS * % of award vesting ** Per annum growth in adjusted EPS * % of award vesting **
<RPI +4% Nil RPI +7% 60%
RPI +4% 30% RPI +8% 70%

* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate. 
** A linear scale will be applied when performance falls between the bands.
Details of awards made to Directors are shown in the table of Directors’ interests on page 57 and details of the 
performance criteria for the Company’s share award and share option schemes are also included in note 29 to the 
Financial Statements.
Executive Share Option Plan
Under the Company’s 2004 Executive Share Option Plan, grants are made to incentivise middle management (Executive 
Directors and senior management do not participate in this plan) and the vesting of options is also conditional on achievement 
of growth in adjusted earnings per share exceeding RPI +5% over a three year period. It is the Company’s policy to phase the 
granting of share options rather than to award them in a single large block to any individual. 
Benefits-in-Kind
The Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car or car allowance, life assurance and private 
medical insurance. In lieu of Company pension contributions, the Company has agreed to pay Richard Wood and 
John Worby a taxable pension allowance of 15% and 12% of basic salary per annum respectively.
Reflecting what was agreed in facilitating his appointment, Karim Bitar, will receive a taxable pension allowance of 25% 
of salary, a car allowance, life assurance and private medical insurance. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Note: John Hawkins was Non-Executive Chairman for the period 1 July 2010 to 11 November 2010.
It is the Company’s policy for the notice periods of Executive Directors normally to be of twelve months or less. The Executive 
Directors’ contracts do not include liquidated damages clauses that provide for a predetermined level of compensation in the 
event of termination. In the event of termination, the Committee’s policy is that payments on termination should reflect the 
circumstances that prevail at that time, also taking account of Directors’ duty to mitigate. There are no enhanced provisions in 
the event of a change of control. Executive Directors’ contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available 
for inspection at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 10 November 2011.
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board having 
regard to the time devoted to the Company’s affairs. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company’s 
incentive schemes or pension schemes. Their appointment is for a fixed term of three years and is subject to one month’s 
notice of termination being given by either the Company or the Non-Executive Director and to annual re-election at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The current total fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors are as follows:
Chairman:  £140,000 >
Other Non-Executive Directors: £47,000 >
The fee payable to the Chairman was benchmarked against companies of similar size and complexity with the assistance 
of Hewitt New Bridge Street and is considered appropriate by the Committee to recruit a high calibre candidate with the 
relevant skills and experience considered necessary to chair Genus through its next phase of development. The fees 
payable to the other Non-Executive Directors have also been reviewed taking into account practice in companies of a 
comparable size, internationality and complexity and, more particularly, the anticipated time commitment of the roles as the 
Company moves forward. The revised total fees payable have been set at £47,000 from 1 July 2011 (inclusive of the fees 
payable for chairmanship of the relevant Board Committees described in the Corporate Governance Report for each 
Non-Executive Director). 
Recruitment of Karim Bitar
In order to facilitate the recruitment of Karim Bitar, who was appointed as a Director of the Company from 1 September 2011 
and shall become Chief Executive with effect from 30 September 2011, the Committee agreed to compensate him for the 
forfeiture of outstanding incentive awards with his former employer on joining Genus.
In determining the level and form of compensation, the Committee took into account the extent to which the performance 
conditions applying to the relevant incentives had been met or were likely to be met mindful of the Committee’s duty not to 
pay more than was necessary to secure his recruitment.

Accordingly, the award granted to Karim Bitar in 2011 by his former employer will be replaced with the Performance Share 
Plan award described below. This award, being performance-related, is subject to consistent terms with the award to be 
granted to the Group Finance Director in relation to the current financial year and is the sole performance-related share 
award that Karim Bitar will receive in 2011. The quantum of the award was set broadly to reflect the expected value of the 
award forfeited.
The other outstanding awards granted to Karim Bitar in 2009 and 2010 by his former employer were assessed by the 
Committee to determine the extent to which there was significant value in the awards (each of which was subject to a two 
year performance period running from the financial year immediately prior to the year in which the award was granted and 
a further one year holding period). As a result of this assessment, the Committee considered it appropriate to replace the 
outstanding awards with a restricted stock award to compensate for the value being forfeited on leaving employment. The 
restricted stock award will be granted with a vesting profile to mirror that of the awards granted by his previous employer. 
The award is subject to continued employment to the relevant vesting dates otherwise the relevant portion of the award 
will lapse.
The final element of compensation provided was in respect of his anticipated loss of annual bonus entitlement for the part 
year served prior to leaving his former employer. Again this payment was based on the Committee’s assessment of the 
likely value forgone to the date of leaving and will be the subject of a cash payment in the Company’s September payroll.
In summary, the compensation agreed with Karim Bitar to facilitate his recruitment was as follows:
1. An award of shares under the Performance Share Plan over shares worth 125% of salary (subject to the rules of 
the Plan) and the performance targets set out on page 53 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report;
2. A restricted stock award (granted using provision 9.4.2 (2) of the Listing Rules) over 77,259 shares. Of this award, 
36,685 shares vest on 31 January 2012 with 40,574 vesting on 31 January 2013 with each part of the award subject 
to continued employment; and
3. A cash payment to be made in September 2011 of £163,000 subject to being employed at the payment date.
In relation to the above, it was also agreed that Karim Bitar would retain at least half of the after tax number of shares 
comprising his restricted share award following vesting until such time as a shareholding in the Company of 100% of 
salary is achieved.
As required under the relevant legislation, the other key features of the restricted stock award described above are as follows:
The award will be granted at the time of the award of shares under the Performance Share Plan; >
The award is non-pensionable and non-transferable (other than on death);  >
If Karim Bitar ceases employment with the Group before any part of the award vests the relevant part of the award will  >
lapse, unless he leaves in certain good leaver situations where the award will vest on cessation;
The award will vest in full on a change of control of the Company. The award may also vest early in the event of a  >
demerger, special dividend or other similar event which, in the Committee’s opinion, materially affects the price of the 
Company’s shares. The award will not, unless the Committee decides otherwise, vest on an internal reorganisation but 
will instead be exchanged for an equivalent award over shares in the new holding company; 
In addition to the shares vesting under the award, the award will provide for a payment (in cash and/or shares) of an  >
amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on those shares over the vesting period;
The award will not confer any shareholder rights on Karim Bitar unless and until it vests;  >
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital, a demerger, a special dividend or other similar event which  >
materially affects the price of the Company’s shares, the award may be adjusted in such manner as the Committee sees 
fit; and
The terms of the award may be amended in such manner as the Committee may determine, provided that amendments  >
to Karim Bitar’s benefit may only be made with the prior consent of shareholders.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011

The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies 
and that this can help broaden the skills and experience of a Director. Upon appointment as the Group Finance Director of

Total 195,457 292,465
The targets applying to the above awards are set out on page 52. Following testing of the performance targets applying 
to (1) and (2) above (based on the Company’s audited results) the Committee determined the proportion of each award 
eligible to vest at the award’s normal vesting date.
With regard to (1) above, the Remuneration Committee declared a vesting percentage of 100% in relation to the Company’s 
earnings per share performance leading to the vesting of 154,639 ordinary shares in the Company in September 2010. 
Actual adjusted EPS growth over the performance period was 11.3% above RPI on an annualised basis which exceeded 
the maximum annual performance level required under the condition and thus triggered full vesting. All of these shares 
were sold at a price of 770 pence per share in September 2010 by Richard Wood. 
Under (2) above the Remuneration Committee tested the condition as in (1) above and declared a vesting percentage of 
91%. Actual adjusted EPS growth over the performance period was 9.1% above RPI on an annualised basis and thus fell 
between the minimum and maximum performance levels and resulted in partial vesting. 
Due to the retirement of Richard Wood on 30 September 2011, in line with the rules of the Plan, it is currently anticipated 
that he will be treated as a good leaver in respect of his share awards under (2), (3) and (4) above and these awards will 
vest early. Such early vesting is subject to a pro rata reduction to reflect Richard Wood’s length of service compared 
with the performance period of the relevant share awards and is subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions 
attaching to the relevant share awards as stated in the Plan. Accordingly under (3) a vesting percentage of 77% shall apply 
as to two-thirds of the grant and that under (4) a vesting percentage of 100% shall apply as to one-third of the grant. This 
level of vesting relates to annual adjusted EPS performance over the relevant performance period of 7.7% and 17.8% which 
resulted in partial and full vesting respectively.

Financial
Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) 
as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
select and apply accounting policies properly; >
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and  >
understandable information; 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  >
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. >
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going Concern
The Business Review on pages 3 to 33 sets out the Group’s position and prospects, in particular:
The Group’s business activities, their performance and position are set out on pages 20 to 25. >
The financial position of the Group including cash flows, liquidity position, borrowing facilities and treasury risk  >
management policies are set out on pages 28 to 30.
The risk factors facing the Group and mitigating actions in place are described on page 30. >
In addition, note 25 to the Financial Statements includes details of the Group’s bank facilities, borrowings under such 
facilities and details of the Group’s financial instruments. 
After reviewing the available information including the Group’s business plans and after making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
1. the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2. the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Group Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Genus plc
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Genus plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group 
Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 36. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (‘APBs’) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group Financial Statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 June 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended; >
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and >
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. >
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or >
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. >
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ Report in relation to going concern; >
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions  >
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
certain elements of the report to shareholders by Board on Directors’ remuneration. >
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial Statements of Genus plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Group Statement of Cash Flows
For the year ended 30 June 201 1 Genus plc Annual Report 2011
66 Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity
Genus plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address 
of the registered office is Belvedere House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4HG. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the Company Overview. The Group Financial Statements for the year 
ended 30 June 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the equity 
method is used to account for the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates.
2. Basis of preparation
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The significant accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these Group Financial Statements. 
Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation as described in the 
relevant notes. 
Functional and presentation currency
The Group Financial Statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
All financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest million at one decimal point. 
Basis of measurement
The Group Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the following, in accordance 
with IFRS:
biological assets are measured at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and selling  >
expenses; and
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. >
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that 
have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in note 4.
Going concern
As set out in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement, after reviewing the available information including the Group’s 
business plans and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The results of subsidiaries 
sold cease to be consolidated from the date on which control passes.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of 
associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant 
influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s carrying amount is 
reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.

Financial
Statements
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. 
The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures. 
Intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in 
preparing the Group Financial Statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are 
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in 
the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Non GAAP measures – adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax
Adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit before tax from continuing operations are defined before the net 
IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, 
exceptional items and other gains and losses. This additional non-GAAP measure of operating performance is included 
as the Directors believe that they provide a useful alternative measure for shareholders of the trading performance of 
the Group. The reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from 
continuing operations is shown on the face of the Group Income Statement. The Directors recognise this alternative 
measure has limitations. 
 
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related foreign exchange 
differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at 
an average rate for the period. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation into Sterling of foreign operations, and the fair value movement of related 
effective hedges, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve. They are released into the income statement upon 
disposal of the foreign operation. 
Exchange movements on intercompany loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign currency translation 
reserve, together with any related taxation.
The principal exchange rates were as follows:
Average Closing
2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009
US Dollar/£ 1.60 1.58 1.60 1.61 1.50 1.65
Euro/£ 1.16 1.14 1.17 1.11 1.22 1.17
3. Significant accounting policies
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the profit and loss 
as incurred. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities which meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are 
classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’, which 
are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture represents the excess of the cost of acquisition 
excluding transaction costs over the Group’s interests in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree. Identifiable assets include any intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from 
legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is 
not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included 
in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate.
As required by IAS 21, goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments made to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the acquired operation on acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the acquired entity rather than assets or liabilities of the acquiring entity, and are therefore expressed in the functional 
currency of the foreign operation and retranslated at the balance sheet date.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and 
understanding, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities and when research projects satisfy the condition for achieving 
technical feasibility and are commercially viable, the Group’s policy is to capitalise further development costs in accordance 
with IAS 38.
The Group’s development activities comprise the development and maintenance of the porcine genetic nucleus herd and 
the development and maintenance of bovine pre-stud herds.
The Group does not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds as their fair value is included within the 
fair value of the Group’s biological assets in accordance with IAS 41.
The Group discloses the costs incurred in research and herd development activities as required by IAS 38.
Exceptional items
The Group presents items which the Directors believe to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence 
as exceptional. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group in a business combination subsequent to 1 April 2005 are identified and 
recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can 
be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets 
acquired separately. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Software     2 to 10 years
Porcine genetics technology   20 years
Multiplier contracts    15 years  
Customer relationships    15 to 17 years
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment loss. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated 
useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes 
in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at 
each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% (2010: 11.4%), the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital. A premium is added to this rate to reflect the risk attributable to individual countries. 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating 
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro 
rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no 
longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Biological assets and inventories
The principal activity of the Group during the period was the global application of quantitative genetics and biotechnology 
to animal breeding. The Group utilises these techniques to identify and select animals that possess the genetics/genes 
responsible for superior milk and meat quality, high health and performance traits. Genus sells breeding animals and 
semen to customers who produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality for the global 
dairy and meat supply chain. 
In bovine, research and development is used to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, but primarily the 
Holstein dairy breed. Progeny testing of the performance of daughters for each bull selected measures their performance 
against those of their peers. Semen from the best bulls is collected and frozen to satisfy customer demand. Semen from 
dairy breeds is used by farmers to breed replacement milking stock. Semen sold from beef breeds is used in either 
specialist beef breeding herds for multiplication of breeding bulls for use in natural service or on dairy cows to produce 
a by-product to be reared for meat.
Bovine biological assets are held for long-term internal use and are classified as non-current assets. Bull semen is 
transferred to inventory at fair value at point of harvest, which becomes the deemed cost under IAS 2. Inventories are 
stated at the lower of this deemed cost and net realisable value.
Since the sorting of semen is not a biological process but a production process, semen inventory transferred into sexed 
semen production is transferred at fair value at point of harvest less cost to sell and becomes a component of the 
production process. Sexed semen is carried in finished goods at production cost. 
In porcine, a central breeding stock (the ‘nucleus herd’) is maintained and developed to provide genetically superior animals. 
The animal genetics offer the potential to improve profitability for farmer and food processing customers by enabling them to 
increase output of consistently high quality products yielding higher value. To allow the Group to capitalise on its intellectual 
property it almost entirely outsources production to its global multiplier network. The offspring or semen obtained from 
animals in the nucleus herd is sold to customers for use in commercial farming. The sale of semen is far less common as 
porcine semen is sold fresh and has a short life when frozen.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Sales of porcine animals generally occur in one of two ways: ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’. Under direct sales, the full fair value 
of the animal is receivable at point of transfer to the customer. Under indirect sales, the pig is regarded as comprising 
of two separately identifiable components, its carcass and its inherent genetic potential. The initial consideration, which 
approximates the carcass value of the animal, is receivable at the point that the pig is transferred to the customer. 
The Group retains its interest in the genetic potential of the pig and consideration for the use of this genetic potential 
is received in the form of royalties. 
The breeding animal biological assets owned by Genus and the retained interest in the biological assets sold under royalty 
contracts are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are recognised in 
the income statement within operating profit for the period. 
Porcine biological assets which are in use as breeding animals are classified as non-current assets and are carried at fair 
value. Porcine biological assets held with an intention of resale, being the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair 
value and classified as current assets. The retained interest in the genetics from indirect sales is split between current and 
non-current assets based on the remaining expected life of the related animals.
Determination of fair values – biological assets
As required by IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’, the Group shows the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet 
determined according to the provisions of IAS 41 with the net valuation movement shown in the income statement. There 
are important differences in the manner in which the value of the Group’s bovine and porcine assets are arrived at, as 
explained below.
Bovine – the fair value of proven bulls and bulls on test, proven bulls being those where the bull’s semen is actively 
marketed, is based on expected future net cash flows from the sale of semen, the bull’s harvest, discounted at a current 
market-determined pre-tax rate. The fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory managed by the Group has been 
adjusted where a third party has a revenue share in the sale of semen from a particular bull. The significant assumptions 
determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, estimated production value, the expected marketable 
life of each bull and, in addition for bulls on test, the percentage whose production is expected to be actively marketed. 
In assessing the sales price, management uses statistical data for the bulls produced by independent authorities, in all its 
major markets, three times a year. In addition, estimates are also used to determine into which markets the semen will be 
sold, and domestic and export prices. The fair value of bulls that have not yet entered the Group testing programme is 
equivalent to their acquisition and rearing costs. 
Porcine – the fair values of porcine biological assets encompasses both the animals owned entirely by Genus and the 
retained interest in the genetics of those animals sold under royalty arrangements. The fair value of animals owned by 
the Group is calculated using average live weights of the animals plus a premium where it is considered that they will be 
saleable for their favourable genetic characteristics. The value attributed to the live weight of the pigs and the premium 
for genetics is based on recent transaction prices achieved by the Group. The significant assumptions in determining 
fair values are the expected life of the breeding animals, the percentage of production animals which are expected to be 
saleable as breeding animals and the expected sales prices. The fair value of the retained interest in the genetics of those 
animals sold under royalty contracts is initially based on the fair values achieved by the Group in recent transactions from 
direct sales of similar animals, less the values received upfront for the sale of the carcass element. The fair value of the 
retained interest is remeasured at each reporting date. The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the 
retained interest is the expected life of the animal transferred under royalty contracts.
 
Non recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group
In order to manage commercial risk a very large part of the Group’s porcine business model involves the sale of pigs to 
farmers (‘multipliers’) who produce piglets on farms neither managed nor controlled by the Group. The Group has the 
option to purchase the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium but no obligation to do so. The Group then has 
the ability to sell the offspring to other farmers at a premium because the offspring has superior genetics.
The right to purchase offspring is not recognised on the balance sheet as the contracts are entered into and continue to be 
held for the purpose of the receipt of non-financial items (the offspring) in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase 
requirements. As such the option is outside the scope of IAS 39. The offspring are not recognised as biological assets 
under IAS 41 as they are neither owned nor controlled by the Group. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at their 
latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment. Land and assets not available for use are not depreciated. The estimated useful 
lives are as follows:
Freehold land   Nil >
Freehold buildings  10 to 15 years >
Leasehold buildings   over the term of the lease >
Plant and equipment  3 to 20 years >
Motor vehicles   3 to 5 years >
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount (discounted if material) less impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of 
the statement of cash flows.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and 
redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the expected life of the borrowings on an effective 
interest rate basis.
 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is 
material, provisions are discounted to present value. 
Revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of sales and royalties receivable from customers, net of trade discounts and value 
added tax.
The principal components of the Group’s revenue and their respective accounting treatments are:
Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals and veterinary products is recognised  >
upon transfer of risks and rewards, either upon shipment to customers or delivery depending on the terms of sale.
Royalties are recognised when receivable. Royalty payments are received from certain porcine customers based on key  >
performance variables such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average 
slaughter weight of animal born.
Revenue from consulting services represents amounts charged for professional services provided during the year  >
including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax. Services provided but not yet billed are recognised 
as revenue based on a fair value assessment of the work delivered and a contractual right to receive payment. 
Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, nothing is recognised until the contingent event crystallises. 
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is 
included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges 
and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are recognised directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, 
in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see below).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance costs
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the income statement as they accrue. Dividend income is 
recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Finance costs that are directly attributable to construction of a qualifying asset, which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time 
as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognised in the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred.
 
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity, or arises as a fair 
value adjustment in a business combination. 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or to be recovered) 
using the tax rates and the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, together with 
any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of share awards and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with 
a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period of each 
option. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Binomial valuation model. The fair value of the awards 
granted is measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the estimated performance against non market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that 
actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
Treasury shares
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘QUEST’) are 
included in the Group Financial Statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in the Company remain deducted 
from shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution pension schemes
A number of employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the income 
statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. Differences between contributions payable 
and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The assets of these 
schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates defined benefit schemes for some of its employees, which are closed to new members. The Group’s 
net obligation in respect of defined benefit schemes is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is 
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The liability 
discount rate is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the Group’s pension liabilities. The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected 
unit market method. 
Actuarial gains and losses including the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and 
experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities are recognised in the period in which they occur directly into equity 
through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis to match the costs of providing retirement benefits evenly over the 
service lives of the employees concerned. Any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value 
of liabilities is allocated over the average remaining service lives of current employees. 
For one of the defined benefits schemes the Group operates, the Milk Pension Fund, the Group is a participating employer 
and takes a multi-employer exemption and only accounts for its share of the schemes assets and liabilities and its share of 
any orphan assets and liabilities. The Group, together with the other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for 
the scheme’s total obligations. These obligations are disclosed as a contingent liability.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net 
assets of subsidiary entities. The Group also uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. 
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to 
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness 
of the swap counterparties. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value 
of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument 
is recognised in equity in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group 
Income Statement.
Where a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, 
the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are recycled in the Group Income Statement in the 
same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Group Income Statement, i.e. when 
interest income or expense is recognised.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains 
in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in 
the Group Income Statement. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Net investment hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability of the net assets of an overseas subsidiary 
entity arising from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the functional currency of overseas 
subsidiary entities, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the 
hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until such point as the investment to which it relates 
is disposed. 
Net investment hedge accounting is applied solely in the Group Financial Statements. 
 
New standards and interpretations adopted
The following new standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted the reported 
results or the financial position:
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘ > Classification of Rights Issues’
Amendment to IFRS 1, ‘ > Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First Time Adopters’
Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘ > Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions’
IFRIC 19 ‘ > Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’
The adoption of these new standards and interpretation has not changed any previously reported figures.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which have been endorsed by the EU but are 
not yet effective for the year ended 30 June 2011, and have not been applied in preparing these Group Financial Statements:
Amendments to IAS 1, IAS 12, IAS 19, IAS 24, IAS 27, IAS 28, IFRS 7 and IFRIC 14 >
IFRS 9 ‘ > Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement’
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will introduce a number 
of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
and IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ were issued by the IASB on 12 May 2011 and are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. These pronouncements have not yet been endorsed for use in the European Union.
4. Significant areas of judgement and determination of fair values
Management consider the critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement to be the following: 
Determination of the fair value of biological assets 
The determination of the fair values of bovine and porcine biological assets requires the use of significant judgement and 
assumptions including an estimation of future cash flows, use of appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present 
value, forecast sales volumes, proportion to slaughter and the length of lives of animals. See note 15.
 
Fair value of assets and liabilities on business combinations
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to determine the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with the fair value of any consideration in excess of this amount representing 
goodwill. In determining the fair values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the use of significant 
judgement and assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and unprovided liabilities and commitments, 
particularly to tax, are often involved.
The determination of the useful life of intangible assets, particularly on those arising on acquisition, involves the exercise 
of management judgement.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011
75
Company
Overview
Business 
Review
Corporate 
Governance
Financial
Statements
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets
Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires a consideration of any specific 
impairment indicators and an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill, intangible and 
tangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows 
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present value. See 
note 14.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, the Directors make estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax 
authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. In recognising deferred tax assets and 
liabilities management also makes judgements about likely future taxable profits. When the final outcome of such matters, 
including the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses, is different, or expected to be different, from previous 
assessments by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be recorded in the 
period in which such a determination is made. See note 19.
Defined benefit pension scheme
Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on significant 
estimates and judgement. Details of estimates and judgements made in calculating these transactions are contained in 
note 28. For one of the defined benefit schemes, the Milk Pension Fund, the Group only accounts for its share of assets 
and liabilities. The Group, together with the other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the scheme’s 
obligations. These obligations are disclosed as a contingent liability.
Share-based payments 
Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of share-based payments are also based on significant estimates 
and judgement. Details of estimates and judgements made in calculating these transactions are contained in note 29. 
 
5. Segmental information

smaller territories.

13. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations
The calculation of basic earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended 30 June 2011 is based on the 
profit attributable to ordinary shareholders from continuing operations of £29.2m (2010: £27.5m) and a weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding of 59,652,000 (2010: 59,385,000), calculated as follows:

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
The calculation of diluted earnings per share at 30 June 2011 is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders from 
continuing operations of £29.2m (2010: £27.5m) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after 
adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares of 60,566,000 (2010: 60,163,000) calculated as follows:

Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments which represent the lowest 
level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment is as follows:
2011 
£m 
2010 
£m 
2009 
£m
North America 33.0 34.1 30.2
Latin America 16.8 15.9 14.2
Europe 11.3 11.1 11.2
Far East 7.2 7.3 6.9
68.3 68.4 62.5
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for 
the value in use calculations of cash-generating units are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected changes 
to selling prices and direct costs. Management has estimated the discount rate using the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital (‘WACC’), changes in selling prices and direct costs, which are based on past experience and expectations of future 
changes in the market.  Genus plc Annual Report 2011

The Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial and strategic budgets approved by management for 
the next three years, and extrapolates cash flows using estimated growth rates beyond this period.
A growth rate of 4.0% (2010: 4.0%, 2009: 4.0%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget and strategic 
plan period. 
The post-tax WACC of 8.0% (2010: 8.0%, 2009: 8.0%) has been applied to cash flow projections, which equates to a pre-tax 
rate of approximately 11.4% (2010: 11.4%, 2009: 11.4%). The discount rate has been risk adjusted for Latin America and the 
Far East, with an additional premium of 1% to 3% added to the WACC.

Bovine biological assets include £1.6m (2010: £1.9m, 2009: £3.0m) representing the fair value of bulls owned by third 
parties but managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties and are therefore treated as 
assets held under finance leases. 
There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes during 
the year.
The current market determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull semen 
is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This has been assessed as 8.0% (2010: 8.0%, 2009: 8.0%).
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets. Inventories of such semen are shown 
as biological asset harvest in note 20. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Porcine biological assets include £30.9m (2010: £32.4m, 2009: £36.7m) relating to the fair value of the retained interest in 
the genetics in respect of animals transferred to customers under royalty contracts. Total revenue in the period includes 
£64.4m (2010: £58.8m) in respect of these contracts comprising £12.2m (2010: £9.8m) on initial transfer of animals to 
customers and £52.2m (2010: £49.0m) in respect of royalties received. Decreases attributable to sales during the period 
of £124.4m (2010: £117.6m) include £30.2m (2010: £36.2m) in respect of the reduction in fair value of the retained interest 
in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts.
Included in increases due to purchases, the aggregate gain arising during the period on initial recognition of biological 
assets in respect of multiplier purchases was £22.0m (2010: £16.5m).

19. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses with a potential tax benefit of £13.4m (2010: £14.1m, 
2009: £13.7m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £2.3m 
(2010: £2.1m, 2009: £3.3m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 
£11.1m (2010: £12.0m, 2009: £10.4m) due to the uncertainty over the availability of future taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities totalling £3.2m (2010: £3.6m, 2009: £2.8m) have not been recognised for the withholding tax and 
other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries. No provision is required 
since the Group is in a position to control the timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Trade receivables
The average credit period taken on the sales of goods is 65 days (2010: 67 days, 2009: 59 days). No interest is charged on 
receivables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. The Group provides for all receivables based upon knowledge 
of the customer and historical experience and estimates irrecoverable amounts by reference to past default experience.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
At 30 June 2011, £40.7m (2010: £35.6m, 2009: £30.8m) of trade receivables were not yet due for payment. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due 
to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the 
present value of expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Receivables denominated in currencies other than Sterling comprise £11.9m of receivables denominated in US Dollar 
(2010: £15.6m, 2009: £11.6m), £11.0m of receivables denominated in Euros (2010: £7.4m, 2009: £9.1m) and £29.1m of

Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of 
measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, 
financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.
For those financial instruments held at valuation, the Group has categorised them into a three level fair value hierarchy 
based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7. The hierarchy gives the highest 
priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable 
inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is 
based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. The 
fair values of the Group’s outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future 
cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7. 
There are no financial instruments which have been categorised as Level 1 or Level 3.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, coordinates access to domestic and 
international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through 
internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including 
currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written 
principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial 
instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board 
of Directors regularly. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, 
for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an 
annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed through its activities are risks of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates and interest rates. The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure 
to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:
forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods in foreign currency  >
and on the purchase of supplies in foreign currencies;
interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and >
cross currency swap contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Group’s investment  >
in foreign operations. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to movement in the US Dollar and the Euro exchange rates.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling against the relevant 
foreign currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management 
personnel and represents management’s assessment of a significant change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity 
analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the 
period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans 
to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of 
the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit where Sterling weakens against the 
relevant currency. For a strengthening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite 
impact on the profit, and the balances below would be negative. The impact on other equity is minimal due to the net 
investment hedging in place.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
The risk is managed centrally by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, 
using interest rate swap agreements. Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined 
risk appetite, thereby ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in 
interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk 
management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the 
amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% increase or decrease 
is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s 
assessment of a significant change in interest rates. 
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 
30 June 2011 would decrease/increase by £0.3m (2010: decrease/increase by £0.2m). This small impact is attributable to 
the Group’s high level of fixed rate borrowing.
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest 
amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing 
interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the 
reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit 
risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the 
end of the financial year.
 
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding 
as at the reporting date:

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly or a monthly basis. The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate 
swaps is three month LIBOR or one month LIBOR. The Group settles the difference between the fixed and floating interest 
rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as 
cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. 
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is 
recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The Group’s exposure and the 
credit ratings of its counterparties are regularly monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread 
amongst approved counterparties. Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that are 
reviewed and approved by the Board annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. 
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by 
maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables

The Group has access to financing facilities, the total unused amount of which is £51.2m (2010: £53.6m, 2009: £44.1m) 
at the balance sheet date. The Group expects to meet its other obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of 
maturing financial assets. The Group expects to reduce the current debt to equity ratio as the level of borrowings 
decreases through repayment from operating cash flows.
The following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The table has been drawn 
up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows/(outflows) on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the 
undiscounted gross outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is

28. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group has a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees. 
The principal funds are those in the United Kingdom, the Milk Pension Fund and the Dalgety Pension Fund, which are 
defined benefit schemes. The assets of these funds are held separately from the assets of the Group and administered by 
trustees and managed professionally. These schemes are closed to new members. 
The financial position of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 are aggregated for disclosure 
purposes. The liability split by principal scheme is set out below.

The Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’)
The Milk Pension Fund is that previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board, and was also open to membership of 
staff working for Milk Marque Ltd (the principal employer now known as Community Foods Group Limited), National Milk 
Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd (which went into receivership 
in June 2009) and Milk Link Ltd. Genus only accounts for its section and its share of any orphan liabilities but discloses 
details regarding the full potential contingent liability below, as ultimate liabilities are joint and several.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Milk Pension Fund was at 31 March 2009. The valuation of the fund used the 
projected unit method (for future service, a control period of three years was used) and was carried out by professionally 
qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2009 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would 
be 8.2% per annum before retirement and 5.4% per annum after retirement, that pay increases would average 4.3% per 
annum and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 3.2% per annum.
Due to the adverse economic conditions that existed at the 31 March 2009, the funding valuation was updated at 31 March 
2010. At 31 March 2010, the market value of the fund’s assets amounted to £312m. The value of those assets represents 
approximately 90% of the value of the uninsured liabilities which were £347m at 31 March 2010, after allowing for expected 
future increases in earnings.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2010 valuation, was £35m (of which Genus’ notional share 
was £13.1m) and this shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers. Under the new 
funding agreement, the Company has agreed to make deficit repair contributions of £1.5m per annum until 31 March 2022.
With effect from 31 May 2010, the majority of the Genus’ active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became 
deferred pensioners. This event resulted in a curtailment gain of £2.5m, which was recognised in the prior year as an 
exceptional item in the income statement.
The Group’s pension cost for the scheme in 2011 is £0.1m (2010: £0.7m).
Dalgety Pension Fund
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Dalgety Pension Fund was at 31 March 2009. The valuation of the scheme used 
the projected unit method and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2009 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would 
be 6.6% per annum before retirement and 4.1% per annum after retirement, that pay increases would average 4.3% per 
annum and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 3.2% per annum.
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2009 was £14.5m. The value of those assets represents 
approximately 91% of the value of the uninsured liabilities which were £16.0m at 31 March 2009, after allowing for 
expected future increases in earnings.
Under the new funding agreement, the Company has agreed to make deficit repair contributions of £0.3m per annum 
until 30 September 2018.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations 
carried out as at 31 March 2009 updated to 30 June 2011. Under the projected unit method the current service cost will 
increase as the members approach retirement.
There is a £2.7m reserve held by Trustees against future unknown liabilities materialising. As the economic benefit to the 
Company of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
With effect from 30 November 2010, the majority of the Genus’ active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and 
became deferred pensioners. This event resulted in a curtailment gain of £0.7m, which has been recognised during the 
year as an exceptional item in the income statement, net of legal costs.
The Group’s pension cost for the scheme in 2011 is £0.1m (2010: £0.2m). Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Other defined benefit scheme in deficit:
The Group also operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig 
Development Company Limited. The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2011 under the 
provisions of IAS 19 were £3.7m (2010: £3.3m, 2009: £2.8m) and £4.7m (2010: £4.6m, 2009: £4.1m), respectively.
Other unfunded schemes
On the acquisition of Sygen International plc, the Group acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an 
unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous group’s senior employees 
and executives.
For the three unfunded defined benefit schemes, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19 the scheme liabilities 
amount to £5.5m (2010: £5.7m, 2009: £5.0m) and this amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group’s balance 
sheet. The current cost charged to operating profit in the year to 30 June 2011 amounted to £nil (2010: £nil, 2009: £nil) and 
the interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to £0.3m (2010: £0.3m, 2009: £0.3m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 5.7% (2010: 5.5%, 
2009: 6.0%), that pay increases would average nil% per annum (2010: nil%, 2009: nil%) and that inflation and pension 
payments would be 3.6% per annum (2010: 3.1%, 2009: 3.2%).
For the unfunded retirement health benefit plan, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19, scheme liabilities 
amount to £1.3m (2010: £1.4m, 2009: £1.3m) and this amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the 
Group’s balance sheet. The current cost charged to operating profit in the year to 30 June 2011 amounted to £nil 
(2010: £nil) and the interest on plan liabilities amounted to £0.1m (2010: £0.1m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 5.7% (2010: 5.5%, 
2009: 6.0%) and that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 7.6% (2010: 7.1%, 2009: 7.4%).

Future pension increases 3.6% 3.1% 2.8%
The mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the schemes’ actuaries and reflect the 
latest available tables, adjusted for the experience of the scheme where appropriate. As in 2010, the mortality tables 
used are the SN1A tables, with birth year and medium cohort projections, with mortality rates increased by 25% at all ages 
(2009: PxA00 tables, with birth year and medium cohort projections, with mortality rates increased by 25% at all ages).
The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the expectation of life of an average 
member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years’ time.

The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.2% (2010: 6.9%, 2009: 6.6%). The expected long-term rate of 
return is based on the portfolio as a whole and not on the sum of the returns on individual asset categories. The return is 
based exclusively on historical returns, without adjustments.
The amount the deficit varies if the main financial assumption changes, particularly the discount rate. If the discount rate 
increased/decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 deficit would decrease/increase by £2.5m.

Share options
On 12 August 2004 the Group established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and other 
senior employees to purchase shares in the Company. Further grants on similar terms were offered to these employee 
groups as set out below. 
The terms and conditions of the grants are as set out below. All options are to be settled by physical delivery of shares and 
meet the criteria for being treated as equity settled as defined by IFRS 2.

The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is based on the fair value of share options granted, 
measured using a binomial model, with the following inputs:
Assumptions applied in valuation models at grant date
2011 2010
Exercise price of options granted in the year (nil for awards) 729p 655p
Expected volatility (weighted average volatility) 30% 30%
Option life (expected weighted average life) 6.5 years 6.5 years
Expected dividends 1.80% 1.80%
Risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds) 2.5% 2.97%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the estimated fair value of the Company’s share 
price over the previous three years. The option life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Share awards
In addition to the outstanding share options above, there are a total of 746,122 conditional share awards which are 
outstanding at 30 June 2011. These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management 
on 19 September 2008, 15 October 2008, 3 March 2009, 15 September 2009, 2 March 2010, 10 September 2010 and 
22 September 2010 under the 2004 Performance Share Plan. In accordance with the terms of the plan, participants in 
the plan have received a conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option award which will vest mainly after three 
years, with the proportion of the award vesting being based on growth in Group adjusted earnings per share. Further 
details of the performance conditions attributing to the 2004 Performance Share Plan are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
In the year to 30 June 2011, awards were granted on 10 September 2010 and 22 September 2010. The aggregate of the 
fair values of those awards granted was £1,712,000. The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is 
based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

Independent Auditors’ Report –  
Parent Company Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Genus plc
We have audited the Parent Company Financial Statements of Genus plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise 
the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 37 to 50. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Parent Company Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (‘APBs’) 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company Financial Statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2011; >
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and >
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. >
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the  >
Companies Act 2006; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  >
is consistent with the Parent Company Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not  >
been received from branches not visited by us; or
the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  >
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or >
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. >
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements of Genus plc for the year ended 30 June 2011.

37. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout 
the current and prior year.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. 
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Genus plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 June 2011. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and 
loss account. The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the 
terms of FRS 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related 
Party Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other members of the Genus Group. 
Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition or at their latest valuation, less 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is calculated to write off the assets to their estimated residual 
values over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are 
as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings  period of lease
Equipment     3–20 years
Motor vehicles     3–5 years
The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Fixed assets investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Pensions
A number of employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to profit and 
loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. Differences between contributions payable and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The assets of these schemes 
are held separately from those of the Company.
Certain current and former employees of the Company are members of one of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes, 
further details of which are given in note 28 of the Group Financial Statements. The schemes are all multi-employer defined 
benefit schemes, the assets and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The Company is unable to identify 
its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and accordingly accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined 
contribution scheme.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred taxation assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be 
suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Timing differences are 
differences arising between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements and which 
are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and 
associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.

Overview
Business 
Review
Corporate 
Governance
Financial
Statements
Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate 
if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract 
rate. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Treasury shares
The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 38, ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’, which requires the assets and liabilities 
associated with the Company’s investment in its own shares to be recognised in the Company’s financial statements 
where there is de facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Company’s own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (“QUEST”) remain deducted from 
shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Employee share schemes
Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share 
awards which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three year period.
The cost of such awards is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares at the date of the award. At the end of 
each financial reporting period an estimate is made of the extent to which those performance criteria will be met at the end 
of three years and an appropriate charge recorded in the profit and loss account together with a corresponding credit to 
profit and loss reserves. Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit 
and loss account in subsequent periods.
Share-based payments
The Company has implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with 
its subsidiary undertaking under UITF 44, whereby the Company has granted the rights of its shares to the employees of 
its subsidiary undertaking under an equity-settled arrangement and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed to the Company 
for these rights. Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiary’s 
accounts as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an amount equal to the share-based payment 
recognised by these subsidiaries in their accounts.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. The Company also uses forward foreign currency 
contracts (implemented through a medium-term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap) 
to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiary entities. Forward foreign currency 
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not in its 
balance sheet.
The use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which 
provides written principles on the use on financial derivatives. Information about the Group’s financial risks, the management 
thereof, and the use of financial instruments and their impact on the Group’s risk, profile, performance, and financial condition is 
included in the notes to the Group Financial Statements.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to 
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of 
the swap counterparties. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value 
of the quoted forward price. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument 
is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss account.
Where a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, 
the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period 
or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when interest income or expense 
is recognised.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Company revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains 
in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the profit and 
loss account immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Company revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until such point as the investment to which it relates 
is disposed.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair 
value with unrealised gains and losses reported in the profit and loss account.
Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs. The carrying amount is 
increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the 
carrying value of the debt to which they relate.

comprise a £65m multi-currency revolving credit facility, a US$60m revolving credit and a US$50m term loan being 
repayable on 30 September 2015.
As part of its interest rate strategy the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge floating LIBOR rates. As a 
result bank loan and overdrafts include £10.0m fixed at 2.17%, US$70m (£43.6m) fixed at 1.40%, and €6m (£5.4m) fixed at 
1.91%. All indicated rates are exclusive of applicable bank margin.

Hedges
The Company’s policy is to monitor net transactional currency exposures and future contracted sales, in order to hedge 
such exposures in the Group, where appropriate. There were short-term forward contracts totalling £3.2m (net) entered into 
at 30 June 2011 (2010: £0.2m (net)).
The recognised profit included in the profit and loss account on forward exchange contracts taken out in previous years 
amounted to £0.1m (2010: £0.1m). The Company has entered into interest rate swaps and a cross currency swap in order 
to manage its interest rate profile.

* The options under (1), (2), (3) and (4) are now exercisable. The options under (5), (6) and (7) above can only be exercised if over a three year period the average annual 
percentage growth in EPS exceeds a minimum of RPI +5% for the same period, unless provisions for ‘good leavers’ have been met where members retire, leave 
employment due to ill-health or are made redundant.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 836 pence.
In the year to 30 June 2011, options were granted on 10 September 2010. The aggregate of the fair values of those options 
granted was £723,000.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is based on the fair value of share options granted, 
measured using a binomial model, with the following inputs:
2011 2010
Assumptions applied in valuation models at grant date
Exercise price of options granted in the year (nil for awards) 729p 655p
Expected volatility (weighted average volatility) 30% 30%
Option life (expected weighted average life) 6.5 years 6.5 years
Expected dividends 1.80% 1.80%
Risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds) 2.5% 2.97%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the estimated fair value of the Company’s share 
price over the previous three years. The option life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Share awards
In addition to the outstanding share options above, there are a total of 746,122 conditional share awards which are 
outstanding at 30 June 2011. These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management 
on 19 September 2008, 15 October 2008, 3 March 2009, 15 September 2009, 2 March 2010, 10 September 2010 and 
22 September 2010 under the 2004 Performance Share Plan. In accordance with the terms of the plan, participants in the 
plan have received a conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option award which will vest mainly after three years, 
with the proportion of the award vesting being based on growth in Group adjusted earnings per share. Further details of the 
performance conditions attributing to the 2004 Performance Share Plan are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Genus plc Annual Report 2011

and section 573 of the Act, to allot equity securities (within the meaning of sections 560 of the Act) for cash pursuant

NOTES:
This notice is being sent to all members and to any person nominated by a member of the Company under section 146 of 
the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) to enjoy information rights. Information regarding the Annual General Meeting, including 
the information required by section 311A of the Act, is available from www.genusplc.com. 
Members will find an attendance card and a form of proxy enclosed with this notice. If you are attending the Annual 
General Meeting, you should bring the attendance card with you. Only holders of Ordinary Shares, or their duly appointed 
representatives, are entitled to attend, vote and speak at the Annual General Meeting. Any member so entitled may appoint 
one or more proxies to attend, speak and to vote instead of him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must 
attend the Annual General Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint one or more proxies are set out in the notes 
to the proxy form. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached 
to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. A vote withheld is 
not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no 
voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain 
from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Annual General Meeting. 
To be valid, a duly executed form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting together, if appropriate, with the power 
of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a duly certified copy of such power or authority must be 
deposited at the offices of Equiniti Registrars, SEA10845, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West 
Sussex BN99 6ZJ at least 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time appointed for holding the Annual General 
Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Alternatively, proxies may be appointed by having an appropriate CREST message 
transmitted, if you are a user of the CREST system (further details are below). In the case of a member which is a company, 
the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney 
for the company. 
Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending the Annual General Meeting and 
voting in person if they wish to do so. 
The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who 
have been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Act (‘nominated 
persons’). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered member who hold shares on their 
behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such 
a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person 
holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights. 
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered 
on the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is 
6.00pm on 8 November 2011 (or if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, members on the register of members not later 
than 6.00pm on the day that is two working days prior to the reconvened Annual General Meeting). Changes to entries on 
the register of members after the relevant time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
Copies of contracts of service and letters of appointment between the directors and the Company will be available for 
inspection at the Registered Office of the Company during normal business hours until the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting, and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the Annual General 
Meeting until its conclusion. 
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may 
do so for this Annual General Meeting to be held on 10 November 2011 at 11.00am and any adjournment(s) thereof by 
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual found on the Euroclear website www.euroclear.com/CREST. CREST 
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action 
on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate 
CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland 
Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. 
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to 
a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) 
by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of Annual General Meeting. For this purpose,  Genus plc Annual Report 2011
122 Notice of Annual General Meeting
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the appointee through other means. 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear 
UK and Ireland Limited do not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system 
timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the 
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has 
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action 
as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In 
this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, as amended. 
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all 
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares. 
As at 30 June 2011 the Company’s issued share capital comprised 59,933,085 ordinary shares of 10 pence each. 
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number 
of voting rights in the Company as at 30 June 2011 is 59,933,085. The Company’s website, referred to above, will include 
information on the number of shares and voting rights. 
Under section 319A of the Act, the Company must answer any question a member asks relating to the business being 
dealt with at the Annual General Meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for 
the Annual General Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; the answer has already been given on 
a website in the form of an answer to a question; or it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order 
of the Annual General Meeting that the question be answered. 
Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require 
the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any 
circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual 
accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the members

Improving world 
agricultural efficiency 
through biotechnology
What We Do
Genus is a world leader in creating 
advances in animal breeding through 
naturally applied biotechnology.
We play a key role in the world’s agricultural 
economy by providing innovative solutions 
to our global farmer and food producer 
customers to meet the challenge of growing 
global demand for milk, pork and beef from 
an increasing world population when 
there are decreasing resources available 
for food production.
We currently operate in the bovine and 
porcine sectors helping farmers and food 
producers across the world to improve 
quality, achieve production efficiencies and 
increase output. 
Our competitive edge is created from our 
ownership and control of proprietary lines of 
breeding animals, the biotechnology used to 
improve them and our global production and 
distribution network. Genus sales are made 
in 70 countries worldwide and we have 
operations in 30 countries.

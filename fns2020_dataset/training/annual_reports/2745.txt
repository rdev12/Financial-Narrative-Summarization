THE RAJASTHAN DEVELOPMENT
EXPLORED...
The Mangala field was discovered in 
January 2004 – the largest onshore 
oil discovery in India in more than 20 
years. The Rajasthan resource base has 
continually grown since the discovery 
of Mangala – a total of 25 discoveries 
have already been made – the focus 
being to realise the full potential  
of the Barmer Basin in the coming 
years. The total acreage under long-
term contract is 3,111 km
2
 spread 
across the districts of Barmer and 
Jalore in the north west of India.
DISCOVERED...
Rajasthan has a resource base of  
approximately 4 billion barrels of  
oil. The Rajasthan fields are being 
developed by Cairn in a phased 
manner with first oil production 
having commenced in August 2009. 
Recoverable reserves are estimated 
to total in excess of one billion barrels 
of oil and will support a plateau 
production of 175,000 barrels of 
oil per day in 2011, with aspirations 
for production targets well beyond 
that level. 
The MBA fields, once at the currently 
approved peak plateau production 
of 175,000 bopd, will contribute 
more than 20% of India’s crude 
oil production. 
DEVELOPED...
The Mangala Processing Terminal 
(MPT) will act as the hub for processing 
crude oil from all the Rajasthan fields. 
The world’s longest heated and insulated 
crude oil pipeline is being built by 
Cairn from the MPT to the Gujarat coast 
– with an eventual length of 670 km – 
giving access to more than 75% of 
India’s refining capacity – the first phase  
of ~600 km to Salaya is complete and 
will be operational in 2010. Initial 
volumes of crude have been produced 
through the first processing train, which 
has a capacity of 30,000 barrels, and 
production ramp-up will continue until 
all four processing trains, with a total 
capacity of 205,000 bopd, are built 
and installed by 2011. 
At the peak of construction 
~16,000 workers were involved in the 
construction activities: 5,000 on the 
pipeline and 11,000 on the MPT.  GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW

CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
Norman Murray Chairman CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  15  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
CORPORATE OVERVIEW 
The substantial and growing resource base in Rajasthan will 
allow the Group to generate sustainable long-term cash flows 
once evacuation of sales crude by pipeline commences this year. 
Cairn has built a strong business platform which will provide 
funds to enable the Group to:
reinvest in Rajasthan to optimise development of  
the resource base;
support exploration programmes in Greenland; and 
provide flexibility for additional growth opportunities. 
INDIA
The Rajasthan project has been a massive undertaking.  
At the peak of construction last year, approximately 16,000 
people were involved in building the MPT site, the gas and 
water processing facilities and the pipeline, making this project 
one of the biggest oil and gas production developments in  
India for many years. 
The honourable Indian Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, 
inaugurated First Oil from Mangala in August 2009. The initial 
production is being taken by road tankers to the coast and 
shipped to refineries pending the commissioning of the 
pipeline. The main pipeline infrastructure is now in place 
and testing and commissioning is underway. Initial piped 
crude oil volumes are scheduled to be pumped through the 
continuously heated and insulated facility during Q2 2010.
With development of the Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya
(MBA) fields well underway, the focus for planning purposes  
has shifted more towards realising the full potential of the basin. 
In this process, unlocking the value of the Enhanced Oil Recovery 
(EOR) and the other fields including the Barmer Hill is of prime 
importance. The current Government of India (GoI) approved 
plateau production level for the MBA fields is 175,000 barrels of 
oil per day (bopd). Our goal is to demonstrate that the resource 
base can support potential production up to 240,000 bopd.
Working effectively with government and partners is 
fundamental wherever we operate but the complexity of  
the Rajasthan development has meant such co-operation is 
even more essential to achieve success. All parties working 
together have already delivered a clear message that India 
provides both the opportunity and the required support 
to create world-class developments.
GREENLAND
The Group’s strong financial position has allowed it to build a 
strategic early entry position in the frontier basins of Greenland, 
a country which Cairn believes has the necessary geological 
ingredients for exploration success. This is the first year of  
what is intended to be a three year exploration campaign 
drilling in various basins offshore Greenland, which could have 
transformational potential. Whilst recognising that the chances 
of success are relatively low in such frontier areas, we look 
forward to the results of the summer 2010 drilling programme. 
Cairn recognises that its activities can have an impact on the 
environment. In this regard it has policies and procedures in 
place that seek to avoid impacts wherever it operates, and these 
are implemented in accordance with international regulatory 
requirements. The Company has an established track record 
of corporate responsibility initiatives in South Asia and will 
continue to adopt the same approach wherever it operates. 
Cairn has submitted Social and Environmental Impact 
Assessments (SIA/EIA) to the Government of Greenland 
as part of the drilling approval process. 
BOARD 
Hamish Grossart has decided, after 16 years on the Board, 
not to seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 
20 May 2010. Hamish was appointed to the Board in 1994 
and has been Deputy Chairman of the Company since 1996. 
His business acumen and insight has been hugely beneficial 
to the Board over many years. Mark Tyndall, who has also 
decided not to seek re-election, has provided invaluable 
support and incisive input, and stands down after seven 
years on the Board.
The Company plans to appoint two new independent  
non-executive directors in the near future as replacements  
for Mr Grossart and Mr Tyndall. 
OUTLOOK
Cairn is well positioned for future growth. 
The phased delivery of the Rajasthan project and development 
of the growing resource base will continue to remain our prime 
focus for a number of years. 
Having built a strong sustainable cash generative position  
in India, we will continue to offer transformational potential  
as we explore the frontier basins of Greenland.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Sir Bill Gammell Chief Executive
“ Following 20 years of building a material South Asian  
business, we are reaching a defining moment in Cairn’s history. 
 
The phased Rajasthan development is set to produce 125,000 bopd 
later this year with multiple buyers now lining up to take crude  
through the pipeline. The basin resource base continues to grow  
and has the potential to take production up to 240,000 bopd. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  17  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
Cairn has a straightforward business model based on 
its entrepreneurial exploration and development skills. 
The Company’s aim is to differentiate itself by focusing 
on materiality and hidden value and through the creation 
of a clear strategic business edge in its activities 
and relationships. 
A 20 year vision to grow a substantial exploration and 
production business in South Asia has been delivered  
through the exploration and development successes of 
Sangu in Bangladesh, the Ravva complex of fields off the 
east coast of India, the Lakshmi, Gauri and other Gujarat 
fields on the west coast of India and the discovery and 
phased development of the Rajasthan fields.
Rajasthan oil production commenced in August 2009 and 
will continue to ramp up in 2010. The phase one Mangala 
plateau production of 125,000 bopd will be reached in the 
second half of this year, before increasing to an approved 
plateau of 175,000 bopd in 2011 with the addition of 
Bhagyam and Aishwariya. 
At the current peak plateau production level, Rajasthan crude 
will account for more than 20% of India’s overall domestic  
oil production. The full potential of the Rajasthan project to 
Cairn and to the economy of India will only be realised once  
the resource base is fully developed. As more and more fields 
and plays such as Bhagyam, Aishwariya and the Barmer Hill 
are brought onto production, Cairn envisages plateau 
production of up to 240,000 bopd.
In addition to the Rajasthan growth story, Cairn is now set 
to embark on an exciting three year multi-well programme 
as the Company starts to explore the high risk frontier 
basins of Greenland.
RAJASTHAN, INDIA
Cairn continues to improve its understanding of the Barmer 
basin and a comprehensive review of the resource potential 
in the block has been carried out. The discovered gross mean 
in place resource base has increased from 3.7 billion barrels 
of oil equivalent (boe) to 4 billion boe.
Following evaluation the exploration potential has increased  
and the prospective resource is now estimated to be a risked 
2.5 billion boe in place. The current total block potential 
resource is now 6.5 billion boe. 
The MBA fields and the smaller Raageshwari and Saraswati 
fields all have approved Field Development Plans (FDPs) which 
carry a combined proven plus probable (2P) gross reserves  
and best estimate contingent resources (2C) resources of over 
700 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). In addition, the 
MBA fields have an estimated EOR contingent resource of over 
300 mmbbls; these resources are expected to be transferred  
to reserves once the EOR field trial results are known. 
There is a further estimated ~1.9 billion boe in place contained 
within the Barmer Hill Formation and the 20 other fields. 
Evaluation work is still ongoing for these discoveries and this 
year will include a pilot fraccing and horizontal well programme 
on the Barmer Hill. The reserve potential for these fields is 
currently estimated to range between 50 and 450 mmbbls.
In addition to the existing discoveries, the remaining risked 
prospective resource potential within the basin is currently 
estimated to be ~2.5 billion barrels (bbls) in 35 main prospects, 
and over 70 leads for which the associated risked prospective 
resource is estimated to range between 150 and 450 mmbbls. 
Substantial progress has been made on the Rajasthan 
integrated development in the last year. Production started 
last August at the MPT, the largest of its kind in India, with 
evacuation by trucking. The crude will shortly be transported 
through the world’s longest continuously heated and insulated 
pipeline to key refineries in north west India. 
The growth in India has enabled the Company to position  
itself as an early entrant in frontier acreage in Greenland.  
By creating substantial strategic positions in two undrilled  
basins 1,500 km apart in Greenland, Cairn continues  
to offer shareholders exposure to transformational upside  
through high risk exploration. ” 18  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW

We have a strong balance sheet  
and funding in place to:
 
 MBA development
 
 campaign in Greenland
Processing Train 1 was completed in 2009 and by the middle  
of 2010, Trains 2 and 3 at the MPT will be operational, providing 
a production capacity of 130,000 bopd. When Train 4 is installed 
in 2011 the currently approved production of 175,000 bopd can 
be reached. 
Sales arrangements are now in place for 143,000 bopd with 
four refineries, namely Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals 
(MRPL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in the public sector and 
Reliance and Essar in the private sector. Discussions are ongoing 
with regard to further sales to refiners in special economic zones 
and potentially overseas, subject to GoI approval. 
Well results from the ongoing development drilling campaign 
in the Mangala field confirm the excellent reservoir quality of the 
Fatehgarh Formation, which indicates the potential to increase 
production to 150,000 bopd, subject to GoI approval and 
facility upgrades.
GREENLAND
It is Cairn’s belief that Greenland, as part of the North Atlantic 
geological province, has hydrocarbons present in its offshore 
basins; however, it will take stamina, skill and indeed luck to 
find them.
Only six exploration wells have been drilled offshore Greenland 
to date, five of which were drilled in the 1970s and one in 2000. 
These wells were all located in the west Greenland basin to 
the south of the undrilled Baffin Bay basin. In none of these 
instances were the operators able to benefit from a more 
sustained campaign.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
Subject to the necessary government approvals, Cairn will 
commence drilling activities in the west Disko blocks within 
the undrilled Baffin Bay basin later this year. By using two 
state-of-the-art drilling rigs Cairn is able to plan a safe multi- 
well campaign. As part of the approval process, Cairn, along 
with its partner Nunaoil and the Government of Greenland,  
has embarked on a Public Consultation Process (PCP) which 
involves engaging with a number of coastal communities in 
the Disko Bay area. The purpose of this process is to discuss 
the EIA/SIA reports for the project plan and well locations.
The proposed four well summer 2010 exploration programme 
targets ~1.6 billion of risked gross mean oil in place and ~385 
mmbbls of risked resources, (16 billion of unrisked oil in place 
and 4.1 billion bbls unrisked resources) and has been designed 
to allow operational flexibility dependent on results. 
As the Baffin Bay basin is undrilled, it does not have a 
confirmed active petroleum system; however, results from 
the 2009 surveys have given positive indications that suggest 
one may be present. The main perceived risk is the presence 
of thick and continuous source rocks offshore. Currently the 
estimated chance of success for the four prospects ranges 
from 7% to 14%. 
Geophysical surveys are also planned across the southern 
Greenland basins in the summer of 2010 in advance of a 
further exploration drilling campaign of up to four wells in 
2011, subject to necessary approvals.
The Baffin Bay bid round also takes place this year with bids to 
be submitted by 1 May 2010 and awards expected in August.
It is anticipated that this will be a very competitive round and 
Cairn plans to participate.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
During 2009, following the deterioration of conditions in 
worldwide financial markets, the Group took prompt action 
to strengthen its balance sheet. This allowed Cairn to 
continue with the programme of investment and to wait 
for credit markets to stabilise before expanding the loan 
facilities in India from $850m to $1.6bn. 
The year closed with two significant transactions – one with 
PETRONAS and one with Dyas. The Group has consequently 
entered 2010 with a stronger balance sheet and a capital 
structure fit for the extensive operational activities.
At 31 December 2009, Group net cash balances, gross of 
prepaid finance costs offset against debt under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), were approximately  
$500m. CIL had net debt of $96m and undrawn loan facilities  
of $923m. The net cash balances of the rest of the Group  
were $596m.
The Board continues to focus the Group’s capital resources 
to maximise shareholder value and maintain financial and 
operational flexibility. 
Resources in India continue to be targeted on delivering the 
Rajasthan project where initial cash flows will be reinvested 
in the block. 
The enhanced financial strength of the Group has also 
enabled Cairn to accelerate the programme in Greenland
where a successful exploration campaign this summer 
could be transformational.

GROUP PRODUCTION
Cairn’s average gross production during 2009 was 77 ,222 
barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) (2008: 76,298 boepd). 
The Group’s average entitlement production for 2009 was 
20,307 boepd net to Cairn (2008: 12,801 boepd). 
The figures in the table below show Group production for 2009 
on a gross, working interest and entitlement interest basis 
(including 100% of both CIL’s and Capricorn’s production).

is 80% gas: 20% oil.
Rajasthan production commenced in August 2009 and 
represents 125 days.
GROUP BOOKED 2P RESERVES
The table below shows reserves information at 31 December 
2009 on an entitlement interest basis for the Group (including 
100% of CIL’s reserves). For accounting and reserves purposes, 
the Group has used an oil price assumption of $65/bbl for 2010 
(real) (2008: $50/bbl for 2009 and $65 for 2010 onwards (real)).

mmboe (31 December 2008: 348.0 mmboe), comprising 
342.3 mmboe in India and 0.5 mmboe in Bangladesh. 
The net entitlement reserves position has also decreased 
by 0.6 mmboe from 254.5 mmboe to 253.9 mmboe. The 2009 
production was replaced primarily due to the reserves additions 
and revisions from CIL. These additions and revisions are a 
direct consequence of the ongoing development programmes 
on the Mangala, Ravva and Lakshmi oilfields and reflect an 
increased number of approved development wells and 
completed subsurface studies. 
The Group’s net entitlement interest to reserves is significantly 
geared to the oil price assumption used and the potential 
movement in reserves at different long-term oil prices is 
shown below.

Rajasthan (Block RJ-ON-90/1)  
(Cairn India 70% (Operator); ONGC 30%)
Cairn and its JV partner ONGC have 3,111 km
2
 under long- 
term contract in Rajasthan. The main field development 
area covers 1,859 km
2
 and the Bhagyam and Kameshwari 
development areas cover 430 km
2
 and 822 km
2
 respectively.
The phased integrated development plan for the block, which 
includes gas, water and pipeline operations, is focused on the 
Mangala field with the MPT; the hub through which all facilities 
will be connected. 
Development – Upstream 
The MPT is designed to process crude from the MBA fields and, 
when completed, will have initial capacity to handle 205,000 
bopd of crude with scope for further expansion. 
Four MPT Processing Trains are being built to ensure that 
Cairn is able to produce and process the presently approved 
peak plateau production of 175,000 bopd. 
Train 1, with a capacity to process 30,000 bopd, has been 
commissioned and handles current Mangala production. The 
crude oil is being evacuated via road trucks to the Gujarat coast 
for onward transport to MRPL and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) 
refineries, using heated crude oil tankers.  22  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Mangala production will continue to build during the ramp-up 
phase; Q4 2009 average gross production was 15,430 bopd 
and current production is ~20,000 bopd.
All equipment for Train 2 (capacity of 50,000 bopd) has been 
erected with commissioning underway. Construction of Train 3 
(50,000 bopd capacity) is now in the pre-commissioning stage. 
Trains 1, 2 and 3 combined are targeting a capacity of 130,000 
bopd at the MPT by H1 2010. Work on the well pads, in-field 
pipelines, processing facilities, buildings, power generation  
and associated utilities are at an advanced stage of completion. 
Construction of the Raageshwari gas terminal and the
Thumbli water field (saline aquifer) has been completed. 
Development drilling and well completion activities are 
currently underway with two drilling rigs and one completion 
rig operating in the Mangala development area. A third drilling
rig has commenced operations. To date 50 development 
wells on Mangala have been drilled, of which 38 have been
completed and made ready for initial production. Six of 
these were horizontal wells.
The results from all of the wells drilled to date confirm the 
excellent reservoir quality, the lateral extent and the high 
deliverability potential of the Fatehgarh formation reservoirs. 
Pipeline
The total length of the MPT to Salaya pipeline of ~600 km,  
which passes through the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, has 
been laid and hydro-tested and is now being commissioned. 
All of the Above Ground Installations (AGIs) from MPT to 
the Intermediate Pumping Terminal (IPT) at Viramgam are 
constructed and pre-commissioned. Gas has been introduced 
in this section to enable commissioning of all AGIs and this 
will be completed in H1 2010.
All AGIs from Viramgam to Salaya are in the pre-commissioning 
phase, with the introduction of gas and commissioning of this 
section scheduled for H1 2010.
Works on the spur lines at Radhanpur to connect to IOC facilities 
and, at Salaya for both the Essar and Reliance refineries, are also 
reaching mechanical completion.
Rajasthan – Sales 
The GoI had nominated MRPL and IOC for the offtake of 
initial crude quantities from the Rajasthan Block for 2009-10 
and 2010-11.
These initial crude oil sales arrangements to Public Sector 
Undertakings (MRPL, IOC) have now been supplemented  
by sales to RIL at Jamnagar and the Essar Group at Vadinar 
following the decision of the GoI to allow private refiners  
to qualify as additional offtakers of the Rajasthan crude.
Prior to the completion of the pipeline the current production  
is being trucked to the Gujarat coast and then shipped to  
MRPL and RIL. To date more than three million barrels of  
crude from Mangala have been delivered to the refiners. 
The GoI has also approved the establishment of additional/
multiple Delivery Points at Radhanpur and Viramgam for sales 
to IOC’s Panipat and Koyali refineries respectively. 
Commercial terms and pricing have been concluded with 
IOC, MRPL, RIL and Essar. This pricing is based on comparable 
low sulphur crude frequently traded in the region – Bonny 
Light – with appropriate adjustments for crude quality. 
The implied price realisation represents an average 10% to 15% 
discount to Brent on the basis of prices prevailing for the last 
12 months to February 2010. 
The oil from Rajasthan is categorised as medium gravity and 
is of a sweet grade with low sulphur content of about 0.1% by 
weight. While the crude has a high pour point and viscosity due 
to its waxy nature, it makes an excellent secondary processing 
feedstock for refiners.
Discussions are in progress with the GoI to allocate  
additional volumes.
Resource Base including Enhanced Oil Recovery
The current assessment of the EOR resource base is more 
than 300 mmbbls of incremental recoverable oil from the MBA 
fields. The EOR field pilot trials in Mangala have started and 
are expected to run for the next 18 months.

The Barmer Hill formation which lies above the Fatehgarh 
Formation reservoir across the basin holds significant potential 
in tighter reservoir rocks (lower permeabilities). A successful 
hydro-fraccing campaign in three Raageshwari Deep gas  
wells was carried out across 10 gas zones. 
After treatment the first well test in Raag-14 proved a gas rate 
of 15.7 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (mmscfd),  
the highest ever in the field. This significant encouragement at 
Raageshwari indicates the potential for improved frac designs 
which could be applied to the low permeability reservoirs of  
the Barmer Hill Formation. The initial frac programme on the 
Barmer Hill is planned in 2010.
Exploration
There remains a significant and as yet untested prospective 
resource potential to pursue across the Rajasthan Barmer Basin 
and detailed technical work continues to assess existing and 
new plays in this asset.

CAIRN INDIA – PRODUCING ASSETS
Cambay Basin – Western India
CB-OS/2 (Cairn India 40% (Operator))
Average gross production from Block CB/OS-2 for 2009 was 
13,158 boepd (comprising average gas production of 25 mmscfd 
and average oil/condensate production of 8,980 bopd). The 
application of advanced geophysical tools has helped map thin 
oil sands which are beyond seismic resolution. These techniques 
have resulted in the continuing evolvement of the CB/OS-2  
block from a gas producing asset to one with predominantly  
oil production.
Krishna-Godavari Basin – Eastern India 
Ravva (Cairn India 22.5% (Operator))
Average gross production from the Ravva field for 2009
was 43,224 boepd (comprising average oil production 
of 34,886 bopd and average gas production of 50 mmscfd). 
Cairn is confident of the Ravva field’s considerable remaining 
reserve potential and of producing more oil from this block 
before the expiry of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) 
primary term in 2019. Cairn and its joint venture (JV) partners 
have commenced a 4D seismic campaign to identify by-passed  
oil zones within the field and there remains scope for further 
reserve additions through infill drilling.
GREENLAND
West Disko Blocks
Cairn is planning to carry out an oil and gas exploration 
drilling programme of up to four exploration wells in the 
Disko West Area offshore west Greenland in the summer 
of 2010. This programme follows on from 2D seismic surveys 
acquired in 2008 and 2009 as well as additional surveys 
and ice monitoring programmes completed in 2009.

. 
Thirty prospects and leads have so far been identified 
on the acreage. The four well programme, targets a prospective 
resource of ~1.6 billion of risked gross mean oil in place and 
~385 mmbbls of risked resources, (16 billion of unrisked oil 
in place and 4.1 billion bbls unrisked resources). The initial
prospects, which lie in water depths of between 300 and 700 
metres, are estimated to have a 7% to 14% chance of success 
based on an assessment of basin and individual prospect risks. 
The 2010 drilling programme will utilise a dual rig strategy and 
therefore has some flexibility built into the programme.
The primary rig the Stena Forth is a ‘state-of-the-art’ high 
efficiency, sixth generation dynamically positioned drillship.  
The second rig, the Stena Don, is a fifth generation dynamically 
positioned semi-submersible. Both rigs are designed and 
equipped for working in harsh environments. 
The drillship will be mobilised in June 2010. The semi- 
submersible rig may be mobilised at the end of June  
to commence drilling the first of two wells by the third  
week in July. All four wells are expected to be completed  
in October.
A number of vessels have been selected to provide additional 
operational support and to provide cover for emergency 
response, rig stand-by, ice management, anchor handling,  
oil spill response and re-supply operations.
Southern Greenland
The acceleration of the exploration programme off the west 
Greenland coast will allow Cairn to plan and focus a potential 
2011 wildcat drilling programme on the previously unmapped 
and undrilled basins off the coast of southern Greenland. 
Further 2D seismic and well site surveys will be carried out 
across these blocks in 2010.
Baffin Bay Bid Round
As part of the strategy to secure further acreage in Greenland, 
Cairn has also pre-qualified as an Operator for the Baffin Bay  
Bid Round, which is due to close in May 2010.
BANGLADESH
Production and Development
In 2009, the Sangu gas field continued to maintain an enviable 
record for safety and low cost production even though 
production is well into decline. In order to increase and extend 
field production, an onshore compressor was installed and 
commissioned at the Sangu Plant in Chittagong in July 2009.  
This compression project was completed on time and on budget 
and is expected to increase gas recovery by 5 billion cubic feet 
(bcf) over the remaining field life. In addition, a well intervention 
campaign is currently underway aimed at maintaining and 
increasing production from four of the Sangu wells. 
Exploration
In Block 16, Cairn and its JV partner Santos commenced  
a 2,702 km 3D survey over the Magnama discovery in  
January 2010.
MEDITERRANEAN
An exploration well, targeting a 20 million bbl unrisked 
exploration prospect in the Louza block, Tunisia was

PRODUCTION, REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT
All numbers are stated before the impact of the  
exceptional items.
Group oil and gas revenues for the period were $234m, 
compared with $299m in 2008. The fall in revenues was  
a result of the natural decline in gross production levels from  
the existing producing fields combined with the lower price 
environment throughout 2009. This was partially offset by 
production from Rajasthan which commenced in August  
2009, a milestone achievement for the Group. Average 
production per day on an entitlement basis for Rajasthan  
from August to December was 9,891 boepd.
Excluding the impact of Rajasthan, average entitlement 
production fell by 19% to 10,416 boepd (2008: 12,801 boepd). 
Overall, annual production including Rajasthan increased to 
13,803 boepd, of which oil accounted for 71% (2008: 54%). 
Total production costs, at $62m, includes closing stock  
of $20m for Rajasthan crude and pre-award costs of $22m 
(2008: $14m). Adjusting for the closing stock balance and 
pre-award costs, average costs per boe have increased from 
$11.22 to $12.31. The increase is primarily attributable to first 
production from Rajasthan, which is being delivered through 
trucking. On commencement of delivery by pipeline Cairn  
expects average production costs per barrel to fall. 
Unsuccessful exploration costs of $57m for the year relate to: 
general exploration costs carried against the Rajasthan block; 
the relinquishment of certain blocks; and a number of dry 
exploration wells in India.
Total depletion and decommissioning charges have increased 
from $48m to $60m. The depletion and decommissioning charge 
per boe has also increased from $10.16 per boe to $11.92 per boe. 
Both increases are a result of Rajasthan production. The depletion 
and decommissioning rate per boe is calculated using booked 
reserves. In Rajasthan, if the planned EOR and Barmer Hill trials 
are successful, Cairn expects to increase the Group’s booked 
reserves. Consequently, the depletion and decommissioning 
rate per boe would decrease accordingly.
Gross profit for the year was $54m (2008: $137m). 
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
All numbers are stated before the impact of the  
exceptional items.
Administrative expenses include charges for share-based 
payments of $24m (2008: $23m) and for depreciation and 
amortisation of $8m (2008: $10m). Net of these charges, 
administrative expenses remain in line year-on-year.
Net finance income for the year was $11m (2008: $42m). Finance 
income received, mainly bank interest, was $43m (2008: $66m). 
Finance costs have increased from $24m to $32m, primarily as  
a result of an increase in foreign exchange losses of $10m. 30  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Continued
Total tax for the year was a credit of $67m (2008: $74m charge). 
This includes a current tax charge of $36m (2008: $14m)  
offset by a deferred tax credit of $103m (2008: $60m charge). 
The increase in the current tax charge reflects an increase in  
the Indian minimum alternative tax (MAT) rate from ~11% to  
~16%. The deferred tax credit arises from changes to Indian  
tax legislation regarding the basis on which tax holidays can  
be claimed and an increase in the MAT carry forward period 
from seven years to 10 years. These changes were enacted  
in July 2009.
Reported profit before exceptional items for the year was  
$53m (2008: $11m). 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Ravva Arbitration
The calculation of the GoI’s share of petroleum produced from 
the Ravva field has been disputed for some years. In January 
2009, the GoI instructed the buyers of the Ravva crude not to 
pass over the revenues to Cairn until such time as they believed 
that the liability had been settled in full. As a result, Cairn has 
provided for the full $96m liability and continues to seek 
recovery of these revenues through legal channels. 
 
1. The MPT, Rajasthan
2. Loading trucks at the MPT
3. Monitoring production at the MPT

Share-based Payments
In December 2009, Cairn’s shareholders approved the conversion 
of notional ‘Units’ in the Capricorn Group awarded in 2007 and 
2008 into incentives over Cairn Energy PLC shares. Consequently, 
a non-cash charge of $30m has been recognised in the Income 
Statement as a result of this modification. A similar and final 
charge is expected in the next financial year.
Dyas Transaction
On 30 November, Cairn announced the acquisition of the  
9.99% minority interest held by Dyas in Capricorn Oil Limited. 
Total consideration for the purchase of the Capricorn shares  
was $103m, payable in $91m PLC shares, $4m cash and the 
transfer of 15% of Capricorn’s working interests in the Tunisian 
and Albanian licences. This transaction resulted in a post-tax 
loss of $102m, being the difference between the implied value  
of the Tunisian assets acquired by Dyas and their carrying value 
in the financial statements. Under IFRS, the implied gain on  
the Albanian assets acquired by Dyas has not been recognised 
in these financial statements. In addition, IFRS requires 
recognition of $63m of goodwill, being the difference between 
the consideration paid to Dyas and the book value of the 
minority interest acquired.
PETRONAS Transaction
In October 2009, Cairn entered into an agreement with 
PETRONAS to dispose of a further 2.3% of the Group’s holding in 
CIL and farm-out a 10% interest in each of the six Cairn-operated 
Greenland exploration licences for a total cash consideration  
of $310m. This resulted in a post-tax accounting gain of $197m. 
$64m of the cash, the majority of the element pertaining to the 
farm-out, was received in February 2010 following approval of  
the transaction by the Greenlandic authorities.
The impact of these exceptional items is separately disclosed  
on the face of the Group Income Statement and further details 
can be found in Note 6 of the Notes to the Accounts. Their 
effect is to increase the loss before tax by $47m and increase 
profit after tax by $10m.  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  31  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
CASH FLOW, CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND LIQUIDITY
Post-tax cash inflow from operating activities has fallen by  
26% from $150m to $111m. The fall is a result of the withheld 
Ravva revenues, although this has been partially offset by the 
operating cash flows generated from Rajasthan and positive 
working capital movements.
During the year, CIL completed ~$1.6bn refinancing for  
the Rajasthan development consisting of a US Dollar facility  
for $750m and an INR facility for 40bn Rupees. The debt is 
repayable over six years and the first repayment will be due  
in 2012. The debt was successfully syndicated with a total  
of 14 international and Indian banks.
Major inflows during the year arose from the 5% share placing by 
PLC raising $158m (net of expenses), the PETRONAS transaction 
raising $241m (net of expenses) and from the drawdown of a 
further $190m of the CIL loan facility, taking the total debt drawn 
at the year end to $690m (shown gross of prepaid finance costs 
offset against debt under IFRS). A further $64m was received 
from PETRONAS in February 2010 following final approval of  
its 10% farm-in to the Greenland acreage from the Greenlandic 
authorities. The Group also earned interest on cash balances  
of $39m (2008: $51m).
Cash outflow on capital expenditure is set out in the table below:
    2009 2008  
    $m $m
Exploration/appraisal expenditure   128 125
Development/producing expenditure  785 494
Other capital expenditure   6 5
Throughout 2009, the Group’s capital expenditure programme 
continued to be focused on the Rajasthan development. This 
will continue into 2010 where the capital budget is in the region 
of $1bn.
With first production achieved from Rajasthan in August 
2009, the Group’s capital programme for 2010 will also 
target the potentially transformational exploration portfolio
in Greenland. Two drilling units have been secured and the 
current programme envisages the drilling of four exploration 
wells and 2,500 km of 2D seismic in the second half of 2010. 
The capital programme for Greenland in 2010 is expected 
to cost up to $420m.
At 31 December 2009, Group net cash balances, gross of 
prepaid finance costs offset against debt under IFRS, were 
approximately $500m. CIL had net debt of $96m and undrawn 
loan facilities of $923m. PLC/Capricorn’s net cash balances  
were $596m.
Further details of the Group financial risk management objectives 
and policies can be found in Note 29 of the Notes to the Accounts.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have considered the financial and operational 
risks relevant to support a statement of going concern. They 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
financial resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.  
In addition, the Group has several options to add to its cash 
reserves to allow the ongoing exploration programme in 
Greenland to continue.
FINANCIAL STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
The Board continues to focus the Group’s capital resources 
to maximise shareholder value and maintain financial and 
operational flexibility. 
CIL’s resources continue to be targeted on delivering the 
Rajasthan project where initial cash flows will be reinvested 
in the block. 
The enhanced financial strength of the Group has also 
enabled Cairn to accelerate the programme in Greenland, 
where a successful exploration campaign this summer 
could be transformational.

A SKILLED TEAM MANAGING BUSINESS RISKS
Given the nature of the oil and gas exploration and production 
business, getting risk management right is an essential 
component of business success at Cairn. 
At the highest level, Cairn’s strategy is to establish commercial 
reserves from strategic positions in high potential exploration 
plays, resulting in the creation and delivery of shareholder 
wealth. In pursuing this strategy Cairn considers investment 
opportunities that provide the right mix of political, commercial 
and technical risks. Cairn’s success in South Asia over the past 
20 years has been achieved through having the confidence in 
Cairn’s technical and commercial acumen and ability to identify, 
assess and effectively manage uncertainties. Cairn will also 
knowingly take informed risks which are appropriate for the 
component parts of the business in pursuit of Cairn’s vision. 
Cairn has recently acquired a large acreage position in 
Greenland where it will seek to replicate its earlier and 
continued success in South Asia.
Since the IPO in early 2007 , the Group’s activities in India have 
been managed by Cairn India, a majority-owned subsidiary  
of Cairn Energy PLC listed in India. Outside of Cairn India,  
the Group manages its operations through its unlisted  
wholly-owned subsidiary Capricorn. 
Business risks across the Group are addressed in a systematic 
way through a risk management structure shown opposite 
and within an integrated business risk management process  
that puts in place controls to mitigate these risks. More detail  
on Cairn’s approach to risk management is provided in the 
Internal Control section of the Corporate Governance 
Statement on pages 59 and 60. 
Our principal risks, uncertainties and mitigation strategies 
as at the end of 2009 are summarised below:
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERT AINTIES

Risk: 
Strategy fails to create shareholder 
value or meet shareholder expectations
Mitigation:  
Our strategy is focused on the development of our production base in India and  
our potentially high impact exploration position in Greenland. We have regular, 
open and transparent communications with all stakeholders to ensure there is  
a clear understanding of the Group and its strategy (risks and potential rewards).
In addition, we protect our strategic alignment with our listed subsidiary, CIL, 
through our controlling shareholding and our representation on the CIL Board,  
all of which is underpinned by a formal Relationship Agreement.
Risk: 
Ineffective capital allocation
Mitigation: 
Regular reviews of the risk and reward potential across the asset base of the Group.
Mitigation: 
Competitive remuneration and incentivisation policies and staff appraisal,  
training and development programmes. Executive and senior management 
succession planning.

and production assets.
Risk: 
Shortfall in operational cash flow,  
through lower than expected oil  
prices or production levels
Mitigation: 
Scenario planning for both oil price and production volumes is a key feature of our 
business planning process, which provides comfort on our funding headroom.
Mitigation: 
Compliance matrices and legal, financial, supply chain and operational due diligence  
to minimise the potential for inadequate processes leading to disputes.
Risk: 
Potential impact of disputes resulting  
from different interpretation of fiscal,  
legal agreements or regulations, leading  
to additional costs, increased taxation  
and failure to achieve cost recovery

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Responsible behaviour is integral to Cairn’s operations. As  
an oil and gas exploration and production company that aims  
to create value for all its stakeholders, we are committed to 
improving the lives of the people in the communities in which 
we operate through the integration of economic prosperity, 
social development and environmental protection. 
Cairn’s approach to CR management and 2009 performance 
is summarised in the following section. In previous years Cairn 
also issued a separate Group CR Report with more detailed 
descriptions and performance data; for 2009 this is provided  
on the Cairn website at www.cairnenergy.com. Environmental 
Resource Management (ERM) has also provided limited 
assurance of the contents of the 2009 CR Report and a 
statement of their findings is available on the website.
2009 CR HIGHLIGHTS
Production from the Mangala Field in Rajasthan commenced 
in August 2009, beginning the generation of substantial 
predicted revenues for both local and national economies
A three fold increase in total people employed in Cairn 
Group’s activities to 72 million man-hours (2008: 24 million 
man-hours) due primarily to construction activities in Rajasthan
Despite significant effort invested in site HSE supervision, 
safety training and providing protective equipment, 
regrettably there were three fatalities among contractors 
working in the Rajasthan construction and production 
operations
Cairn Group’s 2009 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) 
was 0.26 (2008: 0.25) a small increase over 2008 and lower 
than in the wider upstream oil and gas industry as reported 
by OGP (2008: 0.55)
Good progress made in the acquisition of permanent and 
‘right of use’ land for the Mangala pipeline in India, while 
protecting the rights and livelihoods of local landowners
Continuing initiatives to stimulate local development and 
support local communities in Rajasthan via our Enterprise 
Centre and rural dairy development projects in Barmer
Exploration seismic and survey activities in Arctic  
waters offshore Greenland completed without safety  
or environmental incidents
Cairn’s Group CR Policies, Guiding Principles and  
Human Rights Handbook updated and new Biodiversity 
Guidelines prepared.
OUR APPROACH TO CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The complexity and scale of our business raises a variety of CR 
issues at local, national and international level. Cairn is conscious 
that its operations, especially in regions of economic, social 
or environmental sensitivity, may have impacts on staff, 
contractors, local communities and the environment.
Consequently, Cairn is committed to developing and 
maintaining a sustainable approach to its business strategy 
by conducting all its activities in a responsible manner. 
Our CR strategy is based on our core values of Respect, 
Relationships and Responsibility. These are at the heart of all  
we do in the conduct of our business and we believe that it is 
only through responsible business practices that we will ensure  
a sustainable business. 
Our Group CR Policies and Guiding Principles, both reviewed  
and updated in 2009, lie at the heart of all we do in the conduct  
of our business. The Group CR Guiding Principles are consistent 
with the United Nations (UN) Global Compact Guiding Principles 
and are available to download at www.cairnenergy.com. They are 
promoted to staff, partners, suppliers and contractors to help 
ensure a sustainable business culture.
Our Group CR Guiding Principles are based on the value 
of responsible behaviour across our different stakeholder 
groups, namely:
Behaving responsibly in all our business relationships
Behaving responsibly to our people
Behaving responsibly towards the environment
Behaving responsibly to society
CORPORA TE RESPONSIBILITY
“ During 2009, Cairn concentrated on eight  
key areas of business practice identified  
as having high significance through  
our business risk management and  
stakeholder engagement processes. ”

CORPORA TE RESPONSIBILITY
Continued
To support the delivery of the commitments made in these  
CR Policies and Guiding Principles, we implement a Group CR 
Management System (CRMS), which is supported by detailed 
procedures and guidelines. Applying the Group CRMS to all 
our business activities is essential in maintaining our ‘licence  
to operate’ and building our business reputation.
Our Group CRMS is consistent with the international 
environmental management standard ISO 14001, and we  
have successfully retained certification to this standard at  
our production sites at Sangu in Bangladesh and Ravva and 
Suvali in India. 
OUR PROGRESS IN 2009  
Cairn’s activities in India and the associated CR strategy are 
managed by Cairn India, a majority-owned subsidiary of Cairn 
listed in India and based in Gurgaon. Outside of Cairn India,  
the Group manages CR impacts of its operations in Greenland, 
the Mediterranean and South Asia through its unlisted wholly-
owned subsidiary Capricorn, which is delivered by an asset-led 
matrix organisation based in Edinburgh.
Cairn India
Cairn India is a key player in oil and gas exploration and 
production in the region and is expected to operate over  
20% of India’s domestic oil production by 2011. In 2009, 
production began at the Mangala oilfield, which will contribute 
significantly to local and national economies over the course of 
its lifetime. Key CR challenges in Cairn India include community 
development, land acquisition, access to water and security  
of installations. 
Cairn India takes a proactive approach to managing CR issues, 
working closely with local communities to ensure they are 
active partners in its activities and that it balances social 
and environmental needs. 
Cairn (excluding Cairn India)
The exploration activities in the waters off Greenland involve 
significant CR challenges. These range from health and safety 
issues resulting from operating in harsh climatic conditions, 
to meeting the expectations of local people, through to 
minimising potential environmental and biodiversity impacts. 
In the Mediterranean and South Asia assets, CR activities in 
2009 included EIAs in Albania and Bangladesh prior to seismic 
surveys and preparing for drilling operations in Tunisia.
During 2009, we concentrated CR activities across the Group 
on eight priority areas:
Stakeholder Engagement
Business Ethics
Environmental Impact
Climate Change
Employee Development
Occupational Health and Safety
Community and Suppliers
Human Rights
The following sections discuss the steps taken during 2009 
in each of these priority areas.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We strive to develop mutually beneficial relationships with 
all stakeholder groups as one of our CR Guiding Principles.  
Our activities are influenced by, and can impact, many different 
stakeholders at local, national and international levels. 
Our Group CRMS provides guidelines for country, asset and 
project managers to identify stakeholder groups and to develop 
effective stakeholder engagement strategies. For every project 
we undertake, stakeholder engagement strategies are outlined 
within Public Consultation and Disclosure Plans (PCDP). A key 
element of each PCDP is the defining of a clear stakeholder issues 
procedure through which concerns can be voiced and addressed.

2 1
In 2009, a new PCDP and a CR Plan were developed for the 
3D seismic programme in Bangladesh. Cairn India, Greenland 
and Albania also have PCDPs in place, while in Tunisia the 
PCDP was updated in January 2010 to reflect our drilling 
programme commencing in March 2010.
In Greenland, we are committed to an ongoing process 
of stakeholder engagement. In consultation with the Bureau  
of Minerals and Petroleum (BMP), we are currently undertaking  
a detailed EIA and SIAs of the offshore drilling exploration 
programme planned for summer 2010. Through this we aim  
to agree mutually beneficial solutions and provide a forum 
through which stakeholders can share their views and air  
any possible issues.
In 2009, Cairn India continued to pioneer a proactive approach 
to stakeholder engagement in the region. We continue to 
interact positively with communities in the Barmer region 
of Rajasthan through initiatives run by the Enterprise Centre, 
established and funded by Cairn India in partnership with  
the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC)  
and the Government of Rajasthan.
The creation of the Mangala Development Pipeline, which 
runs from the Rajasthan oilfield to the Gujarat coast at Bhogat 
through two Indian states and approximately 250 villages, 
raises important issues with regards to land acquisition. 
In 2009, we continued to secure mutually beneficial agreements 
with landowners for both ‘Right of Use’ and permanent land 
acquisition through a cooperative and transparent approach 
which goes beyond statutory requirements. The careful 
consideration of landowner rights and issues in this process 
means that the successful and peaceful conclusion of ‘Right of 
Use’ acquisition involving more than 25,000 land users should 
be achieved by the end of 2010.
BUSINESS ETHICS
We are committed to behaving with honesty and integrity 
in all our business activities wherever we operate. We are 
aware of the potentially damaging impact of corruption on our 
business, in particular because we operate in some countries 
with a relatively low ranking on the Transparency International 
2008 Corruption Perceptions Index. As a result, we need 
to be particularly vigilant that we operate with the highest 
standards of integrity at all times.
In May 2009, a revised Group Code of Business Ethics and 
a Whistleblowing Policy was approved and implemented across 
our business, supported by a comprehensive communications 
campaign to make all employees aware of their responsibilities  
as representatives of Cairn. All employees are provided with 
their own copy of the Code prior to joining the Company  
and are required to formally agree to it as a condition of 
employment. Breaches of the Code are reported to the Chief 
Executive’s Committee. Further steps are planned in 2010 
towards addressing potential risks of bribery and corruption  
in our business activities.
Given the significance of the revenues paid to government and 
the value of contracts awarded as a result of our operations,  
we strive to act with integrity, honesty and transparency at 
all times. We publish details of the tax and royalty payments 
made to governments around the world by the Group in the 
2009 CR Report. 38  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Our business operations can have an impact on the environment, 
and we place a high priority on mitigating this risk, especially as 
some of our exploration and production acreage lie in areas of 
environmental significance. Behaving responsibly towards the 
environment forms an integral part of our CR Guiding Principles, 
which include seeking to avoid negative impacts on the 
environment, striving to prevent pollution and working to  
ensure no net loss of biodiversity.
In 2009, we completed our seismic and survey activities  
in preparation for drilling in 2010 in Greenland without 
environmental incident. The surveys acquired significant 
information on the particular environmental challenges  
of working in this unique and harsh environment. 
In 2009, we also began the process of developing a detailed  
EIA in consultation with key local stakeholders in Greenland, 
which is due to be completed in 2010 prior to any drilling 
activities commencing. EIA and SIAs were also conducted for 
the trucking operation in Rajasthan and Gujarat and for the 
offshore 3D seismic survey in Sri Lanka.
Across Cairn Group, we continued to monitor, manage and report 
air emissions of greenhouse gases and energy usage, achieving 
reduced emissions from the production plant in Sangu due to the 
implementation of third stage gas compression. Emissions across 
our production activities in Cairn India have increased by 5% over 
last year’s levels with the start of production in Rajasthan. 
Comprehensive spill prevention measures are implemented  
to mitigate potential environmental risks resulting from our 
activities, and detailed spill contingency plans are in place 
should any incident occur. These are supported by dedicated 
resources, equipment and training activities. 
There were two minor spills totalling 0.07 bbls (12 litres) 
reported from our 2009 operations at Sangu, and in Cairn India, 
there were three minor oil spills totalling 12 bbls (1,900 litres) and 
one chemical spill of 2 bbls (318 litres). To reduce the risk of spills 
from road transportation in India, Cairn India set up a safety 
management system in 2009 which includes a road risk survey, 
detailed tanker specifications and driver competency testing. 
CLIMATE CHANGE
Cairn acknowledges the potential adverse effects of climate 
change on a global scale and the role we have as a responsible 
business in responding to this complex issue. Our climate 
change strategy is one of our CR Guiding Principles and  
we continue to focus on four key elements: measurement, 
verification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions; 
maintaining energy and emissions efficiency; demonstrating 
informed and transparent action on climate change; and 
contributing to programmes that address the environmental  
and social impacts of climate change.
EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT
People are at the heart of everything we do, and this focus is 
strongly reflected in our CR approach. Our priorities include 
protecting our people’s health, safety and security, providing 
them with a supportive workplace in which diversity and 
equality are respected and valued, and in which they are given 
support and opportunities to develop to their full potential. 
At a Group level, the key focus areas in 2009 were the review  
of the HR policies, which led to enhancements covering such 
issues as flexible working hours, maternity leave, childcare 
vouchers policy and employee volunteering, engagement  
with our staff in our Edinburgh Head Office and developing  
the organisation to support the 2010 work programme. The 
Employee Opinion Survey in late 2008 identified areas requiring 
attention and a number of initiatives have been implemented 
during 2009 to address these. A follow-up survey carried out  
in the first quarter of 2010 will determine the progress that we 
have made in the relationship with our employees. 
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
We recognise the inherent potential risks associated with 
the exploration for and production of hydrocarbons and our 
responsibility to protect our employees and contractors from 
all work-related injuries and illnesses. The assessment of health 
and safety risks associated with our activities, and the design 
and implementation of robust measures to mitigate such 
risks, are key elements of our CRMS.
During 2009, in Cairn India there was a threefold increase in 
the number of people working on the construction activities 
on the MPT facility covering 1.6 km
2
 and ~600 km long pipeline 
to Salaya. At their peak, there were up to 16,000 workers 
involved in these projects and approximately 63 million  
man-hours were recorded.

Despite significant effort invested in site supervision, safety 
training and providing protective equipment, regrettably there 
were three fatalities among contractors and vendors associated 
with our Rajasthan construction and production operations. 
One of the fatalities occurred during welding operations within 
the MPT facility and the other two occurred outside of the 
Cairn sites through a crane accident at the pipeline contractor’s 
maintenance yard and as a result of a contractor road tanker 
accident on the open highway in Gujarat. All incidents were 
fully investigated and recommendations to minimise the 
chance of a re-occurrence implemented.
The seismic and survey activities in Greenland and Albania were 
completed without injuries. There was however a lost time injury 
at the Sangu plant in Bangladesh in early 2009; our first in the 
Sangu plant in 10 years.
Cairn Group’s 2009 LTIFR of 0.26 (2008: 0.25) and Total 
Recordable Incident Frequency Rate (TRIFR) of 0.64 (2008: 0.68) 
were similar to performance in 2008 and remain lower than in 
the wider upstream oil and gas industry as reported by OGP , 
where the most recent available figures (2008) for LTIFR and 
TRIFR were 0.55 and 2.02. 
In India, we continue to work extensively with contractors to 
address the management of health and safety issues and we 
have invested in road safety training for contractors engaged 
in the transport of crude oil from the Mangala oilfield.
COMMUNITY AND SUPPLIERS
In the areas in which we operate, we aim to contribute to 
community and social development by behaving responsibly 
in all our business relationships and towards society. In addition 
to our business activities, which provide energy, infrastructure, 
employment and trade with local enterprises, we seek to 
add value to communities through focused social investment.
SIAs are undertaken prior to major projects commencing and 
seek to engage with local communities and to provide a forum 
in which concerns can be addressed and mutually beneficial 
solutions agreed.
In 2009, we continued to support community development in 
Rajasthan, through initiatives run by the Enterprise Centre in the 
Barmer region, which is funded by Cairn in partnership with the 
IFC and Government of Rajasthan. These have included a rural 
development project, mobile health van, and child and maternal 
health programmes. 
Cairn, like other oil and gas exploration companies, outsources 
much of its activities to its supply chain. The majority of 
operational man-hours worked on behalf of Cairn are therefore 
completed by contractors, so their performance is vital to our 
overall performance.
In recent years, we have strengthened our relationships 
with existing suppliers and contractors, encouraging them 
to meet the standards required by our CR Policies and Guiding 
Principles. Major contractors in all locations are evaluated 
against these CR criteria prior to any contract being awarded. 
We also plan to implement a process in 2010 to monitor our 
contractors’ performance against the criteria following contract 
award to ensure that they deliver on their commitments.
HUMAN RIGHTS
At Cairn, we recognise human rights as fundamental and work 
continually to preserve the rights and conditions of all our 
stakeholders, including employees, suppliers and those affected 
by our activities. In Rajasthan, for example, we apply a ‘Rights 
Aware’ approach to safeguard the local community’s right to 
water in an area with limited water resources while accessing 
the water required to support our operations.
Respect for human rights is one of our CR Guiding Principles 
and we have recently updated our Human Rights Handbook 
to encourage best practice across our operations in this area.

2010 1,398,639,179 ordinary shares of 
8
⁄13 pence each have been issued and are fully paid up and are quoted on the London Stock 
Exchange. The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. There are no special 
control rights in relation to the Company’s shares and the Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Voting Rights
Subject to any special rights or restrictions attaching to any class of shares, at a general meeting or class meeting, on a show of hands, 
every member present in person and every duly appointed proxy entitled to vote shall have one vote and on a poll every member 
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every share held by him. In the case of joint holders of a 
share, the vote of the senior member who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the  
votes of the other joint holders and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register 
of members in respect of the joint holding. Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be  
a member of the Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting  
or class meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting or class meeting provided that each 
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A corporation which is a member 
of the Company may authorise one or more individuals to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company, 
or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares. A person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers 
on behalf of such corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company.
Restrictions on Voting
No member shall, unless the directors of the Company otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him/her  
to attend or vote at a general meeting of the Company either in person or by proxy if any call or other sum presently payable by 
him/her to the Company in respect of shares in the Company remains unpaid. Further, if a member has been served with a notice  
by the Company under the Companies Act requesting information concerning interests in shares and has failed in relation to any 
shares to provide the Company, within 14 days of the notice, with such information, the directors of the Company may determine 
that such member shall not be entitled in respect of such shares to attend or vote (either in person or by proxy) at any general 
meeting or at any separate general or class meeting of the holders of that class of shares. Proxy forms must be submitted not  
less than 48 hours (excluding, at the Board’s discretion, any part of any day that is a non-working day) before the time appointed  
for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting or, in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it was demanded,  
not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll at which it is to be used.
Variation of Rights
Whenever the share capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the special rights attached  
to any class may, subject to statute and unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights attached to the shares of that class,  
be varied or abrogated either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued 
shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares  
of that class. At every such separate general meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least 
one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class. These provisions apply to the variation or abrogation of the special 
rights attached to some only of the shares of any class as if the shares concerned and the remaining shares of such class formed 
separate classes. The rights attached to any class of shares shall, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of such 
shares or the terms upon which such shares are for the time being held, be deemed not to be varied or abrogated by the creation 
or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with or subsequent to the first mentioned shares or by the purchase by the Company  
of its own shares.
Transfer of Shares
Subject to any procedures set out by the directors in accordance with the Articles of Association, all transfers of shares shall be 
effected by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form acceptable to the directors of the Company.  
The instrument of transfer shall be executed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and (except in the case of fully paid shares) by,  
or on behalf of, the transferee. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name  
of the transferee is entered in the register of members of the Company. 
The directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share unless such share is listed on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities. The directors may also refuse to register a transfer of a share in uncertificated 
form where the Company is entitled to refuse (or is excepted from the requirement) under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
2001 to register the transfer and they may refuse any such transfer in favour of more than four transferees. The directors may also 
refuse to register any transfer of a share on which the Company has a lien.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Continued
The directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share  
in certificated form unless the relevant instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share, is duly stamped or adjudged  
or certified as not chargeable to stamp duty, is lodged at the transfer office or at such other place as the directors may determine,  
is accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the  
right of the transferor to make the transfer and is in favour of not more than four transferees jointly. If the directors refuse to register  
a transfer, they shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with  
the Company (in the case of a share in certificated form) or the date on which the operator-instruction (as defined in the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001) was received by the Company (in the case of a share in uncertificated form) (or in either case such longer 
or shorter period (if any) as the Listing Rules may from time to time permit or require), send to the transferee notice of the refusal.

circumstances, settlement terms are agreed prior to business taking place. Trade creditors of the Company at 31 December 2009 were 
equivalent to 24.4 days’ purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers to the Company during the year.

Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association, UK legislation and any directions given by special resolution,

of the Company’s shareholders.
Disclosure of Information to Auditors
The directors of the Company who held office at 31 December 2009 confirm that, as far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. In making this confirmation, the directors have taken appropriate steps  
to make themselves aware of the relevant audit information and that the Company’s auditors are aware of this information.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Continued
The following provides an explanation of the proposed resolutions. Resolutions 1 to 7 are proposed as ordinary resolutions. This means 
that for each of those resolutions to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. Resolutions 8 to 11 
are proposed as special resolutions. This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast 
must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Annual Report and Accounts
The directors must lay the Company’s accounts, the directors’ report and the auditor’s report before the shareholders in a general 
meeting. 
Resolution 2 – Remuneration Report
Listed companies are required to prepare a directors’ remuneration report and put a resolution to approve the report to the 
shareholders at the AGM. A copy of the Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 62 to 77 (inclusive) of this document.
Resolution 3 – Re-appointment and Remuneration of Auditors
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before shareholders, to hold office 
until the end of the next such meeting. Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as auditors and resolution  
3 proposes their re-appointment as the Company’s auditors and also seeks authority for the directors to decide the auditor’s 
remuneration. 
Resolutions 4 to 6 – Election/Re-Election of Directors
Malcolm Thoms, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson retire by rotation at the AGM in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election as directors. Hamish Grossart and Mark Tyndall will both retire  
by rotation at the AGM and will not be offering themselves for re-election. 
The directors’ biographies are set out on pages 42 and 43 of this document. The Company’s Articles of Association provide  
that directors can be appointed by the Company, by ordinary resolution or by the Board. The nomination committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on the appointment and replacement of directors. Further details of the rules governing the 
appointment and replacement of directors are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 52 to 61 and in the 
Company’s Articles of Association. An explanation of the performance evaluation procedure carried out by the Company is  
also contained in the Corporate Governance Statement, on page 53.
Resolution 7 – Authority to Allot Shares
Resolution 7 seeks to renew the directors’ power to allot shares. This resolution proposes that authority be granted in substitution  
of the existing authority to allot securities up to a maximum amount of £2,868,716.55, representing approximately 33.33% of the 
Company’s total issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 31 March 2010, being the latest practicable date  
prior to publication of this document.
Following guidance issued by the ABI in December 2008 and updated in November 2009, the Company is seeking an additional 
authority to allot securities in connection with a pre-emptive rights issue up to a maximum amount of £2,868,716.55, representing 
approximately 33.33% of the Company’s total issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 31 March 2010, being the 
latest practicable date prior to publication of this document. The benefit to the Company of obtaining such authority on an annual 
basis is that it would allow the Company to implement a rights issue of up to approximately 66.66% of the issued ordinary share capital 
without the need to call an additional general meeting. This would shorten the implementation timetable of such a rights issue.
The directors consider that the authorities sought pursuant to Resolution 7 are desirable to allow the Company to retain flexibility, 
although they have no present intention of exercising these authorities. The authorities will expire on 30 June 2011 or, if earlier,  
at the end of the next AGM of the Company to be held in 2011. 
As at 31 March 2010, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document, the Company did not hold any shares  
in treasury.
Resolution 8 – Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 provides that if the directors wish to allot any equity securities, or sell any treasury shares 
(if it holds any), for cash, it must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. Section 561 
does not apply to allotments of equity securities made in connection with an employee share scheme.
Resolution 8 seeks to give the directors power to allot equity securities or sell treasury shares for cash as if section 561 of  
the Companies Act 2006 did not apply, in connection with rights issues, open offers and other pre-emption offers pursuant  
to the authority granted by Resolution 7 , and otherwise up to a total amount of £430,350.52, representing approximately 5%  
of the Company’s total issued ordinary share capital as at 31 March 2010, being the latest practicable date prior to publication  
of this document. 
The power conferred by Resolution 8 will expire at the same time as the authority conferred by Resolution 7 , unless previously 
revoked, varied or extended by the Company in general meeting. 48  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

Resolution 9 – Market Purchase of Own Shares by the Company
If passed, Resolution 9 will authorise the Company to make market purchases of its own ordinary shares. Ordinary shares repurchased 
by the Company pursuant to such authority may be cancelled or held in treasury and then either sold (in whole or in part) for cash or 
cancelled (in whole or in part).
The directors intend to take advantage of the flexibility offered by this resolution as they deem appropriate. No dividends will be 
paid on treasury shares and no voting rights attach to them.
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares that may be purchased pursuant to the authority shall be approximately 14.99%  
of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2010, being 209,656,012 ordinary shares. The maximum price 
which may be paid for an ordinary share pursuant to this resolution (exclusive of expenses) shall be the higher of (i) an amount equal  
to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the Company’s ordinary shares for the five business days immediately 
preceding the date of purchase and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest 
current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System (SETs). The minimum  
price that may be paid for an ordinary share pursuant to this resolution (exclusive of expenses) shall be 
8
⁄13 pence, being the nominal 
value of an ordinary share.
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company will not repurchase shares in the period of 60 days immediately preceding the 
announcement of its interim results or the preliminary announcement of its annual results or, if shorter, the period from the end of 
the financial period concerned up to and including the time of a relevant announcement or, except in accordance with the Listing 
Rules, at any other time when, in terms of the Company’s dealing rules, the directors would be prohibited from dealing in shares.
This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
This authority will expire on the earlier of 19 November 2011 or the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2011, unless 
previously revoked, varied or renewed by the Company in general meeting. The directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at 
subsequent annual general meetings.
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares during 2009. As at 31 March 2010, options to subscribe for shares were 
outstanding over an aggregate of 5,731,581 ordinary shares (representing approximately 0.41% of the issued share capital of the 
Company as at 31 March 2010. If the outstanding amount of the existing buy-back authority granted at the 2009 AGM was utilised  
in full prior to the 2010 AGM and the new authority was granted at the 2010 AGM and was then utilised in full, the options outstanding 
at 31 March 2010 would represent approximately 0.58% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Resolution 10 – Adoption of New Articles of Association 
Resolution 10 proposes the adoption of new Articles of Association in order to update the Company’s current Articles of Association 
primarily to take account of the coming into force of the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 (the ‘Shareholders’ 
Rights Regulations’), the implementation of the last parts of the Companies Act 2006 and amendments to the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001. 
The principal changes introduced in the new Articles of Association are summarised below. Other changes, which are of a minor, 
technical or clarifying nature and also some more minor changes which merely reflect changes made by the Companies Act 2006, 
the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations or the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, or conform the language of the new Articles 
of Association with that used in the model Articles for public companies produced by the Department for Business, Innovation and 
Skills have not been noted below. The new Articles showing all the changes to the current Articles of Association are available for 
inspection, as noted on page 147 of this document.
The principal changes which would arise from the adoption of the proposed new Articles of Association are set out below.
1. The Company’s Objects
The provisions regulating the operations of the Company are currently set out in the Company’s memorandum and Articles  
of Association. The Company’s memorandum contains, among other things, the objects clause which sets out the scope of  
the activities the Company is authorised to undertake. This is drafted to give a wide scope.
The Companies Act 2006 significantly reduces the constitutional significance of a company’s memorandum. The Companies  
Act 2006 provides that a memorandum will record only the names of subscribers and the number of shares each subscriber has 
agreed to take in the company. Under the Companies Act 2006 the objects clause and all other provisions which are contained  
in a company’s memorandum, for existing companies at 1 October 2009, are deemed to be contained in the company’s articles  
of association but the company can remove these provisions by special resolution.
Further the Companies Act 2006 states that unless a company’s articles provide otherwise, a company’s objects are unrestricted. 
This abolishes the need for companies to have objects clauses. For this reason the Company is proposing to remove its objects 
clause together with all other provisions of its Memorandum which, by virtue of the Companies Act 2006, are treated as forming 
part of the Company’s Articles of Association as of 1 October 2009. Resolution 12 (a) confirms the removal of these provisions  
for the Company. As the effect of this resolution will be to remove the statement currently in the Company’s Memorandum of 
Association regarding limited liability, the new Articles of Association also contain an express statement regarding the limited 
liability of shareholders. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  49  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

2. Articles Which Duplicate Statutory Provisions
Provisions in the current Articles of Association which replicate provisions contained in the Companies Act 2006 are in the main 
amended to bring them into line with the Companies Act 2006. 
3. Change of Name
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company could only change its name by special resolution. Under the Companies Act 2006 a 
company will be able to change its name by other means provided for by its articles. To take advantage of this provision, the new 
Articles of Association enable the directors to pass a resolution to change the Company’s name.
4. Authorised Share Capital and Unissued Shares
The Companies Act 2006 abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and the new Articles  
of Association reflect this. Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any time allot because allotment 
authority continues to be required under the Companies Act 2006, save in respect of employee share schemes.
5. Redeemable Shares
Under the Companies Act 1985, if a company wished to issue redeemable shares, it had to include in its articles the terms and 
manner of redemption. The Companies Act 2006 enables directors to determine such matters instead provided they are so 
authorised by the articles. The new Articles of Association contain such an authorisation. The Company has no plans to issue 
redeemable shares but if it did so the directors would need shareholders’ authority to issue new shares in the usual way.
6. Authority to Purchase Own Shares, Consolidate and Sub-divide Shares, and Reduce Share Capital
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required specific enabling provisions in its articles to purchase its own shares, to 
consolidate or sub-divide its shares and to reduce its share capital or other undistributable reserves as well as shareholder authority 
to undertake the relevant action. The current Articles of Association include these enabling provisions. Under the Companies Act 
2006, a company will only require shareholder authority to do any of these things and it will no longer be necessary for articles to 
contain enabling provisions. Accordingly, where possible, the relevant enabling provisions have been removed in the new Articles  
of Association.
7. Use of Seals
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required authority in its articles to have an official seal for use abroad. Under the 
Companies Act 2006, such authority will no longer be required. Accordingly, the relevant authorisation has been removed in  
the new Articles of Association.
8. Suspension of Registration of Share Transfers
The current Articles of Association permit the directors to suspend the registration of transfers. Under the Companies Act 2006,  
share transfers must be registered as soon as practicable. The power in the current Articles of Association to suspend the registration 
of transfers is inconsistent with this requirement. Accordingly, this power has been removed in the new Articles of Association.
9. Vacation of Office by Directors
The current Articles of Association specify the circumstances in which a director must vacate office. The new Articles of Association 
update these provisions to reflect the approach taken on mental and physical incapacity in the model articles for public companies 
produced by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. 
10. Voting by Proxies on a Show of Hands
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations have amended the Companies Act 2006 so that it now provides that each proxy appointed  
by a member has one vote on a show of hands unless the proxy is appointed by more than one member, in which case the proxy has 
one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been instructed by one or more members to vote for the resolution and by one  
or more members to vote against the resolution. The current Articles of Association have been amended to reflect these changes.
11. Voting by Corporate Representatives
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations have amended the Companies Act 2006 in order to enable multiple representatives 
appointed by the same corporate member to vote in different ways on a show of hands and on a poll. The new Articles of 
Association contain provisions which reflect these amendments.
12. Chairman’s Casting Vote
The new Articles of Association remove the provision giving the Chairman a casting vote in the event of an equality of votes at  
a general meeting as this is no longer permitted under the Companies Act 2006.
13. Notice of General Meetings
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations amend the Companies Act 2006 to require the Company to give 21 clear days’ notice of 
general meetings unless the Company offers members an electronic voting facility and a special resolution reducing the period of 
notice to not less than 14 days has been passed. Annual general meetings must be held on 21 clear days’ notice. The new Articles  
of Association amend the provisions of the current Articles of Association to be consistent with the new requirements. 50  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Continued
14. Method of Giving Notice
The current Articles of Association provide that overseas shareholders who have not provided a UK postal address are not entitled 
to receive notices from the Company. The new Articles of Association clarify that overseas shareholders may not provide an 
electronic address for this purpose.
15. Adjournments for Lack of Quorum
Under the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations, general meetings adjourned for lack of 
quorum must be held at least 10 clear days after the original meeting. The current Articles of Association have been changed  
to reflect this requirement.
16. Voting Record Date
Under the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations the company must determine the right of 
members to vote at a general meeting by reference to the register not more than 48 hours before the time for the holding of the 
meeting, not taking account of days which are not working days. The current Articles of Association have been amended to reflect 
this requirement.
Resolution 11 – Notice of General Meetings 
Changes made to the Companies Act 2006 by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations increase the notice period required for  
general meetings of the Company to 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be  
less than 14 clear days. Annual general meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days notice.
Before the coming into force of the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations on 3 August 2009, the Company was able to call general 
meetings other than an AGM on 14 clear days notice without obtaining such shareholder approval. The directors believe that it is 
appropriate for the Company to retain the flexibility of being able to call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice and in order to preserve 
this ability, Resolution 11 seeks such approval. The flexibility offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account all the 
circumstances, the directors consider this appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the meeting. The approval will  
be effective until the Company’s next AGM in 2011, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. 
Recommendation
The Board considers that all the resolutions to be considered at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders 
as a whole and unanimously recommends that you vote in favour of all of the proposed resolutions, as they intend to do in respect of 
their own beneficial shareholdings.

CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE ST A TEMENT
Cairn is committed to achieving compliance with the principles and provisions set out in the Combined Code appended to the 
Listing Rules and to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are maintained. The Board considers that the Company  
is compliant with the Combined Code, other than in the areas detailed on page 61. 
Set out below is a statement of how the Company applied the principles of the Combined Code for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The Board
Cairn’s business is international in scope and carries political, commercial and technical risks. Accordingly, particular attention is  
paid to the composition and balance of the Board to ensure that it has wide experience of the sector and regulatory environment 
in which Cairn operates, and appropriate financial and risk management skills. In each Board appointment, whether executive or 
non-executive, the Board considers that objectivity and integrity, as well as skills, experience and ability that will assist the Board  
in its key functions, are prerequisites for appointment. 
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, five executive directors and five independent non-executive 
directors. The directors’ biographies are on pages 42 to 43. Hamish Grossart and Mark Tyndall both served as non-executive 
directors during the year but will be retiring at the AGM on 20 May 2010. The Board plans to appoint two new independent 
non-executive directors in the near future as replacements for Mr Grossart and Mr Tyndall.
Iain McLaren took over the role of Cairn’s senior independent non-executive director from Hamish Grossart on 19 May 2009. A key 
responsibility for the senior independent non-executive director is to be available to shareholders in the event that they may feel  
it inappropriate to relay views through the Chairman, Chief Executive or the Finance Director. In addition, the senior independent 
non-executive director takes the lead role when the non-executive directors assess the performance of the Chairman. 
All of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment to the Board and to re-election 
by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, any non-executive director who has served on the Board for more than 
nine years is subject to annual re-election. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board and was reviewed during 2009 to ensure it remains appropriate and effective. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. These reserved matters include determination  
of the overall strategy of the Group and approval of the annual report and accounts and any other financial statements, the  
Group’s annual budget and amendments to that budget over a particular amount, borrowing and security, acquisitions and 
disposals, capital expenditure over a specified amount, amendments to the organisational structure of the Group and Board, 
approval of significant changes to accounting policies and approval of management incentive schemes and Group policy on 
pensions. The schedule of matters reserved to the Board was also reviewed and updated during 2009.
The Board delegates the execution of its strategic objectives to the Chief Executive’s Committee, which comprises the executive 
directors and senior management. Operational management of the Group on a day-to-day basis is delegated to asset managers 
and functional heads of department.
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant information to enable it to perform its duties. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all corporate governance matters. In addition, each director has 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and Deputy Company Secretary. There is also a procedure agreed  
by the Board for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s 
expense, up to a pre-determined limit. 
During 2009, six scheduled meetings of the Board were held, four of which were held at the Company’s registered office in 
Edinburgh, with one meeting held in Greenland and another held in Rajasthan, India. Details of attendance at each of those 
meetings, and at meetings of Board committees, are set out on page 57 . 
During the year, a number of other meetings took place to deal with specific matters that required to be considered at short  
notice. When a specific matter requires consideration at short notice, there is a procedure that sets out when those matters must  
be considered at a short-notice Board meeting and when they may be dealt with by a committee of the Board (comprising at least 
two non-executive directors, one of whom must be the Chairman or the senior independent non-executive directors, and two 
executive directors). 
Any director who is physically unable to attend Board and committee meetings is given the opportunity to be consulted and 
comment in advance of the meeting by telephone or in writing. Video and telephone conferencing facilities are also used when 
directors are not able to attend meetings in person. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  53  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
The formal agenda for each scheduled Board meeting, which regularly includes presentations from senior operational management, 
is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary. In particular, the agenda for each Board 
meeting includes a detailed update on matters in respect of the Group’s Indian business from those directors of the Company who 
also sit in a non-executive capacity on the board of Cairn India (currently Sir Bill Gammell, Jann Brown and Malcolm Thoms). The 
Chief Executive Officer of Cairn India, Rahul Dhir, also attends part of each meeting to ensure that the Board is kept fully briefed  
on matters relating to Cairn India. Formal minutes of all Board and committee meetings are circulated to all directors prior to the 
next Board meeting and are considered for approval at that Board meeting. In addition, the members of the Board are in frequent 
contact between meetings to progress the Group’s business. The non-executive directors also meet informally, without any 
executives present, on a regular basis to discuss matters in respect of the business.
New directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the Board. This involves meetings with other Board members, 
senior management and certain of the Company’s principal advisers. In addition, a new director is provided with an induction pack 
which contains background materials and general information on the Company, the Company’s policies and procedures, financial 
information, an operational review and a briefing on directors’ legal and regulatory responsibilities. 
The Company provides the necessary resources for developing and updating its directors’ knowledge and capabilities. In particular, 
the Company is committed to the provision of continuing professional development training to its directors and in 2009 held a number 
of seminars for Board members, which are regularly presented by the Company’s external advisers and guest speakers, on subjects 
appropriate to the Company’s business, including changes to legislation, regulation and market practice. These seminars were held  
at the end of Board meetings and were attended by all directors present at such meetings. This process is continuing in 2010. Any 
director may request that a particular subject is covered in a seminar. In addition, all press cuttings relating to the Company and all 
brokers’ and analysts’ reports on the Company are distributed to all directors. At least once a year, the Board visits an operational  
site and during 2009 the Board visited both Greenland (in July) and the Company’s operations in Rajasthan, India (in December). 
The Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in place. 
The Board has in place a procedure for the consideration and authorisation of conflicts or possible conflicts with the Company’s 
interests. This was introduced in accordance with directors’ interests provisions in the Companies Act 2006 which came into force 
from 1 October 2008. All directors were asked to submit details to the Company Secretary of any current situations (appointments 
or otherwise) which may give rise to a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest. Notifications were received from all directors and 
there were no conflict matters which required to be authorised. The Board will continue to monitor and review potential conflicts  
of interest on a regular basis.
Performance Evaluations 
The Board has a formal rigorous process of annual performance evaluation for the Board, audit, nomination and remuneration 
committees and individual directors. The Board reviews on an annual basis whether such performance evaluation should be 
conducted using an external resource and meetings were held with two external consultancies during 2009 to discuss the  
possibility of outsourcing this process. The Board decided, however, that for 2009 there was value in continuing to conduct  
the process internally, particularly given new appointments to the Board and Board committees in 2008 and 2009. 
The performance evaluation for 2009 was primarily based upon answers to a high level questionnaire which had been updated 
since the previous year’s evaluation and which focused on the performance of the Board. The questionnaire was prepared internally 
by the Company Secretary and Chairman and was subsequently distributed to all Board members and the Company Secretary.  
The areas covered in the questionnaire included the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees, strategy setting, 
performance against key objectives and the level of information available to the Board in relation to Cairn India. 
Once a questionnaire had been completed by each member of the Board and the Company Secretary, the Chairman held a 
meeting with each director and the Company Secretary individually, as appropriate, to discuss their responses. The Chairman  
then reported the results of the process to the Board at a Board meeting, which discussed the comments and implemented  
the conclusions. The Board and Board committees are satisfied that they are operating effectively.
The executive directors and non-executive directors also provided feedback on the performance of the Chairman, following  
which the Board (not including the Chairman) is satisfied that the Chairman’s performance is effective and that he continues to 
demonstrate a high level of commitment to the role.
The performance evaluation process indicated areas for improvement, which have been or are being implemented. Following the 
performance evaluations, the Board believes that all of the directors’ performance (including those of Malcolm Thoms, Jann Brown 
and Simon Thomson, who are standing for re-election at the AGM) continues to be effective and that they demonstrate 
commitment to the role. 
A performance evaluation of the Board, the Board committees and individual directors will continue to be conducted annually  
and the method for such review will continue to be reviewed by the Board in order to optimise the process.
The executive directors have their performance individually reviewed by the remuneration committee against objectives which  
are set annually. The bonuses payable to the executive directors under the Company’s cash bonus scheme (described further  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 63) are linked directly to the results of these reviews.

Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Board evaluation and review process also covered the independence of each of the non-executive directors, taking into account 
their integrity, objectivity and contribution to the Board and its committees. Hamish Grossart has served on the Board for more than 
nine years but will not seek re-election at the AGM on 20 May 2010. Accordingly, this report does not contain an explanation (included 
in previous years) as to why the Board considers Mr Grossart to be independent. 
The Board believes that the following behaviours are essential in order for a director to be considered independent:
Provides an objective, robust and consistent challenge to the assumptions, beliefs and views of senior management and the 
other directors.
Questions intelligently, debates constructively and challenges rigorously and dispassionately.
Acts at all times in the best interests of the organisation and its shareholders.
Has a detailed and extensive knowledge of the Group’s business, industry and the market as a whole.
Having reviewed the independence of each of the non-executive directors, the Board concluded that all non-executive directors  
of the Company are independent. In addition to this review process, the Company plans to appoint two new independent  
non-executive directors in the near future.
Board Committees
The Board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, each of which has formal 
terms of reference approved by the Board. The terms of reference for each of these committees satisfy the requirements of the 
Combined Code and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by the Board. Copies of the terms of reference are available  
on the Company’s website.
The committees are provided with all necessary resources to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective manner. The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committees and the minutes of all committee meetings are circulated to all directors.
Set out below are reports from the audit committee, remuneration committee and nomination committee.
1. Audit Committee Report
The audit committee comprises three non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Currently, its members are Iain McLaren (chairman), Hamish Grossart and Dr Jim Buckee. The Board is satisfied that two members  
of the committee have recent and relevant financial experience. Mr McLaren was formerly a senior partner at KPMG LLP . Mr Grossart 
serves on audit committees of other listed companies and trained as an investment banker. As mentioned above, Mr Grossart will 
retire from the audit committee with effect from 20 May 2010 and will be replaced by a new independent non-executive director. 
The audit committee met four times in 2009. At the request of the audit committee, the Finance Director and senior members of the 
Finance Department attended each of these meetings. The Chairman also attended one meeting as an observer, on being invited 
to do so by the committee. In addition, all four meetings were attended by the external auditors and by the internal auditors. 
The external auditors receive copies of all audit committee papers (including papers to be considered at meetings when they are 
not in attendance) and minutes of all committee meetings. In addition, the chairman of the committee regularly meets with the 
external audit partner to discuss matters relevant to the Company. 
The role of the committee includes:
monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained in them; 
reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments and disclosures in financial reports; 
reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and internal control and risk management systems;
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function; 
overseeing the Company’s relationship with the external auditors, including making recommendations to the Board as to the 
appointment or reappointment of the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement, and monitoring the external 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and effectiveness; and 
reviewing the Company’s whistleblowing procedures and ensuring that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and 
independent investigation of possible improprieties in respect of financial reporting and other matters and for appropriate 
follow-up action.
Of the four audit committee meetings held during 2009, the first two meetings were in respect of the 2008 year-end process (the 
second two meetings were in respect of the 2009 interim accounts). At the first of these meetings, issues which may impact on the 
financial statements are raised by both the senior management and the external auditors. The auditors also present their audit plan. 
Audit committee guidance is sought on accounting policies and assumptions to be adopted in preparing the financial statements. 
After discussing and challenging the issues raised, the audit committee recommends the policies to be adopted or directs senior 
management to produce further information if deemed necessary.  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  55  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
At the second meeting in respect of the year-end process, the external auditors report their audit results to the audit committee, 
including a summary of any significant accounting and auditing issues, internal control findings and a summary of audit differences 
identified. The audit committee considers any disagreements in accounting treatment between management and the auditors, 
should any arise.
The audit committee has established a policy in relation to the supply of non-audit services by the external auditors and other third 
parties. The Company will engage an external adviser to provide non-audit services on the basis of the skills and experience required 
for the work, where benefit will be derived as a result of the third party’s knowledge of the Company and cost. These advisers may 
include the Company’s external auditors for a restricted list of non-audit services, although, before the engagement commences,  
the Company must be satisfied that the auditor’s objectivity and independence would not be compromised in any way as a result  
of being instructed to carry out those services. If the cumulative fees to be paid to an external adviser for the provision of non-audit 
services are below a certain level, the adviser may be engaged in accordance with the Company’s financial delegations of authority 
after a quotation has been received. If the fees payable are expected to exceed that level on a cumulative basis, the engagement  
must be approved by the audit committee in advance after following a tender process. The audit committee must also be satisfied  
that the engagement is the most effective and efficient means of procuring such non-audit services.
KPMG LLP has been appointed by the audit committee to supervise and co-ordinate the Company’s internal audit function. KPMG 
also provides internal audit services to Cairn India. At the beginning of each year, an internal audit plan is developed by the internal 
auditor, in consultation with senior management, based on a review of the outcome of the previous year’s internal audit, the significant 
risks in the Group Risk Matrix and identified mitigation measures. The internal auditor also participates in meetings of the Group Risk 
Management Committee to maintain an understanding of the business activities and associated risks and to update the committee  
on the internal audit work plan. The audit committee also receives updates on the internal audit work plan on an ongoing basis.  
The external auditors do not place any reliance on the work undertaken by the Company’s internal audit function due to the nature  
of the scope and the timing of their work. The external auditors do, however, attend all audit committee meetings where internal  
audit updates are given.
The Company undertook an audit tender process in 2003, as a result of which Ernst & Young LLP (EY) were re-engaged as the 
Company’s auditors. The Company monitors its auditor’s performance on an ongoing basis, including an annual assessment carried 
out by the audit committee with input from the Finance Director and other key members of the finance department. Following such 
assessment, the audit committee meets to discuss what actions, if any, require to be taken. In addition to this, the EY senior audit 
partner working with Cairn is subject to rotation. The current audit partner has worked with the Company on the 2008 and 2009 
year-end process.
The Company updated its Whistleblowing Policy during 2009 and the new policy has been rolled out across the organisation  
and reviewed by the audit committee. The audit committee is satisfied that arrangements are in place for the proportionate  
and independent investigation of possible improprieties in respect of financial reporting and other matters and for appropriate 
follow-up action.
2. Remuneration Committee Report
The remuneration committee comprises four non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Currently, its members are Dr Jim Buckee (chairman), Norman Murray, Mark Tyndall and Todd Hunt. As mentioned above, Mark 
Tyndall will retire as a member of the remuneration committee on 20 May 2010 and will be replaced by a new independent non-
executive director. 
The remuneration committee met six times during 2009. The Chief Executive, at the request of the committee, attends its 
meetings. In addition, he is consulted by the committee on its proposals. Certain other of the executive directors attended 
meetings of the committee as observers on being invited to do so by the committee. None of the members of the committee, 
nor the Chief Executive nor the Chairman, participated in any meetings or discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The role of the committee includes:
determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration policy for all the executive directors, the Chairman and the members 
of the CEC;
within the terms of the agreed policy, determining the total individual remuneration package for each executive director;

3. Nomination Committee Report
The nomination committee currently comprises Norman Murray (chairman), three independent non-executive directors, Todd Hunt, 
Mark Tyndall and Iain McLaren, and, to ensure input from the executive, one executive director, Sir Bill Gammell (Chief Executive).  
As mentioned above, Mark Tyndall will retire as a member of the nomination committee with effect from 20 May 2010 and will be 
replaced by a new independent non-executive director. Certain other of the non-executive directors attended meetings of the 
committee as observers on being invited to do so by the committee. The nomination committee met six times in 2009. 
The Combined Code requires there to be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors, which 
should be meritocratic and made against objective criteria. For this purpose, the Board has established the nomination committee, 
whose role includes considering the composition, balance and skills of the Board and making recommendations to the Board on 
these matters, on the appointment of new directors and on the reappointment and orderly succession of existing directors. 
The nomination committee reviews Board composition on an ongoing basis and regularly considers whether any skills gap exists  
on the Board. Any new appointments to the Board will be considered in this context. 
The committee has identified two very strong candidates to replace Hamish Grossart and Mark Tyndall as independent non-executive 
directors. It is expected that these candidates will be appointed in the near future. Both have visited the Company’s office in Edinburgh 
and met with the Chairman and other members of the nomination committee as well as the executive directors and senior management. 
They have also been given the opportunity to carry out due diligence on the Company.
Following the appointment of these two new non-executive directors, a total of four independent non-executive directors will have 
been appointed to the board since mid 2008.
Succession Planning
The nomination committee regularly reviews the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and experience) 
required of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate. The Board has satisfied itself that the nomination 
committee has in place appropriate plans for orderly succession to the Board and senior management positions as well as procedures 
to ensure an appropriate balance of skills within the Company and on the Board and its committees. The Board and nomination 
committee are satisfied that individuals currently fulfilling key senior management positions in the organisation have the requisite  
depth and breadth of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that orderly succession to the Chief Executive’s Committee and 
Board can take place.
Organisational Planning 
Throughout 2009, the Company continued to focus on employee engagement and organisational development. In view of planned 
drilling programmes in both Greenland and the Mediterranean during 2010, the key focus of activities during the year involved the 
transition from a primarily corporate head office to a joint corporate-operational hub. 
A full review of HR policies was undertaken in late 2008 and the new and updated policies were approved by the Chief Executive’s 
Committee in February 2009. In keeping with the shift to a more operationally focused organisation, new policies were introduced  
and other policies were revised or introduced to align with changes in legislation and industry best practice and to further support  
the Company in attracting and retaining staff. Throughout the remainder of 2009, the policies were rolled out to all managers and staff 
to ensure the equitable and consistent application of HR policy and to help inform and guide day-to-day human resources decisions. 
Another key change during 2009 was Cairn’s formal move to an asset-led matrix organisation structure. Directors, asset managers, 
heads of departments, and other relevant internal stakeholders attended a workshop in August 2009 on how best to work together 
in the new structure, during which a number of ideas were generated. Project teams have subsequently been formed to work on 
clearly identified projects aimed at creating greater efficiencies in the way the Company works and this will continue during 2010. 
With drilling in both Greenland and Tunisia scheduled for 2010, a firm emphasis was placed on resourcing during the second half of 
2009. In order to ensure that the Company can effectively and efficiently source the right people at the right time, a comprehensive 
tendering process was undertaken with recruitment partners to finalise preferred supplier lists for various disciplines across the 
business. The Company is continuing to recruit additional new staff during 2010 in response to growing resource needs throughout 
the organisation.
Governance Award
In October 2009, Cairn was ranked one of the top ten FTSE 100 companies in the Resources Governance Index published by 
Resources Global Professionals. This is the first Index of its kind and provides a comprehensive benchmark of corporate governance 
standards in the FTSE 100. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  57

Relations with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority by the Board. Cairn sends both its annual report and accounts and half-
yearly report to all shareholders. In order to ensure that the members of the Board develop an understanding of the views of major 
shareholders, there is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including meetings after the announcement of the year-end  
and interim results. The Chairman usually attends a number of these meetings. At the Board meeting immediately following these 
meetings, a detailed report is given to all directors who were not in attendance at those meetings. In addition, the Company maintains 
an external relations database which details all meetings attended by the directors with third party stakeholders. All analysts’ and 
brokers’ reports on the Company are also distributed to all directors. Cairn responds to all correspondence from shareholders and  
also launched an extensively updated new website during 2009, which contains a wide range of information on the Company and 
includes a dedicated investor relations section. 
A list of the Company’s major shareholders can be found in the Directors’ Report on page 46.
The senior independent non-executive director is available to shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
Each of the non-executive directors is available to attend meetings with major shareholders (without the executive directors 
present), if requested by such major shareholders.
During the last quarter of 2009 the Company conducted an extensive investor consultation process in relation to proposals for the 
conversion of certain share incentive awards. As part of this process, the Chairman (deputising for the chairman of the remuneration 
committee) and the Company Secretary held meetings with several of the Company’s institutional shareholders, the ABI and RREV 
to discuss these proposals, which were subsequently approved by shareholders at the Company’s EGM held on 21 December 2009. 
The Chairman and the Company Secretary also plan to meet with the ABI, RREV and certain institutional shareholders during 2010 
to discuss corporate governance matters generally.

Annual General Meeting 
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. It is policy for  
all directors to attend the AGM if at all possible. Whilst this may not always be possible for business or personal reasons, in normal 
circumstances the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees will attend the AGM and be available to answer 
questions.
It is policy to involve shareholders fully in the affairs of the Company and to give them the opportunity at the AGM to ask questions 
about the Company’s activities and prospects. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the AGM on 20 May 2010 can be found in the Notice of Annual General Meeting and on 
the Company’s website. Further explanation of the resolutions can also be found in the Directors’ Report on pages 47 to 50.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as abstentions, will be counted before the AGM and the results will be made 
available at the meeting after the shareholders have voted on each resolution on a show of hands. The Form of Proxy for the AGM 
includes a ‘vote withheld’ option in respect of each resolution, to enable shareholders to abstain on any particular resolution. It is 
explained on the Form of Proxy that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion 
of the votes ‘for’ or ‘against’ a resolution.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors have 
prepared the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
state that the Group and Company financial statements have complied with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
subject to any material departures being disclosed and explained.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
Each of the directors, whose names are listed in the Board of Directors section on pages 42 and 43 confirms to the best of his 
knowledge that:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and 
Company; and
the Directors Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the Group and Company’s financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Going Concern
The directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement on going concern. They have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have therefore used the going concern basis  
in preparing the financial statements.
Internal Control 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Company has in 
place an Integrated Internal Control and Assurance Framework (the framework), which plays a critical role in managing the risks towards 
the achievement of corporate vision, strategy and objectives, and is also central to safeguarding shareholders’ interests and Company 
assets. This system of internal control is in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee and is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The process has been in place in respect of the Group for the 2009 accounting period and up to the date of approval of the report  
and accounts. The Board has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls during 2009 and will ensure 
that such reviews are performed in 2010. In so doing, the Board has taken into account the assurance provided by the Chief Executive 
Officer of Cairn India and Chief Executive of Cairn Energy PLC in respect of the effectiveness of the system of internal control within 
Cairn India Limited and Cairn Energy PLC. The Board is accordingly satisfied that effective control is in place and that risks have been 
mitigated to an acceptable level.  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  59  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
The Company is subject to a variety of risks which derive from the nature of the oil and gas exploration and production business  
and relate to the countries in which it conducts its activities. The directors believe that Cairn derives its competitive edge by 
focusing activities in areas where they believe they have a technical and commercial advantage and the experience gained  
over many years enables the Company to manage these risks effectively. 
Operations in any country are only possible when values are shared, and the directors believe that the Group’s values of integrity, 
social and environmental responsibility, teamwork and nurturing of individuals, creativity, risk management and alliancing with key 
partners are ingredients that are central to the Company’s success. The ability to recognise the value of working as a partnership 
with host governments, both nationally and regionally, has also been a critical ingredient in this approach and success.
2009 was another year of change. The Company was focused on supporting its subsidiary company Cairn India in progressing the 
Mangala field development whilst at the same time building an exploration portfolio in Greenland through its Capricorn operating 
subsidiary. Particular attention has been placed by Group management on ensuring that a robust system of internal control has 
been maintained during 2009 in relation to the significant risks in these business activities. 
Cairn India is subject to the rules, regulations and guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and to its listing 
agreement with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE). Under the terms of a relationship agreement 
between the Company and Cairn India entered into at the time of the IPO (the ‘Relationship Agreement’), both companies have also 
agreed to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that they can comply with their respective obligations to SEBI, the Financial Services 
Authority, the BSE, the NSE and the London Stock Exchange and under the SEBI Insider Trading Regulations and UK regulation and 
legislation relating to the disclosure of information or dealing in respect of listed securities or corporate governance. This has included 
adopting and following the principles and policies of corporate governance, including risk management, which enable each company 
to comply with these obligations. 
The following describes the key elements of the framework and the processes used by the Board during 2009 to review the 
effectiveness of the system. It also describes the approach to be taken in 2010.
1. Strategic Direction
The Group business model is conventional in that strategy is set by the directors and approved by the Board and its implementation 
is delegated to the CEC. Following its listing on the BSE and NSE in January 2007 , Cairn India is a subsidiary of the Company with 
its own board of directors. In accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of Cairn India, the Company has three 
non-executive directors on the board of Cairn India (including Sir Bill Gammell as Chairman) and, therefore, has an input to Cairn 
India’s strategy.
2. Operating Management
Outside of Cairn India, the Group, through its unlisted wholly owned subsidiary Capricorn, operates several business units in different 
countries and with various partners. Work programmes and budgets are prepared annually to meet the Group strategy, starting at  
the asset level before being consolidated at Group level. A detailed business plan is also prepared to meet the agreed annual work 
programme and budget. This sets out detailed objectives and KPIs for each asset and supporting functional departments, and is 
consolidated into the Company’s annual business plan. After an iterative process, the business plan and budget is presented to the 
CEC and the Board for approval. 
The asset management teams then have the required authority to implement the business plans and to deliver the agreed work 
programme within the approved budget and delegation of authorities, and in accordance with the internal control framework. 
The remit of the CEC is to oversee the delivery of the strategy through the annual business plans and approved budget.  
The directors have also appointed Group functional heads whose roles include providing input and ‘challenge’ to the work 
programmes, budgets and business plans, and supplying the relevant director with full and accurate information and to  
make statements on the adequacy of internal control.
3. Risk Management 
The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC), established by the Board in 1999, continues to be responsible for the development 
of risk management strategy and processes within the Company and for overseeing the implementation of the requirements of this 
strategy. It does this by ensuring that the framework for the identification, assessment, mitigation and reporting on all areas of risk is  
‘fit for purpose’ and that appropriate assurance arrangements are in place in relation to these risks. 
The Group Business Risk Management System (GBRMS) defines the processes through which Cairn seeks to systematically  
identify, analyse, assess, treat and monitor the business risks faced by the Group. The GBRMS also identifies the risk management 
organisational structure through which business risks are managed and regularly reviewed at operating, asset, country and  
group levels. 
The GRMC is chaired by the Finance Director and comprises executive directors and senior functional management. The non-
executive chairman of the Audit Committee is also a member of the GRMC. In addition, the Internal Auditor attends all GRMC 
meetings in order to ensure internal audit’s integration with the risk management process. A corporate and new ventures risk 
management sub-committee was also established in 2009 under the chairmanship of the Legal & Commercial Director to  
manage the assessment and treatment of wider business risks that may affect the Company’s ability to deliver its strategy.

Continued 60  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE ST A TEMENT
Continued
Cairn India operates its own RMC in line with its Business Risk Management System (BRMS) under the chairmanship of the Chief 
Operating Officer and reporting to the Cairn India Board. Risk management sub-committees have also been set up reporting to  
the Cairn India RMC to consider the specific risks associated with operations, finance, exploration and the Rajasthan upstream and 
midstream projects. The Cairn India BRMS is substantially similar to that of the Company and, under the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement, a copy of the Cairn India risk report and RMC minutes is routinely submitted for review at the GRMC, at which a senior 
representative from Cairn India is present to provide explanation and take questions. 
Business risks, together with the identified mitigating measures and responsibilities, are recorded in asset and country risk registers 
which are reported through to the Group risk register. The Cairn India asset, corporate and new venture risk registers are integrated 
into the Group risk register, and are regularly reviewed by the GRMC to ensure that the business understands the key risks it faces 
and that there is an embedded risk management approach in place across the Group.
The GRMC reports on the Group’s risk profile to both the audit committee and the Board. Additionally, the audit committee and 
Board receives internal reviews of the effectiveness of internal control relative to the key risks. The conclusion of the Board following 
these reviews during 2009 is that the internal controls in respect of key risks are appropriate.
A summary of key risks and uncertainties as at the end of 2009, together with mitigation measures, is provided on pages 32 and 33.
4. Assurance
The framework adopted by the Board provides for three levels of assurance against the risks facing the Group: first of all at the 
operational level; secondly through overview by Group functional management and the GRMC; and thirdly through internal, 
external or joint venture audits.
During 2009 a review was conducted by Deloitte of the appropriateness of the Cairn framework. This review concluded that  
the principles outlined in the framework are essentially fit for purpose, however changes are required to the framework document  
to reflect recent structural and personnel changes across the organisation. The review also identified a number of areas for 
improvement including embedding the application of the framework into day-to-day operations, enhancing documentation  
and dissemination of procedures and controls, and enhancements to the questionnaires used in the annual assurance process. 
A separate Group HSE, Risk and Compliance Department was subsequently established in January 2010. This department reports 
to the Finance Director and provides independent verification of CR, business risk and compliance activities.
During 2009, the directors reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of financial and non-financial controls, including 
operational and compliance controls, risk management and the Group’s high level internal control arrangements. The directors 
derive assurance from the following internal and external controls:
a regularly updated schedule of matters specifically reserved for a decision by the Board;
policies and procedures for key business activities (including a whistleblowing policy);
an appropriate organisational structure;
control over non-operated joint venture activities through delegated representatives;
specific delegations of authority for all financial and other transactions;
segregation of duties where appropriate and cost-effective;
business and financial reporting, including KPIs;
functional management reviews;
the nomination of various directors of the Company to the Cairn India board (in a non-executive capacity) and to certain of its 
committees. The Board also receives copies of minutes of meetings of the Cairn India board of directors;
a Relationship Agreement with Cairn India, which, inter alia, contains provisions for the supply by Cairn India to the Company  
of such information and confirmations as the Company may require to comply with legal, regulatory and reporting obligations;
an annual ‘letters of assurance’ process, through which asset and functional managers confirm the adequacy of internal financial  
and non-financial controls and their compliance with Group policies and report any control weaknesses identified in the past year;
a ‘letter of assurance’ from the Cairn India Chief Executive Officer and Cairn Energy PLC Chief Executive confirming the 
adequacy of internal controls within Cairn India and Cairn Energy PLC in line with its policy, and reporting of any control 
weaknesses identified in the past year;
Group internal audits to assess compliance – the internal auditor implements a number of audits during the year in line with the 
annual internal audit plan approved by the audit committee and Board;
reports from the Group audit committee and GRMC, (including reports from the Cairn India RMC and Cairn India audit committee);
reports from the Group external auditor on matters identified during its statutory audit;
reports from audits by host governments and co-venturers; and
independent third party reviews. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  61  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
Compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout 2009 the Company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code, except in the following areas:
Provision of the Combined Code Company position Explanation
A.3.2 – at least half the Board, excluding 
the chairman, should comprise non-
executive directors determined by  
the Board to be independent.
During 2009, the Board comprised the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive, five other 
executive directors and five independent 
non-executive directors. Hamish Grossart 
and Mark Tyndall will both retire at the 
AGM to be held on 20 May 2010 and will 
be replaced by two new independent 
non-executive directors.
The Board firmly believes that the 
composition of the Board was appropriate 
and effective for the challenges that it  
faced during 2009. The Board is satisfied  
that it maintained a sufficient degree of 
independence throughout the year to enable 
it to discharge effectively and properly its 
obligations under the Combined Code. The 
composition of the Board and the issue of 
succession planning remains under constant 
review and is a regular item on the agenda 
for meetings of the nomination committee.
A.4.1 – a majority of the members of  
the nomination committee should be 
independent non-executive directors.
The Company complied with this  
provision from 19 May until 31 December 
2009. During the period from 1 January 
2009 to 19 May 2009 the Company  
did not comply with the provision.
At the start of 2009 the nomination 
committee comprised two independent 
non-executive directors, the Chairman  
and one executive director. Following  
the appointment of Todd Hunt and Mark 
Tyndall as members of the nomination 
committee with effect from 19 May 2009, 
the Company complied with the provision.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERA TION REPORT
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’). The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to 
directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
The auditors are required to report to the Company’s members on the ‘auditable parts’ of the report and to state whether, in their 
opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations and the Companies Act 2006. 
In light of this requirement, and in order to present the information in a form that is as accessible as possible to shareholders, the 
report has been split into a number of separate sections. The heading of each section indicates whether it is audited or unaudited.
Overview of the Remuneration Committee and its Policies (unaudited)
Purpose and Structure of the Remuneration Committee
The remuneration committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the executive directors and 
the members of the CEC. The remuneration committee also determines, within the terms of the agreed policy and having consulted 
with the Chief Executive about their proposals, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, including 
pension rights and any compensation payments to be paid on termination.
Reference is made to page 55 of the Corporate Governance Statement, where there is a further summary of the role of the 
remuneration committee.
Cairn’s remuneration committee operates within terms of reference set by the Board. These are reviewed periodically to ensure that 
the remuneration committee remains up to date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business environment 
in which it operates. The terms of reference are available on the Company’s website.
The members of the remuneration committee during the year were as follows:
Dr Jim Buckee (joined the committee on 15 January 2009 and became chairman on 19 May 2009);
Mark Tyndall;
Todd Hunt;
Norman Murray (joined the committee on 19 May 2009);
Ed Story (resigned from the committee on 15 January 2009); and
Hamish Grossart (resigned as chairman and member of the committee on 19 May 2009).
The Chief Executive is not a member of the remuneration committee but may attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted  
in respect of certain of its proposals (although the Chief Executive is not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of his 
own remuneration).
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
As and when the remuneration committee deems appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from a number of sources. 
During the year it consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street (an independent executive compensation consultancy appointed by the 
committee) on various aspects of the directors’ remuneration packages. The Company’s legal advisers, Shepherd and Wedderburn 
LLP and auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , also provided assistance to the committee in respect of the Company’s share option schemes 
and long-term incentive plans. Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent verification of  
the Company’s achievement against performance conditions applicable to the Company’s share option schemes and long-term 
incentive plans.
Remuneration Policy – Overview
Cairn’s policy on executive directors’ remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is that the overall remuneration 
package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high-quality individuals capable of achieving the Group’s 
objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value. The package is generally weighted more towards variable pay and, in relation to 
the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long-term performance. In designing the remuneration structures  
of the executive directors, the committee takes into account pay policies within the Group as a whole.
Each executive director’s remuneration package currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual performance related bonuses,  
a long-term incentive plan, a defined contribution pension (if appropriate) and life assurance of four times basic annual salary.  
The package is designed to support the Group’s business strategy and to provide an appropriate incentive to maximise individual 
and corporate performance, whilst ensuring that overall rewards are market competitive.
Explanation of the Components of Executive Directors’ Remuneration (unaudited)
Basic Salary and Benefits
Basic salary is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any changes take effect from 1 January each year. In deciding 
appropriate levels, the committee utilises objective benchmarking which gives up-to-date information on remuneration practice 
within a comparator group of similar companies within the sector. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  63  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERA TION REPORT
Continued
For the year 2009 the basic salaries of the executive directors were frozen at 2008 levels, being £552,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, 
£402,500 for Dr Mike Watts and £345,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson. Following a 
detailed benchmarking review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street consultants in early 2010, the executive directors’ salaries  
for the year 2010 have been increased to £600,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, £420,000 for Dr Mike Watts and £360,000 for each of 
Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson. 
Benefits available to the executive directors comprise a company car, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and 
death in service benefit.
Further details of the salary and benefits of each of the executive directors are set out in the remuneration table on page 70.
Annual Cash Bonus Scheme 
Cairn’s annual cash bonus scheme applies to all employees and executive directors. Bonuses under the scheme are based on 
individual and Company performance measures. Individual performance is measured through the Company’s performance 
management system. Company performance measures are based on annually defined key performance indicators (‘KPIs’). The KPIs 
for 2009 encompassed various portfolio growth and operational performance targets, the substantial majority of which were met. 
For employees other than executive directors, only the individual and Company performance measures determine the overall bonus 
award. The bonus award to the executive directors is subject to two additional performance measures, being performance against 
annually defined corporate objectives and reserve replacement performance. For 2009, this resulted in one-quarter of each executive 
director’s award being determined by individual performance, one quarter by Company performance, one quarter by performance 
against corporate objectives and one quarter by reserve replacement performance. 
The corporate objectives for 2009 are commercially sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report, as are the 2010 corporate 
objectives. The choice of these measures, and their respective weightings, reflects the committee’s belief that any short-term incentive 
compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and to those areas of its business that each individual 
can directly influence.
The maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors and other senior executives for 2009 was up to 100% of salary.  
The actual bonuses awarded to the executive directors for performance in 2009 are shown in the remuneration table on page 70. 
The bonus cap for all other employees for 2009 was between 25% and 40%. The maximum bonus potentials for 2010 are currently 
under review.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to award bonuses in addition to those payable under the annual cash bonus 
scheme in recognition of particular efforts or achievements by employees, including executive directors. No bonuses of this kind 
were awarded to executive directors during 2009.
A similar structure will operate in 2010. 
Long-term Incentives – Introduction
In order to encourage executive directors (and other selected senior employees) to deliver superior levels of long-term performance 
for the benefit of shareholders, the Company’s policy since 1999 has been to provide these individuals with share incentives under a 
long-term incentive plan. The current arrangement is the Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (2009) (‘2009 LTIP’), which was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009. 
During the year, executive directors also held outstanding awards under the following historic share incentive arrangements 
operated by the Company:
The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 (‘2006 LTIP’); and
The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2002 (‘2002 LTIP’).
At the Company’s EGM held on 21 December 2009 shareholder approval was received for the conversion of certain awards previously 
made under the 2006 LTIP into replacement rights over ordinary shares, such replacement rights to be granted pursuant to The Cairn 
Energy PLC Replacement Long Term Incentive Plan (‘Replacement LTIP’).
Summaries of the 2009 LTIP , 2006 LTIP and 2002 LTIP are provided below, together with additional details relating to the grant of 
awards under the Replacement LTIP .
2009 LTIP
The 2009 LTIP enables executive directors and selected senior employees (excluding those employed by the Cairn India Group)  
to be granted conditional awards over ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment 
with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.  
The scheme is intended to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying 
financial performance of the Group and to align their interests more closely with those of shareholders. 64  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The value of ordinary shares awarded to a participant under the 2009 LTIP in any financial year is subject to a limit of 300% of  
his/her basic salary (although a 400% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional 
circumstances).
On the vesting of an award under the 2009 LTIP , only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become entitled are 
released to him/her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year. No amounts 
due under the 2009 LTIP are recognised as remuneration until the award has vested and the ordinary shares released.
The first awards under the 2009 LTIP were made on 29 May 2009 to the executive directors and a selection of the Company’s senior 
managers. Details of the awards granted to the executive directors are set out on page 71. 
Pages 73 and 74 contains a summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which the above awards vest 
at the end of the applicable performance period. For awards made in future years, the remuneration committee will review, and may 
amend, the performance conditions used for this arrangement in order to ensure they remain appropriate, challenging and in line 
with best practice/investor guidelines. 
2006 LTIP
The 2006 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 17 November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India 
becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007 . Following the adoption of the 2009 LTIP , no further awards have been or  
will be granted under the 2006 LTIP . The date of grant of the last award under the 2006 LTIP was 7 July 2008.
The 2006 LTIP enabled executive directors and selected senior employees to be granted conditional awards over two separate 
pools of notional ‘units’, the first relating to Cairn India (‘Cairn India Units’) and the second relating to the Capricorn Group 
(‘Capricorn Units’) (together, ‘Units’). 
During the year, and as fully explained in the circulars to shareholders dated 22 April 2009 and 3 December 2009, the remuneration 
committee identified significant issues in relation to one aspect of the 2006 LTIP’s operation, namely the mechanism for valuing 
Capricorn Units. In light of these issues it was decided that:
no further awards (whether over Capricorn Units or Cairn India Units) would be granted under the 2006 LTIP;
all future share incentive awards made to the Company’s senior management team (including its executive directors) would be 
granted under the 2009 LTIP;
participants in the 2006 LTIP who held awards over Capricorn Units (‘Capricorn Awards’) would be invited to surrender those rights 
in exchange for the grant of ‘Converted Awards’ over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement LTIP; and
the number of ordinary shares subject to each Converted Award would be calculated by reference to an implied valuation  
of the Capricorn Group derived from the ‘farm-in’ to its Greenland assets by PETRONAS. 
All participants in the 2006 LTIP subsequently accepted the conversion invitation described above and were granted Converted 
Awards on 22 December 2009 pursuant to the Replacement LTIP . As a result, there are no outstanding Capricorn Awards under  
the 2006 LTIP . 
Each of the executive directors (and a number of other senior managers) does, however, continue to hold awards over Cairn India Units 
(‘Cairn India Awards’). These awards are unaffected by the issues described above and continue to subsist on their original terms.
The extent to which a Cairn India Award vests is dependent on continued employment within the Group and the extent to which 
pre-determined performance conditions relating to Cairn India are met over a specified period.
Following the vesting of a Cairn India Award, the participant will then become entitled to such number of ordinary shares in the 
Company as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested Units. (For the purposes of the 2006 LTIP , the price of  
a Cairn India Unit on any day is equal to the price of a Cairn India share, as quoted on the BSE and the NSE of India.) Only 50% of 
these ordinary shares will be transferred to the participant immediately. The remaining 50% will normally be held for a further year. 
Details of the outstanding Cairn India Awards held by executive directors are set out on page 71. A summary of the performance 
conditions that will determine the extent to which these awards vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided  
on page 74 and 75.
Replacement LTIP
The Replacement LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009 and, as explained above, has been used  
to grant Converted Awards over ordinary shares to those participants in the 2006 LTIP who accepted the invitation to surrender 
their Capricorn Awards. These Converted Awards were granted on 22 December 2009. 
Converted Awards comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both 
continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified 
period of three years. The form of these performance conditions, and the period over which they are measured, is intended to 
mirror those that applied to the Capricorn Awards that have been replaced.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERA TION REPORT
Continued
On the vesting of a Converted Award, any ordinary shares to which the holder becomes entitled will normally be subject to an extended 
‘holding period’ during which they cannot be sold (save to meet tax liabilities arising on vesting). This period will generally last until 9 
January 2013. Where a participant ceases employment with the Group during this holding period, his/her unreleased ordinary shares will 
normally be forfeit for no consideration. Exceptions to this general forfeiture principle will be at the remuneration committee’s discretion 
but will usually be limited to ‘good leaver’ circumstances. In addition, if prior to the end of the holding period, events occur which cause 
the remuneration committee to consider that the implied value of the Capricorn Group used as part of the conversion process (see 
above) was materially overstated as at the date on which the conversion took place, then a proportion of a participant’s unreleased 
ordinary shares may be forfeited for no consideration. In these circumstances, the number of ordinary shares to be forfeited will be 
decided by the remuneration committee on such fair and equitable basis as it may determine at the relevant time.
Details of the outstanding Converted Awards held by executive directors are set out on page 72. A summary of the performance 
conditions that will determine the extent to which these awards vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided  
on pages 75 and 76.
No further awards will be granted pursuant to the Replacement LTIP in the future.
2002 LTIP
The 2002 LTIP was superseded by the 2006 LTIP , further details of which are set out above. The date of grant of the last award under 
the 2002 LTIP was 24 April 2006.
Under the 2002 LTIP , participants have been granted ‘Tier One’ and ‘Tier Two’ awards.
A Tier One award is a conditional award over ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued 
employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified performance 
period of three years. 
A Tier Two award is a share appreciation right over a number of notional Cairn shares. The maximum potential benefit a participant 
may receive under a Tier Two award is calculated by comparing the increase in Cairn’s share price over the performance period with 
the change in the average share price of a comparator group of companies over the same period. The increase in Cairn’s share price  
(if any) over the rise (or fall) in the average share price of the comparator group over the performance period is then multiplied by the 
number of notional shares that are the subject of the award. This gives rise to a monetary figure which is then converted into an actual 
number of Cairn shares using the market value as at the date of vesting. Where there has been a fall in Cairn’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) over the period, no Tier Two award will vest. The extent to which a Tier Two award then vests is determined by reference to a 
further performance condition.
On the vesting of a Tier One or Tier Two award under the 2002 LTIP , only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become 
entitled are released to him/her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year. 
Details of the Tier One and Tier Two awards held by executive directors during the year (being the final set of awards granted under 
this arrangement) are set out on page 73. A summary of the performance conditions that were used to determine the extent to 
which these awards vested at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 76.
Pension Arrangements
The Company operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan in the UK. The scheme is non-contributory and all UK 
permanent employees are eligible to participate. The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary (15% in respect of senior 
executives) on behalf of all qualifying employees.
Dr Mike Watts and Jann Brown are members of the Company plan and, during the year, both received a contribution equal to 15% 
of their respective annual basic salaries. 
Simon Thomson and Malcolm Thoms both have an individual personal pension plan and, during the year, received a contribution 
from the Company equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries. 
During the year, Sir Bill Gammell and Phil Tracy both received an amount equivalent to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries 
in the form of additional salary, as their pension arrangements are fully funded. 
Further details of the contributions made by the Company in respect of each executive director are set out in the remuneration 
table on page 70. 
The Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme. Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this scheme. 
The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell and did not do so 
during the year. 66  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Share Option Schemes for Other Employees (unaudited)
Introduction
The Company currently operates the following share option schemes for employees below senior executive level.
2009 Approved Share Option Plan (‘2009 Approved Option Plan’)
2009 Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘2009 Unapproved Option Plan’)
Replacement Share Option Plan (‘Replacement Option Plan’)
2003 Approved Share Option Plan (‘2003 Option Plan’)
2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘2002 Option Plan’)
1996 Second Share Option Scheme (‘1996 Option Scheme’)
Brief summaries of these arrangements are set out below. It should, however, be noted that none of the Company’s executive 
directors participate in any of the above schemes and it is not intended that options will be granted to them under these 
arrangements in the future.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan
The 2009 Approved Option Plan and the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan, both of which were approved by shareholders at the AGM 
held on 19 May 2009, are used to grant market value options to less senior employees of the Group (excluding those employed by 
the Cairn India Group). The principal difference between these two arrangements is that the approval of HM Revenue & Customs 
was sought and obtained for the 2009 Approved Option Plan, whereas no such approval was sought in relation to the 2009 
Unapproved Option Plan. Options granted under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan are normally 
exercisable between three and 10 years following their grant but only if and to the extent that specified performance conditions 
have been satisfied. 
The value of ordinary shares over which options may be granted to a participant under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 
Approved Option Plan in any financial year is subject to a limit of 200% of his/her basic salary (although a 300% of salary limit can be 
applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional circumstances).
The first options under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan were granted on 29 May 2009.  
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these options vest at the end of the applicable 
performance period is provided on page 77 .
Replacement Option Plan
The Replacement Option Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009, was introduced to facilitate 
the conversion of certain options that had previously been granted by the Company under The Cairn Energy PLC Share Option Plan 
2006 (‘2006 Plan’).
The 2006 Plan was established by the Company at the same time as the 2006 LTIP described above. It was designed to enable 
selected employees to be granted options over Capricorn Units (i.e. notional ‘units’ of value relating to the Capricorn Group).
During the year, and as fully explained in the circulars to shareholders dated 22 April 2009 and 3 December 2009, the remuneration 
committee identified significant issues in relation to the Capricorn Unit valuation mechanism that was contained within the rules of 
the 2006 Plan. In light of these issues it was decided that:
no further options would be granted under the 2006 Plan;
participants in the 2006 Plan who held options over Capricorn Units would be invited to surrender those rights in exchange for 
the grant of ‘Converted Options’ over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan; and
the detailed provisions of the Converted Options (i.e. the number of ordinary shares over which they subsist, the exercise price 
per ordinary share, the vesting period, etc) would effectively seek to put participants in the same position as they would have 
been in if, on the date they were originally granted their 2006 Plan options over Capricorn Units, they had instead been granted 
awards on equivalent terms over ordinary shares in the Company.
All participants in the 2006 Plan subsequently accepted the conversion invitation described above and were granted their Converted 
Options on 22 December 2009 pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan. As a result, there are no outstanding options over Capricorn 
Units under the 2006 Plan. 
Converted Options granted under the Replacement Option Plan comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares for a 
specified price, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which 
pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years. The form of these performance conditions, 
and the period over which they are measured, are intended to mirror those that applied to the options over Capricorn Units that 
have been replaced.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which Converted Options vest at the end of the 
applicable performance period is provided on page 77 .
No further options will be granted pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan in the future.

1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan
The 1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan (all of which have subsequently been superseded) were formerly 
used by the Company to grant options to a broad selection of employees in the Group. Although a number of options granted 
under these plans currently subsist, no further awards will be granted pursuant to their terms.
A summary of the performance conditions that must be satisfied before awards under these plans can be exercised is provided  
on page 77 .
Cairn India Schemes (unaudited)
As part of the arrangements surrounding its flotation, Cairn India established its own share option schemes pursuant to which 
options to acquire its shares can be granted. These arrangements (brief details of which are set out in Note 7 of the Notes to the 
Accounts) have been or will be used to grant options to selected employees and executive directors of Cairn India and its various 
subsidiary undertakings.
Dilution of Share Capital Pursuant to Share Plans (unaudited)
In any 10-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with the Company’s discretionary 
share plans cannot exceed 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with all the Company’s 
employee share schemes (whether discretionary or otherwise) cannot exceed 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
Proposed All Employee Share Incentive Plan (unaudited)
In order to encourage increased levels of long-term share ownership amongst its employees, the Company intends to establish  
a UK HM Revenue & Customs approved share incentive plan (‘SIP’) during 2010. Once established, the SIP will be used to provide 
eligible employees, including the executive directors, with some or all of the following benefits:
‘Partnership shares’ – employees can authorise deductions of up to £1,500 per tax year from pre-tax salary, which are then used 
to acquire ordinary shares on their behalf.
‘Matching shares’ – the Company can award further free shares to all participants who acquire partnership shares on the basis  
of up to two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased.
‘Free shares’ – employees can be given up to £3,000 worth of ordinary shares free in each tax year.
All shares acquired by participants under the SIP will be existing ordinary shares purchased in the market. As a result, the SIP will  
not involve the issue of new shares or the transfer of treasury shares.
Non-Executive Directors (unaudited)
The remuneration of each of the non-executive directors (other than the Chairman) is determined by the executive members of the 
Board and the Chairman within limits set out in the Articles of Association and having taken independent advice on appropriate levels. 
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the committee (in his absence), again based on independent advice. In all cases, 
the fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the increased responsibilities of the role of the Chairman and other 
non-executive directors.
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements and are not entitled to a 
bonus or pension contributions. 
The non-executive directors’ fees for 2009 were frozen at 2008 levels and are set out in full in the remuneration table on page 70. 
The non-executive directors’ fees for 2010 are £205,000 for Norman Murray, £105,000 for Hamish Grossart and £63,000 for each of 
the other non-executive directors. In addition to this, an annual fee of £10,000 is payable to each of Iain McLaren and Dr Jim Buckee 
for their roles as chairman of the audit and remuneration committee respectively. 
Service Contracts/Letters of Appointment (unaudited)
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the director 
concerned or the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. In the event of termination by the Company (other than  
as a result of a change of control), the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pension contributions  
for the notice periods. Depending on the circumstances of termination, the executive directors may be entitled, or the remuneration 
committee may exercise its discretion to allow the executive director, to retain a proportion of their outstanding awards under 
long-term incentive arrangements (but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met). The 
committee’s policy on early termination is to emphasise the duty of the terminated party to mitigate any loss caused by the early 
termination to the fullest extent practicable.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a director’s employment, each of the directors is entitled  
to compensation of a sum equal to his/her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment. 
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he is appointed for a fixed three-year period, 
subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years. The 
letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect by 
either the director concerned or the Company. The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors commits sufficient 
time to fulfil his/her duties as a director of the Company. None of the non-executive directors has any conflict of interest which  
has not been disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.  68  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection on 
request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 20 May 2010.

Notes:
(1) This company was placed into members’ voluntary liquidation on 31 March 2009 and Sir Bill Gammell’s fees reflect the period 
from 1 January 2009 to that date.
(2) Dr Mike Watts was appointed a non-executive director of SOCO International plc on 17 August 2009. His fees reflect the period 
from that date to 31 December 2009 and are payable in shares.
The Board believes, in principle, in the benefits of executive directors accepting positions as non-executive directors of other 
companies in order to widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the Company, provided that the time commitments are 
not unduly onerous.
The appointment of any executive director to a non-executive position with another company must be approved by the Board. In the 
case of a proposed appointment to a company within the oil and gas industry, permission will only be given if the two companies do 
not compete in the same geographical area.
Performance Graphs (unaudited)
Both the FTSE 100 Index and FTSE 250 Index were selected as appropriate comparator indices for the two performance graphs 
shown below. Cairn is currently a constituent member of the FTSE 100 Index and was a member of the FTSE 100 for the entirety  
of 2009 but has also been previously been a constituent member of the FTSE 250 Index. 
The graphs compare Cairn’s TSR with that of the chosen indices. The bar chart is presented as additional information to that

*  The prices shown in these tables represent the market value of a Cairn share on the date of commencement of the performance period. Given that all these awards lapsed  
prior to 22 December 2009 (see below), these prices and the numbers of shares over which the awards subsisted have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of the 10 for 1 
subdivision of the Company’s share capital that became effective on that date. 
The performance period applicable to the above awards ended on 23 April 2009. On the basis that the applicable performance 
conditions (a summary of which is provided on page 76) were not met, these awards lapsed in full shortly thereafter.
Overview of Share Incentive Plan Performance Conditions (unaudited)
Introduction
The vesting of each award and option granted under the Company’s various share incentive plans is conditional on the achievement 
of performance conditions determined by the remuneration committee at the relevant date of grant. Set out below is a summary of 
the conditions applicable to awards and options that were outstanding during the year.
In the case of the Company’s long-term incentive plans (being the arrangements in which the executive directors participate),  
the conditions principally relate to the TSR performance of the Company. These TSR measures were selected by the remuneration 
committee on the basis that they improve shareholder alignment and are consistent with the Company’s objective of delivering  
long-term value to shareholders.
On the expiry of the performance period applicable to an award or option, the calculations necessary to determine the extent to 
which the relevant conditions have been satisfied are subject to independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP .
2009 LTIP
In the case of all awards granted under the 2009 LTIP during the year, the extent to which an award vests will be determined by 
comparing the TSR of the Company over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in the following 
comparator group:
Addax Petroleum, Inc* Noble Energy, Inc
BG Group PLC Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited PTT Exploration & Production PLC
Chesapeake Energy Corporation Premier Oil PLC
CNOOC Limited Santos Limited
Dana Petroleum PLC SOCO International PLC
EOG Resources, Inc Talisman Energy, Inc
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Tullow Oil PLC
Indian Oil Corporation Limited Woodside Petroleum Limited
Newfield Exploration Company
 
* Denotes companies that have delisted during the applicable performance period.  74  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to 
produce a ‘ranking table’. The vesting of awards will then take place as follows:
Ranking of Company Against the Comparator Group Percentage of Ordinary Shares Comprised in Award That Vest
Below median 0%
Median 20%
Upper decile (i.e. top 10%) 100%
Between median and upper decile 20% – 100% on a straight line basis
In order to make sure that the 2009 LTIP encourages and rewards exceptional performance, the performance conditions attaching 
to awards also provide that, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate 
comparator group, a participant will then be given the opportunity to increase the percentage of his/her award that vests through 
the application of a ‘multiplier’ that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period. The way in which this 
multiplier will operate is as follows:
Multiplier Applied to Determine the Number of  TSR of the Company Over the Performance Period 
Ordinary Shares that Actually Vest 
1 50% or less
1.33 100% or more
1 – 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 50% and 100%
However, notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any award will vest unless the 
remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of 
the Company as a whole over the performance period.
2006 LTIP (Cairn India Awards)
In the case of all outstanding Cairn India Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP , the extent to which they vest will be determined  
by comparing the TSR of a Cairn India share over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a 
comparator group. The tables below show the comparator groups for each tranche of Cairn India Awards.
2007 Cairn India Awards – Comparator Group 2008 Cairn India Awards – Comparator Group

At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to 
produce a ‘ranking table’. The vesting of Cairn India Awards will then take place as follows:
Ranking of Cairn India Share Against the Comparator Group Percentage of Cairn India Units Comprised in Award that Vest
Below median 0%
Median 20%
Upper decile (i.e. top 10%) 100%
Between median and upper decile 20% – 100% on a straight line basis
For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP , where the TSR of a Cairn India share produces a ranking at or above 
the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Cairn India Award that vests may be 
increased through the application of the following ‘multiplier’ that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period:
Multiplier Applied to Determine the Number of  TSR of Cairn India Over the Performance Period 
Cairn India Units that Actually Vest 
1 40% or less
1.33 80% or more
1 – 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 40% and 80%
Notwithstanding the performance of a Cairn India share against the above targets, no part of any Cairn India Award will vest unless 
the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance 
of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
Replacement LTIP 
The vesting of a Converted Award will be determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over  
the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 LTIP Capricorn Award that it has replaced pursuant to the 
conversion mechanism described on page 64 above.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Award are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Award that it  
has replaced. In particular, the extent to which a Converted Award vests will be determined by comparing the TSR of the Company 
over the applicable performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group (see below) with vesting 
taking place as follows:
Ranking of the Company Against the Comparator Group Percentage of Ordinary Shares Comprised in  
 Converted Award that Vest
Below median 0%
Median 20%
Upper decile (i.e. top 10%) 100%
Between median and upper decile 20% – 100% on a straight line basis
For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP , where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above 
the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Converted Award that vests may be 
increased through the application of the following ‘multiplier’ that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance 
period:
Multiplier Applied to Determine the Number of  TSR of the Company Over the Performance Period 
Ordinary Shares that Actually Vest 
1 75% or less
1.33 150% or more
1 – 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 75% and 150%
For the purposes of the above conditions, the TSR performance of the Company over the performance period will be calculated by 
aggregating (i) the growth (or fall) in the TSR of a Capricorn Unit achieved between the start of the period and the ‘conversion date’ 
(being the date on which the conversion mechanism described on page 64 above became effective); and (ii) the growth (or fall) in 
the TSR of a Cairn share between the conversion date and the end of the period. 
Notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any Converted Award will vest unless the 
remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of  
the Company as a whole over the performance period.
The comparator group applicable to each Converted Award is identical to the group that applied to the Capricorn Award it has 
replaced. The table on the following page shows the comparator groups for each tranche of Converted Awards. 76  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

2002 LTIP 
The performance conditions attaching to all Tier One and Tier Two awards granted under the 2002 LTIP which were outstanding 
during the year, can be summarised as follows:
Step One
Firstly, the TSR of a Cairn share during the performance period is compared to the average TSR performance of the companies 
comprising the FTSE 350 Index. If Cairn’s TSR performance exceeds the average TSR performance of the Index, then the step 
one test has been passed. The step two test is then used to calculate how many (if any) Cairn shares that are the subject of the 
award will vest.
Step Two
Under step two, the TSR of a Cairn share is compared to the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group (see below) with 
vesting taking place as follows:
 Tier One Awards Tier Two Awards 
Ranking of the Company Percentage of Ordinary Ranking of the Company Percentage of Ordinary 
Against the Comparator Shares Comprised in Tier Against the Comparator Shares Comprised in Tier 
Group One Award that Vest Group Two Award that Vest 
Below median 0% Below upper quartile 0%
Median 20% Upper quartile 40%
Upper quartile or above 100% Number one position 100%
Between median and 20% – 100% on a Between upper quartile and 40% – 100% on a 
upper quartile straight line basis number one position straight line basis
Notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no Tier One or Tier Two award vests unless the 
remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and sustained improvement in Cairn’s underlying financial 
position and performance over the performance period.
The table below shows the comparator group applicable to the 2002 LTIP awards granted in 2006 (being the final set of awards 
made under this arrangement):

2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan 
All options granted under the above arrangements are subject to a TSR growth target measured over a three year performance 
period. Under this target, vesting will occur as follows: 
Average annual compound growth in TSR of the  Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in option that vests 
Company over the performance period 
Less than 5% 0%
5% 50%
10% or more 100%
More than 5% but less than 10% 50% – 100% on a straight-line basis
Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of an option granted under the 2009 Approved Option Plan or 2009 Unapproved 
Option Plan will vest unless the TSR of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median 
level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the 2009 LTIP (see the table on page 73).
Replacement Option Plan 
The vesting of a Converted Option will be determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over 
the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 Plan Capricorn Unit option that it has replaced pursuant to the 
exchange mechanism described on page 64 above.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Option are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Unit option  
that it has replaced. In particular, the extent to which a Converted Option vests will be determined by reference to the Company’s 
achievement against a share price growth target measured over the applicable performance period. Under this target, vesting will 
occur as follows: 
Average annual compound growth in the price Percentage of ordinary shares comprised 
of a Cairn share over the performance period in Converted Option that vests
Less than 5% 0%
5% 50%
10% or more 100%
More than 5% but less than 10% 50% – 100% on a straight line basis
Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of a Converted Option will vest unless the TSR of the Company over the performance 
period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes 
of the Converted Awards granted under the Replacement LTIP (see the first table on page 76).
1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan 
In the case of all outstanding options under the 1996 Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan, the option holder may only 
exercise his/her award if Cairn’s share price has increased by 5% on a compound basis over the period from the date of grant to the 
date of exercise; and the percentage increase in Cairn’s share price over the same period is at least equal to or greater than the 
percentage movement in the FTSE Oil & Gas Index.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF CAIRN ENERGY PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC for the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes  
in Equity and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as regards the Parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 58, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2009 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies  
Act 2006; 
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 52 to 61 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are Required to Report by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the directors’ statement, set out on page 58, in relation to going concern; and
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 52 to 61 relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
1. Accounting Policies
a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC (‘Cairn’ or ‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2009 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 6 April 2010. The Group is a limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded. The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, 
Edinburgh, Scotland.
Cairn prepares its accounts on a historical cost basis. Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact  
is disclosed in the relevant accounting policy. 
b) Accounting standards
Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU. 
The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
Cairn early adopted IFRS 8 – ‘Operating Segments’ as of 1 January 2008. The Group concluded that the operating segments 
determined in accordance with IFRS 8 are equivalent to the business segments previously identified under IAS 14. IFRS 8 disclosures 
are shown in Note 4.
For the year ending 31 December 2009, Cairn has adopted the following standards and interpretations:
Title Change to accounting policy Impact on initial application
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments (revised)’ Clarification on the definition of vesting 
conditions and cancellations and 
clarification on the scope and accounting 
for group cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions.
No impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group.
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments:  
Disclosures (amendments)’
Increased disclosures on fair value 
measurement and liquidity risk.
Fair value measurements related to items 
recorded at fair value are disclosed using  
a three level fair value hierarchy in Note 30. 
Liquidity risk disclosures in Note 29 are not 
significantly impacted.
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial  
Statements (revised)’
Terminology changes and changes to  
the format and content of the Group’s 
primary statements.
Cairn now presents a Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, presented in two 
linked statements and the Statement of 
Changes in Equity as a primary statement.
IAS 23 ‘Borrowing costs (revised)’ Eliminates the option of non-capitalisation 
of directly attributable borrowing costs.
No impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group.
IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements (amendments)’
All dividends paid from a subsidiary  
are recognised in the profit or loss of  
the parent irrespective of whether they  
are deemed to arise from pre or post 
acquisition profits.
No impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group or Company. 
IFRIC 9 ‘Re-assessment of Embedded 
Derivatives’, and IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement (amendments)’
Re-assessment of whether an embedded 
derivative must be separated from a host 
contract is required where a hybrid 
financial asset is reclassified out of fair 
value through profit or loss category.
No impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group.
Other amendments to IFRS effective during the year but with no impact on the accounting policies, financial position or 
performance of the Group were as follows:
– IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation (amendments)’ and IAS 1 ‘Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising  
on Liquidation (amendments)’;
– IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’; 
– IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’; and
– IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Liabilities with Equity Instruments’. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  87

of the Group is anticipated.
No other IFRS as issued by the IASB which are not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Group’s or Company’s 
financial statements. 
c) Presentation currency
The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is Sterling. These accounts have been 
presented in US Dollars ($), the functional currency of most companies within the Group. It is deemed to be more appropriate  
to present the financial statements in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group. The Group’s policy on foreign 
currencies is detailed in Note 1(p).
d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash 
Flows from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. Any goodwill arising is 
recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment. Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the 
value of the underlying cash generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill. Any such 
impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed 
in future periods. Negative goodwill is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the Income Statement 
of the parent company. The loss attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009 was $57 .0m (2008: loss of $19.4m).
e) Joint Ventures
Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Group’s oil and gas 
exploration and producing activities. Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in 
which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings. Cairn’s principal 
licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairn’s interests in unincorporated Joint Ventures is given on pages 78 and 79. 88  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
1. Accounting Policies continued
f) Revenue and other income
Revenue from operating activities
Revenue represents Cairn’s share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis, and tariff income 
received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income
Income received as operator from Joint Ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with Joint Venture agreements 
and is included within ‘Other operating income’ in the Income Statement. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest 
method on an accruals basis and is recognised within ‘Finance income’ in the Income Statement.
g) Intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets
Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets. 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis. Costs are held, 
un-depleted, within intangible exploration/appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete 
or commercial reserves have been discovered. 
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within 
intangible exploration/appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities. Exploration/appraisal drilling costs are 
initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established. The success or failure of 
each exploration/appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis. Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the 
results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial. 
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction 
demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration/appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within 
property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets after testing for impairment (see below). Where results of exploration 
drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off 
to the Income Statement. 
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated  
are capitalised within property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets on a field-by-field basis. Subsequent 
expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces  
part of the existing development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an intangible exploration/appraisal asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised 
costs. Any surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets 
are credited against the previously capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised in the 
Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of 
the asset.
Depletion
Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any significant components within property, plant and equipment – development/
producing assets, such as fields, processing facilities and pipelines, which are significant in relation to the total cost of a 
development/producing asset. 
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets on a unit-of-production basis, based 
on proved and probable reserves on a field-by-field basis. In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be 
combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment
Intangible exploration/appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 
‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’ and tested for impairment where such indicators exist. In such circumstances 
the exploration/appraisal asset is allocated to property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets within the same 
operating segment and tested for impairment. Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year. Where 
there are no development/producing assets within an operating segment, the exploration/appraisal costs are charged immediately 
to the Income Statement. 
Impairment reviews on property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating 
unit identified in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Cairn’s cash-generating units are those assets which generate 
largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development areas.

1. Accounting Policies continued
g) Intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets continued
Impairment continued
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash generating unit is compared with 
the associated expected discounted future net cash flows. If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the 
Income Statement as impairment. Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and 
long-term oil price of $65/bbl (2008: short-term of $50/bbl and long-term of $65/bbl), or the appropriate gas price as dictated by 
the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% (2008: 3% and 10% respectively). 
Forecast production profiles are determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques. 
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has 
been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the 
time. In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value  
or the carrying value that would have been determined (net of depletion) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
h) Property, plant and equipment – other
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and depreciated over their 
expected useful economic lives as follows:
   Annual Rate (%) Depreciation method 
Tenants’ improvements    10 – 33* straight line
Vehicles and equipment    25 – 50* straight line
* Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the economic life or the remaining term of the lease.
i) Intangible assets – other
Intangible assets have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and amortised over 
their expected useful economic lives as follows:
   Annual Rate (%) Depreciation method 
Software costs    25 – 50 straight line
 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. See Note 1(d).
j) Investments
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. The recoverable value of 
investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash 
flows of the oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and long-term oil price of $65/bbl 
(2008: short-term of $50/bbl and long-term of $65/bbl) or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, 
escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% (2008: 3% and 10% respectively). Forecast production profiles are 
determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
 
k) Inventory
Inventories of oil and condensate held at the balance sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated selling 
price in accordance with established industry practice.
l) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity. 
Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and 
receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group holds financial assets which are classified as either available-for-sale 
financial assets or loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through 
profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset. Financial liabilities are categorised 
as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost. All of the Group’s financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, 
with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the  
financial instrument. 90  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
Continued
1. Accounting Policies continued
l) Financial instruments continued
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.  
The derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when 
the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are taken directly to the Income Statement.  
The Group did not apply hedge accounting for derivative financial instruments held during the current and prior year.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables.  
The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares which are held at fair value (the quoted market price). 
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and Expense. The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale financial assets will be 
recycled through the Income Statement.
Loans and other receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market 
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less any impairment. Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The carrying amounts of loans and other receivables are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective 
material evidence of impairment, for example overdue trade debt. Any impairment losses are recognised through the use of an 
allowance account. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance 
account are recognised in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet in accordance with where the original receivable was recognised.
Bank deposits
Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the 
face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables and other non-derivative financial liabilities
Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest bearing bank loans and borrowings
All interest bearing bank loans and borrowings represent amounts drawn under the Group’s revolving credit facilities, classified 
according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility. Loans are initially measured at fair value less directly 
attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost  
using the effective interest method. Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower,  
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, 
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general 
policy on borrowing costs (see below).
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership 
lie with the Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred except for borrowing costs 
incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects which are capitalised within the property, plant and 
equipment – development/producing asset. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  91  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

1. Accounting Policies continued
m) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital 
and share premium.
n) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred 
income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that  
is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused 
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, 
carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred income tax asset relating to  
the deductible temporary timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect  
of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures, deferred 
tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future 
and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction and the group intends 
either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
o) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities. Cairn recognises 
the full discounted cost of dismantling and decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation arises. The decommissioning 
asset is included within property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets with the cost of the related installation.  
The liability is included within provisions. Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions 
required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset. The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit-of-
production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the ‘Depletion and decommissioning charge’ in the Income 
Statement, and the unwinding of the discount on the provision is included within ‘Finance costs’.
p) Foreign currencies 
In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate 
of exchange prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into 
the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date. Exchange differences arising are taken to the 
Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised  
as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency. Where applicable,  
the Group translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentation currency, US Dollars, using the closing rate method for  
assets and liabilities which are translated into US Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at  
the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts. Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets  
of Group companies whose functional currency is non US Dollars directly to reserves.  92  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

q) Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of 
Cairn and its subsidiaries. Cairn also operates insured benefit schemes for certain Indian and Bangladeshi employees as required under 
local legislation. In accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ these are treated as defined contribution schemes. The pension cost 
charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Share schemes
The cost of awards to employees under Cairn’s LTIP and share option plans, granted after 7 November 2002, are recognised over 
the three year period to which the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured 
at the date of the award. The shares are valued using either the Black Scholes or binomial model, further details of which are given 
in Note 7 .
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award (‘the vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not 
been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
Shares acquired to meet awards under these share schemes are held by the ESOP Trust. The accounts of the ESOP Trust are 
aggregated into these financial statements. 
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance (phantom options) are recognised over the 
period to which the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the transaction.
Termination benefits
Cairn recognises a liability for termination benefits at the point where the Group is committed to making the payments in return for 
employee redundancy.
r) Operating lease commitments
Cairn charges rentals payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. The Group 
has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the 
lessor and has therefore accounted for the contracts as operating leases.
s) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business. Such items are identified as 
exceptional and a full explanation is given in the Notes to the Accounts. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  93  
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

1. Accounting Policies continued
t) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Judgements
In the process of applying Cairn’s accounting policies, the Group has made the following judgements, which have the most 
significant accounting impact in the consolidated financial results:
Ravva arbitration provision
Cairn has fully provided for revenues withheld by buyers in relation to the disputed share of Ravva profit petroleum due to GoI. 
Cairn is taking all legal routes open to defend the Group’s position and to recover the revenues which Cairn believes have been 
wrongfully withheld. Success through any of these routes should result in a return of cash to the Group and the release of the 
provision. Further details are given in Note 6.
Key estimations and assumptions
The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements. The resulting accounting 
estimates may not equate with the actual results, which will only be known in time. Those areas believed to be key areas of estimation 
are noted below, with further details of the assumptions contained in the relevant note.
Oil and gas reserves 
Cairn estimates oil and gas reserves on a proved and probable entitlement interest basis. Gross reserve estimates are based on 
forecast production profiles over the remaining life of the field, determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum 
engineering techniques. Net entitlement reserves estimates are subsequently calculated using the Group’s current oil price and cost 
recovery assumptions. Estimated reserve quantities are given in the Reserves table on page 141.
Impairment testing
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using commodity price, cost and discount rate assumptions  
on forecast production profiles. See Notes 1(d), 1(g), 1(j) and 1(l) for further details.
Depletion 
Depletion charges are calculated on a field-by-field basis using oil and gas reserve estimates and future capital cost assumptions. 
See Note 1(g).
Decommissioning estimates
The Group’s provision for decommissioning oil and gas assets is based on current estimates of the costs for removing and 
decommissioning producing facilities, the forecast timing of settlement of decommissioning liabilities and the appropriate discount 
rate. See Note 27 .
Share-based payments
Charges for share-based payments are based on the fair value at the date of the award. The shares are valued using appropriate 
modelling techniques and inputs to the models include assumptions on leaver rates, trigger points, discount rates and volatility.  
See Note 7 .
Deferred tax
For certain of the Group’s Indian assets, the measurement of deferred tax liabilities requires the estimation of an effective rate of tax to 
apply over a tax holiday period. This effective rate is determined by the extent to which temporary differences are forecast to unwind 
during the tax holiday period and requires an estimation of future depletion charges expected to apply to the relevant assets based on 
current oil and gas reserve estimates. Details on further estimates and assumptions used in calculating deferred tax liabilities are given 
in Note 1(n).

Block Z-34, offshore Peru) was transferred to Gold Oil Caribbean Limited (a subsidiary of Gold Oil PLC) (‘Gold’). The Group made  
a payment of $1.5m to Gold in connection with the transfer. However, no gain or loss was recognised, as Plectrum was sold at  
book value.
Capricorn Oil and Gas Tunisia Gmbh (formerly REAP Gmbh), a subsidiary of Plectrum Petroleum Limited, which holds a 50% equity 
interest in the Nabeul permit offshore Tunisia, was transferred to Capricorn Petroleum Limited, a member of the Group, prior to the 
sale of Plectrum Petroleum Limited.
4. Segmental Analysis
Operating segments
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two business units; the Capricorn Group, being Capricorn Oil Limited and its 
subsidiary undertakings, and the Cairn India Group, each reporting internally to its own chief executive. There are three reportable 
operating segments as follows:
Cairn India Limited Group’s operations are primarily within India.
Capricorn Group’s operations focus on new exploration activities in Greenland and the Mediterranean. The Capricorn Group also 
includes the Group’s interests in Bangladesh and Nepal and a share in certain North Indian assets operated by Cairn India Limited.
Cairn Energy PLC exists to accumulate the activities and results of Cairn UK Holdings Limited, an intermediate holding company  
and direct parent of Cairn India Limited, and Cairn Energy PLC company results. Unallocated expenditure and net assets/(liabilities), 
including amounts of a corporate nature not specifically attributable to one of the sub-groups, are also included within this segment.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments. 
Management monitors the results of its business units separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation 
and performance assessment.

At the year end the Group reviews the carrying value of cash generating units within property, plant & equipment – development/
producing assets for indicators of impairment or reversal of prior year impairment. This review determined that certain units were 
impaired and consequently $1.3m has been charged to the Income Statement. 
In 2008, this review determined that the value of certain units previously impaired within the Capricorn Group was in excess of the 
carrying value. As a result a reversal of the prior year impairment charge of $2.7m was recognised through the Income Statement  
in that year. 
Refer to Note 13 and Note 14 for the reason for impairment and impairment reversals and Note 1(g) for details of the assumptions 
used in the impairment calculation.
At the year end the Group also reviews intangible exploration/appraisal assets for indicators of impairment defined under IFRS 6. 
Where such indicators are identified the Group tests those assets for impairment. In the current year the write-down of intangible 
exploration/appraisal assets followed an impairment test of the Capricorn Group cash generating unit. The producing asset in this 
cash generating unit is currently carried at net present value and no additional headroom exists to support the carrying value of 
exploration assets where indicators of impairment are identified. As a result a write-down of $137 .5m (2008: $21.0m) in relation to 
intangible exploration/appraisal assets has been charged to the Income Statement. $135.6m of the current year impairment has 
been classified as an exceptional charge against profit as it results from the assets transferred in the buy-back of minority interest  
in the year. See Note 6 for further details.
In the prior year, the Group relinquished Block 5 in Bangladesh. As a result costs of $6.5m were charged to the Income Statement  
as unsuccessful exploration costs in that year. As these costs were previously fully impaired, the impairments were released on 
relinquishment of the block in 2008.
c) Continuing operations
All profits and losses in the current and preceding year were derived from continuing operations.

Ravva arbitration
The calculation of the GoI’s share of petroleum produced from the Ravva field has been the subject of differing interpretations for 
some years and an arbitration to settle the matter was launched in 2003. The biggest single issue, the treatment of an item known 
as the ONGC carry, was found in Cairn’s favour by the arbitration panel in 2004. This was subsequently appealed by the GoI, 
following which it had been disclosed as a contingent liability in the notes to the financial statements. Cairn India’s share of this 
liability was $64.0m principal, plus interest of $31.6m. 98  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
6. Exceptional items continued
Ravva arbitration continued
Following the procedure laid out in the Ravva Production Sharing Contract (PSC), the GoI’s appeal was made to the Malaysian 
courts and in January 2009 they decided to set aside the arbitration award made in favour of Cairn India. Although not the final step 
in the legal process, the GoI then instructed the buyers of the Ravva crude not to pass over the revenues to Cairn until such time as 
they believed that the liability had been settled in full. 
A further judgement was delivered by the Malaysian Court of Appeal in September 2009 which reversed the Malaysian Court’s January 
2009 ruling and had the effect of re-instating the original award in favour of Cairn India. The GoI have applied for leave to appeal this 
judgement to the Federal Court of Malaysia and an admission hearing is scheduled in April 2010. Despite the September judgement 
re-instating the original arbitration award, the GoI continued to prevent the buyers passing revenues to Cairn throughout the 
remainder of the year. 
Consequently, on a conservative basis, Cairn has provided for the full $95.6m liability as an exceptional item. The disputed share  
of profit petroleum of $64.0m has been charged against revenue and the potential interest charge of $31.6m has been recognised 
as a finance cost. An associated deferred tax credit of $40.4m has also been recognised, making a net impact on profit after tax of 
$55.2m. During the year, the cash due on $150.0m of Ravva revenues have been withheld from Cairn. Cairn has offset $85.0m of 
current profit petroleum payments due to GoI against the $150.0m withheld. The remaining $65.0m has been set off against the 
provision, see Note 27 .
Cairn’s view of the merits of the underlying case remains unchanged and Cairn are taking all legal routes open to defend the 
Group’s position and to recover the revenues which Cairn believes have been wrongfully withheld. Success through any of these 
routes should result in a return of this cash to the Group.
Deemed disposal of Cairn India Limited and Farm-out of exploration/appraisal assets
On 14 October 2009, Cairn entered into an agreement with PETRONAS to dispose of a further 2.29% of the Group’s holding  
in Cairn India Limited and farm-out a 10% interest in each of the six Cairn operated Greenland exploration licences. Total consideration 
receivable from PETRONAS is $310.0m of which $241.4m relates to the Cairn India Limited shares with the remaining $68.6m allocated 
across the Greenland assets. At the year end a balance of $63.5m was due to Cairn.
The disposal of the Cairn India Limited shares results in a gain of $199.5m and reduces the Company’s indirect percentage 
shareholding in Cairn India Limited to 62.39% at 31 December 2009. Capital gains tax on the sale of $17 .5m is charged to the 
Income Statement. Under the Group’s accounting policy proceeds on the disposal of intangible exploration/appraisal assets are 
initially credited against previously capitalised costs in the Balance Sheet. Surplus proceeds remaining are credited to the Income 
Statement recognising a gain of $15.0m. 
PETRONAS has an option to increase its interest to 20% in any development in these blocks, in return for payment of further 
consideration to reflect a market valuation of the additional 10% interest at that time. In addition, PETRONAS may also farm-in to 
Cairn’s interests in non-operated Greenland exploration licences, subject to approval, within a year of the transaction. Proceeds  
will reflect the market value at that time. 
In 2008 the Group made an exceptional gain of $355.8m on the deemed disposal of 4.23% of Cairn India Limited during the period. 
4.12% of this disposal was through the private placement on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India,  
which completed on 16 April 2008. Cairn India Limited entered an agreement with PETRONAS and Orient Global Tamarind Fund Pte 
Limited, further to which the investors agreed to purchase a total of 113 million shares of Cairn India Limited at Rs. 224.30 per share.
The share options exercised under the Cairn India Senior Management Plan account for the additional reduction of the Company’s 
indirect percentage holding in Cairn India Limited. At 31 December 2008, the Company retained an indirect holding of 64.68% in 
Cairn India Limited.
Impairment of intangible exploration/appraisal assets
On 30 November, Cairn announced the acquisition of the 9.99% minority interest held by Dyas in Capricorn Oil Limited. Total 
consideration for the purchase of the Capricorn shares was $102.5m payable in $91.3m PLC shares, $3.7m cash and the transfer of 
15% of Capricorn’s working interests in the Tunisian and Albanian licences. Prior to the transfer, an impairment test was performed 
based on fair value less cost to sell resulting in an impairment charge of $135.6m with an associated tax credit of $33.6m.
Share-based payments
At an EGM held on 21 December 2009, Cairn’s shareholders approved the conversion of ‘phantom options’ awarded in 2007 and  
2008 based on notional ‘units’ in the Capricorn Group into Cairn Energy PLC Share options and LTIP’s. In accordance with IFRS 2,  
the incremental fair value of the modified awards, calculated at the date of modification, is charged over the remaining vesting period. 
A net charge of $29.9m is therefore recognised in the Income Statement as a result of this modification. A similar charge is expected  
in 2010. Further details can be found in Note 7 .

The Cairn Energy PLC share options have been valued using a binomial model. The main inputs to the model include the number  
of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility. 
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised  
to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees are assumed to exercise their options. 
The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero-coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the 
option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of  
a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 77 , 
over a 10-year period to the date of award. 102  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

2006 Plan and 2009 Replacement Share Option Plan
Under the 2006 Share Option Plan (the ‘2006 Plan’), certain executive directors and employees had been granted ‘phantom options’ 
(which are equity settled) over ‘units’ in the Group. On the exercise of an option, participants would generally become entitled to 
such number of Cairn shares as have a market value equal to the notional gain that they realise, being the difference between the 
‘notional exercise price’ attributable to their option and the price of the units in respect of which their option has been exercised. 
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 December 2009 resolutions were approved to convert these phantom options into 
Replacement Options over ordinary shares in the Company – the Replacement Share Option Plan. The conversion was intended  
to put the director or employee in the same position as if, on the date the phantom option was granted, they had instead been 
granted an option on equivalent terms over shares in the Company. The conversion took place on 22 December 2009.

2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP
Under the 2006 LTIP , certain executive directors and employees had been granted ‘phantom awards’ (which are equity settled)  
over Capricorn ‘units’ and Cairn India ‘units’ in the Group. Following the vesting of an award, participants would generally become 
entitled to such number of Cairn shares as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested units. Only 50% of these 
shares will be transferred to the participant immediately. The remaining 50% will be held for a further year. 
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 December 2009 resolutions were approved to convert the Capricorn phantom awards  
into Replacement LTIP awards over ordinary shares in the Company – the Replacement LTIP Plan. The conversion did not affect  
the Cairn India ‘units’ awarded. The conversion took place on 22 December 2009. The number of ordinary shares subject to each 
Replacement LTIP award was calculated by reference to an implied valuation of the Capricorn Group derived from the ‘farm-in’  
to its Greenland assets by PETRONAS. An additional condition was made concerning the holding period; on vesting the holder  
is able to sell sufficient shares to fund the tax liabilities which have arisen, and the remaining shares will be held by the Company’s 
employment benefit trust until 9 January 2013.

Cairn India Senior Management Plan
The Cairn India Senior Management Plan (‘CISMP’) was adopted by the company in November 2006. This is a discretionary 
arrangement that allowed the company to grant pre-IPO options over its shares to a limited number of its key senior management 
team. Following the completion of Cairn India’s flotation, no further options will be granted pursuant to this arrangement.
The vesting conditions for options granted under the CISMP are the successful completion of Cairn India’s flotation, the continued 
employment of the relevant participant within the Cairn India Group over a specified period of time and the achievement of certain 
specified performance targets relating to the Rajasthan development. Option exercises will be settled by an allotment of shares in 
Cairn India Limited to the relevant individual.
The options granted under the CISMP are exercisable between 9 January 2007 and 30 April 2011, at Rs.33.70. At 31 December 
2009, there were 2,238,078 options outstanding (2008: 2,238,078 options outstanding) with a weighted average remaining

Cairn India Performance Option Plan (2006)
The Cairn India Performance Option Plan (‘CIPOP’) was adopted by Cairn India in November 2006, and is a discretionary 
arrangement that allows the company to grant options over its shares to selected employees and executive directors.
Under the plan, Cairn India will grant options equivalent to 88,265,718 equity shares (when aggregated with the number of options 
to be granted pursuant to the CIESOP) of the face value of Rs.10 each at an exercise price of Rs.10 each to each of the eligible 
employees of the Cairn India.
The vesting of these options will generally be dependent on both continued employment and the extent to which predetermined 
performance conditions are met over a specified period of at least three years. Initially, the performance condition attached to options 
granted pursuant to the CIPOP will be based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of Cairn India compared to the TSR of a group of 
exploration, production and integrated oil companies.

Under UK tax law, borrowing costs which are capitalised in the accounts will generally be deductible expenses for tax in the period 
in which they are capitalised. Under Indian tax law, capitalised costs must be apportioned between property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets based on the nature of the assets which were funded by the borrowing. To the extent that the borrowing costs 
relate to property, plant and equipment, they will be deductible for tax according to the normal tax depreciation rules. Borrowing 
costs relating to intangibles will be a deductible expense, for Indian tax purposes, in the year in which they are capitalised. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  111

11. Taxation on (Loss)/Profit continued
a) Analysis of tax (credit)/expense in year continued
There is a credit to the income statement in respect of non-exceptional Indian deferred tax of $102.9m (2008: expense of $60.3m).  
In July 2009, Indian fiscal changes were enacted including an amendment to the tax holiday rules with the effect that tax relief can now 
be claimed for certain costs. A tax holiday is available on a contract area basis for seven fiscal years from commencement of production 
and so, where tax holiday relief can be claimed, deferred tax is provided only on the timing differences which remain at the end of the 
tax holiday period. Of the total credit for the year, $43.2m relates to the impact of the changes to the tax holiday rules and $59.7m is 
the movement in fixed assets in the year after taking account of amounts that will unwind before the end of the tax holiday period.
b) Factors affecting tax (credit)/expense for year
A reconciliation of income tax expense applicable to (loss)/profit before income tax at the applicable tax rate to income tax expense 
at the Group’s effective income tax rate is as follows:

The applicable tax rate was the weighted average rate for the year of the UK, Netherlands, Australian, Indian, Jersey, Swiss, 
Bangladeshi, Tunisian, Sri Lankan, Singaporean and Mauritian tax rates. On 1 April 2009, the Indian Minimum Alternate Tax rate 
increased from 10.56% to 15.84%, resulting in an average rate for the year of 14.53%. There were no other major changes in the 
statutory tax rates applying in each of these jurisdictions; however, the weighted average rate is subject to fluctuations from year  
to year based on the level of profits and losses which arise to the Group in each jurisdiction.
c) Factors that may affect future corporation tax charges
At 31 December 2009, Cairn had losses of approximately $527 .3m (2008: $366.0m) available for offset against future trading profits 
chargeable to UK Corporation Tax. In addition there are surplus management expenses of $141.4m (2008: $121.9m) and non-trade 
deficits of $21.9m (2008: $10.1m) available for offset against future investment income. None of the trading losses, surplus management 
expenses or non-trade deficits have been recognised for deferred tax as it is not considered sufficiently probable that they will be 
used. Under UK tax law, tax losses may generally be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2009, Cairn had losses of approximately $13.6m (2008: $14.7m) available for offset against future trading profits 
chargeable to Netherlands Corporate Income Tax, but there are restrictions on the use of these losses. Under Netherlands tax law, 
losses may be carried forward for a period of up to nine years. There were also Swiss tax losses of approximately $0.3m (2008: $nil) 
available for offset against future income chargeable to Swiss Corporate Income Tax. Under Swiss law, losses may be carried forward 
for a period of up to seven years. Cairn also had losses of approximately $0.6m (2008: $nil) available for offset against future profits 
chargeable to Australian Corporate Tax, but there are restrictions on the use of these losses. 
Under Australian law, losses may generally be carried forward indefinitely. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect  
of the Dutch, Swiss or Australian losses, as there is no probability that they will be used. 
At 31 December 2009, Cairn had losses of approximately $509.9m (2008: $369.1m) available for offset against future trading profits 
chargeable to Indian Corporate Income Tax. Under Indian tax laws, losses may be carried forward for a period of up to eight years. 
These losses have not been recognised for deferred tax purposes as it is not considered probable that they will be utilised against 
future trading profits chargeable to Indian tax. $474.5m (2008: $334.9m) of these losses are expected to expire during the period  
of an Indian tax holiday.

c) Factors that may affect future corporation tax charges continued
The remaining $35.4m (2008: $34.2m) of the loss has not been recognised due to expectations regarding the level of income  
in the entity concerned. 
Tax losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot usually be offset against profits or gains arising in another jurisdiction.
12. Earnings per Ordinary Share
The earnings per ordinary share is calculated on a profit of $24.7m (2008: profit of $348.8m) and on a weighted average of 
1,354,133,317 ordinary shares (2008: 1,298,034,315). The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by the Cairn 
Energy PLC Employees’ Share Trust. Comparative numbers have been updated to reflect the subdivision of Cairn Energy PLC 
ordinary shares during the year (see Note 28).
The diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated on a profit of $24.6m (2008: profit of $346.9m) and on 1,355,490,610 ordinary 
shares (2008: 1,299,738,512). The profit of $24.6m reflects the reduced profit attributable to equity holders of the parent after 
potential Cairn India Limited share option issues. The 1,355,490,610 ordinary shares is the basic weighted average of 1,354,133,317 
ordinary shares and the 1,357 ,293 dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to share options.

13. Intangible Exploration/Appraisal Assets continued
Disposals in the year relate to the farm-out of a 10% interest in each of Cairn’s operated Greenland licences to PETRONAS.  
A gain on disposal of $15.0m is recognised in the Income Statement. See Note 6 for further details. 
Exploration costs transferred to property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets (Note 14) during 2009 of $19.0m 
represent general exploration costs allocated to successful exploration activities in Rajasthan in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy. 2008 transfers of $98.8m also relate to successful Rajasthan exploration/appraisal costs associated with Bhagyam 
and Aishwariya oil fields where Cairn booked reserves during that year and Ravva general costs, which were allocated to successful 
exploration activities. 
Assets reclassified as held-for-sale (Note 22) include intangible exploration/appraisal assets being transferred on the buy-back of 
minority interest in Capricorn and costs relating to the Group’s Papua New Guinea interest. Prior to the re-classification, these assets 
were tested for impairment and an impairment charge of $135.6m recognised accordingly. Full details of the transfer of assets and 
resulting impairment loss can be found in Note 6.
At the year end, the Group reviews intangible exploration/appraisal assets for indicators of impairment defined under IFRS 6.  
Where an indicator is identified, the asset is tested for impairment. 
In 2009, exploration/appraisal costs of $1.9m (2008: $21.0m) relating to Bangladesh assets (2008: Bangladesh and Nepalese assets) 
have been impaired. See Note 5 for further details of the impairment review. In 2008, the Group relinquished Block 5 in Bangladesh. 
As a result costs of $6.5m were charged to the Income Statement as unsuccessful exploration costs. As these costs were previously 
fully impaired, impairments of an equal amount were released on relinquishment of the block.

At the year end the Group reviews the carrying value of cash generating units within property, plant & equipment – development/

units within the Capricorn Group was below the carrying value, resulting in an impairment charge of $1.3m. See Note 5 for further 
details of the impairment review.
Exploration costs transferred from intangible exploration/appraisal assets (Note 13) during 2009 of $19.0m represent general

On 30 November, Cairn announced the acquisition of the 9.99% minority interest held by Dyas in Capricorn Oil Limited.  
The minority interest was created in 2007 when Dyas acquired its holding in Capricorn with the group recording a gain  
on deemed disposal of $40.0m in that year. Total consideration for the purchase of the Capricorn shares was $102.5m.  
With the minority interest at the date of the transaction being $41.0m, goodwill of $62.8m is recognised on the buy-back  
after deducting further costs resulting from the transaction.
The consideration payable to Dyas consisted of $91.3m PLC shares and $3.7m in cash, both settled at the time of the transaction. 
The remaining $7 .5m liability is to be settled by transferring 15% of the Capricorn Group’s working interests in the Tunisian and 
Albanian assets, subject to approval. 
All goodwill recognised has been allocated to the Capricorn cash-generating unit, which is also a reporting segment, and has been 
tested for impairment. No impairment has been identified.
The recoverable amount of the Capricorn cash-generating unit has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs  
to sell or its value-in-use, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets within the unit as 
reported to management. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are disclosed in Note 1(g).
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes. The most likely 
factors which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit are the results of the future 
exploration drilling, which will determine the licence area’s future economic potential. 118  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

Following the buy-back of the Dyas minority interest, the Company’s direct and indirect holdings in the Capricorn Oil Group 
increased from 90% at 31 December 2008 to 100% at the balance sheet date. The further deemed disposal of Cairn India Limited 
during the year reduced the Company’s indirect holdings in the Cairn India Group from 64.68% at 31 December 2008 to 62.39%  
at the year end. Further details of both these transactions can be found in Note 6. 
There is a restriction in the ability of some Group companies to distribute profits to Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company,  
as a result of negative distributable reserves in Cairn Energy Holdings Limited, an intermediate holding company.

*  The movements during the year relate to amounts with corresponding balances in trade receivables, deferred income or other creditors in the Balance Sheet therefore do not 
affect the Income Statement.
In determining the recoverability of a trade or other receivable, the Group carries out a risk analysis based on the type and age  
of the outstanding receivable. 
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired Joint Venture debtors with a balance of $79.6m (2008: 
$60.9m). These predominantly relate to outstanding Rajasthan cash calls which are currently being pursued by management.  
The increase in allowance recognised in the Income Statement for impaired Joint Venture debtors in 2008 is included in 
unsuccessful exploration costs.

As part settlement of the minority buy-back (see Note 6), Cairn will transfer to Dyas a 15% interest in the Louza licence and a 7.5% 
interest in the Nabeul licence, both offshore Tunisia, and a 15% interest in the Joni-5 block offshore Albania. The three transfers are 
subject to approval from the respective governments. As no approval was received prior to the year end, the relevant share of the 
assets has been reclassified as held-for-sale at the Balance Sheet date. 
On 31 December 2009, Cairn entered into an agreement with Oil Search Limited for the sale of the Group’s 12.73% interest in  
Block PRL-1, Papua New Guinea. This transaction is also subject to government approval and therefore the assets are reclassified  
as held-for-sale at the year end.

At the Balance Sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for 
which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was $398.5m (2008: $408.4m). No liability has been recognised in respect of 
these differences because Cairn is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that 
such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group had a deferred tax asset of $24.3m (2008: $0.1m) in respect of future United Kingdom corporation 
tax deductions for equity-based remuneration. This asset has not been recognised as it is not considered probable that there will be 
sufficient profits to utilise these tax deductions.
As at the Balance Sheet date, a deferred tax asset was not recognised in respect of Group losses of $1,215.0m (2008: $881.7m) 
(Company: $141.4m; 2008: $113.1m) where it is not probable that they can be utilised in future periods.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised at 31 December 2009 or at 31 December 2008 in respect of trading or other losses,  
as it is not considered to be probable that these losses will be utilised against future trading or other profits arising to the Group.

Decommissioning costs are expected to be incurred between 2015 and 2041 (2008: 2012 and 2041). The provision has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 7% p.a. (2008: 7%). The change in 
decommissioning estimate in 2008 arose as a result of a third party review of estimated costs of decommissioning for the Ravva and 
Lakshmi and Gauri fields together with estimates of additional wells drilled in Rajasthan and the Rajasthan facilities in place at the 
year end. Continued progress on the Rajasthan producing facilities during 2009 further increases the Group’s future obligation for 
decommissioning. 
Other provisions include $8.8m relating to phantom options awarded to certain employees in India and a $2.3m provision for 
onerous contracts relating to the Group’s Sangu asset. Provisions for committed spend recognised on the acquisition of Plectrum 
and medOil of $2.0m were utilised during 2009. 
A provision of $95.6m regarding the Ravva arbitration proceedings was made during the year. Payments withheld by the buyers of 
Ravva crude on the instruction of GoI have been offset against current profit petroleum payments due to GoI with the remaining 
excess offset against the provision. At the year end, $65.0m of the provision had been utilised. See Note 6 for further details.

Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves in 
accordance with IAS 21 ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’.
In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation; this 
reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies. These intra-group 
loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.

Capital reserves – non-distributable include non-distributable amounts arising on various Group acquisitions. 
29. Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies
Group and Company
The main risks arising from the Company’s and the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency 
risk, commodity price risk and credit risk. The respective Boards of Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn India Limited review and agree 
policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below:
The Group’s treasury functions at Cairn Energy PLC, Cairn India Limited and local operational offices are responsible for these risks, 
other than credit risk relating to trade receivables for their respective businesses, in accordance with the policy set by their Board. 
Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, investment and funding requirements using a variety of 
techniques. These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that the companies and the Group have adequate liquidity  
at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements. Trade receivable credit risk is managed by the local operational 
management teams. 
The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, short and medium-term deposits, money market liquidity and mutual 
funds, intra-group loans, forward contracts, foreign exchange options, and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised 
cost. The Group’s strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. Other 
alternatives such as equity and other forms of non-investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the respective Boards, when 
appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas projects.
Liquidity risk
During 2008, Cairn India had an $850.0m revolving credit facility to fund Rajasthan developments from a consortium of international 
banks and the International Finance Corporation. During 2009, the Cairn India Group refinanced this facility through a combination 
of US Dollar (‘USD Facility’) and Indian Rupee loans (‘INR Facility’). 
The USD Facility is provided by a consortium of 6 international banks and the International Finance Corporation. Interest is charged 
at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the facility expires 31 December 2015. The maximum facility 
amount that can be drawn at any point in time is determined by reference to the net present value of the Rajasthan developments. 
The full $750.0m facility is currently available to be drawn, out of which $399.8m was drawn at 31 December 2009. Cairn India may 
cancel and repay the facility at any time. Under the terms of the facility agreement, security in terms of share pledge over the shares 
in Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited (a 100% indirect subsidiary of Cairn India Limited which holds 50% of the Group’s interest in 
Rajasthan) has been provided.
The INR Facility is provided by a consortium of seven leading Indian banks and financial institutions. The maximum facility amount is 
INR 40bn ($863m), interest is charged on floating rates linked to the State Bank of India’s Prime Lending Rate and the facility expires 
31 December 2015. The full facility is currently available to be drawn, of which INR 13,450m ($290m) was drawn as at 31 December 
2009. Under the terms of the INR facility agreement, security in terms of a charge over the participating interest of Cairn Energy 
India Pty Limited (a 100% indirect subsidiary of Cairn India Limited which holds 50% of the Group’s interest in Rajasthan) in the 
Rajasthan block is to be executed as condition subsequent.

29. Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued
Liquidity risk continued
On 28 March 2008, Cairn Energy PLC entered into a £30.0m revolving credit facility to fund its working capital. The facility was  
jointly provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and HBOS PLC and was to expire on 31 January 2013. Interest was charged at 
floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin. No sums were drawn at 31 December 2009 (2008: £nil). The facility 
was cancelled on 20 January 2010.
In addition, as at 31 December 2009, the Group has $66.2m (2008: $80.0m) of facilities in place to cover the issue of bank 
guarantees. Fixed rates of interest apply to these. $47 .6m (2008: $49.0m) was unutilised at 31 December 2009.
The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds, fixed-term deposits  
and mutual funds with a number of International and Indian banks and financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable 
the Group to meet its short/medium-term expenditure requirements.
The Group is conscious of the current environment and constantly monitors counterparty risk. Policies are in place to limit 
counterparty exposure. The Group monitors counterparties using published ratings and other measures where appropriate.
Interest rate risk
Surplus funds are placed on short/medium-term deposits at floating rates. It is Cairn’s policy to deposit funds with banks or other 
financial institutions that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue. The requirement to achieve an acceptable yield  
is balanced against the need to minimise liquidity and counterparty risk.
Short/medium-term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates. The treasury functions may from time to time opt to 
manage a proportion of the interest costs by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. At this time, however, 
there are no such instruments (2008: none).
Interest rate risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s profit before tax to a change in interest rates (through the impact  
on floating rate borrowings and investments). 
   Increase/decrease Effect on profit  
   in basis points before tax
2009    50  $6.9m
2008    50  $4.5m
In addition there would be a change of $3.6m to development/producing assets carrying value as a result of the capitalisation of  
the borrowing costs for the Rajasthan development (2008: $0.8m). 
The amounts calculated are based on actual drawings and investments in the periods for a 50 basis point movement in the total  
rate of interest on each loan or investment.
Foreign currency risk
Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in  
the same currency and actively managing the residual net position. Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts  
and payments have mostly been in US Dollars and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US Dollars. 
As a result of the Rajasthan developments, there has been an increased exposure between the Indian Rupee and US Dollar in  
the current period. This has now been significantly mitigated with the $ and INR facilities which allow matching of drawings and 
payments. 
In order to minimise Cairn’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by 
borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate. The Group also aims 
where possible to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in functional currency, which in most cases is US Dollars, 
thereby matching the presentation currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group. This minimises the impact  
of foreign exchange movements on the Group’s Balance Sheet. 
Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant, the Company and Group may, from time to time,  
opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. 
In 2008 Cairn India entered into forward foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian Rupee requirements as 
part of the Rajasthan Development. These options unwound during 2009. The fair value of the outstanding currency derivatives in 
Cairn India Group as at 31 December 2009 was $nil (2008: $3.7m). Refer to Note 30 for further details.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to movements in the $:GBP and $:INR exchange rates, with all other variables held 
constant, on the Group’s monetary assets and liabilities. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies  
is not material. 132  CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

Commodity price risk
There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu, CB-OS/2 and Ravva Gas 
Sales Contracts (GSCs). The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva, CB-OS/2 and Rajasthan oil sales are made to approved government nominated buyers or approved third parties at floating 
prices. 
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during either the current or the previous year. There were no 
outstanding commodity price contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year. The Group would not normally hedge 
commodity price risk but the respective Boards do monitor the position.
Credit risk
Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the CB-OS/2 and Sangu GSCs. 
With respect to Ravva and Rajasthan there are no payment securities; however, the buyers are either nominated by the GoI or are 
reputed private companies with good credit and payment record.
Credit risk from investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Treasury functions in accordance with  
the Board approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn India Limited respectively. Investments of surplus funds are only made 
with approved counterparties who meet the appropriate rating and/or other criteria, and are only made within approved limits.  
The respective Boards continually re-assess the Group’s policy and update as required. The limits are set to minimise the 
concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty failure. 
Investments by the Group in money market liquidity funds are only made with AAA rated funds and where the investment policy  
is limited to money market instruments. 
PLC and Capricorn Group limit the placing of deposits and other investments to banks or financial institutions that have at least  
two AA- or above ratings from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch, unless a Sovereign Guarantee is available from an AAA rated 
government. The counterparty limit is $100m and a maximum of 5% of a fund.
Cairn India’s policy is to limit the placing of deposits to banks with Moody’s long-term deposit rating of A2 and above in the case of 
$ funds and with Board-approved domestic banks in case of INR funds (at present all of them are AAA rated by CRISIL, a subsidiary 
of S&P). The counterparty limit varies from $50m to $400m for various categories of banks. Investments in $ money market liquidity 
funds are limited to schemes rated AAA by S&P , Moody’s and Fitch and are placed with Board-approved domestic debt mutual 
funds in the case of INR funds. Counterparty limits in case of money market mutual funds are $60m or 10% of the corpus, whichever 
is lower.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in Note 20. 
Deposits are spread over more than 20 banks and institutions to ensure no concentration of risk.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

29. Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued
Capital management
The objective of the Group’s capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to 
carry out committed work programme requirements. The respective Groups monitor the long-term cash flow requirements of their 
businesses in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
The respective Boards manage their own capital structure and make adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions. 
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Groups may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new 
shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate. 
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2009.

The derivative financial assets entered into in 2008 related to foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian Rupee 
requirements as part of the Rajasthan Development entered into by the Cairn India Group. These unwound during 2009. The fair value 
of the currency options was determined by reference to market values obtained from the bank from whom the options were bought. 
The cost to the Group of exercising the currency options on contractual maturity was paid on purchase of the options. The fair value 
movement in the carrying value of the option was included in the 2009 and 2008 financial statements. The options were not hedge 
accounted.
The available-for-sale financial asset relates to listed equity shares held by Cairn India. Refer to Note 17 for further detail.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had no financial instruments in level 1, 2 or 3.

Ravva Joint Venture Arbitration proceedings: Base Development Cost
In a dispute separate and unrelated to the profit petroleum calculations under the Ravva PSC disclosed in Note 6, the Ravva  
joint venture received a claim from the Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) for the period from 2000-2005 for $166.4m for  
an alleged underpayment of profit petroleum to the Indian Government, out of which Cairn India Group’s share will be $37 .4m  
(INR 1,909m) plus potential interest at applicable rate (LIBOR plus 2% as per PSC). 
This claim relates to the Indian Government’s allegation that the Ravva JV has recovered costs in excess of the Base Development 
Costs (’BDC’) cap imposed in the PSC and that the Ravva JV has also allowed these excess costs in the calculation of the Post Tax 
Rate of Return (PTRR). Cairn believes that such a claim is unsustainable under the terms of the PSC because, amongst other reasons, 
the BDC cap only applies to the initial development of the Ravva field and not to subsequent development activities under the PSC. 
Additionally the Ravva JV has also contested the basis of the calculation in the above claim from the DGH. Even if upheld, Cairn 
believes that the DGH has miscalculated the sums that would be due to the Indian Government in such circumstances. 
To resolve this dispute, arbitration proceedings have been initiated, the arbitration panel been fully constituted and pleadings 
exchanged. The matter is set for hearing in April 2010.
Indian Service Tax
One of the subsidiary companies of the Cairn India Group has received four show cause notices from the tax authorities in India for 
non-payment of service tax as a recipient of services from foreign suppliers. 
These notices cover periods from 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2009. A writ petition has been filed with Chennai High Court 
challenging the liability to pay service tax as recipient of services in respect of first show cause notice (16 August 2002 to  
31 March 2006) and challenging the scope of some services in respect of second show cause notice (1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007). 
The reply for second and third show cause notice has also been filed before the authorities. 
Should the adjudication go against Cairn India Group, it will be liable to pay the service tax of approximately $36.2m (INR 1,679m) 
plus potential interest of approximately $12.5m (INR 581m), although this could be recovered in part where it relates to services 
provided to Joint Venture of which Cairn India is operator.

34. Contingent Liabilities continued
Indian Tax Holiday on Gas Production 
Section 80-IB(9) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 allows the deduction of 100% of profits from the commercial production or refining  
of mineral oil. The term ‘mineral oil’ is not defined but has always been understood to refer to both oil and gas, either separately  
or collectively.
The 2008 Indian Finance Bill appeared to remove this deduction by stating without amending section 80-IB(9) that ‘for the purpose  
of section 80-IB(9), the term ‘mineral oil’ does not include petroleum and natural gas, unlike in other sections of the Act’. Subsequent 
announcements by the Finance Minister and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas have confirmed that tax holiday relief would  
be available on production of crude oil but have continued to exclude gas.
Cairn India filed a writ petition to the Gujarat High Court in December 2008 challenging the restriction of section 80-IB to the 
production of oil. Gujarat High Court did not admit the writ petition on the grounds that the matter needs to be first decided  
by lower tax authorities. An SLP has been filed before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Gujarat High Court. 
In the event this challenge is unsuccessful, the potential liability for tax and related interest on tax holiday claimed on gas production 
for all periods to 31 March 2010 is approximately $49.6m. 
Guarantees
It is normal practice for the Group to issue guarantees in respect of obligations during the normal course of business. 
The Group had provided the following guarantees at 31 December 2009:
Various guarantees under the Group’s bank facilities (see Note 29) for the Group’s share of minimum work programme 
commitments for the current year of $18.6m (2008: $31.0m).
Parent company guarantees for the Group’s obligations under PSC, sales and other contracts.

SHAREHOLDER NOTES
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote 
instead of him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting to represent you. A form of 
proxy accompanies this Notice of Annual General Meeting and must be lodged with the Company at the office of its registrars, 
Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6ZR (the ‘Registrars’) or received via the Sharevote 
service (see Note 2 below) or lodged using the CREST proxy voting service (see Note 3 below) not less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for the Meeting or any adjournment(s) thereof. The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member entitled 
to attend and vote at the Meeting from doing so if he or she wishes. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out 
in these notes and the notes to the form of proxy. If you wish to change or revoke your proxy appointment, please contact the 
Registrars on 0871 384 2660 (if calling from overseas: +44 (0) 121 415 7047 for further details. Lines open 8.30am to 5.30pm, 
Monday to Friday. Calls to the 0871 384 2660 number cost 8 pence per minute from a BT landline. Other telephony provider 
costs may vary. Calls to the helpline from outside the United Kingdom will be charged at applicable international rates.
2. Members may register their proxy appointments or voting directions electronically via the www.sharevote.co.uk website,  
where full details of the procedure are given. Members will need the Reference Number, Card ID and Account Number set  
out on the form of proxy which accompanies this Notice of Annual General Meeting. Members are advised to read the terms  
and conditions of use carefully. Electronic communication facilities are available to all shareholders and those who use them  
will not be disadvantaged. The Company will not accept any communication that is found to contain a computer virus.
3. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so  
for the Annual General Meeting to be held on 20 May 2010 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described  
in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take 
the appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message  
(a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (‘EUI’) 
specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, 
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Registrars by no later than 12.00 noon  
on Tuesday, 18 May 2010, or, in the event that the Meeting is adjourned, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the 
adjourned Meeting (not including any part of any day that is a non-working day). No such message received through the CREST 
network after this time will be accepted. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Registrars are able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed 
through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
 CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that EUI does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by 
means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings. The CREST Manual can be reviewed at www.euroclear.com/CREST.
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
4. You may appoint more than one proxy provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different Ordinary 
Shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one Ordinary Share. To appoint more  
than one proxy, please contact the Registrars on 0871 384 2660 (if calling from overseas: +44 (0) 121 415 7047 . Lines open  
8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday. Calls to the 0871 384 2660 number cost 8 pence per minute from a BT landline.  
Other telephony provider costs may vary. Calls to the helpline from outside the United Kingdom will be charged at applicable 
international rates.
5. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have 
been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 
(‘Nominated Persons’). Nominated Persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds the 
shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if Nominated Persons do 
not have such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the 
person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights. 
6. Any corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representative(s) who may exercise on its behalf all  
of its powers as a shareholder provided that they do not do so in relation to the same Ordinary Shares. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009  147

relating to the business being dealt with at the Meeting which is put by a member attending the Meeting, except in certain

the right to require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the

require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528  
of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 
Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s Auditor not later than the time when it makes the 
statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
13. A member may not use any electronic address provided either in this Notice of Annual General Meeting or any related

those expressly stated.

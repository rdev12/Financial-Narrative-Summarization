Chairman’s statement
HRG has once again
produced good results and
continues to anticipate a
positive and resilient future.
 This has been another year of good
performance by the Group, with revenues
increasing and profits showing material
growth over last year’s results. In its turn
this enables the funding of another
significant increase in the dividend, in line
with our progressive dividend policy.
We and our clients operated in the last year
in a world of divergent regional economic
performance. The European economy
benefitted from growth in Germany but
otherwise did poorly in a year that was
dominated by the eurozone crisis and
political indecision over the best way to
resolve it. Within Europe the UK economy
was broadly unchanged for the year as a
whole but questions remain about the
fragility of the economy. North American
economies grew in 2011 but not quite as
well as in 2010 while certain countries in
South America and much of Asia delivered
very good growth in GDP . With these
different challenges and opportunities as
the backdrop, HRG has once again
produced good results and continues to
anticipate a positive and resilient future.
Our strategy is to provide a range of
services to our clients in the corporate
travel and related expense area. We do this
through a mixture of internet and direct
service offerings allowing clients to choose
from a range of service levels with
consequent pricing options. We are
expanding accessibility and range, and
have recently increased ownership of our
subsidiary, Spendvision, to one hundred
per cent. This will enable us to introduce
Spendvision’s capabilities in online expense
management to the corporate travel
market, whilst also continuing to develop
its capabilities in the existing markets that
it serves. Like all businesses we face risks in
delivering our strategy including higher oil
prices and their impact on travel costs.
We have to be at the forefront of
technological change as the internet and
mobile technology constantly increase
the ways to interact with clients. Natural
disasters can impact our business,
interestingly, positively as well as negatively
and finally, travel costs are affected by
Government increasing fuel duty and
taxation of air travel. Notwithstanding
these risks, we see a good and expanding
future for the business in the long term.
Chief Executive David Radcliffe reports in
more detail on performance in the year
and the outlook. I would just like to draw
shareholders’ attention to the increase in
underlying earnings per share of 14%. Your
Board remains mindful of its commitment
to maintain a progressive dividend policy
while being cognisant of the capital needs
of the business and its cash flow.
Nevertheless we think it appropriate to
reward shareholders with an increase in
the total dividend of 33% ahead of last
year’s 25% increase.
Borrowings have been held flat this year
with the £10.4m cash outflow in
connection with the Spendvision purchase
being fully funded by the cash flow
generated from operations. Year-end net
debt again reflects management action to
hold it below the average borrowing level
for the year but we no longer see the need
for this active working capital programme
to continue in the future. After allowing for
its cessation, we expect the business to
again generate positive free cash flow in
the coming year.
The pension deficit remains a substantial
amount for a company of our size. The UK
pension scheme has been closed to new
members since 2003 and during the year
we have taken action to reduce the
volatility of the deficit by offering
enhanced transfer values to members who
withdraw from the scheme. Nevertheless,
for so long as interest rates remain at such
low levels, it is difficult to see the net
pension liabilities reducing significantly.
Your Board has complied with the
requirements of the UK Corporate
Governance Code and, as envisaged last
year, we undertook a review of Board
effectiveness by external consultants in the
last year. The review concluded that our
procedures are appropriate but, as always,
there are some things we can do better.
We have established a programme to
follow up these points and will do so
through the coming year.
We have benefitted from the additional
input of the two directors who were
appointed last year and we were recently
pleased to announce the appointment of
our new Group Finance Director, Philip
Harrison, who will join the Company on
11th June. We are looking forward to
working with him. Philip has been
appointed to fill the role that will be left
when Julian Steadman retires at the AGM
on 25th July after four and a half years’
service. In that time, the Company has
produced consistently better results and
achieved an improved financial position
and I would like to thank Julian for his
important contribution. We wish him well
with his future plans.
Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to
all those who have contributed to the
Company’s success this year. The growth
has continued and that is due to the efforts
of the executive and staff colleagues who
have always put the client first, and of
course to my colleagues on the Board.

Measuring our progress Chief Executive’s statement
As the breadth of the
Group’s services has
widened in recent
years, our clients have
remained at the centre
of our attention.
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report another year of
good financial and operational
performance. We made excellent progress,
continuing the positive momentum that
we achieved in the last financial year and
since the onset of the financial crisis in 
late 2008. During the first six months, we
delivered very good growth despite the
continuing macroeconomic uncertainty. As
expected, the second half was essentially
flat when measured against more
demanding year-on-year comparatives
following our strong performance in the
second half of last year. For the year ended
31 March 2012, client travel activity
increased by 2% and travel spend by 5%.
Our own revenue rose by 5% and
underlying operating profit by 13%.
Given the obvious macroeconomic
uncertainty, it is not surprising that our
clients continue to show a cautious
approach to their travel. Most recognise
the need to travel as they pursue their
growth objectives. However, a majority had
two common objectives this year: to gain
tighter control of their travel activity and to
maximise the value of their travel-related
expenditure. The result was a growing
trend towards consolidation of service and
the delivery of incremental cost savings.
As we have noted before, our proprietary
technology is playing an increasingly
important role by providing accurate and
relevant data to both our clients and our
own business managers as they help our
clients make decisions. Technology also
helps provide efficient and cost-effective
tools applicable to other areas of the travel
and expense management process.
Our strategy is centred on delivering value
through excellent service that is tailored
to the specific needs of each client.
As the breadth of the Group’s services
has widened in recent years, to include
travel, expense and data management
underpinned by proprietary technology,
our clients have remained at the centre of
our attention. This approach supports our
reputation as one of the world’s leading
international corporate services companies
helping us sustain a business which
delivers value to all stakeholders in the
toughest of trading climates.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue of £374m was up 5% as reported,
or up 2% at constant exchange rates.
Underlying operating profit, which is
before the amortisation of acquired
intangibles, was up by 13% to £47.2m, and
represented a margin improvement from
11.7% to 12.6%. Underlying profit before
tax was up by 16% to £38.2m, and
underlying EPS increased by 14% from
7.3p to 8.3p. Once again, this performance
underscores the fact that our model does
not rely on large revenue growth to enable
margin progression.
After including the amortisation of
acquired intangibles, reported operating
profit was up by 14%, profit before tax was
up by 18% and EPS increased by 17%.
Reported revenue per employee
increased by 2.7% from £67.5k to £69.3k.
At constant exchange rates this was an
increase of 0.6%.
At the end of the year, we purchased the
remaining 42% of Spendvision for £13.4m,
which valued 100% of Spendvision at
£32.0m. The consideration was funded by
£8.4m of cash and the issue of £5.0m of
new HRG shares. There was also a deferred
consideration payment of £2.0m in cash.
Spendvision is a leading innovator in the
development and support of transaction
management solutions, including expenses
management and payable automation.
Full ownership brings a number of benefits
to the Group. The acquisition is expected 
to be earnings neutral in the year ending 
31 March 2013 and marginally earnings
enhancing in the year ending 31 March
2014, excluding the benefit of any cost or
revenue synergies.
Cash flow generation remained strong.
Year-end net debt was held flat at £61m,
after paying cash consideration of £10.4m
for the acquisition of Spendvision and
without any change to our active working
capital programme. Year-end net debt
represented 1.1x EBITDA (2011: 1.2x).
Reducing net debt has been a key focus 
of the Group over the last four years and
our consistently strong free cash flow,
coupled with active working capital
management, means that the latest net
debt figure is now almost half of the
£110m in 2008.
PENSIONS
On an accounting basis, the Group-wide
pension deficits amounted to £146m
before tax, or £113m after tax (2011: £89m),
reflecting the impact of continuing low
interest rates on the net present value of
liabilities. As already announced, the April
2011 triennial valuation of the principal 
UK scheme was agreed with only a small
increase in current cash contributions. 
Since then, we have sought to reduce
future volatility by offering enhanced terms

Take advantage of the global growth in corporate travel and the
accelerating trend to outsource on a global basis
Clients
Grow market share through new and existing clients

Acquisition
Seek opportunities for strategic, low-risk M&A – either geographic
infill or additional product/service
to deferred members who transfer their
accrued benefits to alternative pension
providers. This offer has reduced the
March 2012 assets and liabilities by £33m.
The cost of implementing the offer
amounted to £1.4m and is included in
operating expenses for the period.
DIVIDEND
We operate a progressive dividend policy
that remains unchanged. In recognition of
the continued strong performance and
improved financial position, the Board is
recommending a final dividend of 1.4p per
share resulting in a full-year dividend of
2.0p per share. This represents an increase
of 33% on the prior year and is ahead of
the minimum figure of 1.8p per share that
we indicated in our half-year results
statement last November. Our dividend is
covered 4.2x (2011: 4.9x) by underlying EPS.
The final dividend will be paid on 30 July
2012 to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 29 June 2012.
THE BOARD
Earlier this month we announced that
Philip Harrison would be joining us on
11 June as our new Group Finance Director,
taking over from Julian Steadman when he
retires at our AGM in July. We look forward
to welcoming Philip to HRG. On behalf of
the Board, the executive management
team and all the staff at HRG, I would like to
place on record our sincere thanks to Julian
for the positive contribution he made to
the Group during his time with us, and to
wish him the very best for the future.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
Given the difficult macroeconomic outlook,
we expect trading conditions to remain
challenging during the current financial
year. However, since the year end, the
Group has continued to trade in line with
our expectations and we are confident that
our proven strategy and business model,
our robust financial position and strong
pipeline of new business opportunities will
enable HRG to continue to make good
progress in the year ahead.

achieving the Group’s strategic objectives.
HRG has a comprehensive system of
controls in place to manage risks. We
conduct regular reviews of the major risks
which may affect our business and its

evaluated and mitigated through a
combination of a ‘top-down’ (driven by
the Board) and ‘bottom-up’ (originating
from the operations) approach. 
Our Group internal audit function
undertakes regular reviews across the
Group’s operations to assess the controls
that are in place to mitigate these risks.

of Spendvision plays to
the growing demand
by our clients for an
integrated ‘ end-to-end’
travel and expense
management solution.
MARKET OVERVIEW
The global economy remains uncertain.
Figures published by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) reveal 3.9% growth in
world output in calendar 2011, compared
to 5.3% in the prior year, with estimates of
3.5% and 4.1% growth in 2012 and 2013
respectively. Regional variations exist with
growth in the mature economies projected
at roughly 1% in 2012 while output in
developing economies is forecast to rise
by about 6%.
As has been predicted by past industry
statistics, corporate travel has continued to
grow, building on the recovery that began
towards the end of calendar year 2009.
According to the World Travel & Tourism
Council (WTTC), business travel
expenditure increased by 3.3% at constant
currency in calendar 2011, following the
2.6% in the prior year, and it forecasts
growth of 2.5% in 2012.
Airline passenger numbers, as reported by
the International Air Transport Association
(IATA), also continue to grow. Overall,
passenger numbers, including leisure traffic,
grew by 5.9% in calendar 2011, following the
7.3% increase in the prior year, and is forecast
to grow by 4.2% in 2012. The number of
premium class passengers grew by 5.5% in
2011 and economy class passengers
increased by 5.1%. Premium traffic, which is
often seen as a barometer of business
confidence, is now about 10% below its pre-
recession peak while the number of
passengers flying on economy class seats is
approximately 7% above. We believe these
numbers also reflect the ongoing trend for
business passengers to travel in economy,
particularly on short-haul journeys.
For hotels, revenue per available room
(RevPAR) increased by approximately 8% in
calendar year 2011, following 9% in the
prior year, according to the latest data from
STR Global. On a regional basis, Europe, the
Americas and Asia Pacific showed growth
rates of 13%, 8% and 11% respectively,
while RevPAR for hotels in the Middle East
and Africa fell by 1%. The outlook for global
lodging appears cautiously positive. As
examples, both Marriott and Starwood
have indicated that they expect constant
currency RevPAR growth for 2012 to be
similar to 2011.
While HRG’s fee-based business model
does not correlate with any one particular
set of data, the IMF, WTTC, IATA and STR
Global figures all point to a cautiously
positive trend and this is consistent with
our view on the outlook for HRG.
CLIENT ACTIVITY
During the financial year, our client travel
spend rose by 5% or 2% at constant
currency, while travel booking activity
rose by 2%.
Following the sharp rises in travel booking
activity and spend, which were features of
our clients’ activity last year as business
confidence recovered in the aftermath of
the global recession, two specific trends
were common to many of our clients’
activity this year:
– Consolidation of travel management
services through fewer locations
– Determination by clients to seek
incremental cost savings wherever
possible
We have seen further evidence of a
growing trend towards consolidation of
travel management through fewer
locations, often as part of a general aim to
move towards a more centralised model
for outsourced services. We anticipated this
move some years ago and have been
steadily developing our multi-country
service model based on fewer locations.
The drive by clients to seek further,
incremental cost savings is a natural
consequence of the ongoing
macroeconomic uncertainties and their
effect on business generally. Clients are
generally more cautious compared to last
year and while they recognise the need to
continue to travel, they are keen to explore
all opportunities to gain better value from
their travel expenditure. As we have seen in
the past, during periods of uncertainty and
austerity, our clients have naturally drawn
on our expertise, experience and bespoke
advice to help them optimise their travel
expenditure and costs.
In addition to looking for savings from the
travel itself, our clients are increasingly
listening to our ideas on how savings can
be made by changing or implementing
different systems around the process of
booking travel. Adoption of online self-
booking for simpler travel itineraries
continues to grow, not only in the
traditional high adoption markets in North
America, Australia and certain European
countries; companies are now looking at
deployment on regional and global bases.
In certain countries, self-booking accounts
for more than 50% of all travel transactions.
Our move to full ownership of Spendvision
plays to the growing demand by our
clients for an integrated ‘end-to-end’ travel

and expense management solution. We
already have clients who benefit from this
approach and look forward to developing
this opportunity in the future.
Costs associated with hotel expenditure
and business meetings are other areas
where we are helping our clients gain
better value and reduce costs. These
costs have often been overlooked or
misunderstood by clients in the past and
as a result of improved data we are now
able to offer more disciplined advice in
these areas. Programme savings and
compliance policy advice are amongst
many other areas where HRG is now
providing additional services to its clients
related directly to cost savings.
The supply and analysis of data is at
the heart of much of HRG’s travel
management advice and we have seen
an increase in demand from clients for
relevant data and analysis to aid decision-
making across all areas of travel
management, including risk, travel cost
and supplier performance. A key product
of the ongoing development of our
proprietary technology, HRG’s superior
data and analysis is offering new revenue
opportunities to the Group.
Our focus in all aspects of our business
remains firmly on the delivery of the
highest quality of service to each of our
clients around the globe. Inevitably, we
lose clients from time to time, but we
continue to attract new clients and expand
our relationships with existing clients.
Once again, our value proposition has
been rewarded by a consistently-high
client retention rate.
We were pleased to welcome several new
clients during the year including Addax
Petroleum, AIG, Allianz, CGI, Monitor,
Posten Norge, SNC-Lavalin and States of
Jersey. We also secured expanded
contracts, in terms of both service and
geography, with existing clients such as
ABB, BG Group, BMW, Buhler, Capsugel,
Department of Veteran Affairs, DHL,
Huawei, Mars, Polarcus, Sweco, Sungard,
Tesco, UK Central Government and
Volkswagen. Notable amongst clients
renewing their contracts with HRG were
ABB, BG Group, BMW, DuPont, Ergon
Energy, Foreign & Commonwealth Office,
Interpublic Group, Ministry of Defence,
News Corporation, Porsche, Smiths Group,
TeliaSonera and Wells Fargo. Since the year
end, Unilever has indicated its intention to
award its travel contract to HRG. As a new
client, Unilever will use HRG services in
over 70 countries around the globe. Once
again, these successes are evidence of the
huge diversity of HRG’s client base, in terms
of both industry and geography, which is
one of the Group’s key strengths.
Our new business pipeline remains very
healthy. We are pleased to note that several
of our larger clients and prospects are
showing a desire to consolidate service
provision as well as by geography.
The breadth of HRG’s service offering,
which includes travel, expense and data
management, provides natural benefits
to those seeking a ‘one-stop shop’ .

– Continuing to help clients consolidate
multi-country travel operations into
single-point service hubs
At constant currency, revenue was
unchanged for the year, with client
spending and travel activity also broadly
unchanged. Underlying operating profit
rose by £1.3m, including a £1.0m benefit
from currency movements.
HRG’s European business produced a
steady result, building on last year’s
performance despite the heightened
macroeconomic uncertainties which
resulted in many of our clients taking a
more cautious approach to travel.
The trend for clients to consolidate multi-
country operations into single-point
service hubs also continues as clients
increasingly seek value, policy compliance,
control and robust security monitoring.
This trend has now become a regular
feature in all major new business proposals.
HRG’s investment in wide area network
(WAN) and telephony platforms plays well
to this service configuration as we can re-
route call volume and optimise resources
based on demand. We continue to
rationalise our service network and cost
base in Europe where appropriate, as we
increasingly focus our resources on fewer
service points or strategic hubs.
Client adoption of online self-booking
continued to grow and now accounts for
27% of all bookings made in the region, up
from 25% last year. During the year, we
continued to improve the efficiencies of
our operations across the region. The
branch network consolidation and
telephony call-flow switching have allowed
more travel consultants to work from
home and improved clients’ online self-
booking experience. Less HRG intervention
is one of the cost-saving initiatives that
have helped us to stay price competitive
and maintain margins.
Our ongoing focus in the UK has been to
deliver excellent service and value to our
clients. We have continued to improve our
cost base during the year and further
efficiencies continue to be evaluated.
Amongst new business wins were AIG, BP ,
Allianz and the UK Central Government.
Client activity and travel spend increased in
Germany during the year. The first full year
of trading with Volkswagen added to the
business generated by existing clients, as
did Novartis which started to trade with us
during the year. HRG Germany played a
significant role in helping us win geographic
extensions for a number of large German
clients, including Volkswagen, BMW and
DHL, in the period. HRG’s sports-related

At constant currency, revenue was up
1.9%, with client spending increasing by
3% and travel activity by 4%. Underlying
operating profit grew by £1.9m, with no
impact from currency movements.
Margins improved as a result of tight
cost control, including further
rationalisation of our property portfolio.
Our business in North America delivered a
solid performance during the year. Top-line
growth was bolstered by increased client
activity and the provision of additional
travel management product and services
to existing clients. Meetings Management
is one specialist service that proved
particularly attractive to those clients with
limited internal resource. We saw further
growth in client adoption of our online
self-booking solutions, using our own or
third-party booking tools. Online self-
booking is proving attractive to clients
looking to gain better value in their travel
spend and is well suited to clients in North
America where point-to-point domestic
travel journeys are commonplace.
The North American market remains very
competitive. Our steady investment in recent
years in efficient operating systems,
underpinned by our proprietary technology,
enables us to handle large volumes of lower-
price transactions which are commonplace
for domestic travel in this region.
Our loyalty business in Canada, which
manages the redemption of credit card
reward points programmes, continued to
perform well. We restructured this business
during the year to take account of a
planned move into an online environment
in cooperation with another supplier.
This online agreement will attract lower
fees but also requires a significantly lower
cost base to operate. During the year,
we also entered the loyalty market in the
USA with new clients Lufthansa Miles &
More and Delta SkyMiles and the pipeline
remains strong.

At constant currency, revenue was up by

19% and travel activity by 24%. There was
no currency impact on the £0.5m increase

Our business in Australia performed well
during the year, aided by the ongoing
strength of the economy and the surge
in demand for the country’s natural
resources. We won several new clients
and expanded the scope of our services
to many existing clients. Our margin
improvement reflects continued
improvements in our operational
efficiency. Online self-booking of travel
increased further during the year and
now accounts for more than 55% of all
bookings (2011: approximately 50%).
Although there was some softening of the
corporate travel market during the third
quarter of our financial year, it rebounded
strongly during the final quarter.
Our business in Singapore remained
stable during the past year reflecting the
relative stability of the country’s economy
in the face of the uncertainties that
continue to dominate other regions of
the world. As we have noted before,
Singapore is a natural hub for client travel
consolidation. The trend towards
increasing consolidation of operations is
now being explored by clients in some
smaller markets such as Malaysia,

With a refreshed management team in
place, revenue was up 20.0% at constant
currency, with good growth in direct
business and also with clients in the
banking sector. Underlying operating profit
grew by £1.6m, including a £0.1m benefit
from currency movements. The sharp rise
in underlying margin is encouraging and
has come as a result of much sharper 
focus within the business. Investment in
additional development capacity has also
allowed us to provide enhancements in
functionality to customers.
Spendvision is a leading innovator in the
development and support of transaction
management solutions, including end-to-
end expense management and payables
automation. The online platform makes
it easy for companies to capture, pay for,
manage and understand all their
corporate transactions, giving complete
control over spend and increased cost
efficiency. It also automates the processing
of expense claims for employees.
The global roll out of Visa IntelliLink
Spend Management solution, a white-
label version of the Spendvision platform
provided through an alliance with Visa,
has continued to see strong growth with
over 70 financial institutions now
offering the solution.
Spendvision continues to maintain and
develop strong relationships with
new and existing partners, delivering
additional services and advanced
functionality such as its payables
module. As part of an end-to-end travel
management and expenses solution,
we see good opportunities for
contactless payment and eMoney,
together with our payables financing
functionality. We have recently signed
a significant new client in the banking
sector and have a strong pipeline of
additional white-label opportunities.
Since 30 March 2012, Spendvision has been
wholly-owned by HRG and this will allow 
us to further capitalise on the strengths and
capabilities of both companies. In addition
to building on their current strengths in
existing markets, there are also exciting
opportunities to work together for the
offering and integration of our travel and
expense management solutions for our
corporate clients.
TECHNOLOGY
The influence and importance of
technology in business continues to grow
apace. In the delivery of travel and related
expense solutions, technology remains a
critical factor due to ever-increasing
complexity of data and decision-making
as well as the need for accuracy and swift
reporting. Whilst retaining its capability
of being able to work with whichever
technological solutions our clients prefer,
HRG has continued with its strategy of
developing products and solutions that
are targeted at the corporate travel and
related expense sector. Our systems
platform architecture enables us to deliver
a wide range of proprietary applications
as well as to integrate with third-party
systems where necessary to meet
specific client needs.
Travel distribution, booking and reporting
lie at the core of our technology
development. Whether accessing the
Global Distribution Systems (GDS) for
content or going direct to suppliers, our
knowledge and platform architecture helps
determine the best way of sourcing and
aggregating appropriate content for
booking and reporting. From integrating
the latest GDS content interfaces to
assessing if ‘direct connect’ with a provider
is viable and in the best interest of our
clients, our technology platform offers
flexibility and positions HRG at the
forefront of the direct connect debate.
HRG’s systems provide access to travel
itineraries, alternative pricing, policy
compliance, online self-booking tools,
security tracking and reporting. They also
allow our staff to access information from
multiple, concurrent sources, enabling us
to provide efficient, rapid and cost-
effective service to our clients at all times.
During the year, we released upgrades
across our product range with user
interface updates and increased content
through development of the Travelport
Universal Application Programming
Interface as a complement to its core
GDS content.
With the ongoing and rapid adoption of
smartphone mobile devices in business
life, our development of mobile
technology continued during the period.
Access to HRG i-Suite™, our online
portal offering clients access to both
HRG and third-party products, and HRG
Online™, our in-house developed online
booking tool, is available via BlackBerry,
and similar applications are being
developed for iPhone and Android mobile
devices. The discussions surrounding
applications and website mobile
optimisation continue and our flexible
platform architecture means we can be
actively engaged in both.
During the last quarter of our financial year,
we presented to the market our new data
reporting service HRG Insight™. This has
been a significant development focus
through the year and pilots of the new
product are now in use. Travel data has
historically been built around pre-trip, post-
trip and security. We believe that data
should be dynamic and flexible. HRG
Insight™ is therefore a dynamic, flexible
and open platform which brings clients’
data to life by telling the complete story of
each transaction, thereby empowering
travel managers and travellers with the
information they need.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Revenue
Reported revenue increased by 4.5% to
£374.2m, comprised of an increase of 2.4% at
constant exchange rates and an increase of
2.1% from favourable currency translation.
Revenue per employee
Reported revenue per employee increased
by 2.7% from £67.5k to £69.3k. At constant
exchange rates, this was an increase of 0.6%.
Operating expenses
Reported operating expenses increased by
3.4% to £331.1m.
Underlying operating expenses, which are
before amortisation of acquired intangibles,
increased by 3.4% to £327.0m, or by 1.4% at
constant exchange rates. This 1.4% increase
is comprised of 4.8% for staff costs and a
reduction of 5.2% for other expenses.
The increase of 4.8% in staff costs reflects an
increase of 1.7% in staff numbers and higher
average compensation, including bonuses
but excluding share-based incentives.
The reduction of 5.2% for other expenses
is due to the continuing focus on cost
management.
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit, which is before
amortisation of acquired intangibles,
increased by 12.6% from £41.9m to £47.2m,
and includes a benefit of £1.1m from
favourable currency movements. The
underlying operating profit margin, which
has not been affected by currency
movements, increased from 11.7% to 12.6%.
Exceptional items
There were no exceptional items in the
current or prior period income statements.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased by £0.9m to
£9.9m, reflecting the full-year impact of
refinancing the Group’s credit facilities in
November 2010. Net external interest
costs increased by £2.0m as a result.
The IAS 19 pension charge, which is
based on the 31 March position,
decreased by £0.9m for the year, but is
expected to increase by £1.4m in the
year to 31 March 2013.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year represents an
overall effective tax rate (ETR) of 29.0% of
the reported profit before tax (2011: 31.5%).
The current year ETR includes a £0.3m
charge relating to the impact on deferred
tax assets of a reduction in the UK
corporation tax rate from 26% to 24%.
An additional charge of £2.8m is reflected
in the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income in respect of
deferred tax assets on pension liabilities.
We anticipate an ETR of no more than 30%
in future years.
Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed is calculated by
dividing underlying operating profit plus net
share of the results of associates and joint
ventures by average net assets. Average net
assets are based on the 12 month ends for
the financial year and exclude net debt,
pension deficits and tax provisions. Average
net assets amounted to £214.4m (2011:
£216.4m) compared with £169.7m at the
year end (2011: £162.5m). The return for the
year was 22.5% (2011: 19.4%).
Cash flow
Free cash flow, which is the change in net
debt before acquisitions and disposals,
Employee Benefits Trust purchases,
dividends and the impact of foreign
exchange movements on net debt
balances, was £19.6m (2011: £21.4m).
Cash outflow in respect of working capital
was £11.6m (2011: £1.8m), primarily due to
a reduction in trade creditors. The cash
outflow related to interest and refinancing
costs was £5.6m (2011: £6.8m). Tax paid in
cash was £6.7m (2011: £9.3m) and capital
expenditure, which is primarily internal
software development and office
equipment, was £9.4m (2011: £8.7m).
Cash costs for pension deficit reduction
were £6.0m (2011: £6.1m).
In addition to free cash flow, the other
major cash flow items are £11.7m related
to acquisitions and disposals (2011: £0.8m),
mainly comprising the Spendvision
acquisition, share purchases of £2.5m by
the Employee Benefits Trust (2011: £nil) and
£4.7m of dividends paid to shareholders
during the year (2011: £3.9m).
Funding and net debt
The principal banking facility is a £190m
multi-currency revolving credit facility
(RCF) that is committed until November
2014. The RCF is used for loans, letters of
credit and guarantees, with interest based
on LIBOR/EURIBOR plus a margin and
costs. During the year, the Group took
advantage of the low interest rate
environment to fix interest on CHF25m
until November 2014 and on £20m until
February 2017. In addition, the Group has
a £30m fixed rate loan, repayable by 2018,
and uncommitted facilities amounting to
around £18m at the year end.
The principal covenants are measured
semi-annually, at the end of March and the
end of September, and require that net
debt is less than 3.0 times EBITDA and net
external interest is covered at least 4.0
times by EBITDA, both on a rolling
12-month basis. The definition of EBITDA
for covenant purposes is not materially
different from the definition used in
these financial statements.
Net debt at year end reduced by £0.1m to
£61.0m and was equivalent to 1.1 times
EBITDA (2011: 1.2x). This translates into
gearing of 35% (2011: 36%), or 99%
(2011: 74%) including the pension deficits
and related deferred tax assets. The Group
has used an active programme to reduce
working capital requirements at the
end of each half-year reporting period,
but we no longer see the need for this
working capital programme to continue
in the future.
14 HRG Annual Report 2012 HRG Annual Report 2012 15
DIRECTORS’ REPORT – BUSINESS REVIEW
This programme reduced net debt by
approximately £31m in both March 2012
and 2011. Average net debt, as measured
on a weekly basis, reduced by £19m
during the year.
Net external interest costs of £6.6m were
covered 8.8 times by EBITDA (2011: 11.2x).
Pensions
The Group-wide pension deficits under IAS
19 have increased by £31.1m to £145.8m
before tax.
The UK scheme deficit increased by
£30.0m to £134.1m. The scheme assets
reduced by £21.0m and the scheme
liabilities increased by £9.0m, with a lower
discount rate adding £41.2m, a lower
inflation rate saving £10.0m, revised
mortality assumptions saving £3.6m and 
a difference between actual and expected
return on assets of £5.0m. For several years,
the UK defined benefit scheme has been
closed to new entrants and has capped
increases in pensionable salary. Our latest
triennial valuation, which was effective as
at April 2011, was agreed with the Trustees
during the year.
During the year, deferred members of the
UK scheme were offered the opportunity
to transfer their accrued benefits out of
the UK scheme to alternative pension
providers on enhanced terms. The
programme reduced the March 2012
assets and liabilities by approximately
£33m. The cost of implementing the
programme amounted to £1.4m and is
included in other operating expenses
for the period.
The overseas schemes are primarily in
Germany and Switzerland, where the year-
end deficit increased by £1.1m to £11.7m.
At the year end, there was a deferred tax
asset of £32.2m (2011: £27.0m) relating 
to the UK deficit and an asset of £0.5m
(2011: £0.9m liability) relating to the
overseas schemes. The change in UK
deferred tax includes the 2% reduction in
the headline rate of UK corporation tax.
Share price
The closing mid-market price at the year
end was 70.25p (2011: 58p). During the
year, the price ranged from 46.6p to
70.3p per share.

18 HRG Annual Report 2012 DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Board is guided by the UK Corporate Governance Code
(‘the Code’) in seeking to achieve the highest standards of
business integrity, ethics, and professionalism across all of the
Company’s activities. This report sets out the manner in which the
main and supporting principles of Section 1 of the Code have
been applied. Except as noted below, HRG has complied with
the Code throughout the year and is committed to maintaining
such compliance in the future.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board has six members: the Chairman, two further Non-
Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. The effectiveness
of the Board is underpinned by a balance between Executive and
Non-Executive Directors and the Board believes that this brings
together the appropriate skills and experience necessary to provide
effective leadership and control of the Company. The biographies
of the Directors appear on page 18.
BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES, BALANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS
Collectively, the Board is responsible to shareholders for setting the
direction of the business and monitoring the Group’s performance.
It is also responsible for ensuring that an effective internal control
environment exists, and that the risks associated with the business
are appropriately managed. It defines and sets the strategic
objectives of the Group, ensuring that sufficient financial and
human resources are in place to meet those objectives. The Board
meets its commitment to the strategic direction and control of the
Group by meeting regularly throughout the year. In addition to a
schedule of regular meetings, the Board also meets on an
unscheduled basis as the need arises.
The executive element of the Board is balanced by independent
Non-Executive Directors, such that no individual or group of
individuals can dominate the Board’s decision making. The Group’s
Non-Executive Directors are regarded as independent and free
from any business or other relationship that could materially
interfere with their judgement.
The Company has been below the FTSE 350 throughout the year
immediately prior to the reporting year and, in accordance with
paragraph B.1.2 of the Code, the Company has two independent
non-executive directors. In accordance with the Code, the Board
does not regard the Chairman as independent. In view of the fact
that the Board includes three Executive Directors and only two
independent Non-Executive Directors, the Board has adopted
voting procedures which provide that the votes of the Executive
Directors cannot outvote the combined votes of the Independent
Non-Executive Directors and intends to retain these procedures.
The Senior Independent Director has a casting vote in the event of
equality of votes on any resolutions.
The provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to Directors’
conflicts are incorporated into the Company’s Articles of
Association. No conflicts of interest have been noted or authorised
by the Board during the year.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITY ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its
Directors, whether in their capacity as directors of the Company or
associated companies. The Directors also have the benefit of
indemnity provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association.
These provisions are qualifying third party indemnity provisions
as defined by the Companies Act 2006.
THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
The Company has established business values and standards for
the Group, which provide a framework for the corporate social
responsibility which the Board expects the Company to observe in
balancing the interests of all its stakeholders in the conduct of
business. The Company has reviewed this framework in the light of
the Bribery Act 2010, and has adopted procedures which follow
the guidelines published by the Ministry of Justice. These values
and standards are available on the Company’s website
(www.hrgworldwide.com).
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman
and Chief Executive. The Chairman has overall responsibility for the
leadership and effectiveness of the Board, and there is a formal
schedule of matters specifically reserved to the Board for decision
which includes the Group’s business strategy, annual budget,
annual and half-yearly financial results, interim management
statements, dividends, and major corporate activities, such as the
making of investments, acquisitions and disposals. The Board also
considers regular reports from the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director, Chief Operating Officer and operating reports from
individual divisions or functions. Complete, timely and relevant
information is provided to the Board to ensure that informed
judgements are made in pursuit of the Group’s objectives.
The Board also reviews the performance of management in
meeting business objectives, determines appropriate
remuneration levels through the Remuneration Committee
and plans the succession of key executives.
The operational management of the Group is delegated to the
Chief Executive who manages this through an Executive
Management Team which meets according to a regular schedule
and also on an ad hoc basis as the need arises. The composition of
the Executive Management Team is set out on page 18.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THEIR FUNCTION
The Non-Executive Directors provide an independent and
constructive challenge to the business development plans
that are proposed by executive management. Through their
membership of the Board’s committees they also have
responsibility for:
– overseeing that the systems of internal control and risk
management are appropriate and effective;
– managing the relationship with the external auditors;
– evaluating the performance of the management teams in
meeting targets and objectives;
– setting the remuneration of Executive Directors and approving
the Chief Executive’s recommendations as to the remuneration
of the Executive Management Team; and
– planning senior management succession.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Tony Isaac.
In this capacity, he is an additional contact point for shareholders
should they feel that their concerns are not being addressed
through normal channels.
HRG Annual Report 2012 19
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance
Continued
Shareholders will note from the Remuneration Report (on page
22) that the service arrangements of both the Chairman and
Tony Isaac have been extended for a third period of three years.
In doing so, the Board was conscious of paragraph B.2.4 of the
Combined Code and gave careful consideration to the matter,
being mindful of the need for progressive refreshment of the
skills available to the Board. In view of the appointment of
Paul Williams as an Independent Non Executive Director during
the year, the Board was satisfied that the renewal of those
appointments was both appropriate and in the best interests
of the Company.
BOARD DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING
Newly appointed Directors receive a comprehensive induction
programme, and training is made available for Directors on their
roles and legal obligations to ensure that they are fully conversant
with their responsibilities as Directors.
Directors are also kept informed of changes to relevant regulatory
regimes, and new institutional investor guidelines. All of the
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary and also to external independent advice should they
so wish.
PERFORMANCE OF THE BOARD
The Board conducted an externally moderated review of its
effectiveness during the year, following which some minor
adjustments to the procedures of the Board and its Committees
have been implemented. Overall, the Board remains satisfied that
the current Board systems, structures and procedures are
appropriate to the needs of the business.
During the year, the Non-Executive Directors conducted a
performance evaluation of the Chairman, taking into account the
views of the Executive Directors. The Chairman also met the other
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors being
present in order to review the operation of the Board. In addition,
the Chairman held a meeting with the other Non-Executive
Directors to review their contribution to the Board.
BOARD MEMBERSHIP
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of
Association, all Directors submit themselves for re-election on a
rotational basis every three years and newly appointed Directors
are subject to election by the shareholders at the first AGM after
their appointment.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Company has an established Audit Committee, Remuneration
Committee and Nominations Committee. No person other than a
committee member is entitled to attend the meetings of these
Committees, except at the invitation of the Committee. The terms
of reference of the Committees are available on the Company’s
website (www.hrgworldwide.com).
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Tony Isaac, Paul Williams,
(both of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors) and
John Coombe. The Committee is chaired by Tony Isaac, who has
significant and recent relevant financial experience. In addition
to the members of the Committee, regular attendees at Audit
Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee have
included the CEO, the Group Finance Director, representatives of
the external auditors, the head of internal audit, the head of
financial reporting and the Company Secretary.
The Audit Committee meets not less than three times a year and
at such other times as the Chairman of the Committee requires.
The Audit Committee reviewed a wide range of financial reporting
and related matters at its meetings during the year, including the
Company’s results prior to their submission to the Board. The
Committee focused in particular on critical accounting policies
and practices adopted by the Group and any significant areas of
judgement that may materially impact reported results. It also
monitored the internal controls that are operated by management
to ensure the integrity of information reported to shareholders.
The Committee provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s
external auditors. It has advised the Board on the appointment,
independence, and objectivity of the external auditors and on
their remuneration for both statutory audit and non-audit work.
It also discussed the nature, scope and timing of the statutory
audit with the external auditors. The Audit Committee carries out
an independent assessment of the suitability and performance
of the external auditors in making its recommendation to the
Board for their reappointment.
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the annual
internal audit plan for the Group, to ensure that the internal audit
function is adequately sponsored and resourced. Its terms of
reference also provide for it to review the whistle-blowing
arrangements for staff.

At the meeting to review the 2012 Annual Report and Financial
Statements, the Committee considered the level of non-audit
services being provided by the Group’s external auditors in order
to satisfy itself that the objectivity and independence of the
external auditors is safeguarded. The lead audit partner is rotated
every five years and was last changed in 2011.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman, John
Coombe, and the two Non-Executive Directors, Tony Isaac and
Paul Williams, who acts as Chairman of the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee sets the policy framework and
objectives for the remuneration of the Executive Directors
and other senior executives of the Group and monitors their
performance against these targets.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has taken advice
on remuneration from Kepler Associates in relation to overall
remuneration strategy, and also in relation to the design and
structure of share-based incentive schemes. Details of the activities
of the Remuneration Committee are given in the Remuneration
Report on page 22.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is responsible for matters of Board
structure, management succession and the identification and
appointment of Directors. The Committee comprises the
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Chairman of the Committee is John Coombe.
COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board attaches importance to the effectiveness of its
communications with shareholders. The Board has initiated
dialogue with institutional shareholders and the financial
community. This has included presentations of the preliminary and
half-year results, and also includes regular meetings with major
shareholders and industry analysts. All shareholders and potential
shareholders can gain access to the Annual Report and other
significant information about HRG on the Company’s website
(www.hrgworldwide.com).
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company’s AGM
which, this year, is to be held on 25 July 2012, where they will have
the opportunity to receive information on the Group’s business
activities and to question senior management about business
issues and prospects. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration,
and Nominations Committees will be available to answer any
questions on the work of the Committees. All shareholders will be
entitled to vote on the resolutions put to the AGM. All proxy votes
will be counted and the level of proxy votes lodged for each
resolution will be reported at the AGM and on the Company’s
website (www.hrgworldwide.com).
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness in safeguarding
shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks associated
with the achievement of business objectives, and can only
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Within the Group, managers are responsible for the identification
and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of
operation together with the design and operation of appropriate
mitigation. In particular, with regard to regular financial reporting
and preparing Consolidated Financial Statements, Group Finance
participates in the control, self-assessment and policy compliance
elements of risk management. Group Finance also contains a
consolidation team and reviews external technical developments
and detailed reporting and accounting policy issues. In addition,
Group Finance maintains an up-to-date Group Accounting Policies
Manual and sets formal requirements with business unit finance
functions specifying the reports and approvals needed.
Risk management software is used at all major sites and for key
central functions and is readily accessible by management.
The Executive Management Team regularly reviews the risk
management and control process and considers:
– the authority, resources, and coordination of those involved in
the identification, assessment and management of significant
risks faced by the Group;
– the response to the significant risks which have been identified
by management and others; and
– the maintenance of a control environment directed towards the
proper management of risk.
A process of self-certification is used within the Group to provide a
documented and auditable trail of accountability for the operation
of the system of internal control. This is complemented by the
activities of the internal audit function, which provides a degree of
assurance as to the system of internal control that takes account of
the major risks identified by the Executive Management Team.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of
internal control that has been in operation during the year ended
31 March 2012. The Executive Management Team has reviewed
and updated its evaluation of significant risks affecting the
business and the manner in which they are managed. The results
of this exercise have been reviewed and endorsed by the Audit
Committee and the Board, and are commented on in more detail
in the Risk Management section set out on pages 8 and 9.
HRG Annual Report 2012 21
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Remuneration report
MEMBERSHIP AND TERMS OF REFERENCE
During the year under review, the Remuneration Committee (‘the
Committee’) comprised the independent Non-Executive Directors,
Paul Williams and Tony Isaac, together with the Chairman of the
Company, John Coombe. The Committee is chaired by Paul Williams
and sets the policy framework and objectives for the remuneration
of the Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team
(collectively ‘Key Management’) and monitors the performance of
Key Management against those objectives. The Chief Executive and
Chief Operating Officer are invited to attend meetings except when
their own remuneration is being discussed.
During the year, the Committee was advised by Kepler Associates
on remuneration strategy, incentive design and market data.
Kepler Associates were appointed by the Committee in 2006 and
provide no other services to the Group.
REMUNERATION POLICY
When deciding appropriate levels of salary and other forms of
remuneration, the Committee takes into account:
– the annual and continuing performance of the Company, and
each Director within his sphere of operation;
– the requirement to ensure that executive remuneration is
aligned with the interests of shareholders;
– the Company’s need to provide sufficiently attractive remuneration
packages for the recruitment, motivation and retention of
Executives who are able to provide the direction and drive needed
in order to deliver the Company’s strategic objectives;
– pay and conditions across the Company as a whole; and
– appropriate market rates. In judging appropriate market salaries,
the Committee considers external benchmarking research
undertaken for them by Kepler Associates.
There is a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy
on executive remuneration and for determining the remuneration
packages of individual Directors. The Committee’s objective is to
ensure that at least 40% of each Executive Director’s potential
remuneration is variable and linked to performance. Fixed pay
includes salary and contributions towards pension arrangements;
the variable element of pay comprises annual bonus and long term
incentives. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Executive Directors
a) Mr Radcliffe and Mr Ruffles have continuing service contracts
with the Company which, other than for cause, are subject to
termination by the Company giving not less than 12 months’
written notice, or by the Executive Director giving not less
than 12 months’ written notice (in the case of Mr Radcliffe) or
6 months’ written notice (in the case of Mr Ruffles).
b) On 30 November 2011, the Company announced that
Mr Steadman would be retiring at the 2012 AGM. His service
agreement will accordingly terminate on 25 July 2012 and
no payments are to be made in association with or as a
consequence of his retirement. The Committee believed that
there was a material corporate benefit to be achieved by
Mr Steadman remaining in post until the completion of the
full 2012 financial cycle at the Annual General Meeting.
Accordingly, prior to the Company announcing Mr Steadman’s
intention to retire and, after taking external advice, the
Remuneration Committee determined that:
– In accordance with its permitted discretion under the
Performance Share Plan rules, Mr Steadman’s awards under
that plan which are scheduled to vest on 21 June 2013
and 27 May 2014, will be preserved in full until the original
vesting date (rather than being pro-rated for time to the
date of his leaving), at which time the original performance
conditions will be tested to determine the extent to
which the awards will actually vest, thereby ensuring that
Mr Steadman’s continuing interests were aligned with those
of the Company over the longer term. As a condition of
exercising this discretion, the Committee agreed certain
additional specific objectives with Mr Steadman in order
to strengthen his alignment with shareholders and the
Company’s interests. The Remuneration Committee will
determine whether these objectives have been met prior
to implementing this discretion;
– Mr Steadman will not be entitled to any short term bonus
in respect of any period of service after 31 March 2012,
nor will any further grant be made to him under either the
Company Share Option Plan or Performance Share Plan in
respect of his remaining employment;
c) On 2 May 2012, HRG announced the appointment of Philip
Harrison as Group Finance Director. Mr Harrison will join the
Company on 11 June, and will formally succeed Mr Steadman
as Group Finance Director at the conclusion of the Company’s
AGM on 25 July. In common with the arrangements for other
Executive Directors, other than for cause, Mr Harrison’s service
contract will be subject to termination by the Company giving
not less than 12 months’ written notice, or by Mr Harrison
giving not less than 6 months’ written notice. His service
agreement is in similar form to that of the existing Executive
Directors of the Company, including as to benefits. For the year
ending 31 March 2013, the Committee has determined that the
annual rate of base salary for Mr Harrison will be £286,000.
Details of the salary and benefits paid to the Executive Directors
are set out in Tables 1-3 at the end of this report.
No member of Key Management has a notice period which is
longer than 12 months. Service contracts include a liquidated
damages clause which is applicable for a maximum period of
12 months in the event of the Company terminating the role or
employment of a member of Key Management following a
takeover of the Company.
Non-Executive Directors
a) John Coombe entered into a letter of appointment with the
Company dated 7 June 2006 for an initial three-year term which
was subsequently extended in 2009 for a further term of three
years expiring at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. For the year
under review he received an annual fee of £125,000 together
with the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. These fees
have remained unchanged since 2006. On 24 April 2012, the
Company entered into an agreement with Mr Coombe under
which his appointment was extended for a further period of
three years expiring at the 2015 Annual General Meeting at a
revised annual fee of £135,000, but otherwise on terms which
are unchanged from his existing appointment. If the Company
elects to terminate Mr Coombe’s appointment before the
expiry of his appointment, he would be entitled to one month’s
notice and fees during that period.

commencing 1 April 2011. He receives an annual fee of £35,000
and a fee of £5,000 for his role as Chairman of the Company’s
Remuneration Committee and the reimbursement of out-of-
pocket expenses. Mr Williams’ appointment is subject to earlier
termination by either party.
ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION
Basic salaries
Individual basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee
taking into account market rates, personal and corporate
performance and any changes in responsibility. Salary reviews also
consider the remuneration levels that are being set across the rest
of the Company. The Committee considered the performance of
management during the year together with pay and conditions
across the Company as a whole before determining that a salary
increase of 2% was appropriate for Key Management with effect
from 1 April 2012, which is in line with the average salary increase
made across the Company as a whole. The annual rate of base
salary for each of the Executive Directors for the year ending
31 March 2013 will therefore be as follows:
David Radcliffe £428,400
Julian Steadman £297,444 (to 25 July 2012)
Kevin Ruffles £287,513
Philip Harrison £286,000 (from 11 June 2012)
Non-cash benefits (other than pensions)
The Company also provides a package of employment benefits for
Key Management. Principal elements include the cash equivalent
to a fully expensed company car, life insurance, private health
insurance, personal accident insurance and permanent disability
insurance, none of which are pensionable.
Pensions
David Radcliffe, Julian Steadman and Kevin Ruffles have a direct
pension contribution arrangement under which they receive a
non-pensionable payment of 22%, 30% and 22% of their base
salary respectively. Details are set out in Tables 1 and 2 at the end
of this report.
Variable remuneration
The Committee believes that it is important that Key Management
have a substantial part of their annual remuneration based on
performance. Accordingly, in addition to salary, Key Management
are eligible for (i) an annual performance-related bonus, which is
non-pensionable, and (ii) longer term awards under the
Company’s share incentive schemes, the Performance Share Plan
(PSP) and the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP).
Annual bonus plan
For the year under review, Key Management were eligible to
participate in an annual bonus plan. The maximum opportunity
was 100% of base salary with 50% of base salary payable for on-
target achievement. 80% of any bonus opportunity is judged
against a combination of financial targets (principally a
measurement of profitability), with the balance judged against
personal performance targets. In determining whether bonuses
are payable in respect of any year, the Committee also has regard
to the quality of the Company’s earnings.
As indicated in last year’s report, the Committee has adopted a
policy that Key Management are required to build a holding in the
Company’s shares equal to at least their annual salary. Until such
time as that guideline is met, any bonus earned in excess of 80%
of salary (net of tax and national insurance) must be invested in
Company shares which are held until this guideline is achieved.
The annual bonuses payable to Executive Directors for
performance over the year under review are summarised in
Table 1 at the end of this report.
For the year ending 31 March 2013, the Committee has
determined that the annual bonus plan will be unchanged from
the previous year.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES
The Company has three share-based incentive schemes, namely
the PSP , CSOP and a Sharesave Scheme.
The following grants were made under these Schemes during the
year (the 2011 awards).
The PSP
Since the Company’s IPO in 2006, the Company’s granting policy
has been (and continues to be) that awards may be granted under
the PSP with a maximum face value of 75% of base salary. Awards
were made during the year to employees eligible under the PSP in
respect of a total of 2,986,275 (2011: 6,091,372) Ordinary shares in
the Company of 1p each. Of these, 580,803 were awarded to
eligible employees (not being Key Management) of which 193,595
vest on 27 May 2012 and 2013 respectively and a further 193,613
vest on 27 May 2014. Awards made under the PSP are exercisable
without payment of an exercise price but, in respect of the
additional 2,405,472 of these awards (2011: 4,683,050), being those
made to Key Management on 27 May 2011, they vest on
27 May 2014 but are also subject to the achievement of certain
performance criteria which the Remuneration Committee regards
as appropriate and stretching. Details of the performance targets
are set out below. Details of awards which have lapsed or became
exercisable during the year are set out in Table 3 on page 26.
The CSOP
Since the Company’s IPO in 2006, the Company’s granting policy
has been (and continues to be) that awards may be granted under
the CSOP with a maximum face value of 150% of base salary. On
27 May 2011, options were granted to Key Management in respect
of 1,641,145 (2011: 5,619,660) Ordinary shares vesting on 27 May
2014. The options are exercisable at an exercise price of 57.5p, but
are also subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria
which the Remuneration Committee regards as appropriate and
stretching. Details of the performance targets are set out below.
Details of options which have lapsed or became exercisable
during the year are set out in Table 3 on page 26. DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Remuneration report
Continued
Performance Criteria in respect of the PSP and the CSOP
In respect of both the PSP and CSOP , half of each award made to
Key Management is based on the satisfaction of performance
conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR), with the
balance being subject to a performance condition based on real
growth in underlying earnings per share (EPS).
a) TSR targets: Awards subject to TSR targets will vest in full in the
event the TSR of the Company over the 3-year performance
period exceeds the performance of 80% of the companies in the
FTSE 350 Support Services Index. In the event of the Company’s
TSR performance equalling the median performing company of
the index, 25% of the TSR based award will vest, with vesting
calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points.
b) EPS targets: Since 2009, EPS awards made to Key Management
are measured on cumulative underlying EPS. The 2011 awards
will vest in full in the event the Company’s cumulative
underlying EPS over the 3-year performance period exceeds
26p (2010 awards; 23p). In the event that the Company’s
cumulative underlying EPS over the period is 21p (2010 awards;
18p), 25% of the EPS award will vest, with vesting calculated on
a straight line basis between these two points. The Committee
intends to use this cumulative approach in measuring EPS
performance criteria for any future awards to Key Management.
The EPS targets for awards made in 2008 (which partially vested
during the year ending 31 March 2012), and all previous years,
were that such EPS-based awards vested in full in the event the
Company’s underlying EPS increased by 15% per annum above
the percentage change in the RPI over the 3 year performance
period. In the event the Company’s underlying EPS increased
by 5% per annum above the percentage change in the RPI,
25% of the EPS based award would have vested, with vesting
calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Policy on satisfying awards under the PSP and CSOP
Awards made under the PSP are satisfied by market-purchase
shares to the extent that such awards vest in due course. Awards
which vest under the CSOP are structured so as to be satisfied as
equity-settled share appreciation rights. Funding of awards
through new issue shares is subject to an overall dilution limit of
10% of issued share capital in any 10 year period. Of this, 5% may
be used in connection with the Group’s discretionary share
schemes (being the PSP and CSOP).
The Directors’ interests in the PSP , the CSOP and the Sharesave
Scheme are set out in Table 3.
Chart 1: Total shareholder return on £100 invested in HRG
shares over five years
Notes to Chart 1:
(i) TSR is calculated in pounds Sterling, based on spot share prices and includes
dividends reinvested on their ex-dividend date. HRG’s closing share price on
31 March 2007 was 96p. The closing share price on 31 March 2012 was 70.25p.
(ii) The FTSE 350 Support Services Index has been chosen as a suitable comparator
against which to measure the Company’s return to shareholders on the basis of
it comprising companies in broadly similar business activities to the Company.
The Sharesave Scheme
On 1 October 2011, options were granted to employees who had
applied to subscribe for a total of 2,704,304 shares under the
Sharesave Scheme at an option price of 54.8p.

base salary respectively.
(ii) The comparative emoluments for Kevin Ruffles in respect of the year to 31 March 2011 reflect the period in that year for which he was a Director of the Company.
(iii) On 17 May 2012 Julian Steadman irrevocably and unconditionally waived his entitlement to receive an element of his bonus in the amount of £86,200. Mr Steadman has
also requested that the Group should consider making a contribution to his personal pension plan. Under the terms of his service agreement, Mr Steadman is entitled to
receive as a contribution to his personal pension plan the amount of any National Insurance Contributions which the Company would otherwise have paid on any
amount paid into a personal pension plan had such amount been paid as emoluments. The Remuneration committee has considered Mr Steadman’s request and
determined that it will make a contribution of £100,000 to Mr Steadman’s personal pension plan.
(iv) As noted on page 23, until such time as a Director holds shares in the Company equal to at least their annual salary, any bonus earned in excess of 80% of salary (net of tax
and national insurance) is invested in Company shares which are held until such guideline is achieved.

28 HRG Annual Report 2012 DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 25 July
2011, authority was given for the Company to purchase, in the
market, up to 30,776,288 Ordinary Shares of 1p each. The
Company did not use this authority to make any purchases of its
own shares during the period. At the Annual General Meeting to
be held on 25 July 2012, shareholders will be asked to give a
similar authority, details of which are contained in the
accompanying circular to shareholders. Details of the Company’s
interests in its own shares are set out in note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 67.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There have been no post balance sheet events.
PENSIONS
The Group accounts for pensions under IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
On this basis, the deficit in the Group’s pensions schemes at
31 March 2012 has increased to £145.8m (2011: £114.7m). As with
most pension schemes, assets are invested for the long term to
meet long term liabilities but the deficit referred to above
reflected market conditions as at 31 March 2012. Further details
of pension matters are set out in note 21 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
EMPLOYEES
Employees are informed of the performance of the Group and of
any factors affecting their employment. Annual Reports are made
available to all staff and there is a comprehensive internal
communications programme through which management
communicate with employees, and employees are encouraged to
assist in the Group’s development.
Fair and full consideration is given to applications for employment
from disabled persons having regard to their particular aptitudes
and abilities. Efforts are made to continue the employment of
those who become disabled. Training, career development and
promotion opportunities are, as far as practicable, identical for all
employees. The Group consistently seeks to recruit, develop and
employ suitably qualified, capable and experienced people in an
environment of equal opportunity.
The Group aims to maintain a high standard of safe and healthy
working conditions comparable with the best practices in the
particular industry in which it operates.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Board recognises its responsibility to conduct business in a
manner which engages positively so as to ensure that it reflects
the social standards of all HRG’s stakeholders.
The following is a summary of HRG’s approach to each of the areas
on which it has adopted detailed policies reflecting its corporate
social responsibility:
How we do business
We recognise that our shareholders have invested in our business
and the success of our business will directly influence the value of
their investment. We work cooperatively with our suppliers and
business partners, choosing those who share our values and strive
for mutual trust and benefit. We recognise the importance of
managing environmental, social and governance risks through our
business practices and work hard to maintain our reputation for
honesty, integrity and respect for people.
How we treat our employees
We respect our employees’ individuality and diversity, require them
to live up to our values and provide the encouragement and
opportunity to develop their careers. We recruit and promote on
suitability and merit and recognise the vital role our people play in
providing excellent client service. We are committed to attracting,
motivating and retaining the best talent, and will maintain our
reputation as a company of choice.
How we treat our clients
We constantly look to offer our clients superior products and
services that provide good value. We aim to give them the highest
quality service and strive to offer them the best economic and
environmental choices.
How we behave in our communities
We strive to behave as responsible corporate citizens globally and
good, supportive neighbours in our local communities.
How we deal with the environment
The Group’s trading activities have only a marginal direct impact
on the environment and contribute minimally to pollution. The
Group is committed to conducting its business in a manner that
shows responsibility towards the environment and in ensuring
high standards of health and safety for its employees. The Group
complies with statutory and mandatory requirements and where
practicable aims to exceed regulations applicable to its areas of
business. Working practices are routinely monitored as improved
techniques and technologies become available.
HRG strives to constantly develop its approach to corporate
social responsibility. Detailed copies of HRG’s current policies
on each of these areas and the way in which it seeks to
implement them are available on the Company’s website
(www.hrgworldwide.com).
DONATIONS
The Group has made charitable donations during the year
totalling £0.1m (2011: £0.1m). Of the total charitable donations
made in the year £0.01m (2011: £0.01m) was made by the Group
and the remainder was paid on behalf of employees. No political
donations were made during the year (2011: £nil).
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A statement of the Group’s policies in relation to financial instruments
is set out in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
POLICY FOR PAYING SUPPLIERS
The Group’s current policy concerning the payment of its trade
payables and other suppliers is to:
(a) set the terms of payment with those suppliers when agreeing
the terms of each transaction;
(b) ensure that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of
payment by inclusion of the relevant terms in contracts; and
(c) pay in accordance with its contractual and other legal obligations.
Wherever possible UK subsidiaries follow the same policy.
Overseas subsidiaries are encouraged to adopt similar policies by
applying local best practice. The figure for trade payables for the
Group at the end of the financial year represents 10 days
purchases (2011: 11 days). The Company has no trade payables.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
have prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the Parent
Company Financial Statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under
company law the Directors must not approve the Consolidated
and Parent Company Financial Statements unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for
that period. In preparing these Consolidated and Parent Company
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
– make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
– state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements
respectively;
– prepare the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial
Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable
them to ensure that the Consolidated and Parent Company
Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
Consolidated Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on
page 18 confirms that, to the best of his knowledge:
– the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit of the Group; and
– the Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a
fair review of the development and performance of the business
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Independent Auditors’ report

We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of Hogg
Robinson Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2012 which
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement set out on page 32, the Directors are responsible for
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements sufficient
to give reasonable assurance that the Consolidated Financial
Statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation
of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we read
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual
Report to identify any material inconsistencies with the audited
Consolidated Financial Statements. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider
the implications for our report.
OPINION ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion the Consolidated Financial Statements:
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 March 2012 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then
ended;
– have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union; and
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY
THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion:
– the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year
for which the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared is
consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements; and
– the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement
on pages 19 to 21 with respect to internal control and risk
management systems and about share capital structures is
consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO
REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to
you if, in our opinion:
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law
are not made; or
– we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit; or
– a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by
the Parent Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
– the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern;
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
– certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on
Directors’ Remuneration.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial
Statements of Hogg Robinson Group plc for the year ended
31 March 2012 and on the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2012
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies
BASIS OF PREPARATION: INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as endorsed and adopted for use by the European Union,
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The preparation of the IFRS financial statements requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the year. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions,
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates, as noted
in the key management judgements policy on page 44.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Directors consider that, taking into account the assets,
revenue and financing facilities available to the Group, the Group
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors adopt the going
concern basis for the Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in this Report.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis of accounting except for the revaluation of
certain financial instruments and retirement benefit obligations.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years
presented. No changes have been made to the accounting
policies by comparison with those applied in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 other
than as described below.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no standards or interpretations that are effective for
the first time for the financial year beginning on or after the
1 April 2011 that would be expected to have a material
impact on the Group.
Standards and amendments to existing standards that are not
yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following standards and amendments to existing standards
have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2012 or later
periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
– IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011. The
impact on the group will be to immediately recognise all past
service costs, and replace interest cost and expected return on
plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by
applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IAS 19 (amended)
although it is likely to lead to a reduction in finance income as
presented in the Consolidated Income Statement, with a
corresponding offsetting movement within the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income, leaving the liability
disclosed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet unchanged.
The directors anticipate that the following standards and
amendments to existing standards will not have a material impact
on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
– IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ aims to promote
transparency in the reporting of transfer transactions and improve
users’ understanding of the risk exposures relating to transfers 
of financial assets and the effect of those risks on an entity’s
financial position.
– IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ identifies the concept
of control as the determining factor as to whether the entity
should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the
parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to
assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess.
– IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ deals with how a joint arrangement of
which two or more parties have joint control should be classified.
There are two types of joint arrangement under IFRS 11: joint
operations and joint ventures. They are distinguished by parties’
rights and obligations under the arrangements. The existence of a
separate vehicle will no longer be a sufficient condition for a joint
arrangement to be classified as a joint venture.
– IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of other entities’ includes the disclosure
requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including
joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and
other off balance sheet vehicles.
– IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ , aims to improve consistency
and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair
value and a single source of fair value measurements for use
across IFRSs.
– IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to endorsement
by the EU. This standard is the first step in the process to replace
IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement,
and introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring
financial assets. This is likely to affect the Group’s accounting for
its financial assets, although the Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s
full impact.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not 
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Financial Statements of the Group consolidate the results of
Hogg Robinson Group plc, (the Company) and its subsidiary entities,
and include its share of its joint ventures’ results accounted for under
the equity method, all of which are prepared to 31 March.
All intra – group balances and transactions, and any unrealised
profits and losses arising from intra – group transactions have
been eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is the
power to govern the financial and operating policies in order to
obtain benefits from their activities. The results of subsidiaries are
included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Control is presumed to exist where the Group owns more than one

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Governance Business review Overview Financial statements CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2012 – continued
half of the voting rights (which does not always equate to
percentage ownership) unless it can be demonstrated that
ownership does not constitute control. Control does not exist
where other parties hold veto rights over significant operating and
financial decisions or where the Companies cannot obtain benefits
from the activities of the entities they have the power to govern.
Similarly, the Group has control where another party owns more
than one half of the voting rights of an entity but the Group can
control those voting rights through a contractual arrangement.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Consolidated
Financial Statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after
eliminating intra-group transactions as noted above.
For partly owned subsidiaries, the allocation of net assets and net
earnings to outside shareholders is shown in the line ‘Attributable
to non-controlling interests’ on the face of the Consolidated
Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity, that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint
venture, over whose operating and financial policies the Group
exercises significant influence. Significant influence is presumed to
exist where the Group has between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of
the voting rights, but can also arise where the Group holds less
than 20 per cent if it has the power to be actively involved and
influential in policy decisions affecting the entity.
An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint
control over its operating and financial policies. In some situations,
joint control exists even though the Group has an ownership
interest of more than 50 per cent because of the veto rights held
by joint venture partners.
Associates and Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity
method, where the consolidated income statement and
consolidated balance sheet includes the Group’s share of their
profits and losses, and net assets. This involves recording the
investment initially at cost to the Group, which therefore includes
any goodwill on acquisition, and then, in subsequent periods,
adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reflect the
Group’s share of the associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses,
which is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, and
its share of post-acquisition comprehensive income, which is
recognised within the line item ‘share of other comprehensive
income of equity accounted units’ in the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income. Unrealised gains on transactions
between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent
of the Group’s interest in the associates.
Acquisitions
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the acquisition method of
accounting is used whereby the purchase consideration is allocated
to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
(identifiable net assets) of the subsidiary on the basis of fair value at
the date of acquisition. Provisional fair values allocated at a reporting
date are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary
includes the fair value of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by
the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests
issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and vested share-
based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced through
the acquisition. Costs related to the acquisition of a subsidiary are
expensed as incurred. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the
Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Where the Group
has a previously held non-controlling interest in the acquiree,
this is remeasured to fair value at acquisition with any gain or loss
being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are brought into
the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which
control, joint control or significant influence commences.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are
accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity
as equity holders. Any difference between the fair value of the
consideration paid and the carrying amount of the interest in the
net assets acquired at the date of the transaction is recognised
directly in equity. Prior to 1 April 2010 this difference was
recognised as goodwill.
Disposals
Disposal groups held for sale comprise assets and liabilities where
the carrying amount is expected to be recovered through sale
rather than continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only
when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to 
a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present
condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one
year from the date of classification.
Disposal groups held for sale are carried at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are presented
separately on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the
related assets and liabilities being presented as a single asset and 
a single liability respectively. Comparative information is not
restated. Disposal groups acquired with a view to resale are held at
fair value determined at the acquisition date and no profits or
losses are recognised between acquisition date and disposal date,
unless there is a subsequent impairment.
For a disposal group held for sale that continues to be carried at its
carrying amount, the profit on disposal, calculated as net sales
proceeds less the carrying amount, is recognised in the Consolidated
Income Statement in the period during which control passes to the
buyer. Where the fair value less costs to sell of a disposal group is
lower than the carrying amount at the time of classification as held
for sale, the resulting charge is recognised in the Consolidated
Income Statement in that period. On classification as held for sale,
the assets are no longer depreciated. When the fair value less costs to
sell of a disposal group falls below the carrying amount during the
period in which it is classified as held for sale, the charge is included
in the Consolidated Income Statement at that time.
If the disposal group or groups represent a separate major line of
business or geographical area of operations, or are part of a single
coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations, or are subsidiaries acquired
exclusively with a view to resale, they are classified as
“discontinued operations” . The net results attributable to such
discontinued operations are shown separately and comparative
40 HRG Annual Report 2012
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
figures in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement are restated as if the operation had been
discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
The Group accounts for transactions with non-controlling interests
as transactions with equity owners of the Group, hence gains or
losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are recorded in
equity. The results of businesses are taken out of the Consolidated
Financial Statements from the date on which control, joint control
or significant influence ceases. At this point any retained interest in
the entity is re-measured to its fair value, with the change in
carrying amount recognised in the Consolidated Income
Statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the
purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as
an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in
respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly
disposed of the appropriate share of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income are reclassified
to the Consolidated Income Statement.
REVENUE
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course
of business, net of discounts and rebates, value added tax and
other sales related taxes. Revenue does not include transactions
entered into by Group clients for which the Group acts as agent.
Revenue represents service fees earned from clients, management
fees and revenue and commissions from suppliers.
Client service fees are earned by charging a transaction or
management fee for airline or other transactions, based on
contractual agreements with travel clients. Transaction revenue is
recognised at the time of ticketing of the travel arrangement with
the exception of hotel related income, which is recognised at the
time travel plans are confirmed. Management fees are recognised
over the period of time that the service is provided to the client.
Supplier revenues are earned under sales and marketing agreements,
incentive arrangements and distribution and system usage
agreements. In such cases, revenue is measured at each balance
sheet date as total anticipated income multiplied by the percentage
stage of completion of the contract. Revenue from Meetings, Groups
and Events is accounted on a percentage completion basis.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Pension obligations
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes or
amounts paid directly to the personal pension plans of employees
are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The assets of the defined benefit pension schemes are measured
at their fair value at the balance sheet date and compared to the
liabilities of those schemes at the same date, measured on an
actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The
discount rate used is the current rate of return on a high quality
corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
Costs of defined benefit pension schemes arising from employee
service in the current period are charged to operating expenses.
Past service costs, representing the increase in the present value
of pension scheme liabilities relating to employee service in prior
periods, but arising in the current period as a result of benefit
improvements, are charged to operating expenses immediately
to the extent that the benefits have already vested, or otherwise
recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The
expected return on the schemes’ assets and the increase during
the period in the present value of the schemes’ liabilities arising
from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits may be payable when employment is
terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or
whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in
exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination
benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating
the employment of current employees according to a detailed
formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage
voluntary redundancy.
Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based
on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to
the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. Bonuses are
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period a
contractual or constructive obligation arises.
Share-based incentives
The Group operates several equity-settled share-based incentive
schemes for employees. The fair value of the awards is calculated
at grant date and is recognised as an expense over the vesting
period. For awards with vesting conditions based on market
conditions (particularly, those based on total shareholder return
compared with external benchmarks), the likelihood of vesting is
assessed at the date of grant and is not subsequently amended
in arriving at the expense for each year in the vesting period.
All other awards are re-assessed at each balance sheet date, with
the expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement,
including the impact of changes of previous estimates of the
likelihood of vesting. The total expense for the year gives rise
to a corresponding credit to equity.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are those significant items which due to their
size and/or nature are separately disclosed to provide a full
understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the surplus of the purchase consideration
over the Group’s share of the fair value of the separable net
assets of the subsidiary or interest in the associate or joint
venture acquired. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is
included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of
interests in associates and joint ventures is included in
‘investments accounted for using the equity method’ and
is tested for impairment as part of the Group’s total
goodwill. Separately recognised goodwill is recognised as
an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in operating
HRG Annual Report 2012 41
Governance Business review Overview Financial statements
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2012 – continued
expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not
subsequently reversed.
The review of impairment includes examination of anticipated
cash flows from the cash generating units to which goodwill
relates. Cash generating units are determined by geography.
Goodwill is written down to its estimated recoverable amount,
being the higher of:
– fair value, the amount obtainable from sale on an arm’s length
basis, less the costs of disposal; and
– the value in use, the net present value of future cash flows
expected to be generated from the business.
When a business is disposed of the carrying amount of goodwill
applicable is taken into account in determining the profit or loss
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to
IFRS, 1 April 2003, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP
amounts subject to being tested for impairment since that date.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without
physical substance. They are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment. Cost includes third party purchases,
the directly attributable costs of internally generated assets and the
fair value of identifiable intangible assets arising on acquisitions
since the date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2003. Amortisation is
provided on the cost of all intangible assets, less the estimated
residual value, using the straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives as follows:
Computer software 3-10 years
Client relationships in acquired businesses 10 years
Amortisation is charged to operating expenses in the
Consolidated Income Statement.
Computer software includes the cost of internally generated
software which is capitalised when it is probable that economic
benefits will flow to the Group from the asset being developed,
and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical
feasibility can be demonstrated. Capitalisation ceases when the
asset being developed is ready for use. Research expenditure
incurred is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset
may be impaired. If any such indicator exists, impairment is
tested by estimating the recoverable amount. If the recoverable
amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment
charge is made.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment. Cost is defined as expenditure that is
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation is
provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, less the
estimated residual value, which is re-assessed annually, using the
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Property:
Long-term leaseholds 50 years
Short-term leaseholds and structural
leasehold improvements the lease term
Plant and equipment:
IT and office equipment 2-7 years
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset
may be impaired. If any such indicator exists, impairment is tested
by estimating the recoverable amount. If the recoverable
amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment
charge is made.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of issue
costs incurred. Subsequent measurement depends on the
designation of the instrument as follows:
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as either at fair value
through profit or loss or loans and receivables. The classification
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were
acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial
assets at initial recognition.
At fair value through profit or loss – Financial instruments at fair
value through profit or loss are financial instruments held for
trading. A financial instrument is classified in this category if
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are
designated as hedges. Financial instruments in this category are
classified as current assets or liabilities.
Loans and receivables – Loans and receivables are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets,
except where expected maturity is greater than 12 months after
the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other
receivables and cash and cash equivalent assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on
the trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase
or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value for
all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are
initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed
in the Consolidated Income Statement. Financial assets are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the
investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are
presented in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in
which they arise.
42 HRG Annual Report 2012
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value with subsequent
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than
90 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable
is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a
provision account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the
Consolidated Income Statement. When a trade receivable is not
collectible, it is written off against the provision account for trade
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off
are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings are held at amortised cost and are classified as current
liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance
sheet date. Currency swaps are stated at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Exchange movements on foreign
currency long-term borrowings are taken to reserves to the extent
that the borrowing is in the functional currency of the obligor and
to the Consolidated Income Statement to the extent it is not.
Changes in the fair value of currency swaps are taken to the
Consolidated Income Statement when they are acquired principally
for the purpose of selling in the short term. Net finance costs are
recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.
Debt issue costs are amortised proportionally over the anticipated
life of the relevant debt facility using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver
cash or another financial asset to a third party.
Financial instruments are stated at fair value with differences on
valuation taken to reserves if hedge accounting has been
established for the particular instrument. Otherwise, the
differences on valuation are taken to the Consolidated Income
Statement. These include interest rate caps and amounts
receivable or payable in foreign currency together with the
forward foreign currency exchange contracts used to fix their
value. Fair values are derived from published financial data.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of each of
the Group’s subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates
are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling
which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency of the relevant entity using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the
Consolidated Income Statement, except when deferred in equity as
qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures
and associates in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at
the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results
of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated
at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the consolidation at closing rates
of net investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates,
together with those on foreign currency loans which finance
them, are taken to reserves and reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to
treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition
to IFRS (1 April 2003) as a sterling denominated asset.
LEASING
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Other leases are
classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase agreements
are included in property, plant and equipment and are
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful
economic life. Lease obligations are stated net of finance charges
attributable to future periods. Finance costs are allocated over the
period of the lease to give a constant rate of charge.
Operating lease rentals, net of any incentives received from the
lessor, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over
the life of the lease.
TAXATION
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in
the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates operate and generate taxable income. Management
periodically evaluates the positions taken in tax returns with
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject
to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on
the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted 
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of
the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that
HRG Annual Report 2012 43
Governance Business review Overview Financial statements
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income
tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising
on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS
Interim dividends are recognised in the Consolidated Financial
Statements in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in
the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that
an outflow of resources will be necessary to settle the obligation and
the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions for restructuring
costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for
the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Provisions are discounted where the impact is material.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash
and cash equivalents includes bank balances and deposits with
original maturities of three months or less. It also includes bank
overdrafts which form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management and are likely to fluctuate from overdrawn to
positive balances. Bank overdrafts, where there is no right of
set-off, are shown as borrowings within current liabilities.
SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The premium received on the issue of shares in excess of the
nominal value of shares is credited to the share premium account
and included within shareholders’ equity.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TRUST
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group sponsored
Employee Benefits Trust are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the
Company remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they
vest unconditionally with employees.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IAS 24,
Related Party Disclosures, not to disclose transactions and
balances between Group entities that have been eliminated
on consolidation.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND KEY
MANAGEMENT JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances.
The principal management judgements made in the preparation
of these Consolidated Financial Statements are:
– the assessment of the impairment of goodwill at each balance
sheet date (see note 10). This process depends on the
preparation of estimates of future cash flows expected to be
generated by each business in the Group;
– the valuation of client relationships included in intangible assets
at acquisition (see note 10). This process depends on the
preparation of estimates of future cash flows expected to be
generated by existing clients at acquisition;
– the capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets.
This process depends on it being probable that economic
benefits will flow to the Group from the asset being developed,
the cost of the asset being reliably measured and the technical
feasibility being demonstrated;
– the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets (see
note 20), which depends on the assessment of the probability
that there will be sufficient appropriate taxable profits available
in future against which to realise them;
– the evaluation of retirement benefit obligations. This depends
on the actuarial assumptions set out in note 21, including
estimates of future returns on scheme assets; and
– within revenue there are key judgements made by
management in terms of revenue recognition. The Group uses
a percentage of completion method to measure supplier
revenues earned under sales and marketing agreements,
incentive arrangements, and distribution and usage agreements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2012 – continued
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk
management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group
Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group
Treasury identifies, evaluates financial risks and uses derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Group’s
treasury policy does not allow transactions of a speculative nature.
The Group arranges central borrowing facilities and maintains local
banking relationships to enable it to meet payment obligations as
they fall due, taking into account information from its cash
forecasts and business plans. The amounts of unused borrowing
facilities are set out in note 17.
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern while providing
adequate returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders
and to maintain a capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce
debt. It may also increase debt provided that the funded venture
provides adequate returns so that the overall capital structure
remains supportable.
The Group uses an operational gearing ratio to manage net debt
(1)
to ensure that covenants within banking arrangements are
complied with. Using a ratio of EBITDA
(2)
before exceptional items
to net debt, at 31 March 2012 the operational gearing ratio was 1.1
(2011: 1.2). The definition of EBITDA for covenant purposes is not
materially different from the definition used in these Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods
adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of
measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are
recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial
liability and equity instrument are disclosed within General
information and accounting policies (see note 1).
(1) Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current
borrowings as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet but excluding
unamortised loan issue costs) less cash and cash equivalent assets.
(2) Earnings before net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation, amortisation
and impairment.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The translation of non-Sterling earnings, assets and liabilities of the
Group is affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Group uses short-term currency swaps linked to
intercompany lending as well as direct borrowing in non-Sterling
currencies to manage the currency profile of external borrowings.
Net debt at 31 March 2012 included £12.8m of non-Sterling net debt
(2011: £11.5m) with changes in exchange rates, including the effect
of currency swaps, increasing the balance by £0.6m (2011: £0.3m).
The Group’s transaction exposure is limited, with the majority of its
transactions denominated in the currency of the country of
operation. In the few instances where there is exposure, short-term
hedges are taken once the exposure can be accurately identified.
The following principal exchange rates have been used in the
Consolidated Financial Statements:
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the year ended 31 March 2012, if the average value of Sterling
had been 5% higher or lower relative to other currencies than
actual, the profit before tax of the Group would have been
reduced or increased by £1.5m compared to the actual result
(2011: £1.1m). The impact on equity would be a movement of
£4.5m (2011: £6.4m) mainly arising on foreign currency exchange
gains or losses on translation of net investment in foreign
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on any borrowing at
floating interest rates except that it has fixed the interest rate on
£20m until February 2017 and on CHF25m until November 2014.
The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) is not
otherwise currently fixed, although the Group keeps this situation
under review. The fixed rate loan has an interest rate of 7.239%.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
For the year ended 31 March 2012, if interest rates in all currencies
in which the Group has borrowings had been higher or lower by
1%, interest cost would have been increased or reduced by £0.7m
(2011: £1.3m).
CREDIT RISK
The risk associated with deposits in commercial banks is managed
by diversifying with a number of well known financial institutions
together with a periodic review of ratings attributed by major
credit rating institutions.
The risk associated with clients and suppliers is not material based
on the current client and supplier concentration and based on the
large number of countries where the Group trades. The Group
makes widespread use of credit checks in respect of clients and
maintains a close working relationship with its key suppliers.

LIQUIDITY RISK
The RCF is committed until November 2014 and used for loans, letters of credit and guarantees. The fixed rate sterling private placement
of debt is committed in full until November 2016 when equal annual repayments begin until November 2018. In addition, the Group has
uncommitted facilities that are used for local flexibility. Working capital requirements fluctuate significantly during the year, with March
and September typically being the lowest levels.
LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RISK TABLES
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities including future expected interest payable and net-settled derivative financial
liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying

3 Segment information
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive Management Team, which reviews the Group’s internal
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The Executive Management Team has determined the operating
segments based on these reports.
The Executive Management Team considers the business from the perspective of two core activities, Corporate Travel Management,
which is analysed into three distinct geographic segments, and Spendvision. The Group’s internal reporting processes do not distinguish
between the numerous sources of income that comprise revenue for Corporate Travel Management. The performance of the operating
segments is assessed based on a measure of operating profit excluding items of an exceptional nature. Interest income and expenditure
and income tax expense are not included in the result for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Executive Management Team.
Other information provided, except as noted below, to the Executive Management Team is measured in a manner consistent with that in
the financial statements.
Total segment assets exclude cash and cash equivalent assets, current tax assets and deferred tax assets which are managed on a central
basis. These are included as part of the reconciliation to total Consolidated Balance Sheet assets. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The amortisation charge for the year of £9.5m (2011: £8.4m) is comprised of £4.1m (2011: £4.0m) in respect of intangible assets
acquired via business combinations and £5.4m (2011: £4.4m) which relates to amortisation of software purchased and internally
generated by existing businesses.
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
The recoverable amount used in the assessment of goodwill for all cash generating units comprises the higher of value in use and net
realisable value. During the year the Group reviewed its discount rate and long term growth rates and these have been applied in the
assessment. The value in use has been calculated by discounting at 10% per annum (2011: 10% per annum) the anticipated pre-tax
cash flows. The forecasts are prepared from management information taking into account historical trading performance and
anticipated changes in future market conditions. The detailed forecasts cover a period of three years from the balance sheet date;
cash flows are projected beyond that period based on market consensus for GDP growth of 2% (2011: 2%).
Goodwill consists of the following amounts related to cash generating units of the Group:
Years ended 31 March

Corporate Travel Management
Europe 169.7 172.9
North America 43.6 43.6
Asia Pacific 1.0 1.0
214.3 217.5
Spendvision 5.5 3.5
219.8 221.0
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing were as follows:
– Discount rates
– Rates of growth in cash generating units beyond 3 years
Discount rate
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the post-tax cost of capital employed for the Group’s cash generating units listed
above. The same rate is applied to all cash generating units, and reflects the Group’s funding arrangements where all units have equal
access to the Group’s treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations. None of the Group’s cash generating units
demonstrate levels of risks that are significantly different from those experienced by the Group generally, and all have similar funding
profiles and therefore the discount rate applied is deemed to be justified.
Rates of growth in cash generating units beyond 3 years
Management have reviewed Corporate Travel industry forecasts and consider that the market consensus for GDP growth of 2% is
reasonable for the purposes of the assessment of goodwill.
Goodwill impairment
Management believes that no reasonable change in the key assumptions would cause any of the identified cash generating units to
become impaired. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
– Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
– Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly; and
– Level 3:  techniques which use inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not observable market data.
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values have been determined by reference 
to Level 2 techniques in the hierarchy described above. The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum 
credit exposure. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

receivables of £7.2m (2011: £13.2m) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of independent customers for whom
there is no recent history of default. The ageing of these trade receivables is as follows:

A provision for onerous contracts has been recognised for contracts where the expected benefits derived by the Group are lower than
the unavoidable costs of meeting the Group’s obligations under the contract.
Provision has been made for the present value of property lease commitments in respect of properties surplus to operational
requirements. Allowance has been made for anticipated sublet rental income, and costs to restore premises to their original condition

At 31 March 2012, deferred tax assets include £39.5m (2011: £35.7m) arising in the UK. These assets are recognised on the basis that
there will be sufficient appropriate taxable profits available in the future against which to realise them.
The UK Government reduced the rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012. Based on the UK deferred tax
balances as at 31 March 2012, this has led to a reduction in deferred tax assets of £3.1m, of which £2.8m is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and £0.3m is in the Consolidated Income Statement. Further proposals to reduce the
UK rate by 1% per annum to 22% by April 2014 had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not
reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Of the total tax losses at 31 March 2012, £0.2m is scheduled to expire by 31 March 2022.
No deferred tax is recognised on the undistributed profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as they are reinvested by the
Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Since acquisition, subsidiaries have made profits of
£65.8m (2011: £58.3m) that have not been remitted to the Company. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension arrangement is the Hogg Robinson (1987) Pension Scheme (the UK Scheme). The UK
Scheme was closed to new members in March 2003, with benefits based on final pensionable salary. The increase in final pensionable
salary since 31 March 2003 is limited to the lower of the increase in the Retail Prices Index and 5% per annum. The latest actuarial
valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2011 by an independent qualified actuary.
The Group also operates defined benefit schemes in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Italy and France.
The following amounts have been included in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of all defined benefit pension arrangements:

The expected rates of return have been set taking into account current market returns for each category of asset at the balance sheet dates.
The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the UK Scheme is sensitive to both the actuarial assumptions used and to
market conditions. If the discount rate assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligations would be expected to increase by £41.8m and if it
was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to decrease by £35.9m. If the inflation assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligations would be
expected to decrease by £14.1m and if it was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to increase by £18.4m.
The mortality assumptions for the UK Scheme are based on PMA/FA92 tables with ‘medium cohort’ projections and a 1% underpin in the
rate of future improvements in mortality. Life expectancy at the age of 65 is assumed to be:
Years ended 31 March
2012 2011
Current pensioners
Male 23.5 22.8
Female 25.7 26.1
Future retirements
Male 25.0 24.8
Female 27.3 28.2
The UK liability is based on the assumption that active and deferred members will take 25% of the value of their pension as a lump sum
on retirement.
The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the UK Scheme are sensitive to the life expectancy assumption. If there was
an increase of one year to this assumption the obligations would be expected to increase by £10.2m.

During the year, deferred members of the UK scheme were offered the opportunity to transfer their accrued benefits out of the UK
scheme to alternative pension providers on enhanced terms. The programme reduced the March 2012 assests and liabilities by
approximately £33m, of which £26.8m will be settled after 31 March 2012.
None of the plan assets are represented by financial instruments of the Group. None of the plan assets are occupied or used by the Group.
For several years, the UK defined benefit scheme has been closed to new entrants and has capped increases in pensionable salary.
The latest triennial valuation, effective April 2011, was agreed with the Trustees during the year. Cash contributions amounting to 14.8%
of pensionable salaries, plus deficit reduction payments totalling £15.0m during the two years ending 31 March 2013 were agreed.
Deficit reduction payments from April 2013, will amount to £7.7m per annum, as adjusted for increases in RPI.

SPENDVISION HOLDINGS LIMITED
On 30 March 2012 the Group acquired the 42% interest in Spendvision Holdings Limited which it did not already own for a total
consideration of £13.4m, satisfied by £8.4m in cash and £5m from the issue of 8.2m shares in Hogg Robinson Group plc. Spendvision
Holdings Limited is a leading innovator in the development and support of transaction management solutions, including end-to-end
expense management and payables automation. The acquisition provides an opportunity to strengthen the Group’s product offering
and end-to-end services proposition, and is consistent with the Group’s strategy to provide a broader range of integrated products to its
corporate clients linked to its own proprietary technology.
The goodwill arising related to deferred consideration of £2m that was paid under pre-existing agreements resulting from a previous sale
of shares in March 2008, this was consequently accounted for under IFRS 3 (2004).
At the acquisition date, the carrying value of the non-controlling interest in Spendvision Holdings Limited was £3m. The difference of
£10.4m between the consideration and the carrying value of the interest acquired has been recognised in retained earnings within
equity. Acquisition-related costs of £0.3m have been charged to retained earnings.

26 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
In 1994 Compagnie Dens Ocean NV (CDO), an indirectly owned subsidiary, received a claim from the Belgian Customs authorities
resulting in a liquidator being appointed in 1995. Civil litigation is in process with criminal proceedings being considered pending the
final outcome of the civil action. The liquidator is defending the civil action vigorously and has received strong legal advice on the
strength of CDO’s case. The Directors continue to believe, on the basis of such advice, that any future impact on the net assets of the
Group would not be material.

30 Share-based incentives
The Group operates equity-settled share-based incentive schemes as follows:
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The PSP is applicable to senior executives including Key Management. Shares are awarded which vest for no consideration after a three
year period. Award holders are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.
For Key Management, each award has two discrete elements with performance conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR) and
on basic earnings per share (EPS).
The extent to which the TSR portion of the scheme will vest is subject to the Company’s TSR performance over a three year period
relative to the TSR performance of the companies in the FTSE 350 Support Service Index. Full vesting will take place for a top 20%
ranking, 25% vesting for a median ranking and no award if TSR falls below the median.
The extent to which the EPS portion of any award will vest is subject to the underlying EPS of the Company increasing over a three
year period.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2010, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 20p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 15p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years ending
on 31 March 2012.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2011, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 23p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 18p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years ending
on 31 March 2013.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2012, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 26p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 21p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years ending
on 31 March 2014. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HRG Annual Report 2012 73
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
30 Share-based incentives continued
Awards to certain senior executives (other than Key Management) are not subject to TSR or EPS performance conditions.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2010, 25% of such awards vest two years after the grant date, with the remaining
75% vesting one year later.
– For awards made during the years ended 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2012, one third of such awards vest on each anniversary of the
Deed of Grant.
If performance conditions are met then shares will be issued up to six months after the vesting date. Participants who leave as a result of
a qualifying reason (generally retirement or involuntary redundancy) will receive a pro-rata entitlement. The awards for other participants
who leave prior to vesting will lapse.
COMPANY SHARE OPTION PLAN (CSOP)
The CSOP is applicable to senior executives including Key Management. Share options are awarded which vest after a three year period
subject to performance conditions. The exercise price of the options is the market price of shares immediately prior to the award. Each
award has two discrete elements with performance conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR) and on earnings per share (EPS).
The performance conditions and arrangements for leavers are the same as for the PSP scheme. Options can be exercised for a period of
seven years following the end of the vesting period. Option holders are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.
SHARESAVE SCHEMES
Sharesave schemes have been established in most countries in which the Group has operations and are applicable to all employees.
Options are issued linked to savings contracts of up to £250 per month (or equivalent amounts overseas) for periods of three or five years
(two years in the USA) with a six month exercise period. Options are issued at a discount of up to 20% of the market price immediately
preceding the date of invitation to apply.
CHARGE FOR THE YEAR
The Group’s charge for equity-settled share-based incentives for the year of £2.4m (2011: £2.2m) has been included in operating
expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The following table illustrates the weighted average exercise price (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options during the year:

that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and
express an opinion on the Parent Company Financial Statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on

where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information
in the Annual Report to identify any material inconsistencies with
the audited Financial Statements. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider
the implications for our report.

BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in

Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
1 Accounting policies
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006, and conform with applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards. The Directors consider that the
accounting policies set out below are suitable, have been
consistently applied and are supported by reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates.
INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less any
provision for impairment in value.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of issue
costs incurred. Subsequent measurement depends on the
designation of the instruments as follows:
Borrowings are held at amortised cost and are classified as current
liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
balance sheet date. Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense
in the period in which they are incurred.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value with
subsequent provision for impairment.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its
liabilities. A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver
cash or another financial asset to a third party.
TAXATION AND DEFERRED TAXATION
Any charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period
and takes into account deferred taxation. Full provision is made
where required by FRS 19, Deferred Taxation for deferred taxation
on all timing differences, which have arisen but have not reversed
at the balance sheet date. Deferred taxation assets and liabilities
are not discounted.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS
Interim dividends are recognised in the Parent Company Financial
Statements in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in
the Parent Company Financial Statements in the period in which
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
The amounts of dividends taken as shares instead of cash under
the scrip dividend scheme have been added back to reserves. The
nominal value of shares issued under the scheme has been
funded out of the share premium account.
SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The premium received on the issue of shares in excess of the
nominal value of shares is credited to the share premium account
and included within shareholders’ equity.
SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES
The Company operates several equity-settled share-based
incentive schemes for Group employees. The fair value of the
awards is calculated at grant date and is recognised as an expense
over the vesting period. For awards with vesting conditions based
on market conditions (particularly, those based on total
shareholder return compared with external benchmarks), the
likelihood of vesting is assessed at the date of grant and is not
subsequently amended in arriving at the expense for each year in
the vesting period. All other awards are re-assessed at each
balance sheet date, with the expense charged to the Profit and
Loss Account including the impact of changes of previous
estimates of the likelihood of vesting. The total expense for the
year gives rise to a corresponding credit to equity.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TRUST
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored
Employee Benefits Trust are included in the Financial Statements.
In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the Company
remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they vest
unconditionally with employees.
MANAGEMENT JUDGEMENT
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies,
management has made a number of judgements, none of which
are considered to have a significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the Parent Company Financial Statements.
2 Cash flow statement and related party disclosures
In accordance with the exemption under FRS 1, the Company’s
Cash Flow Statement has not been separately presented in these
Parent Company Financial Statements. The Company is also
exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party
transactions with entities that are part of Hogg Robinson Group
plc or wholly owned investees of Hogg Robinson Group plc.
The Directors of Hogg Robinson plc occasionally use the
services of Group companies for their personal travel needs.
These transactions are not material to either party and hence
do not warrant further disclosure in these Parent Company
Financial Statements. PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3 Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for
the year. Hogg Robinson Group plc reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 of £3.9m (2011: loss of £2.5m).
Audit fees and non-audit fees for the Company are borne by a subsidiary of this Company, Hogg Robinson plc.

Introduction Chairman’s statement
HRG has once again
produced good results
and continues to
anticipate a positive
and resilient future.
 This has been another year of good
performance by the Group, with
revenues increasing and profits
showing material growth over last
year’s results. In its turn this enables
the funding of another significant
increase in the dividend, in line with
our progressive dividend policy.
We and our clients operated in the
last year in a world of divergent
regional economic performance.
The European economy benefitted
from growth in Germany but
otherwise did poorly in a year that
was dominated by the eurozone
crisis and political indecision over
the best way to resolve it. Within
Europe the UK economy was
broadly unchanged for the year as
a whole but questions remain
about the fragility of the economy.
North American economies grew
in 2011 but not quite as well as in
2010 while certain countries in
South America and much of Asia
delivered very good growth in GDP .
With these different challenges and
opportunities as the backdrop, HRG
has once again produced good
results and continues to anticipate
a positive and resilient future.
Our strategy is to provide a range
of services to our clients in the
corporate travel and related
expense area. We do this through 
a mixture of internet and direct
service offerings allowing clients 
to choose from a range of service
levels with consequent pricing
options. We are expanding
accessibility and range, and have
recently increased ownership of our
subsidiary, Spendvision, to one
hundred per cent. This will enable 
us to introduce Spendvision’s
capabilities in online expense
management to the corporate
travel market, whilst also continuing
to develop its capabilities in the
existing markets that it serves. 
Like all businesses we face risks in
delivering our strategy including
higher oil prices and their impact on
travel costs. We have to be at the
forefront of technological change as
the internet and mobile technology
constantly increase the ways to
interact with clients. Natural
disasters can impact our business,
interestingly, positively as well as
negatively and finally, travel costs are
affected by Government increasing
fuel duty and taxation of air travel.
Notwithstanding these risks, we see
a good and expanding future for
the business in the long term.
I would like to draw shareholders’
attention to the increase in
underlying earnings per share of
14%. Your Board remains mindful 
of its commitment to maintain a
progressive dividend policy while
being cognisant of the capital needs
of the business and its cash flow.
Nevertheless we think it appropriate
to reward shareholders with an
increase in the total dividend of 33%,
ahead of last year’s 25% increase.
Borrowings have been held flat this
year with the £10.4m cash outflow
in connection with the Spendvision
purchase being fully funded by
the cash flow generated from
operations. Year-end net debt again
reflects management action to hold
it below the average borrowing
level for the year but we no longer
see the need for this active working
capital programme to continue in
the future. After allowing for its
cessation, we expect the business
to again generate positive free cash
flow in the coming year.
The pension deficit remains a
substantial amount for a company of
our size. The UK pension scheme has
been closed to new members since
2003 and during the year we have
taken action to reduce the volatility
of the deficit by offering enhanced
transfer values to members who
withdraw from the scheme.
Nevertheless, for so long as interest
rates remain at such low levels,
it is difficult to see the net pension
liabilities reducing significantly.
Your Board has complied with the
requirements of the UK Corporate
Governance Code and, as
envisaged last year, we undertook
a review of Board effectiveness by
external consultants in the last year.
The review concluded that our
procedures are appropriate but, as
always, there are some things we
can do better. We have established
a programme to follow up these
points and will do so through the
coming year.
We have benefitted from the
additional input of the two directors
who were appointed last year
and we were recently pleased to
announce the appointment of
our new Group Finance Director,
Philip Harrison, who will join the
Company on 11th June. We are
looking forward to working with
him. Philip has been appointed to fill
the role that will be left when Julian
Steadman retires at the AGM on
25th July after four and a half years’
service. In that time, the Company
has produced consistently better
results and achieved an improved
financial position and I would like
to thank Julian for his important
contribution. We wish him well
with his future plans.
Finally, I would like to extend my
thanks to all those who have
contributed to the Company’s
success this year. The growth has
continued and that is due to the
efforts of the executive and staff
colleagues who have always put
the client first, and of course to
my colleagues on the Board.

HRG demonstrates talent, expertise
and knowledge at every stage. 
This, together with the company’s
investment and innovation in bespoke
technology, means we are confident
our global travel needs will always 
be well serviced.
Willis
“
” Several factors were crucial to the
success of this global contract, such as
Syngenta and HRG’s strong relationship
and HRG’s understanding of – and
respect for – the targets of local teams.
This led to a genuine partnership,
resulting in an effective global travel
programme that accounts for local
needs and brings many mutual benefits.

The HRG team’s extensive local
knowledge, all-round experience 
and flexibility in proposing effective

and ones which definitely influenced
our decision to award HRG with the
contract to manage our travel
programme.

” HRG People – going further for our clients
The past year has seen many
successes for Hogg Robinson
Group. This is an achievement
attributable not just to HRG’s
superior technology and
products, but also to our clear
point of service difference –
HRG People.
At HRG we take pride in
working harder and going
further to support our clients
and their travellers. HRG
People share a passion that
can be felt at every level and
which is evident in how we
apply our depth of knowledge,
resourcefulness and influence

This is why ‘HRG - People going
further’ is a belief that is at the
core of our brand. It is a proud
statement of both HRG’s
difference and HRG’s promise,
one that we know that our
clients recognise as honest and 
one of the primary reasons that
they use our services. 
We are a company that
delivers above and beyond the
call of duty for all our
stakeholders. HRG clients, in
particular, have always felt this
difference. Now it is being
made explicit and in doing so
HRG will strengthen existing
client relationships and forge
exciting new ones.
Our key strengths – HRG
People and our technology –
are evident across our three
areas of business expertise:
Travel, Expense and Data
Management. These will
continue to bring advantage
for our clients and deliver on
our brand promise of HRG
People going further.

HRG Consulting client
achieves US $6.1 million
saving
With a well-established
global hotel programme in
place, this consumer product
client engaged the support of
HRG Consulting to maximise
value. The scope of the project
included assistance with a
Request For Proposal (RFP) to
suppliers covering 73
countries. Subsequent
negotiations were divided
between the client and HRG
Consulting and tracking of
programme performance
was then used to monitor
effectiveness and provide a
platform for further action.
The results included savings
on amenities as well as rates
and a return on investment of
over 90 times the project cost.

Spendvision realises
major savings for a UK
public sector body 
Spendvision’s technological
advantage helped a UK
public sector body cut costs
by £229,800 annually. Firstly
a £110,000 saving was made
through a more accurate
VAT reclaim process, together
with rebates on purchasing
card spend, while £93,000
was then saved through
efficiencies including
redeployment of staff. As a
further benefit, because
purchasing card transactions
were three times faster than
before, front line workers
were freed up to concentrate
on their added value
functions so effectively saving
a further £26,800.
CASE STUDY Joanne answered a call to our office
asking for help from travellers stranded
due to Hurricane Irene. They were
facing a delay of up to a week in
getting home due to cancelled flights.
Joanne worked through the night to
secure flights for the next day, from
their nearest airport, ensuring all
travellers got home quickly and safely.

In his time here [my colleague] Paul has
worked very closely with the client to
identify and follow through on
opportunities to improve their global
airline programme, resulting in 
annual incremental savings of over
$300,000. The client trusts him
implicitly and recognises they are
getting superior consultative assistance.

My team member Charlotte received
a very short lead time enquiry for
immediate response. The client had
already secured rates but she felt
there was better value available.
Through some clever thinking and
determined negotiation she saved
the client almost €1 64,000 on just
that one booking.

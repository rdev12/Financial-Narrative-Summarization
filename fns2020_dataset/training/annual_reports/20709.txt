Financial Highlights 2003 I am pleased to be able to report another
successful year for Alliance & Leicester plc. 
Financial Results
Pre-tax proﬁt in 2003 was a record
£525m, up 12% on 2002. Basic earnings
per share were up 16% to 79.0p. The
Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of
29.6p, making a total dividend of 43.9p,
a 10% increase on the equivalent ﬁgure
for 2002.
Shareholder Returns
The Group’s strategy is working, and 
this is reﬂected in the returns we have
generated for our shareholders. Since 
July 2000, when we launched our
strategy, we have generated a Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) of 114%. 
This compares to a TSR of minus 23% 
for the FTSE 100 Index, and a TSR
of 28% for the banking sector index 
over the same period.
During 2003 Alliance & Leicester
shareholders received a TSR of 25%. 
This compares to a TSR of 18% for the
FTSE 100 Index, and a TSR of 24% for 
the banking sector index.
Strategy
Our strategy is reﬂected by our 
brand values of rewarding customers
who buy more from us, offering 
better value products, developing
straightforward processes, and 
providing friendly, approachable
customer service. By delivering 
these brand values we are ideally
positioned for continued success. 
The market is evolving in a way that 
will give us competitive advantage. Both
personal and commercial customers 
are increasingly using “direct” channels
for their basic banking transactions, 
but they also wish to use branches or
other face-to-face contact for more
complex enquiries and purchases. 
We have proven skills in these “direct”
channels – telephone, internet and ATM
banking – together with a compact 
and professional branch network. By
continuing to build a direct bank with 
a high street presence, we are well
placed for the future.
Board and Management
We continue to add to the existing
strengths of our Board and on 1 October
2003 announced the appointment of
Chris Rhodes as Managing Director,
Retail Banking. Chris has demonstrated
considerable leadership skills since 
he joined the Board in June 2002 
as Operations Director, and we are
conﬁdent in his ability to successfully
grow our Retail Banking business. 
We have also appointed two additional
non-executive directors. Peter Stone and
Jane Barker both have broad commercial
experience, and they also have speciﬁc
skills which will be of great overall beneﬁt
to our Board. In particular, Peter Stone
has extensive experience in the ﬁeld of
commercial banking, and will make a
valuable contribution to the Group’s
Wholesale Banking strategy. Jane Barker
has extensive experience in ﬁnancial
services, and will add further valuable
ﬁnancial expertise to the Board.

Chairman’s Statement
“We delivered record 
profits in 2003 and met
all our strategic targets.
Implementation of our
strategy is delivering
excellent total returns 
for our shareholders.”
John Windeler, Chairman by being a responsible employer and
through charitable giving and staff
volunteering. We update our Corporate
Social Responsibility report annually, 
and we continue to make a valuable
contribution to our local communities
through donations, gifts-in-kind and 
staff volunteering. 
The Future
The ﬁnancial success shown in our 2003
results demonstrates the value of our
strategy for our shareholders, a strategy
we believe represents the future for
banking in the UK, and which we believe
will continue to deliver real value for 
our customers and shareholders going
forward. I am confident that 2004 will 
be another successful year for the Group.

Business Performance
Each of the Group’s business sectors 
had a successful 2003, as is highlighted
elsewhere in this Report. These results
reﬂect the continuing excellent work of
the executive team, under Richard Pym’s
leadership, as well as the dedication and
ability of our staff. 
Alliance & Leicester is widely regarded 
as being a low-risk bank and a responsible
lender that pays considerable attention
to being fair to customers. We have
worked hard to gain and maintain this
reputation, and we will continue to
pursue responsible lending in each of 
our markets.
Corporate Governance
The Board recognises the value of 
good corporate governance, not only 
in the areas of accountability and risk
management, but also as a positive
contribution to business prosperity. 
The Board has reviewed the main and
supporting principles and provisions set
out in the revised Combined Code on
Corporate Governance issued by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2003,
and is satisﬁed that it complies with
those provisions in all material respects.
Corporate Social Responsibility
We believe that we have an important
role to play in our local communities,

'01 '02 '03 Alliance & Leicester achieved all of 
its strategic objectives in 2003 and
delivered a strong set of ﬁnancial results.
Pre-tax proﬁt was up 12% to a record
£525m. Earnings per share increased 
by 16% to 79.0p, and the Board has
proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 29.6p per
share, making a total dividend of 43.9p,
an increase of 10%. Our return on 
capital increased to 22.1% as a result 
of our increased earnings and a more
efﬁcient capital base.
These results have been delivered 
against a relatively uncertain economic
backdrop during most of 2003. However
most commentators agree that the
economy enters 2004 in a stronger
position than it entered 2003. Our
current plans are based broadly on
consensus forecasts, suggesting UK 
GDP growth in 2004 of close to 3%,
compared to an out-turn of 2.1% in
2003. We expect interest rates to rise
during 2004, resulting in a modest
slowdown in the growth of consumer
expenditure during the year. 
The UK mortgage market remained 
very strong during 2003. After an
apparent easing in activity in the 
early part of the year, levels of 
lending accelerated towards the year
end. This trend leads us to expect no
signiﬁcant change in UK lending to 
our core markets of house buyers and
remortgages during 2004. We expect
house price inﬂation to continue to 
slow across the UK although, as in 
2003, there will be regional variations.
The unsecured personal loan market
forms part of the non-card consumer
credit market, which slowed in 2003,
with UK gross lending falling 5% and 
net lending falling 17% compared to
2002. We expect UK net lending to
continue to reduce in 2004. Despite 
the 5% reduction in UK gross lending 
in 2003, we achieved record unsecured
personal loan gross advances of £1.9bn
in this market, a 36% increase compared 
to 2002.
Strategic Objectives
The Group’s ultimate aim remains 
the maximisation of shareholder value. 
To deliver this goal in 2003 we had 
a primary strategic target and three
supporting objectives.
We achieved our primary strategic
target of double digit percentage
growth in earnings per share.
Basic earnings per share increased 
by 16% compared to 2002.
We have also delivered against each 
of our supporting objectives:
Achieved accelerated revenue 
growth target.
Group revenues on a like for 
like basis (excluding credit card 
income and any distortion from 
the rationalisation of properties) 
were 5.6% higher than in the 
same period in 2002, exceeding 
our target of 3.9%.

Total Group revenues increased by
2.4% in 2003. This includes £70m 
of credit card income in 2003 (2002:
£102m). There were no signiﬁcant
property rationalisations in 2003
(2002: £5m).
Achieved 2003 cost target.
We achieved the £50m of core
operating cost savings targeted 
in 2003. At the end of 2003 we 
are positioned to achieve the 
£100m reduction in the Group’s 
core operating costs compared 
to 2000, based on 2000 business
volumes and prices, which will be
reﬂected in the Group’s 2004 results.
Achieved tier 1 capital ratio target.
During 2003 we bought back 24.6m
shares at a cost of £215m, reducing
our tier 1 capital ratio to 7.4%, within
our 7.0% – 7.5% target range.
The maintenance of our high quality
credit standards remains a key strategic
goal. As in 2002 our asset quality
remains strong.
During 2004 our primary target will
continue to be to achieve double digit
percentage growth in earnings per share.
This target is supported by goals relating
to revenue growth, costs and the
management of our capital. These
targets are set out in detail on page 13.
In the future, we believe that
implementing our strategy and 
business model, which are covered 
in more detail below, will enable the
Group to continue to grow its franchise
in its chosen markets, supported by 
an efﬁcient operating infrastructure.
Our Business Model
Over the past few years we have
constructed, reﬁned and implemented 
a robust strategy to grow our Retail
Banking business, and in 2003 we
announced a new focused strategy 
for our Wholesale Banking business. 
For Retail Banking, our entire business 
is focused on delivering to customers 
our four brand values: we attract new
customers through products emphasising
the “better value” we offer them; we
make it easy for customers to buy from
us by being “simple and straightforward”
to deal with; both our sales and service
are enhanced by being “friendly and
approachable”; and we retain customers,
and sell more to them, by “recognising
customer relationships”, that is by offering
our existing customers preferential terms
on additional products they purchase
from us. The growth we have achieved in
2003 in Retail Banking reﬂects the value
we offer to customers and create for
shareholders through this approach.
Retail banking in the UK is changing 
fast, driven by far-reaching changes 
in consumer behaviour. Consumers are
becoming ever more aware of the value
of the products available in the market,
and business models which rely on
customer inertia to charge high prices
are becoming increasingly out-dated.
There are also rapid changes in the way
that consumers buy and transact their
ﬁnancial services products. Our own
evidence is showing that our branch
transactions are starting to reduce, whilst
for the UK as a whole, the number of
people using the internet to carry out
their ﬁnancial transactions has more
than doubled in the past two years.
The C1/C2 customer group, our target
customer, has above average internet
usage. In the next two years we believe
customers will become even more
conﬁdent in using technology to process
their ﬁnancial transactions, following the
national introduction of chip and pin
technology for plastic cards.
We have developed a business model 
for our Retail Banking business which
recognises these far-reaching changes.
We refer to this model as being a “direct
bank with a high street presence”. Our
products and marketing activities are 
akin to those offered by a pure direct
bank. We have a skilled management
and workforce in this respect, and a high
proportion of our sales and customer
transactions are already made through
the direct channels of internet, ATM and
telephone, particularly by interactive
voice response. This approach is leading
to a reduction in the marginal cost of
acquiring new customers. Unlike solely
direct providers, however, we also offer
customers face-to-face access through
our compact branch network for more
complex sales and transactions, and as

396 468 525 increased to 1.84m accounts at the end
of 2003.
We believe our Core 4 products offer
customers excellent value. This is
supported by the 1,900 “best buy”
mentions they received in national
newspapers during 2003, more than 
any of our competitors.
Our relationships with our key 
partners, MBNA for credit cards, 
Legal & General for life assurance and
long term investments, and Zurich for
household insurance, continue to work
effectively. We have recorded strong
growth in sales of credit cards, general
insurance and life assurance products.
Wholesale Banking Performance
Our Wholesale Banking operations have
performed well during the year with 
pre-tax proﬁt in Commercial Banking up
15% to £80m (2002: £70m), and pre-tax
proﬁt in Treasury up 22% to £47m
(2002: £39m).
Commercial Banking saw strong growth
in cash sales to ﬁnancial institutions, with
volumes more than doubling to £43bn in
2003 (2002: £20bn). We opened 11,000
new business banking accounts in 2003.
The majority of these customers have a
turnover of less than £1m. During 2004
we will be broadening our business
banking proposition to appeal to
customers with a higher turnover. 
Our commercial loan book grew to
£4.1bn at the end of 2003 (2002:
£3.4bn) and, as we announced in July
2003, we have focused our small ticket
leasing activities on the commercial
vehicle, bus and coach, public sector and
wholesale ﬁnance (primarily large scale
ﬂeet ﬁnance) sectors. As a consequence,
from July 2003 we ceased to write new
business in the equipment ﬁnance, plant
and machinery, car contract hire, ﬂeet
management and other general business
small ticket leasing sectors. Since July
2003, £80m of the £500m balances 
in these sectors have run off, leaving
£420m at the end of 2003 to run off
over the next four years.
As part of our Wholesale Banking
strategy, in July 2003 we announced that
we were seeking an alliance to provide 
a merchant acquisition service for our
customers in the future. This process is
ongoing and we expect, subject to the
necessary approvals, to conclude an
agreement in the ﬁrst half of 2004. This
is likely to involve the sale of our existing
business, and the continuation of an
Alliance & Leicester branded service.
Regulation
Our business policies are, we believe,
well-aligned with our regulator’s agenda.
We are a responsible lender, ensuring as
best we are able that customers are not
borrowing more than they can afford 
to repay now or in the future, should
interest rates rise, as expected. As part 
of our standard mortgage application
process, we ask all customers to provide
evidence of their income, as well as
limiting lending to a maximum of 95%
of the value of the property. Our lending
application processes make extensive 
use of credit bureau data to assess 
the customer and check their current
commitments, as well as using data
available from their existing relationships
with us. 
These procedures, together with new
system developments implemented
during the second half of 2003, leave 
us well positioned to comply with the
Financial Services Authority’s (FSA)
“Regulating mortgage sales: conduct 
of business rules” which takes effect 
at the end of October 2004. 
Our policies and operations are driven 
by our brand values. These include
being both “simple and straightforward”
and “friendly and approachable” for
customers to deal with, which aligns 
us with our regulator, in particular in 
the light of its objective to improve the
clarity of ﬁnancial information and its
understanding by customers. During
2004 we will be implementing additional
initiatives to assist in the ﬁnancial
education of customers. 
Our preparations for reporting 
our 2005 results under International
Accounting Standards (IAS) are making
good progress, and we await publication
of a ﬁnal IAS 39 “Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement” by the
International Accounting Standards
Board. We are also making good
progress in ensuring we meet all the
necessary criteria to maximise the
6 Alliance & Leicester
Group Chief Executive’s Review continued
a source of conﬁdence for customers 
so that they can talk face-to-face should
they need to. We have a network of 300
branches, which we believe covers the
whole of the UK effectively. 
Our business model will increasingly 
allow us to provide customers with good,
consistent customer service at a low unit
cost. By reinvesting some of that cost
saving to ensure our products continue 
to offer good value to our customers, we
have a business model for growing future
revenues in a cost-effective way.
In our Wholesale Banking business, we
are making good progress implementing
the strategy we announced in July 2003.
This strategy focuses on products and
markets where we have a core
competency and critical mass, building
on the success achieved within Retail
Banking from increased focus, and
simpliﬁcation of operating processes. 
The four core business lines are cash,
commercial lending, business banking
and treasury. 
Retail Banking Performance
Retail Banking pre-tax proﬁt increased 
by £9m to £441m (2002: £432m), 
with revenues growing by 5.5% on 
a like for like basis (excluding credit 
card income and any distortion from 
the rationalisation of properties). Cost
growth was controlled at 2.6%, and 
asset quality remains very strong.
Retail Banking resources are focused 
on mortgages, personal loans, current
accounts and savings. We refer to these
four products as the “Core 4”. Each of
our Core 4 products performed well
during 2003. We achieved record gross
mortgage lending of £8.1bn, up 27%, 
a 15% increase in net mortgage lending
to £2.0bn, and record gross unsecured
personal loan sales of £1.9bn, up 36%.
This lending has been achieved without
any reduction in our credit standards.
Lending in both our mortgage and
personal loan operations in January 
2004 was higher than in January 2003.
Our personal account deposit balances
grew by over £1.3bn, with balances 
at the end of 2003 reaching £18.9bn.
183,000 new current accounts were
opened, in line with the number opened
in 2002. The current account base has continue to recognise our customer
relationships by offering customers
preferential terms on additional products
they purchase from us.
We believe our “direct bank with a 
high street presence” business model
represents the future for banking in 
the UK. By delivering this model, and
maintaining our responsible approach 
to lending, we believe that Alliance &
Leicester will continue to deliver real
value for our customers and shareholders
in the future. Alliance & Leicester has
never been clearer on what it is doing,
on what it has to achieve, and on 
where it is going.

potential beneﬁts for our shareholders
from the implementation of the Basel 2
capital accord, from which we expect to
be a major beneﬁciary.
Our Staff
I would like to thank our staff for their
contribution to our success in 2003.
Throughout the Group we have been
strengthening our management teams
by developing existing managers as well
as recruiting new managers from outside
the organisation. Over the past few years
we have signiﬁcantly improved the
quality of our management, enabling 
us to compete successfully in the
competitive UK banking market. During
2003 we achieved Group-wide “Investors
In People” accreditation, recognising the
quality of our training and development.
This set of results reﬂects the work of 
the excellent teams of people we have
working across the whole Group, each
committed to achieving our business
goals, and sharing a clear vision of 
where Alliance & Leicester is heading.
As a British bank focused on serving
British customers, we believe our
customers prefer to have their telephone
calls answered in the British Isles. Our
staff provide good, friendly service to 
our customers and we will not put this,
nor our customer relationships, at risk 
by outsourcing our core contact centres
outside the British Isles. 
The funding of pension schemes is 
a key issue for all employers and staff 
in the UK. During 2003 we agreed to
increase the Group’s funding of our
deﬁned beneﬁts pension scheme and
deﬁned contribution pension schemes. 
In 2003 the Group also made a one-off
contribution of £100m to the deﬁned
benefits pension scheme. This
contribution was above that required
by the scheme’s actuaries, and
demonstrates the commitment of 
the Group to our pension schemes.
The Future
2003 has seen continued growth 
in our Retail Banking franchise, and 
in our chosen Wholesale Banking
markets. We will continue to develop 
our direct distribution channels to give
our customers great value products,
supported by straightforward, friendly
and approachable service, and we will During 2003 creditor protection
insurance penetration of new personal
loans has been maintained at around 
the levels achieved in 2002, generating 
a valuable source of non-interest income.
Our personal loans business continues 
to be a highly efﬁcient direct operation.
During 2003 the internet accounted for
22% of applications, representing a 90%
increase on 2002 application numbers. 
In total the internet and the telephone
generated 87% of our personal
loan applications.
Current Accounts
We opened 183,000 new current
accounts in 2003, similar to the number
in 2002 which itself was 28% higher
than 2001. Our current account base 
has grown to 1.84m accounts.
During the ﬁnal quarter of 2003 we
started using direct response television 
to advertise our Premier current account
product. The initial results from these
adverts have exceeded our expectations.
The majority of current accounts opened
during 2003 were Premier accounts. The
average product holding of a Premier
account customer is more than double
that of the rest of the Retail Banking
customer base.
Savings
Personal customer deposit balances have
increased by over £1.3bn to £18.9bn at
the end of December 2003.
We continue to maintain our focused 
and simpliﬁed range of products, with
the growth in balances being achieved
through both branch and telephone
based accounts. 
Since January 2004 all of our card-based
savings account holders have been able
to deposit, withdraw, and check their
balances at Post Ofﬁce counters, using
the same process as that introduced for
current account customers in 2003.
Partner 4
2003 has been the ﬁrst full ﬁnancial year
for our partnerships with both MBNA for
credit cards, and with Legal & General
for life assurance. Sales of both of these
products have seen strong growth, with
the sale of new credit cards increasing by
2003, compared to less than 10% in
2002. The proportion of our mortgage
balances covered by early repayment fees
increased from 42% at the end of 2002
to 54% at the end of 2003.
Personal Loans
During 2003 gross unsecured personal
loan advances increased by 36% to
£1.9bn (2002: £1.4bn), whilst balances
increased by 16% to £2.5bn (2002:
£2.1bn). This increase in new lending 
has been achieved as a result of
improvements in our marketing and
customer acquisition processes. The 
key drivers were the use of highly 
focused and cost effective direct response
television advertising and the use of 
our risk-based pricing system. The use 
of risk-based pricing has not involved 
any relaxation in our lending criteria.
Our process for assessing our customers’
ability to repay a loan takes into account a
number of factors such as income, regular
outgoings, other outstanding loan balances
and the size of loan applied for. As part 
of our credit approval process we make
extensive use of credit bureau data to
assess customers and to check their
current commitments, as well as using data
available from our own customer base.
The credit quality of our unsecured
lending book remains very strong, with
the charge for bad debts remaining 
at around 2002 levels, despite a 16%
increase in balances. The maintenance of
our high credit standards in this business
is a key objective. For the month of
December 2003 we increased our loan
cut-off criteria to reﬂect the general
increase in ﬁnancial stress that occurs
towards the end of the year. This
dampened our lending volumes 
in the fourth quarter of 2003.
During 2003 over 75% of our unsecured
loans to “New-to-Group” customers 
were to homeowners, greater than 
the 66% identiﬁed in a recent Bank of
England survey. The proportion of loan
applications we accepted has reduced 
in 2003 compared to 2002. We believe 
that the proﬁle of our typical applicant,
combined with our risk assessment and
affordability processes, will leave us well
placed to manage any impact from the
future changes in the UK personal
bankruptcy laws.

2003, a market share of 3%. Net
mortgage lending increased 15% 
to £2.0bn, a market share of 2.1%.
Mortgage balances at the end of 
2003 were £25.5bn (2002: £23.5bn), 
a market share of 3.3% (2002: 3.5%).
We have implemented a number 
of customer service improvements 
in our mortgage business during the
second half of 2003, including a new
sales quotation system as well as
enhancements to our intermediary
internet application system. These
initiatives contributed to a signiﬁcant
increase in our mortgage lending during
the second half of 2003, with gross
advances of £4.9bn, a market share 
of 3.3%, and net lending of £1.5bn, 
a market share of 2.9%.
Our mortgage strategy aims to provide
year on year growth in our mortgage
assets by targeting the prime residential
sector. We avoid lending in the buy-to-
let, sub-prime, self-certiﬁcation and over
95% loan to value ratio (LTV) sectors,
which we believe are higher risk. We will
increasingly offer our customers a simple
product range and segment our new
business by both channel and buyer type. 
Lending to remortgage customers
accounted for 50% of Alliance &
Leicester’s gross mortgage lending in
2003, similar to the 45% for the market
as a whole. Whilst gross lending to ﬁrst
time buyers fell by around 20% in the
market as a whole, our lending to this
type of customer increased by 11%.
The product mix also saw a signiﬁcant
change in 2003. Over 50% of our gross
lending was on ﬁxed rate products in 80% during the year to 212,000, and 
life assurance products sales increasing
by 20% compared to 2002.
General insurance product sales
of household, mortgage payment
protection, personal accident and motor
insurance have seen a strong increase,
rising 23% during 2003, driven primarily
by the growth in our mortgage lending. 
New long term investment business in
2003 was lower than in 2002, although
sales in the second half of 2003 reversed
the downward trend seen since the start
of the second half of 2002.
Our Partner 4 products (credit cards, 
life assurance, general insurance and long
term investments) play an important role
in building and recognising customer
relationships, which is a key part of our
strategy and is one of our four brand
values. In July 2003 we reported that 
we had achieved our target of increasing
the average product holding from 1.5
products in June 2000 to 1.65 products.
Since July 2003 we have seen further
growth in cross sales, with the average
product holding increasing to 1.66 at 
the end of 2003.
Distribution
Our 300 branches had a record year in
2003, achieving their highest ever number
of product sales, whilst our telephone and
internet channels have also seen signiﬁcant
growth in new business volumes.
Applications for personal loans, mortgages
and current accounts via our internet site
almost doubled in 2003 compared to
2002. In 2003 over £2bn of mortgage
and personal loan applications were
received directly via the internet, with
over two-thirds of mortgage intermediary
applications also received via our
intermediary internet application system.
During 2003 over 120,000 new customers
registered for our internet banking service,
taking the total number registered to over
225,000. These customers regularly use
the system, with around 10 million bill
payments, transfers between accounts,
and balance checks carried out in 2003.
Our customers are increasingly 
becoming used to using technology 
such as interactive voice response
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 9
systems, ATMs and the internet to carry
out their ﬁnancial transactions. Our
strategy is to increase the number and
range of transactions that customers can
undertake themselves (“self-serve”)
without involving our staff. We process
around 100m transactions (excluding
cheque and debit card transactions) a
year, of which only around 20m involve
personal contact with Alliance & Leicester
staff, whether in the branches or over the
phone. This means that our customers
already self-serve on around 80% of 
their transactions with us.
We have recently reviewed our mortgage
processing operations and have now
focused our operations on three centres
each dedicated to serving a particular
customer group – branch, telephone 
and internet, and intermediaries.
Our ATM network is now around its 
ideal size with a total of 2,600 machines
in operation. During 2003 we installed
80 new sites.
Over the past 3 years we have reduced
the unit cost of acquiring a new Core 4
customer by 38%. This reduction has
been achieved as a result of our simple
and straightforward targeted marketing
programmes. The effectiveness of each 
of our marketing campaigns is measured,
and each campaign is reﬁned following
analysis of the results. During the last 
12 months the unit cost of new customer
acquisition across the Core 4 products
reduced by 5%.
Asset Quality
Asset quality across Retail Banking remains
very strong. Our responsible approach 
to lending has ensured that both our
mortgage and personal loans arrears 
levels are better than industry averages. 
We take a responsible approach to all 
of our lending activities. Our mortgage
and personal loan lending policies are
regularly reviewed. Our mortgage lending
policy was amended in December 2003
to reﬂect both current market conditions
and further enhancements to our credit
assessment processes. Our current
mortgage lending policy applies to the
whole of the UK and limits our lending 
to a maximum of 95% LTV for properties
valued up to £250,000, reducing to 75%
for properties valued over £500,000. This,
combined with our income multiple

criteria and affordability assessments,
protects both our customers and
shareholders. The average LTV of new
lending in 2003 was 59%, with just 
5% of new lending having an LTV over
90%. The estimated LTV of our total
mortgage book, based on house prices at
31 December 2003, was 40%. Mortgage
arrears have continued to reduce, from
£9.7m to £7.3m over the past 12 months.
Only 0.73% of mortgage accounts are in
arrears at the end of 2003 (2002: 0.85%).
Our unsecured lending asset quality has
improved and remains very strong. Non-
performing assets (loans over 30 days in
arrears) comprise 4.4% of the unsecured
loan book (2002: 5.3%). During 2003, our merchant acquisition
business delivered revenues of £21m,
with operating expenses of £15m, and
during 2003 merchant acquisition
transactions increased to 349m. 
We are currently looking at various
options for the future shape of our bill
payments business. During 2003 there
was a small increase in electronic bill
payment transactions, but this was more
than offset by a continued reduction in
the number of paper payments. Total
bill payment transactions were 225m
in 2003 (2002: 229m).
Lending
During 2003 our commercial lending
balances increased by £0.7bn to 
£4.1bn. This growth is after a reduction
in balances of £80m, representing the
run-off of leasing transactions in speciﬁc
small ticket leasing sectors, following 
the decision announced in July 2003. 
The run-off will take around four years 
to complete, with £420m of balances
outstanding at the end of 2003. 
Asset quality across our lending book
remains good, with 0.68% of loans 
over 30 days in arrears at the end 
of 2003 (2002: 0.64%). 
Our commercial lending activities 
are split between Alliance & Leicester
Commercial Bank (ALCB) and 
Alliance & Leicester Commercial 
Finance (ALCF). 
ALCB’s lending activities support 
our corporate customers. ALCB also
undertakes a small amount of secured
property ﬁnance, including long term
leases to UK Government departments
and large UK corporates.
ALCF’s lending can be split into two
types. Big ticket leasing is focused on a
number of sectors and asset specialisations,
and the majority of this lending is bank
guaranteed. Commercial asset ﬁnance
lending is focused on four sectors:
commercial vehicles, bus and coach,
public sector, and wholesale ﬁnance
(primarily large scale ﬂeet ﬁnance). In
July 2003 we announced that we would
be exiting the commercial asset ﬁnance
sectors of equipment ﬁnance, plant 
and machinery, car contract hire, 
ﬂeet management and other general 
business small ticket leasing sectors.
Our Wholesale Banking operations have
performed well during the year, with 
pre-tax proﬁt in Commercial Banking up
15% to £80m (2002: £70m) and pre-tax
proﬁt in Treasury up 22% to £47m (2002:
£39m). Treasury’s ﬁnancial performance
for reporting purposes is included within
the Treasury & Group sector.
In July 2003 we completed a strategic
review of our Wholesale Banking
businesses. This identiﬁed the optimal
future shape and direction for our
Commercial Banking and Treasury
businesses to deliver long term
shareholder value. As part of the strategy
we have focused Wholesale Banking on
four core business lines: cash, lending,
business banking and treasury.
Cash
As we announced in July 2003, the
primary driver of the cash business will
be the value of cash sales rather than the
value of cash handling deposits. During
2003 cash sales to ﬁnancial institutions
were £43.2bn, more than double the
value in 2002. This increase was achieved
as a result of growth in the value of 
cash sold to existing customers, and 
also reﬂects a full year of cash sales to
customers acquired in late 2002. During
2003 cash handling deposits were
£61bn, slightly higher than in 2002. 
The value of cheques processed fell 
by £5.2bn to £20.3bn.
As part of the Wholesale Banking
strategy announcement in July 2003,
we explained that we would continue to
provide services for our customers in bill
payments, international payments and
merchant acquiring. These businesses, in
which we see less potential for signiﬁcant
future proﬁtable growth, will be run in
the most efﬁcient way to continue to
add shareholder value. 
The process of establishing an alliance to
provide a merchant acquisition business
is ongoing and we expect, subject to 
the necessary approvals, to conclude an
agreement in the ﬁrst half of 2004. This 
is likely to involve the sale of our existing
business, and the continuation of an
Alliance & Leicester branded service.
Around 33 Alliance & Leicester staff work
within our merchant acquisition business
and we do not expect any compulsory
redundancies as a result of any sale.

Business Banking
ALCB’s business banking products 
and services offer customers a low 
cost, direct bank with access to the 
Post Ofﬁce network. 
At the end of 2003 we had 58,000
business banking and 101,000
Community accounts. We opened
11,000 new business banking accounts
in 2003 (2002: 11,000). The majority 
of these customers have a turnover of
less than £1m. During 2004 we will 
be broadening our business banking
proposition to appeal to customers 
with a higher turnover. 
In January 2004 we launched our 
new product offerings and a marketing
campaign in the central region of
England, positioning Alliance & Leicester
Commercial Bank as the “A+Lternative
Business Bank” to the larger banks who
currently dominate this market.
Treasury
Treasury have continued to manage the
Group’s liquidity, funding and hedging
requirements successfully. During 2003
extensive marketing has resulted in
continued diversiﬁcation of the funding
base. During December 2003 Treasury
experienced a strong inﬂow of short term
money market funds from institutional
investors, which were reinvested in short
term bank deposits. This contributed
signiﬁcantly to the growth in Treasury’s
assets of 39% in 2003. 
Asset quality within Treasury remains
strong, with 96% (2002: 94%) of
exposures having a long term credit
rating at or above single ‘A’, and we
continue our policy of not investing 
in corporate bonds, emerging markets,
venture capital funds or hedge funds. 12 Alliance & Leicester

Group
Capital
During 2003 we bought back 24.6m
shares at a cost of £215m, reducing 
our tier 1 capital ratio to 7.4%, within
our 7.0% to 7.5% target range.
In 2004 we will continue to improve 
the efﬁciency of our capital base through
the issue of non-equity tier 1 capital and
a reduction in our equity tier 1 ratio. 
It is our intention, subject to market
conditions, to issue a tranche of up to
£300m non-equity tier 1 capital during
the ﬁrst half of 2004, which will result in
our total tier 1 ratio increasing to above
our original 7.0%-7.5% target range by
the end of 2004.
We are, however, planning to continue
to reduce our equity tier 1 capital ratio
from 7.4% at the end of 2003, towards
the lower end of our 7.0%-7.5% target
range by the end of 2004. This reduction
is likely to be achieved through a further
share buyback programme of between
£100m and £150m. We plan to continue
to improve the efﬁciency of our capital
base through our preferred method of
share buybacks. The level of buyback
beyond 2004 will of course be subject to
the impact of International Accounting
Standards and Basel.
Strategic Investment
During 2003 one-off strategic investment
expenditure totalled £18m, £8m lower
than originally anticipated. This £8m 
will be carried forward from 2003 into
2004, reﬂecting projects which are now
expected to be completed in 2004, and
represents the ﬁnal part of the strategic
investment programme set out in 2000.
Investment expenditure in 2003 included
the costs of implementing our Wholesale
Banking strategy and the new credit card
business model.
International Accounting 
Standards (IAS)
Good progress is being made towards
the production of our 2005 results on an
IAS basis from 1 January 2005, including
the required 2004 comparative ﬁgures.
Necessary systems changes are being
implemented and revised accounting
policies under IAS are being drafted,
which will be completed during this year.
The main areas of uncertainty still to be
resolved are the International Accounting
Standards Board’s publication of 
a ﬁnal IAS 39 “Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement”,
guidance from the FSA on the capital
implications of the new standards and
guidance from the Inland Revenue of
the tax implications.
Basel 2
Our Basel 2 project team is making 
good progress to ensure that we meet 
all the necessary criteria to maximise the
beneﬁts from the Basel 2 capital accord
when implemented in 2007. We already
have in place the required systems and
have been capturing the necessary data
for credit risk under Pillar 1 of Basel 2.
Given the high quality of our balance
sheet and our responsible lending
processes we expect to be a major
beneﬁciary of these new rules.

Strategic Targets – 2004
The Group’s primary strategic objective for 2004 is: 
Earnings per share
To deliver double digit percentage growth in basic earnings
per share in 2004.
Our supporting goals for revenue growth, cost reduction
and capital efﬁciency for 2004 are as shown below. 
Revenue
We will continue to target accelerating annual income 
growth in 2004 on a like for like basis (removing the
distortion from any signiﬁcant property rationalisations).
Using this deﬁnition, income growth in 2003 was 2.7%.
Costs
At the end of 2003 we are positioned to achieve the £100m
reduction in the Group’s core operating costs compared to
2000, based on 2000 business volumes and prices, which
will be reﬂected in our 2004 ﬁnancial results.
Overall we are targeting our 2004 operating expenses
(excluding depreciation on operating lease assets and 
one-off strategic investment expenditure) to be broadly
similar to 2003. This reﬂects the achievement of the £100m
reduction in core costs and the impact of inﬂation and
volume growth.
We continue to endeavour to make the extra savings
necessary to offset the additional annual cash market related
costs of around £20m in 2004. These costs arose as a result 
of the implementation of our new business model for the
provision of cash services announced in July 2002.
Capital
We will continue to improve the efﬁciency of our capital base
in 2004, through the issue of non-equity tier 1 capital and a
reduction in our equity tier 1 ratio.
It is our intention, subject to market conditions, to issue a 
tranche of up to £300m non-equity tier 1 capital during the 
ﬁrst half of 2004, which will result in our total tier 1 ratio 
increasing to above 7.5% by the end of 2004.
We are, however, planning to continue to reduce our equity
tier 1 capital ratio from 7.4% at the end of 2003, towards the
bottom end of a 7.0%-7.5% target range by the end of 2004.
This reduction is likely to be achieved through a further share 
buyback programme of between £100m and £150m.
Impact of potential merchant acquisition transaction
As referred to on page 10, we are in the process of seeking 
an alliance to provide a merchant acquisition service for our
customers in the future. This is likely to involve the sale of our
existing business in the ﬁrst half of 2004 and the continuation
of an Alliance & Leicester branded service.
Completion of the transaction would have an impact on our
strategic targets for 2004. The net proﬁt from the sale would
be accounted for as an FRS 3 exceptional item, “Proﬁt on disposal
of Group operations” below “Operating proﬁt”. We will target
double digit percentage growth in underlying basic earnings per
share in 2004, which would exclude any beneﬁt from the sale.
The revenues from this business of £21m in 2003 and £17m 
in 2002 would be removed from our revenue target calculation
to ensure a like for like comparison. Using this deﬁnition our
income growth for 2003 was 2.5%.
Merchant acquisition operating costs of around £15m per
annum would be saved as a result of the sale of the business.
These potential cost savings represent £5m of inﬂation and
volume growth costs compared to 2000, and core costs of
£10m. The core cost savings would partially offset the additional
annual cash market related costs, referred to above. 
The increase in reserves resulting from the sale of the business
would be available for further share buybacks in 2004.

to 2002, is set out below.

Financial Review continued
The Retail Banking sector pre-tax proﬁt of £441m was £9m
(2%) higher than 2002. Income growth was 5.5% (excluding
credit cards and a £5m one-off proﬁt on disposal of a branch
property in 2002), whilst costs were 2.6% higher than the
comparable period, mainly due to increased business volumes.
The loss charge was £12m lower, primarily as a result of the
sale of the credit card accounts to MBNA in 2002. 
The MLI pre-tax proﬁt of £250m was £15m lower than 2002,
primarily reﬂecting lower income from the sale of long term
investment products, a fall in the proportion of mortgages
paying standard variable rate, and the £5m one-off proﬁt 
on disposal of a branch property in 2002.
The Personal Banking pre-tax proﬁt of £191m was £24m higher
than 2002 due to higher unsecured personal loan proﬁts and
growth in current account and ATM income. 
Net interest income
For the full year net interest income of £588m was £23m 
lower than 2002. The sale of the credit card accounts in 
August 2002 reduced net interest by £26m compared to 2002.
This reduction was partly offset by higher net interest income
in unsecured personal loans and current accounts. Net interest
income was £6m lower in the second half of 2003 compared
to the ﬁrst half of 2003.
The Retail Banking net interest margin in 2003 was 1.88%,
compared to 2.09% in 2002. The fall in margin of 0.21%
compared to 2002 reﬂected a fall in interest spread of 0.24%,
partly offset by an increase in the contribution from interest-
free liabilities of 0.03%. The Retail Banking net interest margin
fell from 1.97% in the ﬁrst half of 2003 to 1.80% in the second
half, driven by the MLI margin.
The MLI net interest margin fell from 1.53% in 2002 to 1.40%
in 2003, primarily due to a fall in the proportion of mortgage
balances paying standard variable rate and higher cost of funds
compared to bank base rate. The 0.13% margin reduction
reﬂected a fall in interest spread of 0.11% and a 0.02%
reduction in the contribution from interest-free liabilities. 
The MLI net interest margin fell from 1.48% in the ﬁrst half of
2003 to 1.32% in the second half, driven by higher mortgage
lending in the second half of the year and higher cost of funds
compared to bank base rate. Further details are disclosed on
pages 73 and 74.
The Personal Banking net interest margin fell from 4.75% 
in 2002 to 4.23% in 2003 as a result of lower earnings from
current accounts, the sale of the credit card book, and lower
unsecured lending margins due to competitive market pricing.
In the second half of 2003 the Personal Banking net interest
margin fell by 0.24% from 4.36% in the ﬁrst half to 4.12%,
driven by growth in interest paying Premier accounts and
unsecured lending.
Average interest-earning assets within Retail Banking increased
by 7% in 2003 compared with 2002, and increased by 5% in
the second half of 2003 compared to the ﬁrst half. The growth
in interest-free liabilities reﬂected the full year impact of the
rationalisation of our current account portfolio in December 2002.

Non-interest income
Non-interest income increased by £30m (10%) to £318m in
2003 and included £56m (2002: £36m) of the excess being
recognised from the sale of credit card accounts to MBNA,
whilst the same period in 2002 included a £5m one-off beneﬁt
from the sale of a branch property. Non-interest income from
unsecured personal loans was £64m in 2003 (2002: £43m).
Excluding total credit card income and the property disposal 
in 2002, like for like non-interest income increased by 19%,
mainly reﬂecting higher insurance commission income from
unsecured personal loans, higher mortgage application fee
income and higher ATM income from growth in the network.
This was partly offset by lower income from sales of long term
investment products. 
Our Partner 4 products of credit cards, life assurance, general
insurance and long term investments, in total contributed
£124m of non-interest income. This was £11m lower than
2002, primarily due to the decline in the sale of long term
investment products.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by 2.6% to £416m in 2003
(2002: £406m), reﬂecting growth in business volumes and
inﬂation, partially offset by cost saving initiatives.
The cost:income ratio was 46.0% (2002: 45.1%), mainly
reﬂecting the growth in the ATM network, lower income 
from long term investment sales, and the up-front costs of 
new mortgage lending.
Bad debt provisions 
The charge for bad and doubtful debts fell by £12m to £49m,
reﬂecting the high quality of our Retail Banking assets and the
removal of our exposure to credit cards in August 2002.
The arrears performance for both our mortgage and unsecured
lending businesses continues to compare favourably with
industry data. The value of residential mortgage arrears has
fallen by 25% since December 2002, and at 31 December
2003 represented 0.03% of mortgage balances. For unsecured
personal lending the value of loans over 30 days in arrears as 
a percentage of total loans was around 35% lower than the
average for Finance and Leasing Association members. Annual Report & Accounts 2003 15

(Note 2) Excluding net income from operating lease assets, 
and excluding operating lease assets from average interest-
earning assets, the net interest margin is 1.70% (2002: 1.85%).
(Note 3) Included within mean interest-earning assets are
operating lease assets of £372m (2002: £361m).
(Note 4) The cost:income ratio has been calculated, consistent
with previous years, as operating expenses, which excludes
depreciation on operating lease assets, divided by total income
less depreciation on operating lease assets.
(Note 5) Including depreciation on operating lease assets, 
the cost:income ratio is 77.4% (2002: 79.5%).
Pre-tax proﬁt for the Commercial Banking sector increased by
15% to £80m, primarily reﬂecting business growth in Alliance
& Leicester Commercial Finance. Total income increased by 6%
to £401m.
Net interest income
Net interest income increased by 8% to £88m, with 
interest-earning assets increasing by 16%. The net interest
margin fell to 2.06%, primarily due to the lower interest rate
environment and the focus on higher quality, lower margin
commercial lending.
Non-interest income
Non-interest income rose by 6% to £313m, reﬂecting increased
income from the cash business and higher volumes of business.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by £16m to £255m, primarily
reﬂecting the additional cash market related costs.
Bad debt provisions 
The charge for bad and doubtful debts increased from £8m 
to £10m, reﬂecting growth in balances.

operations increased by 11%, reﬂecting higher earnings from
the high quality medium term investment portfolio. This was
offset by lower earnings on our excess capital, mainly due to
share buybacks. External mean interest-earning assets have
increased by 14% compared with 2002, reﬂecting increased
investments in debt securities.
Non-interest income
Non-interest income includes £2m of proﬁt on Treasury’s small
trading book.

The charge for bad and doubtful debts represents a general
provision. No speciﬁc provisions are deemed necessary.

(Note 2) The net interest margin above is calculated, consistent
with previous years, as net interest including net income from
operating lease assets, divided by average interest-earning
assets including operating lease assets.
(Note 3) Excluding net income from operating lease assets and
excluding operating lease assets from average interest-earning
assets, the net interest margin is 1.75% for the year ended 
31 December 2003 (2002: 1.97%), 1.85% for the six months
ended 30 June 2003 and 1.66% for the six months ended 
31 December 2003.
Group net interest income of £764m was £18m lower than 
in 2002, whilst the average total interest-earning assets were
10% higher than the previous year. The sale of our credit card
accounts resulted in a £26m reduction in net interest income.
The net interest margin has fallen by 0.22% from 2.01% to
1.79%, primarily reﬂecting a reduction in interest spread of
0.21% compared to 2002. The fall in interest spread is driven 
by reduced spreads in Retail Banking and the impact of
changing business mix driven by growth in lower margin
treasury assets. We continue to plan for a narrower margin
environment, although we expect the rate of decline to slow.

reﬂecting higher unsecured personal loans income, increased
ATM income through growth in the network, and higher
Commercial Banking income, partly offset by lower income
from long term investment product sales.
The increase in fees and commissions receivable reﬂected the
strong growth in unsecured personal loans and ATM income.
Other operating income included £56m excess from the sale 
of credit card accounts to MBNA (2002: £36m) and, in 2002, 
a £5m one-off beneﬁt from the sale of the branch property.

Total expenses of £787m have fallen by £16m compared 
to 2002, whilst operating expenses of £713m, which exclude 
the planned strategic investment costs and depreciation 
on operating lease assets, have increased by £22m over 
the comparable period. This is primarily due to the full 
year impact of the new cash market business model.
The £713m of operating expenses in 2003 included £54m of
inﬂation related expenses and £69m of volume related expenses
compared to the core cost base in 2000. The remaining core
costs of £590m (£650m in 2000) demonstrates that we have
more than achieved our 2003 target of £50m core cost savings.  Annual Report & Accounts 2003 17
Our strategic investment one-off expenditure was £18m in
2003. These costs included expenditure on the implementation
of our new credit card business model and Wholesale Banking
strategy. In 2004 there will be £8m of one-off strategic
investment expenditure, representing the ﬁnal part of the
programme set out in 2000.
The Group cost:income ratio, excluding depreciation on
operating lease assets, was 55.6% (2002: 58.0%). Excluding
strategic investment costs the Group core cost:income ratio was
54.2% (2002: 54.0%). Including depreciation on operating lease
assets, the Group cost:income ratio was 57.4% (2002: 59.9%),
with a core Group cost:income ratio of 56.1% (2002: 56.1%).

The loss charge for the Group in the second half of 2003 was
£31m, broadly in line with the ﬁrst half of 2003. The reduction
in the Personal Banking loss charge in 2003 reﬂected the sale of
credit card accounts to MBNA. The increase in the residential
mortgage and Treasury & Group loss charges for 2003 reﬂects
our prudent provisioning policy. The Commercial Banking loss
charge increased by £2m, reﬂecting growth in balances.

Speciﬁc 113 132
Total 185 167
(Note 1) Personal Banking comprises unsecured loans, current accounts and credit cards
For residential lending, the ratio of closing provisions to 
gross loans and advances increased slightly from 0.11% 
to 0.13%, reﬂecting our continued prudent provisioning 
policy. In addition to the £32m of residential provisions 
above, the Group has an offshore captive insurance subsidiary
with available funds of £8m, and a further £12m of high
percentage loan fees held on balance sheet. These funds are
deducted from “Loans and advances to customers” in the
Group balance sheet. Together this pool provides £52m (2002:
£51m) of cover within the Group for losses in the residential
mortgage book. Further cover is provided through insurance 
of risk with external insurers. 
The provision for unsecured loans, current accounts and 
credit cards increased marginally from £113m to £115m. This
represents 4.26% (December 2002: 4.81%) of gross balances,
reﬂecting the continuing high quality of these assets.
The Commercial Banking lending book is split between “big
ticket” structured ﬁnance transactions of £1.4bn (December
2002: £1.0bn) and other commercial loans and smaller “ticket”
leases of £2.7bn (December 2002: £2.4bn). The total level of
provisions at 31 December 2003 was £30m (December 2002:
£22m), representing 0.7% (2002: 0.6%) of gross balances. In
addition, there is a further £8m residual value provision against
the carrying value of operating lease assets. The vast majority
of the £1.4bn “big ticket” portfolio is guaranteed by banks.
The provisioning methodology for both residential lending and
unsecured personal loans was reﬁned during the year to align
with industry best practice. Whilst this did not signiﬁcantly
change the overall level of provisioning, there was a switch
between speciﬁc and general provisions as a consequence.
Pensions
The total charge to the Group’s proﬁts in respect of pensions
was £24.6m for 2003. The charge in 2002 was £27.5m, which
included a one-off provision of £5m for pension claims from
part-time employees. Under FRS17, at 31 December 2003 the
net retirement beneﬁts liability was £144m (2002: £223m), 
as explained in Note 38 on page 64.
Taxation
A corporation tax rate of 30% (2002: 30%) has been used in
preparing these results. The tax charge for the year of £145.5m
(2002: £128.0m) represented 27.7% of proﬁt before tax (2002:
27.3%). The Group’s intention is to maintain a tax charge at
around this level, as it continues to carry out its commercial
activities and structure its business in a tax efﬁcient manner. 
In 2002 we stated that the Group was having discussions 
with the Inland Revenue regarding the utilisation of certain 
tax allowances in respect of one speciﬁc transaction undertaken
by its leasing operation in 1997. The discussions have been
concluded in a satisfactory manner and this matter has now
been resolved, with no liability arising.  18 Alliance & Leicester

Dividends
A ﬁnal dividend of 29.6p per share is proposed, giving a 
total dividend of 43.9p for the year, up 10% on 2002. This
compares to basic earnings per share of 79.0p. The directors
have proposed the dividend for 2003 after considering the 
core proﬁts of the business, excluding strategy costs.

Total assets increased by £7.2bn in the year to £48.4bn. Total
loans to customers (including “net investment in ﬁnance leases
and hire purchase contracts” and “operating lease assets”)
increased by £2.9bn to £32.2bn. Cash, treasury assets and
loans and advances to banks increased by £4.4bn to £15.3bn.
The balance sheet growth was funded by an increase of £1.9bn
from customer accounts, £2.8bn increase in debt securities in
issue and £2.3bn increase in deposits by banks.
The growth in cash and treasury assets reﬂects a £0.2bn
increase in cash supplied to third party ATM networks plus 
a £4.2bn growth in assets held within Treasury. This growth
reﬂects prudent building of the medium term investment book
by £1.3bn, without compromising on our high credit quality
standards. The remaining growth was largely due to a strong
inﬂow of short term money market funds in December which
were invested in short term bank deposits.

Risk management and control
As a result of its normal business activities, the Group is
exposed to a variety of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are
operational risk, credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The
following table details the work of the main committees that
have been established within the Group to manage these risks:

Committee risks and and other senior
(ALCO) recommending managers
policy in these
areas to GCPC Market risk
Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income 
or the value of Group net worth arising from movements in
interest rates, exchange rates or other market prices. Market
risk exists to some extent in all the Group’s businesses. The
Group recognises that the effective management of market 
risk is essential to the maintenance of stable earnings and 
the preservation of shareholder value.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is governed by a policy
approved by the GCPC. This policy sets out the nature of risk
which may be taken and aggregate risk limits. Based on these
aggregate limits, the ALCO assigns risk limits to all Group
businesses and monitors compliance with these limits. Each
business has its own market risk policy which is approved by
the ALCO. At each meeting the ALCO reviews reports showing
the Group’s exposure to market and liquidity risks. 
The Group has established a transfer pricing system with the
intention of transferring materially all of the market risks that
arise in the various Group businesses to Group Treasury. Most
of the Group’s market risk is transferred to Group Treasury by
way of appropriate hedging arrangements. Group Treasury
plays a pivotal role in managing the Group’s market risk. Group
Treasury acts as a “Risk Clearing House”, managing these risks
within its own limits, and seeks to take advantage of natural
hedges within the Group’s businesses. 
Market risk is measured and reported using a variety of
techniques, according to the appropriateness of the technique
to the exposure concerned. The techniques used include
interest rate gap analysis, scenario analysis and value at risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the most signiﬁcant market risk to which 
the Group is exposed. This risk mainly arises from mismatches
between the repricing dates of the interest bearing assets 
and liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet, and from the
investment proﬁle of the Group’s reserves and other net 
non-interest bearing liabilities.
Outside of Group Treasury, interest rate risk primarily 
arises in the Group’s mortgage, savings, leasing and personal
loan businesses. The exposure in these portfolios is hedged
with Group Treasury using interest rate swaps and other
appropriate instruments.
Net non-interest bearing liabilities comprise mainly interest-free
personal and corporate current accounts and shareholders’
funds, and totalled £4.3bn at 31 December 2003 (2002:
£4.2bn). Wherever it decides to invest these funds, the Group
is exposed to market risk – if the funds are invested short term
net interest income will be very volatile but the market value 
of the assets will be relatively stable, whilst investing the funds
longer term will achieve more stability in net interest income
but at the expense of greater volatility in the market value 
of the assets. In balancing these two extremes the Group’s
objective is to minimise volatility in net interest income over
the medium term. 
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 19
Operational risk
Operational risk is deﬁned as “the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems 
or from external events”. All of the Group’s activities give 
rise to the potential for operational loss events.
The Group monitors its operational risks through a variety 
of techniques. These include the six-monthly Group Internal
Control Policy certiﬁcation by senior management undertaken
across all the Group’s business areas, which includes an
operational risk self-assessment schedule, and the presentation
to the Group Board of a monthly dashboard assessing the
extent of each of the Group’s operational risks.
Operational risk is managed through a combination of 
internal controls, processes and procedures and various risk
mitigation techniques, including insurance and business
continuity planning.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss where counterparties are
not able to meet their obligations as they fall due. The Group 
is ﬁrmly committed to the management of this risk in both its
retail and wholesale lending activities.
The Group employs sophisticated credit scoring, behavioural
scoring, underwriting and fraud detection techniques to
support sound decision making and minimise losses in its
lending activities. Behavioural scoring also operates within 
the personal account management and collections processes. 
A proactive approach to the control of bad and doubtful debts
is maintained within the collections areas. 
Experienced credit and risk teams operate within the Group,
and are driven both by the recognised need to manage the
potential and actual risks, but also by the need to continually
develop new processes to ensure sound decisions into the
future. In this way, any variations in risk from market, economic
or competitive changes are identiﬁed and the appropriate
controls developed and put in place. 
Comprehensive management information on movement 
and performance within the various personal and wholesale
portfolios ensure that credit risk is effectively controlled and
trends identiﬁed prior to any potential impact on performance.
Group performance is also measured against the industry,
where appropriate, to ensure debt default levels remain below
that of the industry average. This management information 
is distributed widely across the Group and monitored within
tight boundaries at Board and credit policy committees. 
Policy statements covering, amongst other things, criteria to be
used in considering limits on counterparties and countries, are
reviewed at least annually by the GCPC. Authorised limits on a
counterparty are determined following rigorous analysis, giving
due consideration to both internal and external credit ratings.  Derivatives
A derivative is an off balance sheet agreement which deﬁnes
certain ﬁnancial rights and obligations which are contractually
linked to interest rates, exchange rates or other market 
prices. Derivatives are an efﬁcient and cost effective means of
managing market risk and limiting counterparty exposures and
are an indispensable tool in treasury management. Derivatives
are primarily used by the Group for balance sheet management
purposes. However the bank also runs trading book positions in
derivatives; details of the level of interest rate risk in the trading
book are contained in Note 41 on page 68.
Types of derivatives and uses
The principal derivatives used in balance sheet risk
management are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements
(FRAs), futures, interest rate options and foreign exchange
contracts which are used to hedge balance sheet exposures
arising from ﬁxed and capped rate mortgage lending, personal
loans, leasing arrangements, funding and investment activities
and foreign exchange services to customers.
The following table describes the signiﬁcant activities
undertaken by the Group, the related risks associated with 
such activities, and the types of derivatives which are typically
used in managing such risks. These risks may alternatively be
managed using on balance sheet instruments or natural hedges
that exist in the Group balance sheet.

Control of derivatives
With the exception of credit exposures, which are managed
within policies approved by the GCPC, all limits over the use 
of derivatives are the responsibility of the ALCO.
All exchange traded instruments are subject to cash requirements
under the standard margin arrangements applied by the
individual exchanges, and are not subject to signiﬁcant credit risk.
Other derivatives contracts are on an “Over the Counter” basis
with OECD ﬁnancial institutions. The exposures arising from these
contracts are shown in Note 41 to the Accounts on page 69.

These funds, particularly current account balances, are
constantly changing and it is therefore necessary to establish 
a view of the core balance and to keep this under review on 
a regular basis. This responsibility rests with the ALCO. At

Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s policy is not to run material, speculative foreign
exchange positions.
The Group offers foreign exchange services to customers
through both Group Treasury and Alliance & Leicester
Commercial Bank, and detailed limits and controls are
established within those businesses to control the exposure.
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank clears its positions with
Group Treasury in accordance with the policy of transferring
market risk positions to Group Treasury wherever possible.
As part of its normal operations Group Treasury raises and
invests funds in currencies other than Sterling. The foreign
exchange risks of these activities are hedged within Group
Treasury’s limits.
Equity risk
The Group markets equity related products to its customers,
including guaranteed stock market bonds. The Group’s policy is
to have no material exposure to equity markets. The exposures
arising from the Group’s products are eliminated as far as is
practicable by appropriate hedging contracts.
Liquidity risk
It is Group policy to ensure that sufﬁcient liquid assets are at all
times available to meet the Group’s obligations, including the
withdrawal of customer deposits, the draw-down of customer
facilities and growth in the balance sheet. The development
and implementation of policy is the responsibility of the ALCO.
The day-to-day management of liquidity is the responsibility of
Group Treasury, which provides funding to and takes surplus
funds from each of the Group’s businesses as required.
Liquidity policy is approved by the GCPC and agreed with 
the Financial Services Authority. Limits on potential cash ﬂow
mismatches over deﬁned time horizons are the principal 
basis of liquidity control. The size of the Group’s holdings 
of readily realisable liquid assets is primarily driven by such
potential outﬂows. Directors’ Interests in Shares
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company and options
to acquire shares are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on pages 28 to 34.

Authority to Purchase Shares
During the year 24.6m shares of 50 pence each, representing a
nominal value of £12.3m, were repurchased and cancelled,
representing 5.33% of the Company’s issued capital as at
31 December 2003. The aggregate consideration (including
stamp duty) paid for the shares was £215.1m. The purpose of the
share buyback programme was to reduce the tier 1 capital ratio
to within our target range of 7.0%-7.5% by the end of 2003.
Capital efﬁciency remains a key ﬁnancial objective and
shareholder authority will again be sought, at the Annual
General Meeting, for the Company to purchase in the market
up to 46.2 million of its shares, representing some 10% of the
issued share capital, in order to retain ﬂexibility in managing
the Company’s capital requirements.
Auditors
On 1 August 2003, Deloitte & Touche, the Company’s auditors
transferred their business to Deloitte & Touche LLP, a limited
liability partnership incorporated under the Limited Liability
Partnerships Act 2000. The Company’s consent has been given
to treating the appointment of Deloitte & Touche as extending
to Deloitte & Touche LLP, with effect from 1 August 2003, under
the provisions of section 26(5) of the Companies Act 1989.
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
Company’s auditors and authorise the Group Audit & Risk
Committee to determine their remuneration will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting.

The following report contains extracts
taken from our 2003 Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) Report which is
published on the Group’s CSR website
(www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk).
In 2002 we set out our commitment 
to CSR activities. During 2003 we 
have continued to develop and 
promote our CSR activities and have
made signiﬁcant progress in gaining
industry recognition, including winning
Mortgage Finance Gazette’s “Community
Services Award – National”, recognising
our work in the voluntary sector, and 
the Institute of Financial Services award
for “Most impressive Community 
Service Programme”.
We have continued to structure our 
CSR report along the guidelines set out
by the Financial Organisations Reporting
Guidelines (FORGE) working group, and
we have also followed the Business in the
Community (BITC) recommendations on
indicators, in terms of the data disclosed
in the full report.
Our Marketplace
Access to products and services 
Our distribution network includes 300
branches, telephone and postal banking,
and the internet. Our personal current
account customers and our corporate
customers are also able to use the 17,000
Post Ofﬁces across the UK to deposit and
withdraw cash.
We know that some of our customers
have additional needs. For customers
who are deaf, hard of hearing or have
speech impairments, a fully qualiﬁed 
sign language interpreter is available 
on request. Customers can also use 
a Typetalk operator, a national 
telephone relay system allowing 
them to communicate with us via 
our standard telephone system.
For customers with visual impairments
we make our documents easier to 
read by printing brochures, letters 
and statements in larger print, or
providing them in an audio or 
Braille format. 
Our new and refurbished branches are 
all being designed, wherever possible, 
to make them more convenient and
accessible for customers with additional
needs. Over the past year we have
invested over £1.3m in providing
accessible services for customers 
who have additional needs.
Business ethics
Our Statement of Business Principles
includes a number of items that
encapsulate the Group’s business 
ethics, and have been endorsed by 
the Board and communicated to our
employees. All of our core policies are
regularly reviewed by the directors, 
and our Group Audit & Risk Committee 
has responsibility for reviewing and
approving them. Our Statement of
Business Principles can be found in the
policies section on the Group’s CSR web-
site – www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk.
Privacy
The Group complies with the Data
Protection Act and has stringent policies
on the protection of customer privacy,
conforming to standards set by the
voluntary banking codes and legislation. 
Our research has shown that customers
rank “privacy” as one of their major
issues when dealing with their bank.
Reﬂecting this, we regularly monitor 
how our customers rate the privacy 
they receive when dealing with 
Alliance & Leicester, and their responses
feed directly into our formal monitoring
of our customer service performance. 
Terms of trade
Our products are primarily aimed at 
UK-based customers, and all of our
operations are based in the British Isles.
In this context, Terms of Trade issues 
are not signiﬁcant for the Group.
Creditor payment policy
The Group is a signatory of the DTI’s
Better Payment Practice Code.
Information regarding this code and its
purpose can be obtained from the Better
Payment Practice Group’s website at
www.payontime.co.uk.
It is Group policy to:
agree the terms of payment at the
start of business with that supplier;
ensure suppliers are aware of the
payment terms;
24 Alliance & Leicester
Corporate Social Responsibility Report
pay in accordance with any contractual
and other legal obligations.
Trade creditors of the Company for the
year ended 31 December 2003 were 29
days (2002: 28 days), based on the ratio
of Company trade creditors at the end of
the year to the amounts invoiced during
the year by trade creditors.
Responsible lending 
Alliance & Leicester is a responsible
lender. We are committed to helping
our customers understand the products
they are buying, and to assessing
whether they can afford to repay any
money that they borrow from us. Our
brand values of being “simple and
straightforward” to deal with and “friendly
and approachable”, align us with our
regulator’s objective of improving the
clarity of financial information and its
understanding by customers. 
Our mortgage and personal lending 
sales and application processes comply
with all industry codes of practice. All
applications are credit scored, a well-
proven method of determining an
individual’s likelihood to default on a
loan. Credit scoring takes into account
the customer’s details as submitted in 
the application form, as well as an
independent view of the customer’s
payment behaviour from credit 
reference agencies. In addition, all
applications must pass an affordability
test, which takes into account a number
of speciﬁc elements of a person’s
outgoings, including the servicing 
costs of the customer’s outstanding 
loans and mortgages.
Mortgage payments can be subject to
volatility caused by changes in interest
rates, and by the impact of short term
discounts coming to an end. Reﬂecting
this, we further protect our mortgage
customers, by assessing what the
monthly mortgage loan repayment
would be at higher than prevailing
interest rates. As part of the affordability
process, we check all mortgage
applicants’ income via payslips.
We have a high quality loan book which,
as a result of our responsible approach
and rigorous underwriting processes, 
has a lower level of arrears than the
industry average. Annual Report & Accounts 2003 25
Our Workplace
Responsibility for all employee related
matters, including health and safety, 
rests with the Group’s Human Resources
Director, who reports to the Group 
Chief Executive.
Investors in People 
In 2000 we committed to achieving the
Investors in People (IiP) standard. IiP is 
a nationally recognised, independently
assessed standard, encouraging
organisations to train and develop all
their people. Using IiP as a benchmark
has helped us to focus the training and
development of all employees around 
the delivery of our strategy. 
Since 2000 we have successfully 
achieved accreditation in many areas 
of the business, and in December 2003
were pleased to achieve accreditation 
at Group level. The most recent report
from IiP says, “In summary, Alliance &
Leicester is an impressive organisation
with a genuine and continuing
commitment to developing its people.” 
Learning and development
Alliance & Leicester places a high priority
on the training and development of our
employees. During 2003 we spent 
over £6m to support improved staff
performance. This equates to an average
spend per employee of £690. On
average, staff will complete 6 days of
development per year, 4 days workshop
based, the remainder “on the job”. 
During 2002 or 2003, almost all of our
employees attended a “Valuing Individual
People” workshop. This training course
was aimed at enhancing customer service
and meeting the Group’s strategic goals. 
Public interest disclosures
Individual employees may be the ﬁrst 
to realise that there may be something
seriously wrong within a business. 
We are committed to ensuring that 
any suspicion of malpractice is reported,
and therefore encourage all employees
to raise any genuine concerns about
potential malpractice at the earliest
practicable stage. The Group treats 
all such concerns seriously. All staff
initially report any concerns, in
conﬁdence, to the Group’s Head 
of Group Compliance and Money
Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer.
Disciplinary policy
Alliance & Leicester has a formal
disciplinary policy. The aim of the policy
is to be corrective rather than punitive,
and it is in line with the ACAS Code of
Practice on discipline at work. It sets
reasonable standards of performance 
and behaviour, and aims to ensure
consistency and fairness of treatment 
of all employees when these standards
are not met. 
Health and safety 
As a responsible employer we are
committed to ensuring that none 
of our people are exposed to an
unacceptable risk to their health 
or safety. Although financial sector
employment is generally regarded 
as low risk, every occupation involves 
its own hazards with the potential 
for injury, damage or loss. 
It is our policy to provide a safe and
healthy working environment for our
staff, our customers and our contractors.
We believe a safe and healthy working
environment is a positive business
investment, and we will seek to achieve
health and safety excellence through
statutory compliance.
Diversity and equal opportunities
We are committed to equality 
of opportunity and recognise the
importance of this in building a strong
and competitive business. We will not
condone discrimination on the grounds
of sex, race or national origin, colour,
religious belief, disability (mental or
physical), marital status, age or sexual
orientation. We believe that all staff
should be treated with the same respect
and dignity, and will continually strive 
to provide employees with a working
environment which is free from
discrimination. Our Equal Opportunities
policy commits us to removing barriers
which would prevent the employment
of disabled people, and to implementing
all reasonable measures to ensure
disabled staff can effectively carry
out their jobs.
Freedom of association/ 
collective bargaining
The Group recognises the
Communications Workers Union (CWU),
Alliance & Leicester Group Union of Staff
(ALGUS), and the Public and Commercial
Services Union (PCS) for collective
bargaining purposes. We enjoy good
relations with these recognised unions
and endeavour to involve their
representatives at all levels. 
Our Community
Our Director of Corporate
Communications, who reports 
directly to the Group Chief Executive, 
is responsible for community affairs. 
We aim to build close ties with the
communities in which we operate across
the UK, particularly those from which 
we draw a large number of employees,
customers and shareholders. This year we
have continued to support and involve
employees in community related projects
that contribute toward staff development
needs and provide measurable beneﬁt 
to the community. Our volunteering
programme positively encourages links
with “partner” organisations, and
facilitates a co-ordinated response 
by employees and outside partners. 
Alliance & Leicester is an active 
member of Business in the Community’s
“Cares” initiative, which aims to increase
the quality and quantity of employee
volunteering across the UK. Our two
main centres of operation, in Leicester
and Bootle, Merseyside are each a
particular focus of activity. We also 
have volunteering activities organised 
by staff in our Manchester, Ashford and
Leeds centres. Group employees are
participating in both Leicestershire Cares
and Liverpool Cares initiatives, with a
particular emphasis on education. To 
this end we have recruited over 150
volunteers from our Leicester, Liverpool,
Leeds and Manchester operations to
participate in the Right To Read scheme,
which aims to improve literacy standards
by using volunteers to listen to primary
school children read.
Donations and community investment
We have signiﬁcantly increased our
investment in our local communities.
During 2003, Alliance & Leicester made
donations for charitable purposes
amounting to £662,000, an 18%
increase compared to 2002. This
included £150,000 donated by the
Group to the NSPCC as a result of 
our account-opening promotion run 
in December 2002 and January 2003.  In addition to these donations, our
corporate community investment
programme has given support to a large
number of organisations nationally and
locally. During 2003 we invested over
£330,000 in local community events and
programmes, including the TAG rugby
programme with Leicester Tigers, and
sponsorship of the Liverpool City Council
ﬁrework display and Diwali celebrations
in Leicester. In addition to this we also
sponsor Leicester City Football Club, 
the Premiership football club local to 
our head ofﬁce.
As mentioned earlier in this report, 
over the past year we have invested 
over £1.3m in providing accessible
services for customers who have
additional needs.
Our staff play a key role in our
relationships with our local communities,
and this has been acknowledged with
the setting up of annual Volunteer 
of the Year and Charity of the Year 
awards within the Group. Management
secondments, organising fund raising
events, the development of our
community programmes, and the 
use of ofﬁce space, amounted to an
estimated cost of £120,000 in 2003. 
We also support staff wishing to give
donations to charities through payroll
giving, as well as running a matched
donation scheme, which matches funds
raised for charities by our staff.
Our Environment
Environmental risk is part of our overall
risk framework, which is managed by 
the Group Audit & Risk Committee. The
Group’s environmental policy, which is
applied consistently across the whole
Group, is the responsibility of the
Managing Director, Wholesale Banking,
an executive director and member of 
the Board, who is also responsible for 
the Group’s Supply Chain Management
department. The policy is implemented
by our Group Energy Manager, who is 
a senior manager within the Group’s
Supply Chain Management department.
We recognise that the Group has 
a responsibility to act in a way that
respects the environment. Environmental
best practice, wherever reasonably
practicable, is incorporated into our
decision making processes. The Group
invests in environmentally friendly and
sustainable products and services where
it is practical to do so.
Alliance & Leicester’s main environmental
impacts are through the buildings we
operate, and the resources used by our
staff in their day-to-day work. The
Group’s environmental activity is
therefore focused on the key areas of
energy and water, transport, waste and
pollution, and the working environment.
Our indirect impact on the environment
is primarily through the Group’s lending
activities. Over three-quarters of the
Group’s loans and advances are to
customers for the financing of their
principal residential UK home. The 
Group has a relatively small commercial
lending business. The commercial
lending risk assessment process includes,
where appropriate, a review of the
environmental risk associated with 
each transaction.
We are committed to controlling our
environmental impact from the use of
energy. We achieved re-accreditation
status for a further 3 years from the
Institute of Energy and the National
Energy Foundation at the end of 2002.
The Energy Efﬁciency Accreditation
Scheme is the UK’s only independent
award, recognising achievements 
in reducing energy use by leading
organisations in industry, commerce 
and the public sector. 
During the ﬁrst half of 2004 we are
committed to developing, documenting
and implementing an Environmental
Management System (EMS). This project
is a key objective for the Group’s Energy
Manager in 2004. The EMS will focus 
on the Group’s energy (gas, electricity),
water, waste and business travel usage.
In developing the system the Group’s
environmental objectives and targets will
be thoroughly reviewed and updated.

It is committed to principles of accountability and transparency 
to ensure that remuneration arrangements demonstrate a clear 
link between reward and performance. In its work, the Committee
considers fully the principles and provisions of the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance.
Membership 
The Committee comprises the following non-executive directors:
Mr M P S Barton
(Committee Chairman and senior independent non-executive director)
Mr M J Allen
The Hon D Brougham 
Miss F A Cairncross
Mr R M McTighe
Mr E J Watts 
Mr J R Windeler resigned from the Committee on 25 September 2003. 
Mr R M McTighe and Mr E J Watts were appointed members of the
Committee on 30 October 2003. All other members of the Committee
served throughout 2003.
The Company Secretary, Mr J Hepplewhite, acted as secretary to the
Committee throughout 2003, and provided professional assistance 
to the Committee on governance issues. Mr T S Lloyd replaced 
Mr Hepplewhite on his retirement on 31 December 2003.
Meetings
The directors’ attendance at Committee meetings held during their
period of membership and the number of meetings held during 2003
is set out on page 38. The Chairman, Mr J R Windeler and the Group
Chief Executive, Mr R A Pym are invited to attend the Committee
meetings, except when the Committee discusses matters relating 
to their remuneration. 
Advisers
The Committee used the services of both Towers Perrin and Watson
Wyatt during the year, to provide general remuneration advice and
comparator information, and Mercer Human Resource Consulting
(“Mercer”) to advise speciﬁcally on pension related issues. Deloitte &
Touche LLP, the Company’s external auditor, was appointed by the
Company, during the year, with the agreement of the Committee, 
to provide specialist advice on the Group’s Share Schemes. Freshﬁelds,
Solicitors, provided advice on Directors’ service agreements. Mercer
also act as actuaries and advisers to the Group’s pension scheme 
and advise the Company on matters relating to its operation. 
The Committee consults with the Chairman and the Group Chief
Executive as appropriate, and is also supported by the Director of
Human Resources. 
Remuneration Policy
The broad policy of the Group Board and the Committee remains to
set remuneration so as to attract and retain high calibre executives and
to encourage and reward superior business performance. Remuneration
for executive directors is intended to reward both individual and
company performance, measured against performance criteria that are
relevant and realistic but also challenging, so that good performance 
is encouraged. Therefore, remuneration arrangements will continue to
focus on incentive plans that encourage delivery of operating plans as
well as shareholder value, rather than just annual salary. 
Also, under Committee guidelines, each executive director is required
to build up over a period of ﬁve years and retain, whilst a director, a
minimum holding of shares in the Company equivalent to his annual
basic salary.
For 2004 and beyond, annual salary will continue to be set at levels 
not normally exceeding market median, to remain competitive in the
market place, whilst bonuses and long term incentive plans will reﬂect
market upper quartile competitive levels and be based on delivery of
targets and Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). 
Performance Graph
The performance graph below shows the Company’s performance 
in comparison with the FTSE 100 Index over the ﬁve years ended 
31 December 2003. The FTSE Index was chosen as it is a broad equity
market index consisting of companies of similar complexity and size 
to the Company.
TSR Performance: 
Alliance & Leicester v FTSE 100, 01.01.1999 – 31.12.2003
Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main components of the remuneration package for executive
directors are:
Basic Salary
Basic salary for executive directors takes into account the role,
responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual. This is
normally reviewed annually unless responsibilities change. Salary levels
are set against background information from independent advisers on
salary levels for similar positions amongst a speciﬁc comparator group
of ﬁnancial organisations and with due regard to general salary trends
within companies in the FTSE 100 Index. The current comparator
group comprises:
Abbey National plc Aviva plc 
Barclays Bank plc Bradford & Bingley plc
Britannic Assurance plc Friends Provident plc
HBOS plc HSBC Holdings plc
Legal & General plc Lloyds TSB Group plc
Northern Rock plc Prudential plc
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Standard Chartered plc
As at 31 December 2003, the comparator group included Egg plc 
and Zurich Financial Services instead of Standard Chartered plc and
Northern Rock plc.
Annual Bonus
At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors are eligible 
to receive an annual performance bonus.

 Alliance & Leicester plc
 FTSE 100 Bonuses are contingent on achievement of one-year performance targets
set annually by the Committee. These comprise a mix of corporate targets
(revenue growth, cost reduction, pre-tax proﬁt and growth in earnings
per share (“EPS”)) and individual personal performance targets. The level
of bonus for on-target performance for 2003 and beyond is 60% of salary,
with a maximum of 200% of salary for exceptional performance (amounts
over 100% of salary are taken in the form of deferred shares under the
Deferred Bonus Scheme (see below), but without any matching element).
Bonuses are discretionary and are non-pensionable. 
In order to encourage executive directors to build up a signiﬁcant
personal stake in the Company, they may be required to receive 
one-quarter of their annual bonus in the form of a deferred shares
option award which the Company will match if related performance
criteria are achieved (see below under Long Term Incentive Schemes).
Executive directors are able to voluntarily defer up to 100% of their
annual bonus (to a maximum of 100% of salary) for this purpose. 
This also acts as a retention tool and ensures executive directors share 
a signiﬁcant level of personal risk with the Company’s shareholders. 
The rights to deferred shares cannot normally be exercised for three
years and lapse if not exercised within seven years. If a director leaves
before the third anniversary of the grant, the Trustees to the Scheme
may exercise their discretion in allowing the options over deferred
shares to be exercised. Deferred shares are not awarded within two
years of an individual’s 60th birthday.
There are share schemes for executive directors designed to align the
interests of executive directors with those of shareholders:
Share Options
Each executive director is eligible for the grant of options under the
Alliance & Leicester Approved and Unapproved Company Share Option
Schemes. The price at which shares can be acquired on exercise of
options is the market value of the shares on the day prior to the date 
of grant. Accordingly, the share price has to rise above the price at
which the option is granted before an executive director can beneﬁt. 
The aggregate value of new shares, for which options to subscribe 
may be granted to each executive director in any year, cannot normally
exceed a maximum total annual award of two times basic salary, with 
a power for the Committee to increase this up to four times basic salary
if it considers that this is warranted in exceptional circumstances. 
The value of share option grants has typically been valued at up to 
one and a half times basic salary (two times for new appointments), 
with the grants being made in two tranches following the ﬁnal and
interim results. Options cannot normally be exercised for three years
from the date of grant. The performance condition applied to grants 
is that options are exercisable if the percentage growth in EPS exceeds
the increase in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) by at least 9% over a three
year period (grants, prior to 2002, have used a percentage between
6% and 9%). The Committee reviews this condition before each new
grant paying due regard to market practice. The Committee considers
this performance condition to be suitable and appropriate as a means
of focusing executive directors on generating earnings growth and
accords with market practice. No options are awarded within two 
years of an individual’s 60th birthday. 
Options normally vest after three years, subject to attainment of the
relevant performance conditions. Provisions exist for the re-testing of
performance after years four and ﬁve, calculated from the base grant
year and based on EPS growth of RPI +12% (year 4) or RPI +15% 
(year 5). Options granted prior to 2002 are subject to performance
conditions that may be measured over any three year period. 
Under the rules of the share option schemes, options are exercisable
prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant where an option
holder ceases to be employed by the Company by reason of death,
injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement or transfer of the
employing company outside the Group, or at the discretion of the
Committee in any other circumstances. Also, in these circumstances,
any performance conditions attaching to the exercise of the options
cease to apply.
Long Term Incentive Scheme
Deferred Bonus Scheme
Under the Alliance & Leicester Deferred Bonus Scheme, the Company
may match an award of deferred shares on the basis of up to three
matched shares for each deferred share awarded. The maximum
matched award is given for upper quartile performance in terms of
Total Shareholder Return measured relative to a peer group of Retail
Banks. Total Shareholder Return measures the change in value of a
share and reinvested income over the period of measurement. The
current constituents of the peer group, excluding the Company, are:
Abbey National plc Barclays Bank plc
Bradford & Bingley plc HBOS plc
Lloyds TSB Group plc Northern Rock plc
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc
These banks have been chosen because they are all in the ﬁnancial
services sector and are broadly comparable in the range of activities
undertaken. Awards only begin to vest when median performance
relative to the peer group is achieved, with linear progression from 
one matching share at median performance up to three matching
shares for upper quartile performance. The rights to matching shares
cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised
within seven years. Total Shareholder Return is considered by the
Committee to be a suitable measure for this type of scheme, as it
provides clear links with the creation of shareholder value. Further
details are set out on page 34.
Under the Deferred Bonus Scheme options may be exercised prior 
to the third anniversary of the date of grant where the executive
director ceases to be employed by reason of death, injury, ill-health,
disability, retirement or at the discretion of the Trustees to the Scheme
based on the recommendations by the Committee in any other
circumstances. Performance conditions apply unless waived by the
Committee and are normally subject to a three-year performance
period, without re-testing. 
Employee Share Schemes
Executive directors may also participate in the Company’s existing
Employee Share Schemes, including the Savings Related Share Option
Scheme and the Company’s Share Incentive Plan, on the same basis as
all other employees. There are no performance conditions attached to
these schemes.
Pensions
Executive directors are members of the Deﬁned Beneﬁt Section of the
Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme which has a normal retirement
age of 60. 
The main features of the pension promise for executive directors based
on the standard terms of the Scheme, are:
(a) Pensions from age 60 of 1/60th of basic salary averaged over 
the last twelve months prior to retirement for each year of
pensionable service.
(b) A cash beneﬁt on death in service of 4x annual rate of basic salary
at date of death.
(c) Pensions payable in the event of ill-health.
(d) Pensions for dependants on a member’s death are generally 
equal to half the member’s prospective retirement pension at 
60 on death in service, or half the member’s pension entitlement 
on death in retirement.
Member contributions are 5% of basic salary.
The following directors have special arrangements:
(a) Mr Pym and Mr Bennett are entitled to a pension of 2/3rd of 
their ﬁnal pensionable salary on retirement at age 60 inclusive 
of retirement beneﬁts from service at other organisations.
(b) Mr Pym is not required to contribute. Mr Bennett contributes 15%
of the Earnings Cap. 
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 29 30 Alliance & Leicester
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
For the Year Ended 31 December 2003
There is an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement to increase 
the pension and lump sum life assurance beneﬁt to the level promised,
where, because of Inland Revenue limitations (including those resulting
from the Earnings Cap), these cannot be paid in total from the Scheme.
Such arrangements apply to Mr Pym and Mr Bennett.
On retirement from service an executive director may, with the consent
of the employer, draw his accrued pension from the Alliance & Leicester
Pension Scheme at any time after his 50th birthday (subject to a
reduction of 3% for each year by which retirement precedes his 
60th birthday). 
Pensions in payment are subject to contractual increases each April 
in line with the annual percentage rise in the RPI over the previous
calendar year, subject to a maximum of 5%.
It is conﬁrmed that there are no discretionary practices which are 
taken into account in calculating transfer values on leaving service.
Other Benefits
Executive directors are eligible for a range of beneﬁts which include 
the provision of a company car, payment of car operating expenses
including fuel, concessionary mortgage facilities, life assurance and
membership of a private medical insurance scheme.
Other Directorships
The Group is supportive of executive directors who wish to take one
non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company in order to
broaden their experience. They are entitled to retain any fees they may
receive. During the year, Mr R A Pym held a non-executive directorship
with Selfridges plc, until his resignation on 29 August 2003. His fees for
the period were £22,917. 
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive directors is
determined by the Board as a whole in the light of recommendations
by the Group Chief Executive and within the limits speciﬁed in the
Articles of Association of the Company. 
Mr Windeler was Executive Chairman until 1 June 2002. His contract 
of employment, which expired on his 60th birthday in March 2003,
entitled him to a company car, non-exclusive use of a chauffeured 
car for business purposes, life assurance and membership of a private
medical insurance scheme. 
He was also a member of the Deﬁned Beneﬁt Section of the 
Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme, with a normal retirement age of
60, and he contributed 5% of the Earnings Cap (the unfunded pension
arrangements referred to earlier in this report applied to him also up 
to his 60th birthday). This pension is not currently being drawn.
Since March 2003 he has continued as a non-executive director 
on a similar basis of appointment to that applicable to the other 
non-executive directors, save that he continues to enjoy the beneﬁt 
of non-exclusive use of a chauffeured car for business purposes. Whilst
an executive director, he participated in the Long Term Incentive
Schemes speciﬁed earlier in the report. 
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build up their shareholding
to 5,000 shares. No options have been, or will be, granted to any 
non-executive director in their capacity as a non-executive director 
of the Company.
Non-executive directors who are in full-time employment with a 
third party employer may elect to pay the whole or part of their fees 
to it. Payments in respect of Mr Stone’s fees are made to his service
company, and in respect of Mrs J V Barker (who was appointed as a
non-executive director on 1 January 2004) are made to her employer. 
Service Contracts
No non-executive director has an employment contract with the
Company. Mr J R Windeler’s employment contract ceased in March
2003. On joining the Board, non-executive directors are issued with 
an appointment letter. 
New non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of two
years, which may be renewed for one or more terms of two years. An
example of a non-executive director’s letter of appointment can be
found on the Group’s web site www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk
There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early
termination of an appointment. The non-executive directors are not
eligible for share options.

Executive directors have service contracts that continue until terminated
by twelve months’ notice (but which in any event terminate on their
60th birthday). 
During the year the executive directors agreed to a revision of the
terms relating to termination, without payment of any compensation.
The new contractual provisions state that, if the employment of an
executive director is terminated by the Company for any reason (other
than due cause) without twelve months’ notice being given, the
director is entitled to receive payment of twelve months’ basic salary,
an amount equal to the value of a cash bonus, having regard to the
director’s performance for the period worked, as the Committee, in its
discretion, reasonably and fairly determines, and pension beneﬁts. In
addition, life assurance and medical insurance cover will be maintained
for twelve months from the termination date. No such payments of
salary and pension beneﬁts, on termination by the Company, will
exceed a payment based on the number of months from the date 
of termination of employment to the executive director’s normal
retirement date. 
The executive directors may terminate their contracts of employment 
at any time by giving six months’ prior notice.
The new contracts were signed by all executive directors on 
18 December 2003. Annual Report & Accounts 2003 31

On behalf of the Board
M P S Barton
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
19 February 2004 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 35
Statement of Corporate Governance
Principles of Corporate Governance
The Board recognises the value of good corporate governance not 
only in the areas of accountability and risk management but also as a
positive contribution to business prosperity. It believes that corporate
governance involves applying the principles, as set out in the Principles
of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice (“the Combined Code”)
issued by the London Stock Exchange in June 1998, in a sensible and
pragmatic fashion, having regard to the individual circumstances of 
the Group’s business. The key objective is to enhance and protect
shareholder value. 
The Board notes the publication in July 2003 of the revised Combined
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council, which applies to listed
companies for periods commencing on or after 1 November 2003
(“the revised Combined Code”). The Group will report formally on its
compliance with the revised Combined Code, as required under the
Listing Rules, next year. However, the Board has reviewed the main and
supporting principles and provisions set out in the revised Combined
Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting
Council in July 2003, and is satisﬁed that it complies with those
provisions in all material respects.
Board Structure
The Board comprises nine non-executive directors and four executive
directors who have the collective responsibility for ensuring that the
affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries are managed competently
and with integrity.
The Chairman is Mr J R Windeler. The senior independent non-
executive director is the Deputy Chairman, Mr M P S Barton, and 
Mr R A Pym is Group Chief Executive. The names of the directors in
ofﬁce at the date of this report and their biographical details are set 
out on pages 22 and 23. 
The revised Combined Code determines that the Chairman ceases 
to be independent when appointed. 
The Board considers that all the non-executive directors are
independent in character and judgement, and within the deﬁnition 
of this term in the revised Combined Code. This includes the Board’s
longest serving director, Miss F A Cairncross, who joined the Board of
Alliance & Leicester Building Society in January 1992, although she has
served on the Board of Alliance & Leicester plc for less than 9 years,
being appointed in October 1996.
The Chairman regularly holds meetings with the non-executive
directors without the executives present.
As well as providing “challenge” to the executive directors, the non-
executive directors play a full part as members of the Board “team”.
They bring a diversity of business perspective and objectivity which
complements the “hands on” expertise of their executive director
colleagues. All members of the Board share responsibility for 
Board decisions. 
The composition of the Board is kept under review, with the aim of
ensuring that there is an appropriate balance of power and authority
between executive and non-executive directors, and that the directors
collectively possess the necessary skills and experience for properly
directing the Group’s business activities. 
Newly appointed directors submit themselves for election by
shareholders at the ﬁrst General Meeting after their appointment and 
at least every three years thereafter. They receive induction training
upon appointment and are required to make regular visits to the
Company’s operational locations. The appointment of non-executive
directors is documented in a letter, the standard terms of which are
available from the Group website at www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk.
Evaluation of Board Performance
The Board is appraised annually, as are individual directors and 
Board committees.
The Chairman is responsible for appraising the performance of the Group
Chief Executive against objective criteria agreed by the Remuneration
Committee prior to the commencement of any appraisal period. The
Chairman presents the results of his appraisal to the Remuneration
Committee for consideration and determination of remuneration. 
The Group Chief Executive is responsible for appraising the performance
of the other executive directors individually, against objective criteria
agreed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the commencement
of any appraisal period. The Group Chief Executive presents the results
of these appraisals to the Remuneration Committee for consideration
and determination of remuneration.
All Board directors are required to complete a detailed questionnaire 
on the performance of the Board, to seek to identify any areas in which
improvements might be made to the information provided to the
Board or the conduct of its proceedings generally. The evaluation 
takes the form of a series of speciﬁc questions within general subject
headings, and directors are required to score performance according 
to a scale. The Board subsequently discusses the collated results of 
the evaluation and any agreed improvements are implemented. The
members of Board Committees undertake a similar annual evaluation
and report their ﬁndings and recommendations to the Board.
The non-executive directors meet at least once a year under the
guidance of the senior independent non-executive director, to review
the performance of the Chairman.
Operation of the Board
The Board approves and closely monitors the Alliance & Leicester Group’s
strategic direction and business strategy. There is a formal schedule 
of matters speciﬁcally reserved to the Board, including the setting of
corporate objectives, major capital expenditure, annual budgets and
signiﬁcant changes to the Group’s structure and product range.
The Group Chief Executive is empowered to approve any matter not
reserved to the Group Board within agreed ﬁnancial limits, and in turn
delegates the operational and ﬁnancial management of the business 
to the executive directors to achieve agreed budgets and objectives.
The Board receives regular management performance and internal
control reports and operates a system of Board reviews of individual
business units and their performance against key targets and objectives.
Details of the number of Board and Committee meetings and the
attendance at those meetings is set out on page 38. 
Procedures are in place which allow directors to take independent
professional advice in the course of their duties and all directors have
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
The Board has established several Committees with speciﬁed terms of
reference to assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities. The
terms of reference for each of the Committees are available from the
Group website at www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprising non-executive directors has 
the task of:
• evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience required
on the Board and the structure, size and composition of the Board
and its Committees;
• recommending new appointments to the Board and reviewing 
reappointments when they become due;
• annually reviewing the performance of and the time required from
the non-executive directors and Board Committees;
• overseeing succession planning for the Board. 36 Alliance & Leicester
Statement of Corporate Governance continued
During the year the Committee has formalised its succession and
contingency plan for all Board and Committee appointments. Two
additional independent non-executive directors, Mr P J Stone and 
Mrs J V Barker, have been appointed to the Board with the speciﬁc
objective of increasing the breadth of recent ﬁnancial and risk
management experience on the Group Audit & Risk Committee, 
and the Group Credit Policy Committee. 
Detailed candidate proﬁles were prepared for both appointments 
and an external search consultancy retained to identify prospective
candidates from which a short-list was presented to the Committee.
The Committee membership as at 19 February 2004 is and during 
the period under review was: 
Mr J R Windeler (Chairman)
Mr M J Allen
Mr M P S Barton 
Miss F A Cairncross
Mr R M McTighe (from 30 October 2003)
Mr E J Watts (from 30 October 2003)
Mrs D Henderson, Head of Board Ofﬁce, is the secretary of the
Nomination Committee.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprising non-executive directors is
responsible, pursuant to a policy framework on executive remuneration
agreed by the Board, for determining the pay and beneﬁts and
contractual arrangements for the Chairman, Executive Directors and
the Company Secretary, and for overseeing the Group’s Share Schemes.
The Committee also recommends and monitors the structure and levels
of remuneration for Senior Managers throughout the Group.
The Committee oversees the preparation of the Directors’
Remuneration report which appears on pages 28 to 34.
The Committee membership as at 19 February 2004 is and during the
period under review was: 
Mr M P S Barton (Chairman)
Mr M J Allen
The Hon D Brougham
Miss F A Cairncross
Mr R M McTighe (from 30 October 2003)
Mr E J Watts (from 30 October 2003)
Mr T S Lloyd, Company Secretary, is the Secretary of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Group Audit & Risk Committee
The Group Audit & Risk Committee supports the Board’s Corporate
Governance responsibilities, including risk management and
compliance with applicable codes.
The duties of the Committee fall into two main areas: 
• Internal Control: the Committee reviews the effectiveness of the
Group’s systems of internal control and risk management and monitors
compliance with regulatory requirements. To do this, the Committee
approves the annual Internal Audit and Compliance plans, which are
based on thorough risk assessments of the full scope of the Group’s
business activities, and monitors progress against the plans. Each
meeting of the Committee receives reports from the Head of Group
Internal Audit and the Head of Group Compliance regarding the state
of internal control and compliance within the Group. The salient points
of these reports are presented to the next Board meeting.
• Financial Reporting: the Committee’s role is to review, on behalf 
of the Board, the Annual Report and Accounts, the Interim Report
and internal audit reports. The Committee focuses on reviewing any
changes in accounting policy, major areas of judgement and estimates,
and compliance with accounting principles and regulatory requirements.
The Committee membership as at 19 February 2004 is and during the
period under review was: 
Mr M P S Barton* (Chairman) 
Mrs J V Barker* (from 29 January 2004)
The Hon D Brougham*
Mr R M McTighe 
Mr E J Watts 
Mr P J Stone* (from 30 October 2003)
* The Board considers that these non-executive members of the committee have recent
and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
Mrs N Veall, Head of Group Internal Audit, is the Secretary of the
Group Audit & Risk Committee.
The Group Chief Executive, and other Executive Directors, Director of
Group Risk, Director of Accounting & Taxation, Head of Group Internal
Audit, Head of Group Compliance and a representative of the external
auditors normally attend meetings. Other Group Board members are
also invited to all meetings. The Chairman of the Committee has
independent access to both internal and external auditors, and to 
the Group’s statutory regulator, the Financial Services Authority.
The Committee is also responsible for appointment and reappointment
of the external auditors, the appropriateness of the audit fee and the
engagement letter, ensuring that it has been updated to reﬂect changes
in circumstances arising since the previous year, and any questions of
resignation or dismissal.
The Group has developed and implemented a formal policy for the
engagement of its external auditors to supply non-audit services. The
policy is designed to ensure that neither the nature of the service to 
be provided nor the level of reliance placed on the service could impair
the objectivity of the external auditors’ opinion on the Group’s ﬁnancial
statements. The policy incorporates a comprehensive system for reporting
to the Group Audit & Risk Committee the use of delegated authorities to
appoint the external auditors for non-audit services.
The Committee recognises the importance of maintaining a sound
system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and the Group’s assets. Further information on the systems of business
control appears later in this Statement. The Company’s independent
external auditors are present at meetings of the Committee and 
the Committee reviews the effectiveness of the audit process. The
Committee also receives, on behalf of the Board, the Annual Report 
of the Group Money Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer, and reviews
arrangements by which staff may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or 
other matters.
Other Committees
The Group Credit Policy Committee reviews all aspects of credit,
liquidity and market risk, and the Group Assets and Liabilities
Committee establishes strategies for, and monitors and controls, the
levels of balance sheet risk including liquidity, funding and currency
exposures across the Group, and the monitoring of interest rate reﬁxing
proﬁles. The Chairman’s Committee is empowered to take urgent
decisions between Board meetings and comprises the Chairman or a
non-executive director, the Deputy Chairman or another non-executive
director, and the Group Chief Executive or one other executive director.
Pension Funds
The Group’s pension funds are held and controlled by trustees separately
from the Group; in particular no scheme assets are invested in or
loaned to the Company or its subsidiaries. Independence is reinforced
by strong employee trustee representation. Annual Report & Accounts 2003 37
Relations with Shareholders
The Company values dialogue with its institutional shareholders
through meetings, presentations and results brieﬁngs.
The Board receives monthly updates on changes in the Group’s
institutional share register, together with details and feedback from 
any meetings held with shareholders. To ensure the Board are kept up
to date on current external views they also regularly receive copies of
analyst research notes on the Company. 
During the year the Company has undertaken surveys of both analyst and
investor views on the Company. The Board is provided with a summary of
the ﬁndings of these surveys, and has access to the full reports. 
The Group’s major institutional shareholders regularly meet with 
the Company’s management. The Chairman and senior non-executive
director attend results presentations, together with other non-executive
directors who are able to do so. The Group’s major institutional
shareholders have been contacted in order to give them the opportunity
to meet with the Chairman, senior independent non-executive director,
and other non-executive directors. In addition, all institutional
shareholders have the opportunity to request a meeting with the
Chairman and non-executive independent directors via the Group’s web-
site. The senior independent non-executive director is available to deal
with the concerns of shareholders that cannot be resolved through the
normal channels of the Chairman or the Group Chief Executive.
All shareholders have the opportunity to meet the directors at the
Annual General Meeting (AGM). The Company facilitates this by
holding the AGM in the evening at the Company’s Leicestershire 
head ofﬁce, which is at the heart of its individual shareholder base.
Compliance Statement
The Company has complied with the Principles of Good Governance
and Code of Best Practice as contained in the Combined Code, issued
by the London Stock Exchange in June 1998, throughout the year
ended 31 December 2003, save that the Chairman had been a
member of the Remuneration Committee until his resignation from 
that Committee on 25 September 2003. 
Internal Control
The Group Audit & Risk Committee has regularly reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the year to 
31 December 2003 on behalf of the Board, and has taken account of
any material developments that may have taken place since the year end.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls 
and for monitoring its effectiveness. The Group’s business involves 
the identiﬁcation, acceptance and mitigation of risk, and appropriate
internal control systems have been implemented and embedded. 
These systems of internal control are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and
provide reasonable assurance as to the effectiveness of the safeguards
protecting the business against the risk of material error, loss or fraud,
but it must be recognised that they cannot provide absolute assurance.
The directors are required by law to establish systems for the control 
of the conduct of the business in accordance with the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000, and to conduct the business with prudence and
integrity, ensuring that there are adequate reserves and other capital
resources and assets in liquid form for the protection of depositors.
There has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of this report a process of identifying, evaluating and managing the
signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. This process is regularly reviewed
by the Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance for Directors on
the Combined Code issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales in September 1999.
The Board receives monthly reports from the key executives identifying
performance against budget, major business issues and the impact of 
the external business and economic environment on their areas of
responsibility. The Board also receives minutes and reports from the
Chairmen of the Group Audit & Risk Committee, and the Group Credit
Policy Committee. These identify any signiﬁcant issues relating to the
adequacy of the Group’s risk management policies and procedures 
across the full range of risk to which the Group is exposed.
The Board has delegated oversight of the Group’s Internal Control Policy
to the Group Audit & Risk Committee. Each regular meeting of this
Committee receives a report identifying the effectiveness of internal
control together with speciﬁc reports on major issues. An annual
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control within the Group 
is submitted by the Head of Group Internal Audit to this Committee. 
The Board retains control over this area through the presentation of a
regular Group Audit & Risk Committee “activities” report together with
the minutes of the Committee meetings.
The key features of the system of business control established by the
Board are:
• A Group Internal Control Policy requiring senior management to
identify major risks and monitor the effectiveness of internal controls
through key performance indicators and certify to the Board on 
a twice yearly basis that they are effective. The results of this self-
certiﬁcation are subject to internal audit scrutiny and are reported 
via the Group Audit & Risk Committee;
• A well deﬁned management structure with clear accountabilities 
and delegations;
• A system of executive management committees, including the
Executive Directors Committee and the Credit, Controls & Security
Executive Committee. These committees enhance and support the
oversight role of the Board;
• A planning and budget process that delivers detailed annual ﬁnancial
forecasts and targets for Board approval;
• Management information systems enabling the Board to receive
comprehensive monthly analysis of ﬁnancial and business 
performance including variance against budget;
• A Group Risk Management function with overarching responsibility 
for the monitoring and reporting of all major risks to which the 
Group is exposed, supported by specialist risk functions;
• An Internal Audit function to report to the Board on the effectiveness
of key internal controls in relation to these major risks;
• A Compliance function to manage relationships with the Group’s 
key regulators and to identify and control major compliance risks; 
• The appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer and the
establishment and maintenance of anti-money laundering procedures
and controls including training programmes for staff; and
• Documented procedures and authority levels to ensure that risks
involved in major projects are properly assessed and controlled.
The activities of the Group, including the systems of business control, 
are subject to supervision by the Financial Services Authority. The 
Group is required on a regular basis to submit detailed prudential and
statistical returns covering all areas of its business and meets regularly
with its supervisors, conducting the relationship in an open and
constructive manner. 
Going Concern
The directors conﬁrm that they are satisﬁed that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accounts. 38 Alliance & Leicester
Statement of Corporate Governance continued
UK company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial accounts 
for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing
those ﬁnancial accounts, the directors are required to:
• select appropriate accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
accounts; and
• prepare ﬁnancial accounts on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to assume the Group will continue to be in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect
fraud and other irregularities.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities Annual Report & Accounts 2003 39
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Alliance & Leicester plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Alliance & Leicester plc for
the year ended 31 December 2003 which comprise the consolidated
proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash ﬂow
statement, the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds, the
statement of accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 43. These
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the part of the
directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the
Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards. They are also responsible for the preparation 
of the other information contained in the annual report including 
the directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United
Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having 
been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is 
not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects 
the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required 
to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained 
in the Annual Report for the above year as described in the contents
section including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration
report and consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the
Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described
as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2003 
and of the proﬁt of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the ﬁnancial statements and part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
44 Alliance & Leicester 1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of presentation
The consolidated accounts are prepared in accordance with the 
special provisions of Part VII, Chapter II of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to banking companies and banking groups.
Accounting convention
The Group prepares its accounts under the historical cost convention,
except for the revaluation of securities used in trading activities, and 
in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the bank and all 
its subsidiaries at the end of the year. Where subsidiaries are acquired
during the year, their results are included in the Group accounts from
the date of acquisition.
In accordance with FRS 9 “Associates and Joint Ventures”, investments
in joint arrangements that are not entities are included in the group
ﬁnancial statements through the recognition of the group’s share 
of the assets, liabilities and cashﬂows arising from the arrangement.
Statements of Recommended Practice (SORPs)
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with British Bankers’
Association SORPs on Advances, Securities, Derivatives, Contingent
Liabilities and Segmental Reporting by Banks, and the Finance &
Leasing Association SORP “Accounting issues in the asset ﬁnance 
and leasing industry”.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Company balance sheet
at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill
In accordance with FRS 10 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”, goodwill
arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies, which is represented
by the excess of fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair
value of assets acquired, is capitalised and shown as an asset in the
balance sheet and subsequently amortised over a period of between 
3 and 10 years on a straight line basis as a charge to the proﬁt and 
loss account. Negative goodwill is amortised over a period of 3 years.
Goodwill written off to reserves before the adoption of FRS 10 amounts
to £42.2m. This would be charged to the proﬁt and loss account in the
event of the disposal of the relevant business.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the full provision method in accordance
with FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all
timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date. Provision is calculated at rates expected to be applicable
when the liability or asset crystallises. Deferred tax is provided on 
a non-discounted basis.
Fixed assets and depreciation
The cost of additions and major alterations to ofﬁce premises, plant,
ﬁxtures, equipment and motor vehicles is capitalised. The cost of ﬁxed
assets less estimated residual value is written off on a straight line basis
over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 to 75 years
Leasehold buildings over the remainder of the
lease up to 75 years
Fixtures and major alterations 10 to 15 years
Equipment and motor vehicles 3 to 9 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course 
of construction.
Software costs and external consultancy costs associated with software
development are written off to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
Operating lease assets
Assets acquired for the purpose of renting out under operating lease
agreements are capitalised and depreciation is provided at rates
calculated to write off the cost of the assets, less estimated residual
value, over their useful lives using methods which allocate depreciation
charges on a systematic basis to the periods which are expected to
beneﬁt from their use.
Finance and rental agreements
The minimum lease payments receivable from ﬁnance lease and other
finance agreements, less appropriate future income arising from ﬁnance
charges, are included in net investment in ﬁnance leases and hire
purchase contracts.
Gross earnings on ﬁnance and rental agreements comprise the income
component of repayments, after recognising sufﬁcient income to cover
initial direct costs, which are credited to the proﬁt and loss account
using methods which produce an approximate constant rate of return
on the net cash investment.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals under operating leases are charged to administrative expenses
on a straight line basis.
Finance lease agreements
Assets acquired under ﬁnance leases are capitalised at fair value at the
start of the lease, with the corresponding obligations being included 
in other liabilities. The finance lease costs charged to the profit and 
loss account are based on a constant periodic rate as applied to the
outstanding liabilities.
Wholesale funding issue costs
Premiums or discounts, net of commission costs associated with the 
issue of fixed and floating rate notes and subordinated liabilities, 
are amortised over the relevant period to maturity and are included 
in the proﬁt and loss account within interest payable.
Pensions and post-retirement medical beneﬁts
The Group operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution
pension arrangements. Under the deﬁned beneﬁt section the cost 
of providing pensions and related beneﬁts is charged to the proﬁt 
and loss account so as to spread the costs evenly over the employees’
working lives. The difference between the charge to the proﬁt and loss
account and the contributions paid to the scheme is shown as an asset
or a liability in the balance sheet. The assets of the deﬁned contribution
section are held separately in an independently administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the proﬁt and loss 
account as they fall due.
The cost of providing post-retirement medical beneﬁts is charged 
to the proﬁt and loss account so as to spread the costs evenly over 
the employees’ working lives. A provision is included within “Other
provisions for liabilities and charges”.
Securities
Securities intended for use on a continuing basis in the bank’s 
activities are classiﬁed as investment securities and are stated in the
balance sheet at cost less any impairment in value. Adjustments are
made to cost for premiums and discounts arising on the purchase 
of investment securities, which are amortised over the period to 
the maturity date of the security, and for the effect of the annual
movement in the retail price index where redemption is so ﬁxed 
under the terms of the issue. Securities used in trading activities 
are carried at fair value, with all gains and losses taken directly 
to the proﬁt and loss account.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
Speciﬁc provisions are made in respect of loans and advances where
recovery is considered doubtful; a general provision is made for losses
which, although not speciﬁcally identiﬁed, are known to be inherent 
in any portfolio of lending. The provisions methodology for residential
mortgages and unsecured personal loans was reﬁned during the year
to align with industry best practice. This did not signiﬁcantly change
the level of provisions. Provisions for residential mortgages are reduced
by the level of funds held in the Group’s offshore captive insurance 
Notes to the Accounts
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 45 1 Principal accounting policies continued
subsidiary and by high percentage loan fees held in the Group 
balance sheet.
Where the collection of interest is in signiﬁcant doubt, it is credited 
to a suspense account and written off when there is no longer any
realistic prospect of recovery. The outstanding provisions are deducted
from loans and advances, along with the interest on non-performing
loans held in suspense. The charge in the proﬁt and loss account
represents the net increase (or decrease) in the provisions less
recoveries for the year.
Income recognition
Interest is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account on an accruals
basis. The costs of mortgage cashbacks, discounts and other incentives
to borrowers are charged as incurred to interest receivable, except 
for products where the customer has an obligation over a period of
time to return the incentive if they redeem the mortgage, and the
early redemption fee is closely linked to the incentive cost. For these
products the incentive is recorded within “Prepayments and accrued
income” and spread over the term of the customer’s obligation.
Mortgage arrangement fees are taken to income in the proﬁt and 
loss account on a received basis. Other fees receivable are credited 
to income when the related service is performed.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, other than those
covered by forward contracts which are translated at contracted rates,
are translated into sterling using year end exchange rates and any
differences charged or credited to the proﬁt and loss account.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivatives used in trading activities are carried at fair value, with 
all gains and losses taken directly to the proﬁt and loss account.
Gains and losses on non-trading derivatives are taken to the proﬁt 
and loss account in accordance with the accounting treatment 
of the underlying transaction being hedged. Accrued income 
or expense is reported in “Prepayments and accrued income” or
“Accruals and deferred income” as appropriate. Proﬁts and losses
relating to hedges of commitments and anticipated transactions 
are deferred and taken to the proﬁt and loss account over the life 
of the underlying hedge.
Hedging contracts and instruments are used by the Group as part 
of its overall risk management strategy. Instruments used for hedging
purposes include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, collars and
ﬂoors, futures, forward rate agreements and spot and forward foreign
exchange transactions.
The criteria required for a derivative instrument to be classiﬁed 
as a designated hedge are:
i) the transaction must be reasonably expected to match or eliminate
a signiﬁcant proportion of the risk inherent in the assets, liabilities 
or positions being hedged which results from potential movements
in interest rates and exchange rates;
ii) adequate evidence of the intention to hedge and linkage with the
underlying risk inherent in the assets and liabilities being hedged
must be established at the outset of the transaction.
Hedge transactions which cease to be effective or are terminated 
early are measured at fair value. Any proﬁt or loss arising is deferred
and amortised over the remaining life of the asset, liability or position
being hedged. Where the underlying asset, liability or position no
longer exists, the hedging transaction is measured at fair value and 
any proﬁt or loss arising is recognised in full.
Mortgage guarantee income
The bank charges a fee to reﬂect the increased risk on high loan 
to value advances, and has established a wholly owned subsidiary 
as a captive insurance company, for the purposes of insuring part 
of the risk upon such secured lending. In the Group accounts, fees 
are taken to “Other interest receivable and similar income” over the
average anticipated life of the loan. The deferred element is shown as
a deduction from “Loans and advances to customers” in accordance
with ICAEW Technical Release 20/01.
Securitisation
Securitisation transactions are reported in accordance with FRS 5,
“Reporting the Substance of Transactions”. Where assets are sold under
securitisation, if there is no signiﬁcant change to the Group’s rights and
beneﬁts to those assets and its exposure is limited to a ﬁxed monetary
ceiling, linked presentation is used. Under linked presentation the
finance is shown deducted from the gross amount of the item it
finances on the face of the balance sheet within a single asset caption
“Loans and advances to customers”.

These balances include £2.1m in respect of loans to bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”). The SPVs, owned by charitable trusts,
are funded by Asset Backed Commercial Paper and invest in “AAA” rated assets. In addition to these loans the Group provides liquidity facilities 
to the SPVs. The SPVs are not consolidated into the Group accounts on the basis that the SPVs are not controlled by the Group and the beneﬁts
the Group receives from the SPVs are restricted to interest and fees relating directly to the loans and liquidity facilities provided.
15 Securitisation
On 1 November 2000, the Company sold residential mortgage assets of £250.0m to Fosse Securities No.1 plc (“Fosse”). Fosse issued Mortgage
Backed Floating Rate Notes to finance the purchase of the portfolio of loans. These notes are serviceable only from cash flows generated
by the mortgage assets together with £2.7m (2002: £3.0m) of subordinated finance from the Company. In addition, the Company had 
a subordinated loan to ﬁnance certain issue related expenses which has been repaid (December 2002: £0.9m).
The Group is not obliged to support any losses in respect of these mortgages other than to the extent of its subordinated loans, nor does it intend
to do so. This is clearly stated in the agreements with bondholders. 
The Company has an option to sell further mortgage loans to Fosse where at the end of any interest period the actual rate of repayment of
principal (“ARR”) exceeds 20% per annum, so long as the sale price of such loans does not exceed the principal repayments received in the
interest period and the ARR after the sale is not less than 20% per annum.
The controlling interest of Fosse is held by a discretionary trust established for charitable purposes. The Group receives administration fees for servicing
Fosse’s mortgage portfolio together with its residual income arising after the claims of the bondholders and other creditors are met. Fosse is
consolidated and included in the Group ﬁnancial statements as a quasi-subsidiary.
The summary results of Fosse are as follows:

In previous years capital gains have been rolled-over against the acquisition cost of assets acquired by the Group including freehold land and
buildings. These gains will crystallise if the new assets are disposed of and will result in a liability of £4.7m (2002: £4.8m). There are no plans 
to dispose of any of these assets in the foreseeable future. In the event of such a sale the Group also has capital losses of £8.3m (2002: £24.8m)

The above assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling do not indicate the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group has hedged all material foreign currency exposures by using off balance sheet hedging instruments so that there are no material
unmatched exposures at the balance sheet date. All of the principal subsidiaries owned by Alliance & Leicester plc use sterling as their functional
currency. Therefore, the Group is not subject to any structural currency exposures.
38 Pensions
Pension costs relating to deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution sections of the Scheme can be analysed as follows:
2003 2002
(a) SSAP 24 Disclosures (Group) £m £m
Regular cost 17.8 17.1
Variations from regular cost (i) 6.6 4.9
Notional interest on prepayment (1.4) (1.5)
Total 23.0 20.5
(i) Variations from regular cost arise from the scheme deﬁcit being spread on a basis changing in line with pensionable payroll over the average expected future working life of the
membership (15 years).
The Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme (the Scheme) comprises funded deﬁned beneﬁt sections which became closed to new entrants on 
31 March 1998. New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a deﬁned contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is an exempt approved pension scheme under which retirement and death beneﬁts are provided for Group employees. 
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the ﬁnances of the participating employers.
In addition beneﬁts are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989 whose
beneﬁts would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualiﬁed actuaries using the projected unit method. The latest
actuarial valuation was made as at 31 March 2002. The signiﬁcant assumptions in these valuations were that salaries increase on average by 
2.0% p.a. above inﬂation, long term return on investments is 7.0% p.a. in the period before members reach retirement and 5.5% p.a. in the 
post-retirement period, and that pensions increase at 2.5% p.a. Assets were valued at their market value as at 31 March 2002.
At 31 March 2002 the market value of the assets of the deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Scheme was £727.7m and this was sufﬁcient to cover 
92% of the liabilities for beneﬁts due to members in respect of service prior to that date. 
Contributions to the Scheme in 2003 amounted to £138.3m (2002: £18.1m), including a one-off contribution of £100m. The excess of £115.1m 
of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension contribution over the charge has increased the prepayment of £19.4m at the start of the year. An asset of £134.7m
representing total net accumulated prepaid contributions is included in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2003.
Post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group provides post-retirement medical beneﬁts to certain pensioners and active employees. The liability has been assessed by an independent
qualiﬁed actuary as at 31 December 2002, using the projected unit method. The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were a discount
rate of 6.0% and medical beneﬁt cost inﬂation of 8.0% for 2 years gradually reducing to 4.35% over 5 years and remaining at 4.35% thereafter.
The charge in the year for post-retirement medical beneﬁts in the Group accounts is £1.6m (2002: £1.6m). 
(b) FRS 17 Retirement Beneﬁts: Group accounts
(i) Deﬁned beneﬁt section
The following disclosures are provided under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 which requires certain disclosures only for periods ending
subsequent to 22 June 2002. The amounts disclosed under these transitional arrangements, which apply to both the funded and unfunded
Schemes, are not included in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. If FRS 17 were to be fully adopted, the impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
Proﬁt and Loss Account and Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses would be as set out below. 
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2002 and updated by an independent
qualiﬁed actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2003. Scheme
assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.

The deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Scheme is closed to new members. Therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will
increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
The Group made contributions of £34.6m during the year being 37.1% of pensionable salary. In addition the Group made a one-off special
contribution in the year amounting to £100m. It has been agreed with the trustees that the contribution rate for 2004 will be 17.5%, plus 
an additional £1.5m per month.
(ii) Deﬁned contribution section
Employer contributions payable during the year were £3.7m (2002: £2.9m). There were no unpaid contributions at 31 December 2003 or 
31 December 2002.
(c) Company accounts
It is not possible, on a reasonable basis, to identify the Company’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt section of
the Scheme and accordingly the Company will account for the Scheme as a deﬁned contribution scheme in accordance with paragraph 9(b) of FRS 17.
The Company contributions payable during the year to the defined benefit section were £86.8m (2002: £10.0m). There were no unpaid
contributions at 31 December 2003 or 31 December 2002.
The Company contributions payable during the year to the defined contribution section were £2.7m (2002: £2.3m). There were no unpaid

41 Risk management
The Group uses ﬁnancial instruments, including derivatives, to manage its ﬁnancial risks.
Financial instruments have the potential to reduce, modify or increase the liquidity, credit and market risks arising from normal business activities.
Details of the objectives and policies for managing the risks associated with the Group’s use of ﬁnancial instruments are presented in the Financial
Review on pages 18 to 20. These disclosures form part of the audited ﬁnancial statements.
i) Interest rate repricing analysis
The following table provides a summary of the interest rate repricing proﬁle of the Group’s assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2003. 
Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate reset date and the contractual 
maturity date. The table takes account of derivative ﬁnancial interests whose effect is to alter the interest basis of Group assets and liabilities.
The trading book and non-interest bearing balances have been included in a separate column; the interest rate risk of the trading book is analysed
under ii) below.

ii) Trading book
The Group’s trading activities are conducted through the Group’s Treasury division. Material trading assets comprise debt securities for which 
the carrying value is equal to the fair value at 31 December 2003 and 2002. Dealing proﬁts are disclosed in note 2.
The bank uses a variety of techniques to measure market risk in the trading book, including calculating the sensitivity of the market value of
positions to hypothetical changes in interest rates. The following table sets out the change in the value of the trading book arising from a 1%
change in market interest rates, for the year ended 31 December 2003, with all other variables remaining constant:
Change in value
£m £m
2003 2002
Highest exposure 0.9 0.9
Lowest exposure 0.3 0.3
Average exposure 0.6 0.5
Exposure as at 31 December 0.5 0.5
The sensitivity analysis technique used by the Group measures the change in the fair value of the Group’s trading book arising from hypothetical
changes in market rates. Actual results in the future could differ from these projected figures if fluctuations in interest rates exceeded the
hypothetical 1% shift. The Group’s trading book is not materially exposed to other market risks.
iii) Fair values
The table below compares the book and fair values of some of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments by category at the balance sheet date. Where
available, market prices have been used to determine fair values. Where market prices are not available, fair values have been calculated for
options by using option-pricing models and for other ﬁnancial instruments by discounting cash ﬂows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Minor changes in assumptions used could have a signiﬁcant impact on the resulting estimated fair values, and, as a result, readers of these
ﬁnancial statements are advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
The concept of fair value assumes realisation of ﬁnancial instruments by way of sale. However, in many cases, the Group intends to realise assets
through collection over time.

The tables below analyse the Group’s derivatives portfolios by type of contract and maturity and shows the contract amount and the replacement
cost. Contract amount indicates the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and does not represent amounts at risk. The
replacement cost represents the cost of replacing contracts, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date and reﬂects the Group’s
exposure should counterparties default. No account is taken of offsetting positions with the same counterparty.

iv) Hedging
As explained in the Financial Review on pages 18 to 20, the Group’s policy is to hedge the following exposures:
• Interest rate risk – using interest rate swaps, caps, collars and ﬂoors, futures and forward rate agreements;
• Transactional currency exposures – using spot and forward foreign exchange transactions.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows:

after the next ﬁnancial year 172.0 (412.4) (240.4) 230.2 (194.3) 35.9
The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group. The gains and losses do
not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from
on-balance sheet instruments.

Notes
a) Capital is allocated to business sectors on the basis of 7% equity and 3.5% subordinated debt. Excess capital is held within Treasury & Group.
b) Costs have been assigned to each sector based on resources consumed. Corporate overheads not directly attributable to business units, including strategy costs of £18.0m
(2002: £50.6m) are included within Treasury & Group.
c) The Group operates entirely within the banking and insurance business, and operations are not managed on the basis of an allocation of net assets. The level of banking assets 
can ﬂuctuate throughout the year, therefore the information derived from the year end ﬁgures does not provide a picture representative of the year as a whole. A more meaningful
analysis of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities by business sector is contained within the Business and Financial Reviews on pages 8 to 20.
d) No geographical analysis is presented because substantially all of the Group’s activities are in the UK.

Total 18 35
Mortgage incentive costs, as a discount to the appropriate headline
mortgage rate, increased by £43m to £327m. Expressed as a discount
to bank base rate, incentives fell £17m from £35m (December 2002)
to £18m. The cost of discounts relative to bank base rate provides 
a close proxy to the actual cost of discounts which impact the proﬁt 
and loss account.
The variable rate discounts have an average remaining life of 21 months
(December 2002: 21 months). For ﬁxed rate discounts, the average
remaining period was 23 months (December 2002: 24 months). At 
the end of December 2003, 54% (December 2002: 42%) of balances
on individual mortgage accounts, including ﬁxed and variable rate
mortgages, were covered by early repayment fees.

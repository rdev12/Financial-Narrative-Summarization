employee productivity and increased

Chairman’s Statement
The 12 months to 31 October 2011 have been 
a transformative year for Idox. The acquisition 
of McLaren Software extended the Group’s 
core technology skills into international highly 
regulated asset intensive industries, providing 
access to many higher growth markets outside 
the UK and Europe. 
The post year-end acquisition of CTSpace 
has further established the Group as a 
significant vendor in the Engineering Document 
Management and Control market and with 
McLaren has established a second major market 
focus for the Group.
Idox’s diversification into new verticals in the 
private sector maintains the Group’s emphasis 
on generating high levels of recurring revenues 
and on building long-lasting supportive 
relationships with customers. At the same time it 
lowers the Group’s reliance on revenue from the 
public sector in the UK and provides access to 
global markets. 
Idox remains a significant provider of complex 
large scale document management and related 
systems to UK local government. The Group 
is now the clear UK market leader in Land and 
Property software solutions providing some 63% 
of all UK planning systems. 
The Public Sector software business accounted 
for 68% of Group revenues (2010: 77%). During 
the period, the Group has further expanded 
the business into full service provision covering 
software, consulting, managed services, full 
off-premise hosting, and integrated cloud-based 
services. As a result, the proportion of longer-
term shared and managed service contracts as 
part of the Group’s revenue mix has generated a 
greater level of recurring revenues. 
The development of the Group both in its 
markets and geographic diversity, has been 
accompanied by an evolution in its management 
structure and its capability to develop business 
and successfully integrate acquisitions. 
The Group moved to a divisional business 
structure, supported by Group functions such 
as technology and finance, a process that 
was completed by the internal appointment of 
Andrew Riley as managing director of Idox’s 
Public Sector software business. 
2011 Highlights and Markets
As the Company predicted last year the local 
government settlement resulting from the 2010 
Comprehensive spending review has led to 
renewed growth, innovation and stability in our 
traditional core local authority market where we 
report a 15% uplift in sales, increasingly tilting 
towards long-term managed service agreements 
rather than outright one off software sales. 
Our experience therefore is in line with the 
forecasts of independent market research 
company Kable of modest growth in the local 
government software & services market for the 
next three years
Group revenues grew by 23% to £38.6m (2010: 
£31.3m) and EBITDA rose by 33% to £11.6 m 
(2010: £8.7m) 
Operating costs increased by 27% to £21.9m 
(2010: £17.3M) as a result of the full year impact 
of acquisitions made in the previous and current 
financial years. On a like-for-like basis overheads 
were 1% higher.
Dividend
Following a large rise in the interim dividend 
of 0.24p, the Board proposes a further final 
dividend of 0.36p, subject to shareholder 
approval, making a total for the year of 0.6p, a 
33% increase over 2010.
This year, in addition to thanking our senior 
management and staff for driving this business 
forward in terms of capability and profitability, I 
would like to thank also on behalf of the Board 
our shareholders in particular, who have been 
very supportive in our journey as growing AIM 
listed company, as well as our able professional 
advisers. All have played a part in helping 
Idox progress well against the headwinds of 
extraordinary uncertainty in the wider economic 
world and resulted in a year on year uplift in our 
share price of 82%.

government, moving Idox to a 46% market 
share in that vertical. Today, the Group offers a 
compelling case to local government to be more 
efficient by standardising around one integrated 
property based platform.
In the engineering document management and 
control sector, McLaren Software has undergone 
a year of change. The division’s focus on core 
markets and on delivering solutions and domain 
expertise have resulted in a 27% year on year 
increase in revenue. This includes significant big 
customer wins with blue chip companies like 
Chevron, Arcelor Mittal and Queensland Gas.
In addition, McLaren has concluded an OEM 
agreement with Documentum Inc., further 
supporting the platform as a strategically 
important partner. The business also continues 
to build stronger value added partnerships as 
the domain expert with IBM and Accenture.
The Solutions division was impacted by 
procurement delays and reductions in project 
work resulting in minimal revenue growth, but 
managed to maintain subscription revenues 
in the core grants business.  The acquisition 
of Interactive Dialogues, an e-learning and 
certification software business, has added rich 
content for the legal market, a blue chip private 
sector customer base and the capability to 
deliver on-line grants training solutions for the 
core business.  It has also provided a flexible 
platform for other divisions in the Group to meet 
the needs of both local and global customer 
bases.
The Public Sector software business market 
faced an unsettled start to the year, with 
the implementation of the new public sector 
spending round. This meant that decision 
cycles lengthened amid the prevailing economic 
uncertainty. This has now passed and there 
is greater clarity on the solutions required and 
budgets available. 
Independent market research company, Kable, 
is forecasting modest growth in the local 
government software & services market for the 
next three years. Idox’s Public Sector software 
business reported like-for-like growth in orders 
of 14% in the financial year as a result of the 
introduction of new services and an increased 
market share.
Idox has actively developed its management 
and technical capabilities in managed service 
or “zero infrastructure” provision for its public 
sector clients. By the end of 2011, Idox had 
consolidated its market leading position serving 
over 90% of UK local authorities. It also achieved 
a ten-fold increase in managed service sales 
over the previous year leading to a further 
strengthening of its local authority recurring 
revenues, which grew by 15% to £17.2m.
The introduction of a fully hosted resilient 
capability resulted in the business signing and 
delivering four fully-managed offsite solutions 
- with Westminster, Uttlesford, South Downs 
National Park and Buckinghamshire County 
Council – which have a total value of £3.5m.  
This shift towards managed services provision 
means that while the Public Sector software 
business has seen a double-digit increase in 
sales in the period, reported revenue growth 
has been marginal. However, with most of these 
deals running from three to five years, recurring 
revenues have increased to 66% from 62% the 
previous year.
In September 2011 the Group launched the 
Consultee Cloud, a product that allows all 
planning process stakeholders to complete both 
internal and external consultations online. In the 
three months since launch it has signed up in 
excess of 10% of all local authorities as well as 
the large consultee organisations. 
The acquisition of LalPac strengthened 
the Group’s position in the licensing and 
environmental health vertical of local

Divisional analysis: Revenue Mix Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 7
The Recruitment business saw strong growth 
in specialist permanent recruitment revenues. 
The market for contract recruitment remained 
soft, further hindered by changes in employment 
law which is moving more clients to direct 
engagement. The recruitment business overall 
showed a strong return to profitability, with 
revenues up 3% and gross profit rising 27%.
Outlook 
The Group has started the current financial 
year with a very strong order pipeline across all 
businesses. The shift in focus toward long term 
relationships and recurring revenues in its Public 
Sector software market may marginally impact 
top line revenues in this business with a move 
away from pure licence based sales. 
The acquisition of McLaren Software and 
CTSpace has enabled the Group to extend its 
core technology skills into the private sector 
on a global scale, providing access to verticals 
including pharmaceuticals and oil and gas.
In 2012, Idox will streamline its development 
activities to ensure that each initiative has broad 
applicability across all divisions. This strategic 
initiative in development may result in a small 
increase in capitalised development costs in the 
year. 
Whilst the economic climate remains 
challenging, the Group continues to reinforce its 
position as the centre of excellence in its chosen 
domains. The Board is confident that its strategy 
of diversification of revenue streams both 
operationally and geographically will enhance 
the Group’s resilience to current macroeconomic 
challenges and enable it to report good organic 
growth this year.  Trading in the current year has 
started in line with the Board’s expectations.

For the year ended 31 October 2011 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 8
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Group Gross margins continued to improve, 
reaching 87% (2010: 83%), with increases in all 
four businesses.  Public Sector software margins 
of 89% (2010: 87%) improved due to the 
growing recurring maintenance and managed 
service revenues and the EDMC business 
achieved gross margins of 94%.
The increased scale and recurring content 
subscription revenues within the Solutions 
business generated margins of 93% (2010: 
92%). The continuing shift within the Recruitment 
segment toward permanent placements resulted 
in gross margins of 44% (2010: 39%).  
Operating costs increased to £21.9m (2010: 
£17.3m) as a result of the acquisitions made 
in the previous and current financial years.  On 
a like-for-like basis, excluding acquisitions, 
overheads were 1% higher.  
EBITDA increased by 33% to £11.6m (2010: 
£8.7m) reflecting the maiden contribution 
from acquisitions, managing core revenues in 
a challenging environment, increasing gross 
margins and close control of operating costs.  
As a result, EBITDA margins increased to 30% 
(2010: 28%).  
Adjusted pre-tax profit, excluding amortisation, 
share options costs and exceptional charges, 
increased by 36% to £10.9m (2010: £8.0m). 
Pre-tax profit was £5.6m (2010: £4.9m) after 
an increased non cash amortisation charge of 
£3.7m (2010: £2.3m) following the acquisitions, 
an increased non cash share option charge 
of £1.1m (2010: £0.2m) and exceptional 
restructuring and corporate finance charges of 
£0.5m (2010: £0.6m). 
Adjusted earnings per share were up 41% to 
2.47p (2010: 1.75p). Basic earnings per share 
were up 22% to 1.31p (2010: 1.07p).
The Board proposes a final dividend of 0.36p, 
to give a full year dividend of 0.60p (2010: 
0.45p). This 33% increase in dividend reflects 
the Group’s strong profitability growth, revenue 
visibility, healthy operating cash generation and 
the Board’s continuing confidence in the long-
term strength of the business.
Group revenues grew by 23% to £38.6m 
(2010: £31.3m) reflecting the full year impact 
of acquisitions made in 2010 and maiden 
contributions from acquisitions of McLaren 
Software and LalPac in 2011.
The Public Sector software business, which 
accounted for 68% of Group revenues, delivered 
revenues of £26.1m (2010: £24.1m), of which 
around 66% were recurring (2010: 62%).  On 
a like-for-like basis, excluding acquisitions 
and revenues from the large one-off Scottish 
executive contract which was completed in 
2010, revenues in the Public Sector software 
business were marginally higher than 2010. 
There continues to be a shift in new orders 
within the public sector business toward longer 
term managed service contracts, such as Idox’s 
contract with Westminster City Council, which 
contributed to a 14% increase in new orders 
compared to 2010.  This trend, combined with 
a high level of recurring revenues in acquired 
businesses, helped recurring maintenance and 
managed services revenue in the public sector 
business grow by 15% to £17.2m.
McLaren Software, which was acquired in 
December 2010 and operates in the Engineering 
Document Management and Control (“EDMC”) 
market, delivered a maiden contribution to 
revenues of £4.7m, which represented organic 
growth of 27% over the same period prior to its 
acquisition.  Growth came from strong licence 
sales in new geographies such as Australia with 
sales to Chevron and Queensland Gas and also 
from sales to new customers in capital-intensive 
industries, such as Arcelor Mittal. 
The Solutions business increased revenues by 
12% to £4.7m (2010: £4.2m) as a result of a 
full year contribution from Grantfinder, acquired 
in May 2010.  Recurring revenues, which are 
derived from subscriptions to the UK’s leading 
grants information database, have increased 
to 70% (2010: 62%) and it is encouraging that 
in the current market environment subscription 
renewals have remained stable. 
The Recruitment business revenues grew by 3% 
to £3.1m (2010: £3.0m). Gross profit increased 
by 27% to £1.4m (2010: £1.1m) due to a 
strong performance in the specialist permanent 
recruitment business.
Chief Financial Officer’s Review Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 9
Idox ended the year with net debt of £2.4m 
(2010: net debt £0.9m) after funding the 
McLaren and LalPac acquisitions and retention 
payments relating to previous acquisitions, 
totalling £4.3m, a dividend payment of £2m and 
share buy backs of £0.3m. 
Since end of the financial year the Group has 
made a further two acquisitions.  Interactive 
Dialogues, a provider of e-learning platforms 
and content, was acquired on 7 November 
2011 for an initial consideration of €2m and will 
be integrated into the Solutions business.  A 
further €0.2m consideration will be payable in 
November 2012 subject to fulfilment of certain 
performance conditions.
CTSpace, which was acquired on 14 November 
2011 for £11.6m, is a provider of EDMC 
solutions and will be integrated with McLaren 
Software to create an EDMC business.  This 
division is expected to deliver around 30% 
of Group revenue in 2012, of which 55% is 
expected to be recurring maintenance and SaaS 
revenues.
The significantly enlarged EDMC business will 
be a leading provider of software and solutions 
to capital-intensive industries worldwide with 
around 70% of EDMC revenues expected to be 
generated internationally, predominantly from 
Europe and the US with a growing business in 
Australasia.
The recent acquisitions have been funded 
by new debt facilities provided by its existing 
bankers, Lloyds Banking Group.  A term loan 
of £12m together with a flexible revolving credit 
facility of a further £10m have been agreed.

Health, Safety and Environmental Policies
The Group recognises and accepts its responsibilities for health, safety and the environment 
(H,S&E) and has a dedicated team which provides advice and support in this area.  The team 
members regularly attend external H,S&E courses and internal reviews are performed on a regular 
basis to ensure compliance with best practice and all relevant legislation.
Disabled Employees
Application for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes and abilities of the applicant concerned.  
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their 
employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged.  It is the policy of 
the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled employees should, as 
far as possible be identical with that of other employees.  
Employee Consultation
The Group consults employees through the National Company Council (NCC).  The NCC sits 
regularly during the year and is made up of representatives voted on the Council by employees.  An 
employee consultation policy is also in place.  Employees are encouraged to present their views 
and suggestions in respect of the Group’s performance and policies.  In addition, the Group has an 
intranet which facilitates faster and more effective communication.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of investing 
in the Company. The Company purchases matching shares which become the property of the 
employee after a three year vesting period.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group uses various financial instruments which include cash, equity investments, bank loans 
and items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest 
rate risk. The directors review these risks on an ongoing basis. This policy has remained unchanged 
from previous years. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 13
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Directors’ Report cont’d
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors. The credit risk associated with 
cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from its trade debtors. 
In order to manage credit risk, the management review the debt ageing on an ongoing basis, 
together with the collection history and third party credit references where appropriate. 
Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Interest Rate Risk
Any funds over and above the current working capital requirements of the Group are invested in 
high interest deposit accounts. The Group’s bank borrowings bear interest at rates linked to the 
LIBOR.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group include the following:
Political – the Group has a large customer base in local government. A change in spending  >
priorities by the current or a future Government could materially impact the Group.  However this 
risk is mitigated due to the contractual nature of the recurring revenue in the Group.  The Group 
has increased diversification through acquisitions to mitigate against political risks.
Economic – elements of the recruitment area of the business activity could be adversely affected  >
by a further slowdown in the economic environment.  However, in the event of an improvement 
in the economy, some recruitment revenue streams may improve. The software area of the 
business could be adversely affected if the government reduces the grants to local authorities 
in an economic downturn. However, all indications are that the government will maintain and 
may increase the grants during such a period. The Group has increased diversification through 
acquisitions to mitigate against economic risks.
Competitors – the Group has certain competitors for its software products. To mitigate this risk,  >
the Group continues to invest in and develop its software.  Competitor risk is also mitigated 
through the long term nature of customer relationships and recurring software maintenance 
revenue. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 14

ited to BS EN ISO 9001:2008, the approved systems applying to the

Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash flows for 2012 in the context of the 
Group’s banking facilities and covenants, the level of recurring revenue within the business, the 
outlook for our chosen markets, and our current working capital resources, and are satisfied that 
it is appropriate to prepare accounts on a going concern basis. As a result of acquisitions post 
year end, on 14 November 2011 the Group put in place a revolving loan facility of £10m and an 
acquisition funding facility of £12m.  The revolving loan facility is for the period to November 2014 
and the acquisition funding facility is for the period to June 2015.  There are no events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern.   
Post balance sheet events
The Group signed a revolving loan facility of £10m and an acquisition funding facility of £12m on 14 
November 2011. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 15

Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee operates within defined terms of reference.  The Remuneration Committee comprises the 
Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors.  It is chaired by Christopher Wright.
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Group is to set levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and key staff.  
The packages are designed to be competitive in value to those offered to the Directors of similar sized public companies 
in related sectors. It is the Board’s policy to align the interests of managers with those of our shareholders in the grant 
of option and other equity rewards which underlying securities grantees are very much encouraged to retain over the 
longer term.
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are currently a basic salary, bonus, money 
purchase pension contributions and benefits in kind.  The benefits include car allowance, private medical cover, life 
cover and critical illness cover.  The bonus elements are dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance 
criteria set out by the Remuneration Committee.  The criteria include targets for revenue and profits as well as for cash 
balances.  In addition, the Group operates share option schemes for the Executive Directors.

Corporate Governance Report
Corporate Governance
The Group is committed to applying 
the highest principles of corporate 
governance commensurate with its 
size. The Group has adopted the 
Quoted Company Alliance (QCA) 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
for AIM Companies as published in 
September 2010. The Group complies 
with the QCA Corporate Governance 
Guidelines except whereby:
 
the Board does not currently  >
undertake performance evaluation 
of the Board, its committees, and 
its individual directors
the Board held seven Board  >
meetings, three Audit Committee 
and two Remuneration Committee 
meetings during the year.  All 
Directors attended each Board 
meeting. Two Directors attended 
each Committee meeting.
Internal Control
The Board takes responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining reliable 
systems of control in all areas of 
operation. These systems of control, 
especially of financial control, can 
only provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system 
of internal control are set out below:
Idox plc has established an  >
operational management structure 
with clearly defined responsibilities 
and regular performance reviews
the Group operates a  >
comprehensive system for 
reporting financial and non-financial 
information to the Board including 
preparation and review of strategy 
plans and the preparation and 
review of annual budgets
financial results are monitored  >
against budgets, forecasts and 
other performance indicators with 
action dictated accordingly at each 
meeting
a structured approval process  >
based on assessment of risk and 
value delivered
sufficient resource is focused to  >
maintain and develop internal 
control procedures and information 
systems, especially in financial 
management.
The Board considers that there have 
been no substantial weaknesses 
in internal financial controls that 
have resulted in any material losses, 
contingencies or uncertainties which 
need to be disclosed in the accounts.
The Group supports an internal 
audit function that performs annual 
audits on its management systems.  
This function is supported by a 
management review of the audit 
findings.  
Following publication of Internal 
Control: Guidance for Directors on 
the Combined Code (the “Turnbull 
Guidance”), the Board confirms 
that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the 
Group, and that this process has 
been in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
This process is regularly reviewed by 
the Board and is consistent with the 
Turnbull Guidance. 
Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have to prepare the 
consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs). The 
directors have elected to prepare the 
company financial statements under 
UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (“UK GAAP”).  
The financial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the group and 
parent company and of the profit or 
loss of the group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies  >
and then apply them consistently
make judgements and estimates  >
that are reasonable and prudent
state whether applicable IFRSs  >
have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements
prepare the financial statements on  >
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of 
the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006.  They 
are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 19
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Corporate Governance Report cont’d
The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring that the Directors’ Report 
and other information included in 
the Annual Report is prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
company law. They are also 
responsible for ensuring that the 
Annual Report includes information 
required by the AIM Market Rules. 
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s web site is the responsibility 
of the Directors; the work carried 
out by the auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, 
accordingly, the auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that 
may have occurred to the information 
contained in the accounts since they 
were initially presented on the web 
site. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and the 
dissemination of the accounts and 
other information included in annual 
reports may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
Accounting Policies
The Board considers the 
appropriateness of its accounting 
policies on an annual basis. The Board 
believes that its accounting policies 
are appropriate in particular in relation 
to income recognition and research 
and development.
Board of Directors
The Board, comprising the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer and two Non-
Executive Directors, is responsible 
for the overall strategy and direction 
of Idox plc as well as for approving 
potential acquisitions, major capital 
expenditure items and financing 
matters. The Board has a formal 
schedule of business reserved to it 
and meets regularly during the year. 
The Board is supplied in a timely 
manner with information in a form 
and of a suitable quality appropriate 
to enable it to discharge its duties. 
Advice from independent sources 
is available if required. The Board 
monitors exposure to key business 
risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of the Group, the annual 
budgets as well as their progress 
against those budgets.
The Board members and their 
roles are described on page 10.  In 
accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association, one third of 
the Directors are required to retire 
by rotation at the Annual General 
Meeting.
Shareholder Relations
Idox plc is committed to open 
communication with all its 
shareholders. The Directors hold 
regular meetings with institutional 
shareholders to discuss and review 
the Group’s activities and objectives. 
Communication with private 
shareholders is principally through 
the Annual General Meeting, where 
participation is encouraged and where 
the Board is available to answer 
questions. Idox plc maintains up-
to-date information on the Investor 
Relations section of its website www.
Idoxplc.com.
Every shareholder has access to a 
full annual report each year end and 
an interim report at the half year end. 
Care is taken to ensure that any price 
sensitive information is released to all 
shareholders, institutional and private, 
at the same time in accordance 
with London Stock Exchange 
requirements. 
Idox plc strives to give a full, 
timely and realistic assessment 
of its business in a balanced way, 
in all price-sensitive reports and 
presentations. 
The Group has adopted the Quoted 
Company Alliance (QCA) suggested 
terms of reference for the various 
Board committees as set out by the 
QCA.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by 
Peter Lilley and includes Christopher 
Wright. The Report of the Audit 
Committee can be found on page 20.
The Nomination Committee

schemes within the Group.

Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee operates within agreed 
terms of reference, which can be found on the 
Company’s website.
Independence of External Auditors
The Committee keeps under review the 
relationship with the external auditors including:
the independence and objectivity of the  >
external auditors, taking into account the 
relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements and the relationship with the 
auditor as a whole, including the provision of 
the non-audit services
the consideration of audit fees and any fees  >
for non-audit services.
The Audit Committee develops and 
recommends to the Board the Group’s policy 
in relation to the provision of non-audit services 
by the auditors, and ensures that the provision 
of such services does not impair the external 
auditor independence.

of changes in equity, the consolidated cash

This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the company’s members

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other

for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and 
Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 
18 & 19, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General Information
Idox plc is a leading supplier of software and services for the management of local government and other organisations. 
The company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Alternative Investment Market and is 
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 2nd Floor, Chancery Exchange, 10 Furnival 
Street, London, EC4A 1AB. The registered number of the company is 03984070.
The financial statements are prepared in pound sterling.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union (EU) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of 
certain financial assets and liabilities, being available for sale investments.
As set out on page 14 of the Directors’ Report, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to 
existing standards have been published that are mandatory for forthcoming financial periods, but which the Group has 
not adopted early.  None of these are considered relevant to the Group’s operations.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new standards and amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group during the year.
IAS 24 (Revised 2009) “Related Party Disclosures” - effective 1 January 2011. The revised standard modifies the 
definition of related parties.
IAS 32 Amendment: Classification of Rights Issues.  The Amendment alters IAS 32 so that rights, options or warrants to 
acquire a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments for a fixed amount of any currency are equity instruments 
if the entity offers the rights, options or warrants pro rata to all of its existing owners of the same class of its own (non-
derivative) equity instruments.  
Amendments to IFRS 2 – Group cash-settled share based payment transactions.  This amendment clarifies that an 
entity that receives goods or services from its suppliers (including employees) must apply IFRS 2 even where the 
obligation to make the required share-based cash payment lies with another group entity.    
Improvements to IFRS issued May 2010 – part effective 1 January 2011.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.  The resulting accounting estimates and 
assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  The Group has evaluated the estimates 
and assumptions that have been made in relation to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in these financial 
statements.  The estimates and assumptions which have the most significant impact on the financial statements which 
are recognised in the financial statements are as follows: Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 30
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts
(i) Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired 
as part of business combinations at fair value 
at the date of acquisition.  The determination of 
these fair values is based upon management’s 
judgement and includes assumptions on the 
timing and amount of future incremental cash 
flows generated by the assets and selection of 
an appropriate cost of capital.  Furthermore, 
management must estimate the expected 
useful lives of intangible assets and charge 
amortisation on those assets accordingly.  In 
determining the useful economic life of the 
intangible software assets, management has 
given consideration to the length of time that its 
own software is typically used within its market.  
In addition, management reviewed competitor 
products and the length of time they had also 
been in use.
Consideration was also given as to the likelihood 
that a new competitor could enter the market 
with a new product.  This was considered 
unlikely due to the up-front capital investment 
which would be required to develop a new 
product, the requirement for reference sites to 
demonstrate the product, and the long life cycles 
which products have in the market.  For details 
on the estimates made in relation to intangible 
assets, see note 11.
(ii) Development costs
The Group reviews half yearly whether the 
recognition requirements for development 
costs have been met.  This is necessary 
as the economic success of any product 
development is uncertain and may be subject 
to future technical problems at the time of 
recognition.  Judgements are based on the 
information available at each balance sheet 
date.  In addition, all internal activities related to 
the research and development of new software 
products are continuously monitored by the 
directors. See note 11 for further information.
(iii) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, as least annually, 
whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.  
The recoverable amount is determined based 
upon value-in-use and net realisable value 
calculations.  The value-in-use method requires 
the estimation of future cash flows and the 
choice of a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value of these cash flows. 
Pre-tax discount rates have been applied and 
are based on WACC calculations.   See note 11 
for further commentary.
(iv) Revenue recognition
The group recognises revenue on certain 
contracts such as work in progress, prior 
to an invoice being raised, where work has 
been completed and there is a high degree 
of certainty of the contract being completed 
and the invoice raised and cash received. See 
paragraph headed ‘Revenue’ below for more 
detail on how the Group accounts for revenue. 
(v) Dilapidations
Dilapidation provisions are management’s best 
estimates based on actual costs incurred in 
existing or similar properties. See note 18 for 
details of the amounts included in the balance 
sheet at the year end.
(vi) Contingent consideration
The contingent consideration provision is the 
maximum undiscounted amount which will be 
paid.  
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts 
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings 
drawn up to 31 October each year.  Subsidiaries 
are those entities over which the Group has the 
power to control the financial and operating 
policies.  Over all its subsidiaries, Idox plc 
obtains and exercises control through 100% of 
the voting rights.
The Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations retrospectively to business 
combinations prior to 1 November 2006.  
Accordingly the classification of the combination 
(acquisition, reverse acquisition or merger) 
remains unchanged from that used under UK 
GAAP .  
Assets and liabilities are recognised at the date 
of transition if they would be recognised under 
IFRS, and are measured using their UK GAAP 
carrying amount immediately post-acquisition as 
deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires 
fair value measurement.  Deferred tax is adjusted 
for the impact of any consequential adjustments 
after taking advantage of the transitional 
provisions. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 31
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on 
consolidation. 
For business combinations occurring since 
1 November 2009, the requirements of IFRS 
3R have been applied.  The consideration 
transferred by the Group to obtain control of 
a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the 
acquisition date fair values of assets transferred, 
liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued 
by the Group, which includes the fair value of 
any asset or liability arising from a contingent 
consideration arrangement.   Acquisition costs 
are expensed as incurred.
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts receivable in 
respect of goods and services provided during 
the year, stated net of value added tax.  Where 
work has been done, but a billing milestone has 
not been reached, the income has been accrued 
and included in amounts recoverable within 
trade and other receivables. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right 
to consideration. The Group derives its revenue 
streams from software solutions, information 
solutions and recruitment services.  
Software licences revenue is recognised when 
the licence is delivered.  Where the licence 
is bespoke, revenue is recognised when 
the licence is delivered and the customer 
has accepted the licence as fully functional.  
Software consultancy revenue is recognised 
in accordance with the percentage of value 
delivered to the customer.  For small value 
orders, the whole invoice amount is recognised 
at the billing point. 
The revenues for maintenance and managed 
service contracts are spread evenly over the life 
of the agreement, which is typically one year.  
Revenue derived from information solutions 
content is recognised over the life of the 
subscription, which is typically one year.  
Revenue from projects is recognised over the life 
of the project in accordance with the stage of 
completion.  Revenue from information solutions 
based managed services is recognised on a 
usage basis as the service is performed.
Recruitment revenue from permanent 
placements is recognised in the month when 
the placement starts.  Revenue from contract 
recruitment is recognised as the service is 
performed.
Contract revenue
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of 
completion of a long term contract is recognised 
only when the outcome of the contract can be 
foreseen with reasonable certainty. Revenue for 
such contracts is stated at the cost appropriate 
to their stage of completion plus attributable 
profits, less amounts recognised in previous 
years. Provision is made for any losses as they 
are foreseen.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included 
in trade and other receivables and represent 
revenue recognised in excess of payments on 
account.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision-maker.  The chief 
operating decision-maker has been identified as 
the steering committee, which comprises the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer.
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of 
identifiable intangible assets.  It is calculated 
as the excess of the sum of a) fair value of 
consideration transferred, b) the recognised 
amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of 
any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over 
the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net 
assets.  If the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets exceed the sum calculated above, the 
excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) 
is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated are tested for impairment at 
least annually.  All other individual assets or 
cash-generating units are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 32
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.  Negative goodwill is 
recognised immediately after acquisition in 
the statement of comprehensive income.  
Unallocated goodwill on acquisitions relates 
mainly to workforce valuation, synergies and 
economies of scale obtained on combining 
acquisitions with existing operations.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to the 
date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves.  
There is no re-instatement of goodwill that was 
amortised prior to transition to IFRS.  Goodwill 
previously written off to reserves is not written 
back to profit or loss on subsequent disposal.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are 
amortised to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which are 
reviewed on an annual basis.  Amortisation 
commences when the asset is available for 
use.  The residual values of intangible assets are 
assumed to be zero.
(i) Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research 
phase of an internal project) is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which it is incurred.  
Development costs incurred are capitalised 
when all the following conditions are satisfied:
completion of the intangible asset is  >
technically feasible so that it will be available 
for use or sale
the group intends to complete the intangible  >
asset and use or sell it
the group has the ability to use or sell the  >
intangible asset
the intangible asset will generate probable  >
future economic benefits.  Among other 
things, this requires that there is a market for 
the output from the intangible asset or for the 
intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used 
internally, the asset will be used in generating 
such benefits
there are adequate technical, financial and  >
other resources to complete the development 
and to use or sell the intangible asset, and
the expenditure attributable to the intangible  >
asset during its development can be 
measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria 
for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.  
The cost of an internally generated intangible 
asset comprises all directly attributable costs 
necessary to create, produce, and prepare 
the asset to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.  Amortisation 
commences upon completion of the asset, 
and is shown separately on the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Careful judgement by the directors is applied 
when deciding whether the recognition 
requirements for development costs have been 
met.  This is necessary as the economic success 
of any product development is uncertain and 
may be subject to future technical problems at 
the time of recognition.  Judgements are based 
on the information available at each balance 
sheet date.  In addition, all internal activities 
related to the research and development of new 
software products are continuously monitored by 
the directors.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 5 years.
(ii) Customer relationships
Customer relationships represent the purchase 
price of customer lists and contractual 
relationships purchased on the acquisition of 
CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, 
J4B Software and Publishing Limited, Strand 
Electoral Management Services Limited, 
Grantfinder Limited, McLaren Software Limited 
and Lalpac Limited.  These relationships are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses.  
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 20, 10 and 5 years.
(iii) Trade names
Trade names represent the named intangible 
asset recognised on the acquisition of CAPS 
Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, J4B 
Software and Publishing Limited, Strand 
Electoral Management Services Limited,  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 33
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
Grantfinder Limited, McLaren Software Limited 
and Lalpac Limited.  These trade names are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses.  
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 20, 10 and 5 years.
(iv) Software
Software represents the Uniform, Acolaid, 
Enterprise Engineer and electoral and licensing 
software purchased on the acquisition of CAPS 
Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, McLaren 
Software Limited, Strand Electoral Management 
Services Limited and Lalpac Limited.  The 
software is carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses.  Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight line method over a period of 5 and 10 
years.  Software also includes software licences 
purchased which are amortised using the 
straight line method over a period of 3 years.
(v) Database
Database represents the grant information 
database purchased on the acquisition of J4B 
Software & Publishing Limited and Grantfinder 
Limited.  The database is carried at fair value 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight line method over a period of 5 
years.
(vi) Order backlog
Order backlog represents the managed service 
contracts and subscription deferred revenue 
purchased on the acquisition of 11 land and 
property information solution contracts and 
Grantfinder Limited. Amortisation on the 
managed service deferred revenue is calculated 
based on the weighting and length of each 
contract purchased.  Subscription deferred 
revenue is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 5 years.
Impairment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units).  As a result, some assets are 
tested individually for impairment and some are 
tested at cash-generating unit level.  Goodwill is 
allocated to those cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from synergies of the related 
business combination and represent the lowest 
level within the group at which management 
monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-
generating units that include goodwill, other 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, 
and those intangible assets not yet available for 
use are tested for impairment at least annually.  
All other individual assets or cash-generating 
units are tested for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher 
of fair value, reflecting market conditions 
less costs to sell, and value in use based on 
an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.  
Impairment losses recognised for cash-
generating units, to which goodwill has been 
allocated, are credited initially to the carrying 
amount of goodwill.  Any remaining impairment 
loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in 
the cash generating unit.  With the exception of 
goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed 
for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement using the following rates and bases 
so as to write off the cost or valuation of 
items of property, plant and equipment over 
their expected useful lives.  The rates that are 
generally applicable are:
Computer hardware 50% and 100% 
straight line
Fixtures, fittings and 
equipment
25% straight line
Library books and 
journals
33 1/3% straight line

Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions paid to private pension plans of 
certain employees are charged to the income 
statement in the period in which they become 
payable. Contributions paid to the group 
personal pension plans of employees are 
charged to the income statement in the period in 
which they become payable.
Share-based payment transactions
All share-based payment arrangements granted 
after 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
prior to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange 
for the grant of any share-based payment are 
measured at their fair values.  Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, 
the fair values of employees’ services are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair 
value of the instrument granted to the employee.  
This fair value is appraised at the grant date 
and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales 
growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are 
ultimately recognised as an expense in the 
income statement with a corresponding credit to 
the share option reserve.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting 
conditions apply, the expense is allocated 
over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share 
options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised 
subsequently if there is any indication that the 
number of share options expected to vest 
differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative 
adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the 
current period.  No adjustment is made to any 
expense recognised in prior periods if share 
options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds 
received net of attributable transaction costs are 
credited to reserves.
Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
“Share premium” represents the excess over  >
nominal value of the fair value of consideration 
received for equity shares, net of expenses of 
the share issue.
“Capital redemption reserve” represents when  >
the entire deferred ordinary share capital was 
bought in exchange for one ordinary 1p share. 
“Merger reserve” which arose as a result of  >
a group reconstruction that occurred on 17 
November 2000.  This represents the issued 
share capital and share premium account in 
the Company’s subsidiary undertaking, Idox 
Software Limited.
“Share options reserve” represents shares to  >
be issued on potential exercise of those share 
options that have been accounted for under 
“IFRS 2 Share Based Payments”.
“ESOP trust” represents share capital  >
purchased to satisfy the liability of the 
employee share scheme. Purchased shares 
are classified within the ESOP trust reserve 
and presented as a deduction from total 
equity.
“Retained earnings” represents retained  >
profits.
“Treasury reserve” represents shares  >
repurchased by the company to be held for 
redistribution as share options.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises 
current and deferred tax.  Current tax is 
charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income except where it relates to tax on items 
recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
charged to equity.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on 
taxable profit for the year.  
Deferred income taxes are calculated using 
the liability method on temporary differences.  
Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 35
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts cont’d 
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  
However, deferred tax is not provided on the 
initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability unless the 
related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit.  Deferred tax on 
temporary differences associated with shares in 
subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these 
temporary differences can be controlled by the 
group and it is probable that reversal will not 
occur in the foreseeable future.  In addition, tax 
losses available to be carried forward as well as 
other income credits to the group are assessed 
for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, 
with no discounting.  Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences 
will be able to be offset against future taxable 
income.  Current and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are 
expected to apply to their respective period 
of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
recognised as a component of tax expense in 
the statement of comprehensive income, except 
where they relate to items that are charged or 
credited directly to equity in which case the 
related deferred tax is also charged or credited 
directly to equity.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as operating leases.  All leases are operating in 
nature.  Amounts paid under operating leases 
are charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight line basis over the lease 
term.
Dividend distributions
Interim dividends in respect of equity shares 
are recognised in the financial statements in the 
period in which they are paid.
Final dividends in respect of equity shares are 
recognised in the financial statements in the 
period that the dividends are formally approved.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentation currency of 
Idox plc and its United Kingdom subsidiaries 
is the pound sterling (£).  Transactions in 
foreign currencies are initially recorded at the 
functional currency rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction.  Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the functional currency rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  
All differences are taken to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
In the consolidated financial statements, the 
assets and liabilities of non-sterling functional 
currency subsidiaries, are translated into pound 
sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The results of non-sterling 
functional currency subsidiaries are translated 
into pound sterling using average rates of 
exchange. Exchange adjustments arising are 
taken to a separate component of equity and 
reported in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Capital policy
The Group’s objectives when managing 
capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure 
that optimises the cost of capital.  In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid 
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or 
issue new shares. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when 
the Group has become a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified according to the 
substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into.  
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and 
are initially stated at their fair value, as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.  All receivables are  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 36
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
considered for impairment.  Provision against 
trade receivables is made when there is 
objective evidence that the group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due in accordance 
with the original terms of those receivables.  The 
amount of the write-down is determined as the 
difference between the assets carrying value and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on 
hand and on deposit and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.  
Investments
Investments consist of available-for-sale 
investments in equity instruments which are 
measured at market prices.  Movements 
in market value are recognised through the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.  In the event of a disposal of an 
available-for-sale financial asset , the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is transferred to the profit 
and loss account.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are 
classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into.  An 
equity instrument is any contact that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the group after 
deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts 
are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct 
transaction costs.  Such instruments are 
subsequently carried at their amortised cost and 
finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption, are recognised 
in the income statement over the term of the 
instrument using an effective rate of interest.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest-
bearing, are initially stated at their fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are 
recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 37

and finance income. Segment profit reported to the board represents the profit earned by each segment before the 
allocation of tax, interest payments and share option charges.  The assets and liabilities of the Group are not reviewed 
by the chief executive decision-maker on a segment basis.

Impairment test for goodwill
For this review goodwill was allocated to individual Cash Generating Units (CGU) on the basis of the Group’s operations.
The carrying value of goodwill by each CGU is as follows:
2011 2010
£000 £000
Cash Generating Units (CGU)
Software 19,642 17,870
Idox Information Solutions 3,837 3,804
TFPL Recruitment 1,957 1,957
25,436 23,631
The recoverable amount of all CGU’s has been determined using value-in-use calculations.  These calculations use pre-
tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering the next five financial years.  
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
For value in use calculations, the growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on 
management’s best estimate of short term performance based on an assessment of market opportunities and macro-
economic conditions. In the year to 31 October 2011 and the year to 31 October 2010, the Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital for the Group has been used as an appropriate discount rate to apply to cash flows. This represents the overall 
required return on the Group as a whole and is also considered appropriate to each CGU.
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the Group has been applied to CGU cash flows rather than calculating a 
separate one for each CGU.  This had been done given the common factors such as equity and debt which cannot be 
apportioned to individual CGUs. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 48
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
The assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows and are considered appropriate for each of the risk 
profiles of the respective CGU:
2011 2010
Discount rate 12.5% 12.5%
Growth rate 2% 2%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU.
Sensitivities have been run on cash flow forecasts for all CGU’s. Management are satisfied that the key assumptions are 
achievable and that reasonably possible changes to those key assumptions would not lead to the carrying amount of the 
relevant CGU exceeding the recoverable amount.

The provision allowance in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is 
satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible.  At that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable 
and are written off against the trade receivable directly.  Where trade receivables are past due an assessment is made 
of individual customers and the outstanding balance.  No provision is required in respect of amounts owed by group 
undertakings.

21 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits and bank 
borrowings. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has 
other financial instruments which mainly comprise trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its 
operations.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the board of directors. The 
Group finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. The board provides guidance on overall risk 
management including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, and investment of excess liquidity.
The impact of the risks required to be discussed under IFRS 7 are detailed below:
Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in 
a currency that is not the group’s functional currency.  The Group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a 
result of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions.
(ii) Price risk
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk due to investments held by the Group.  The Group is not exposed 
to commodity price risk.
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of cash balances held with banks and other highly rated 
counterparties.
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.  Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the 
Group to cash flow interest rate risk.  Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.  
During 2011 and 2010, all the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in UK Sterling.
Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the 
reporting date, as summarised below:
2011 2010
Classes of financial  assets - carrying amounts £000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents - 2,004
Trade receivables 5,973 4,509
Amounts recoverable on contracts 1,695 484
Assets available for sale - 855
Other receivables 167 100
Financial assets at fair value 7,835 7,952
Credit risk is managed on a group basis.  Credit risks arise from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks 
and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed 
transactions.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.  It is the policy of the Group to present the 
amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based 
on prior experience and the current economic environment. The Group reviews the reliability of its customers on a 
regular basis, such a review takes into account the nature of the Group’s trading history with the customer. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 54
For the year ended 31 October 2011
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are three banks with high credit-ratings assigned 
by international credit-rating agencies. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance of these 
counterparties.
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Liquidity risk
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments 
on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet obligations of the Group as they fall due.
The board receives regular debt management forecasts which estimate the cash inflows and outflows over the next 
twelve months, so that management can ensure that sufficient financing is in place as it is required.  Surplus cash within 
the Group is put on deposit in accordance with limits and counterparties agreed by the Board, the objective being to 
maximise return on funds whilst ensuring that the short-term cashflow requirements of the Group are met.
Detailed analysis of the debt facilities taken out and available to the Group are disclosed in note 19.  
 
As at 31 October 2011, the Group’s financial liabilities have contractual maturities (including interest payments where 
applicable) as summarised below:
Current Current Non-current Non-current
Within 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 5 years Later than 5 years
£000 £000 £000 £000
Bank borrowings 2,408 - - -
Trade and other payables 2,304 - - -
This compares to the maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities in the previous reporting period as follows:
Current Current Non-current Non-current
Within 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 5 years Later than 5 years
£000 £000 £000 £000
Bank borrowings 565 553 2,095 -
Trade and other payables 2,784 - - -
The above amounts reflect the contractual undiscounted cashflows, which may differ from the carrying values of the 
liabilities at the reporting date.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure 
to reduce the cost of capital.  In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debts. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55
For the year ended 31 October 2011

non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The company recognised total expenses of £1,064,000 (2010: £185,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions during the year.
Transitional Provisions
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 share options granted prior to 7 November 2002 but not vested at 1 November 
2006 fall outside the measurement and recognition criteria of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”.

24 ACQUISITIONS
McLaren Software Group Limited
On 13 December 2010, the Group acquired the entire share capital of McLaren Software Group Limited (McLaren) for a 
consideration of £3.
McLaren is a leading supplier of engineering document management and control applications serving many leading 
international companies in industries including oil & gas, mining, utilities, pharmaceuticals and transportation.
The acquisition of McLaren extends Idox’s core skills in planning and building documents management into the related 
area of engineering drawings.  This will provide Idox with the opportunity of broadening its activities into complementary 
UK and international markets in both the private and public sector, particularly where the management of complex 
engineering systems interacts with regulatory oversight.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of McLaren has been capitalised and consists largely of the workforce value, 
synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of McLaren with Idox.  None of the goodwill 
recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  The purchase of McLaren has been accounted for 
using the acquisition method of accounting.

is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  The purchase of LalPac has been accounted for using the 
acquisition method of accounting.

was £685k.  LalPac also contributed profit of £191k over the same period.

Interactive Dialogues Limited
On 7 November 2011, the Group acquired Interactive Dialogues Limited and Interactive Dialogues NV (“ID”) for 
a total consideration of €2.2m (£1.9m) in cash.  ID is a leading supplier of e-learning and information solutions in 
Europe enabling organisations to conduct ‘dialogues’ with employees, customers and suppliers to achieve legislative 
compliance in areas such as Competition Law and the UK Bribery Act. The company is based in the UK and Belgium 
and its global client base includes Associated British Foods, Hays, E.ON AG, Alstom, PricewaterhouseCoopers, AB 
InBev and Xstrata.
An initial payment of €2m has been made on completion and a further €0.2m is payable one year after completion 
subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. ID had revenues of €2.4m for the year ended 31 May 2011.    
The acquisition of ID extends the range of solutions available within the Idox Information Solutions business and 
provides Idox with an e-learning platform that will be used to support customers across the Group. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61

CTSpace
On 15 November 2011 the Group acquired CTSpace, an engineering and construction sector document management 
and control business, for £11.6m in cash from Sword Group. 
CTSpace provides document management and collaboration workflow applications for the global construction and 
engineering industry and will complement the McLaren Software business that Idox acquired in December 2010.
CTSpace, which is headquartered in London, had revenues of £12.7m (approximately half of these were generated in 
Europe and half in North America), which generated EBITDA of £1.7m and pre-tax profit of £1.3m for the year ended 31 
December 2010 when CTSpace had net assets of £4.1m. The business had cash at completion of £0.5m. Idox will fund 
the acquisition entirely from a new term and revolving credit facility through its existing relationship with Lloyds Banking 
Group.
CTSpace provides both Software as a Service (‘SaaS’) and on-premise enterprise solutions, the latter of which leverage 
an organization’s existing investment in leading enterprise content management (‘ECM’) platforms such as IBM 
FileNet®, EMC Documentum® or Microsoft SharePoint®. When deployed with leading enterprise content management 
platforms, CTSpace’s products provide an integrated, best practice environment that supports a project’s entire 
lifecycle.
With the existing resources of McLaren Software and the Group’s integrated software development resource, the 
addition of CTSpace brings further scale, efficiencies and enhanced product and development capabilities.
The Idox Board expects the acquisition to be earnings enhancing in its first year.
Full IFRS 3(R) disclosure has not been included in the financial statements due to the timing of the acquisitions.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards and under the historical 
cost convention, except for the valuation of listed 
investments.
No profit and loss account is presented for the 
Company as permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act, 2006.
Investments
Investments, held as fixed assets, are included 
at cost less amounts written off for any 
permanent diminution in value. Investments 
in a UK listed company are measured at 
market prices.  Movements in market value are 
recognised through the revaluation reserve.
FRS 20 Share Based Payment
All share-based payment arrangements granted 
after 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
prior to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange 
for the grant of any share-based payment are 
measured at their fair values.  Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, 
the fair values of employees’ services are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair 
value of the instrument granted to the employee.  
This fair value is appraised at the grant date 
and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales 
growth targets).
Employees to whom share options have been 
granted provide their services in subsidiary 
companies of Idox Plc.  All equity settled share-
based payments are recognised as an expense 
in the profit and loss account of the relevant 
subsidiary company.  In Idox Plc, the cost is 
allocated to investments in subsidiaries.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting 
conditions apply, the expense is allocated 
over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share 
options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised 
subsequently if there is any indication that the 
number of share options expected to vest 
differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative 
adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the 
current period.  No adjustment is made to any 
expense recognised in prior periods if share 
options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds 
received net of attributable transaction costs are 
credited to reserves.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing 
differences where the transactions or events 
that give the company an obligation to pay more 
tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the 
future, have occurred by the balance sheet date.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is 
more likely than not that they will be recovered.  
Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are 
classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the entity after 
deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial 
instruments (including share capital) are 
equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those 
financial instruments are classed as financial 
liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as 
such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and 
gains or losses relating to financial liabilities are 
included in the profit and loss account. Finance 
costs are calculated so as to produce a constant 
rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do 
not have any terms meeting the definition of a 
financial liability then this is classed as an equity 
instrument. Dividends and distributions relating 
to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
Interest and expenditure arising on financial 
instruments is recognised on the accruals basis 
and credited or charged to the profit and loss 
account in the financial period to which it relates.  
The company does not apply FRS 26. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 65
For the year ended 31 October 2011

Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.  
All leases are operating in nature.  Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a 
straight line basis over the lease term.
2 DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES
There are no wages and salaries paid by the parent company.
The company has no employees and directors are remunerated by other group companies.  Details of the remuneration 
for each director are included in the Report on Remuneration which can be found on page 16 but which do not form 
part of the audited accounts.

4 LOSS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
The parent company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own 
profit and loss account in these financial statements.  The parent company’s loss for the year was £503,000 (2010: loss

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share price over the previous 
3 years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The company recognised total expenses of £1,064,000 (2010: £185,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions during the year.
Transitional Provisions

The capital redemption reserve for the Group and the Company was created during 2003 when the entire deferred 
ordinary share capital was bought in exchange for one ordinary 1p share.  Other reserves relate to the issued share 
capital and share premium account in the Company’s subsidiary undertaking, Idox Software Limited, and has been 
treated in accordance with FRS 6 under merger accounting. The share options reserve represents shares to be issued 
on potential exercise of those share options that have been accounted for under FRS20 (IFRS2) Share Based Payments.
The purpose of the Treasury Reserve is to enable the board to issue share options to employees.
Idox plc paid an interim dividend to shareholders in August 2011.  It has recently come to the attention of the Directors 
that although there were sufficient reserves in the Group, technically there were insufficient distributable reserves in Idox 
plc itself after being advised that treasury reserves should be included within the definition of distributable reserves.  The 
situation has been remedied since the accounts date by declaring a £7m dividend from Idox Software Ltd to Idox plc.

13 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
As the parent company of a wholly-owned group, the Company is exempt from the requirements of FRS 8 to disclose 
transactions with other members of the Group headed by Idox plc.
As in the prior year, no transactions with other related parties, including key management personnel, were undertaken 
with the company.
14 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
The Group signed a revolving loan facility of £10m and an acquisition funding facility of £12m on 14 November 2011.
Interactive Dialogues Limited
On 7 November 2011, the Group acquired Interactive Dialogues Limited and Interactive Dialogues NV (“ID”) for 
a total consideration of €2.2m (£1.9m) in cash.  ID is a leading supplier of e-learning and information solutions in 
Europe enabling organisations to conduct ‘dialogues’ with employees, customers and suppliers to achieve legislative 
compliance in areas such as Competition Law and the UK Bribery Act. The company is based in the UK and Belgium 
and its global client base includes Associated British Foods, Hays, E.ON AG, Alstom, PricewaterhouseCoopers, AB 
InBev and Xstrata.
An initial payment of €2m has been made on completion and a further €0.2m is payable one year after completion 
subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. ID had revenues of €2.4m for the year ended 31 May 2011.    
The acquisition of ID extends the range of solutions available within the Idox Information Solutions business and 
provides Idox with an e-learning platform that will be used to support customers across the Group.
CTSpace
On 15 November 2011 the Group acquired CTSpace, an engineering and construction sector document management 
and control business, for £11.6m in cash from Sword Group. 
CTSpace provides document management and collaboration workflow applications for the global construction and 
engineering industry and will complement the McLaren Software business that Idox acquired in December 2010.
CTSpace, which is headquartered in London, had revenues of £12.7m (approximately half of these were generated in 
Europe and half in North America), which generated EBITDA of £1.7m and pre-tax profit of £1.3m for the year ended 31 
December 2010 when CTSpace had net assets of £4.1m. The business had cash at completion of £0.5m. Idox will fund 
the acquisition entirely from a new term and revolving credit facility through its existing relationship with Lloyds Banking 
Group.
CTSpace provides both Software as a Service (‘SaaS’) and on-premise enterprise solutions, the latter of which leverage 
an organization’s existing investment in leading enterprise content management (‘ECM’) platforms such as IBM 
FileNet®, EMC Documentum® or Microsoft SharePoint®. When deployed with leading enterprise content management 
platforms, CTSpace’s products provide an integrated, best practice environment that supports a project’s entire 
lifecycle.
With the existing resources of McLaren Software and the Group’s integrated software development resource, the 
addition of CTSpace brings further scale, efficiencies and enhanced product and development capabilities.
The Idox Board expect the acquisition to be earnings enhancing in its first year. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 73

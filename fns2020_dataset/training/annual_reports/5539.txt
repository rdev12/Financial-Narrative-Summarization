2 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008
Chairman’s Statement
In the year to 30 September 2008, EBITDA before exceptional items fell by 3.0% to £512 million and profit
before tax and exceptional items fell by 12.6% to £263 million. However, adjusted earnings per share were 39.2
pence, a decrease of only 1% over the prior year due to a reduction in the weighted average number of shares
in issue.
Trading throughout the year has been difficult and became progressively more challenging during the second
half when we would normally have seen an increase in profits compared to the first six months. This year
however, pro forma EBITDA was the same in both half-year periods as consumers responded to the economic
pressures by reducing their expenditure on discretionary items.
At the interim stage we increased the dividend by 12% to 5.8 pence per share and the Board is now
recommending an unchanged final dividend of 10.4 pence per share, giving a total for the year of 16.2 pence
per share, an increase of 3.8% over the prior year. Dividend cover based on adjusted earnings is 2.4 times and
the final dividend of 10.4 pence will be payable on 26 January 2009 to shareholders on the register on
5 January 2009.
During the year, we have witnessed increasingly difficult economic conditions and turbulent financial markets,
which have prompted a comprehensive review of our business plans and financial structure. Our operational
focus, as always, is to optimise trading profit and during the period we remain in recession we will invest both
in our pubs and in support of our licensees whilst disposing of those outlets which no longer have a viable
economic future as a pub. Financially, we enjoy strong cash flows and secure long-term debt with no refinancing
requirement until 2011, in preparation for which we will take opportunities to reduce debt levels.
In July 2008, we announced the appointment of David Maloney as an independent non-executive director of
the Company. His expertise, knowledge and experience gained from senior roles in UK and international based
service industries will further strengthen the Board and be of great benefit to the Company. It is intended that at
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in January 2009 David Maloney will succeed David Harding as
Chairman of the Audit Committee and Susan Murray will succeed Jo Stewart as Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. Both David Harding and Jo Stewart will continue as members of the Board and Jo Stewart will
remain as Senior Independent Director.
Given the current economic climate we are likely to see some further decline in trading profit until economic
conditions and consumer confidence improve. Nevertheless, the quality of our pub estate in which we are
continuing to invest alongside our licensees will ensure that we meet the challenges of reduced and changing
consumer demand from a strong platform and be well positioned to benefit from economic recovery when this
occurs.

Chief Executive’s Review
(Incorporating the Business Review)
RESULTS
This has been a very difficult year for the pub industry. In addition to the first full year impact of the ban on
smoking in public places, our licensees have had to endure a serious deterioration in consumer spending and
confidence brought about through rising costs and taxes, the virtual collapse of the banking system and a UK
economy sliding further into recession.
As a result, the year to 30 September 2008 has presented many challenges to the Enterprise team and our
licensees. EBITDA decreased by 3% to £512 million and profit before tax and exceptional items fell to £263
million, giving adjusted earnings per share of 39.2 pence, a decrease of 1% over the prior year.
Nevertheless, the majority of our pubs continue to trade successfully, albeit with licensees having to work much
smarter and harder simply to stand still in terms of profitability. Whilst average EBITDA per pub for the whole
estate decreased by 3% to £66,000 during the year, those pubs which are let on long-term substantive lease or
tenancy agreements, representing some 82% of our estate, actually grew EBITDA by 2% to an average of
£73,000.
Free cash flow remained strong at £62 million for the year, based upon operating cash inflow of £536 million
after deduction of mandatory payments in respect of net interest and taxation (£323 million) and discretionary
payments in respect of capital expenditure and dividends (£151 million).
At the interim stage, we increased the dividend by 12% to 5.8 pence per share and the Board is recommending
an unchanged final dividend of 10.4 pence, giving a total for the year of 16.2 pence per share, an increase of
3.8% over the prior year. Dividend cover based on adjusted earnings is 2.4 times. The final dividend will be
payable on 26 January 2009 to shareholders on the register on 5 January 2009.
TEAM
The Enterprise team has worked with great commitment to provide a top quality service to our licensees in these
difficult times, with the entire organisation structured in such a way as to allow our field-based operations and
property teams to maximise the time spent with licensees.
Effective training remains a key focus and we are delighted that our award-winning Associate Regional Manager
programme continues to attract top quality candidates to the business. Furthermore, we have this year
introduced a key skills certification programme, to ensure that everyone maintains the highest standards of
technical ability and professionalism in all dealings with our licensees. We are proud that six of the team
reached the finals of the annual ALMR operations manager awards with Joe Smith, our Regional Manager for
North Tyneside, winning the overall title.
LICENSEES
Through these testing times, the fairness and resilience of the leased and tenanted partnership has seen
Enterprise providing unprecedented support to licensees. During the year, rent concessions and special discount
schemes costing more than £9 million were provided to a total of 1,453 licensees. Such schemes are designed
to help a licensee trade out of difficulty and we are heartened by the enthusiastic response of licensees and the
level of success achieved. At 30 September some 855 licensees were receiving these special concessions, a
level which has now reduced as some greater stability is achieved in the estate.
Based upon our annual review of the pub estate, we estimate that the average level of potential licensee
profitability has fallen by around 4% to £45,000. Whilst the growth in food revenues has to some extent offset
declining beer sales, overhead costs have increased. There are of course wide variations in performance,
depending upon the retail profile of each outlet. Not surprisingly, smaller, wet-led outlets have suffered most,
with some becoming unviable in the face of the smoking ban and aggressive pricing of alcohol in the off trade.

Chief Executive’s Review
(Incorporating the Business Review)
The key performance indicators of licensee financial health have worsened during this period of difficult trading
but most remain robust despite the challenging conditions:
 During the year, there was a small increase in the number of formal applications to take a pub with
Enterprise, with the number relatively stable at around 130 per month. There are currently 577 fully
funded applicants on our database.
 With 82% of the estate let on substantive leases and tenancies, many licensee changes take the form of
lease assignments. There have been fewer assignments during the year, down from 790 in 2007 to 483
in 2008, with the average premium, excluding fixtures and fittings, down 9% to an average of £63,000
(£79,000 including tenants’ fixtures and fittings).
 Rent concessions for the year ended 30 September 2008 amounted to £2.7 million. In addition, the cost
of special discount schemes granted during the year amounted to £6.4 million. At 30 September 2008
the combined cost of rent concessions and special discount schemes was running at a monthly rate of
£1.3 million.
 915 rent reviews were completed during the year, with an average rental increase of 2.2% per annum.
 Overdue balances have increased during the year but still stand at less than 1% of turnover. Bad debt
costs have similarly increased but remain low at 0.1% of turnover.
Whilst the majority of licensees comply with the terms of their agreements and work closely with the Enterprise
team to develop trade and improve profitability, there are some who fail to meet agreed payment terms or who
blatantly and consistently breach their obligations under the tie. We have taken a straightforward stance in these
circumstances, preferring to terminate agreements and remove the offending licensees. This has led to an
increase in the number of closed and holding over pubs, the latter where the licensee remains in occupation
without paying rent or buying beer pending settlement or eviction. The number of closed and holding over pubs
has reduced since the year end and we expect this trend to continue.
ESTATE
During the year, Enterprise invested £68 million into the estate, working alongside licensees to improve facilities
in more than 1,587 pubs. Having enjoyed two years of increased investment to deal with issues arising from the
ban on smoking, we now expect to return to a normal level of capital investment, at around £45 million per year.
The estates team purchased 58 top quality pubs at an average cost of £828,000 during the year. We also
disposed of 58 underperforming and high alternative use value outlets, plus various other plots of land, achieving
sale proceeds of £30 million and a profit above book value of £2 million. During the coming year, the team will
focus on disposing of underperforming outlets, predominantly for alternative use. Although the market is
subdued as a result of the lack of credit available to developers, we remain confident that the disposal
programme will deliver a significant amount of cash and a profit above book value. We have already this year
exchanged or completed on sales amounting to £13 million and have a further £23 million of transactions
agreed and in the hands of solicitors.
The annual valuation of the estate, carried out on a basis consistent with previous years, resulted in a 1%
revaluation uplift to £5.9 billion, equivalent to an average value of £755,000 per pub. The estate is valued on a
pub by pub basis and, as one would expect with an estate of our size and variety, there are significant variations
underlying the increase in valuation. Overall, some 4,900 pubs increased in value, 2,500 fell in value and the
balance remained the same.

Chief Executive’s Review
(Incorporating the Business Review)
GROUP FINANCING
Debt facilities
The Group has a flexible financing structure in place, including bank facilities, corporate bonds and securitised
bonds. At 30 September 2008, underlying net debt was £3,704 million compared to £3,716 million at the start
of the year. At the year end the Group’s borrowings were 89% fixed for an average period of 10 years at an
average interest rate of 6.5%.
The five year bank facility of £1 billion expires in May 2011 with no amortisation schedule. A programme has
been introduced to reduce the level of borrowings under this facility prior to commencing refinancing
discussions with the banks.
The corporate bonds mature between 2014 and 2031 and the securitised bonds fully amortise by 2032, with the
next mandatory repayment of £2 million due in June 2010.
Liquidity and Financial Covenants
At the year end, committed bank facilities of £69 million were undrawn and the bank facility agreement permits
the arrangement of up to a further £100 million of additional borrowings. A liquidity facility of £190 million is in
place in respect of the securitised bonds.
All debt facilities have financial covenants which are tested on a periodic basis. The covenant tests confirmed
that appropriate headroom was maintained throughout the year. Financial forecasts are prepared on a regular
basis and reviewed by the Board to ensure ongoing compliance with all covenants.
TAX CHARGE
The pre-exceptional tax charge of 26% is lower than was expected to apply at the interim stage as most
enquiries relating to 2004 and 2005 have now been closed and no enquiries have been received in respect of
2006. It is expected that the corporation tax rate of 28% will apply in 2009.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the
Income Statement. Exceptional items are those which are specifically identified by virtue of their size or nature
to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. As a result, the Group focuses on ‘pre-
exceptional’ performance measures in order to compare underlying performance year on year.
The most significant exceptional item in the year is the movement arising from the revaluation of the pub estate
of £53 million. This is the charge taken to the Income Statement in respect of pubs that have been revalued
below historic cost. The exceptional tax credit of £48 million includes a £33 million credit in relation to
indexation on the tax base cost of certain properties.
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITs)
The Board remains attracted to the principle and benefits of conversion to a REIT and we have made excellent
progress agreeing all technical and valuation methodology issues with HMRC.
However, in light of the current turmoil in the financial markets, the Board does not consider it appropriate to
progress matters further at this time. We are therefore adopting a cautious approach to the costs and processes
of conversion, continuing to work with our advisers to explore the options and develop a total solution which is
demonstrably in the best long-term interests of all stakeholders. We are not working to a particular timetable
and will make further announcements as and when appropriate.

Chief Executive’s Review
(Incorporating the Business Review)
INDUSTRY ISSUES
Responsible drinking
For the vast majority of pub-goers in the UK, the pub is “the home of responsible drinking”, providing a safe and
professionally supervised environment for responsible adults to enjoy food, drink and sociable good company. It
is a tragedy that such an important part of the fabric of British life is under attack from a Government too often
influenced by exaggerated media coverage and the voices of unrepresentative minorities. Whilst doing nothing
to curb the off trade sale of cut price alcohol into an unsupervised environment, ministers seek to appease the
lobbyists with talk of ever greater regulation and control. There will of course always be a few rogue operators
who encourage irresponsible behaviour but it is reassuring to learn that the Association of Chief Police Officers
considers that the police have sufficient powers in the existing Licensing Act to regulate pubs, their spokesman
on licensing saying “I’m comfortable with the amount of legislation that we have at the moment”. The industry
does not need more regulation, it needs robust and consistent enforcement of the laws that already exist.
Business and Enterprise Committee (BEC) inquiry
The forthcoming review by the BEC into how the pub companies have responded to the recommendations of the
2004 Trade and Industry Select Committee (TISC) will provide Enterprise with an opportunity to demonstrate how
it has led the way in ensuring clarity, transparency and fairness in all its dealings with licensees. With small
businesses under pressure and with more than 30 pubs per week reported to be closing permanently, this is a
time when the support that can be offered by pub companies under the leased and tenanted model provides
welcome relief for many struggling licensees. It should come as no surprise that the rate of pub closures is
materially higher in the free trade, where the business partner is most likely a bank manager with a remit to
control or reduce credit limits, rather than a Regional Manager whose first priority is to support a deserving
licensee.
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In very difficult circumstances, the Enterprise team has worked tirelessly to deliver solid results. The quality of
the estate has improved as a result of successful investment. The vast majority of licensees remain profitable
and comply with the terms of their leases and tenancies. Financially, we enjoy strong cash flows and secure
long-term debt with no refinancing requirement until 2011, in preparation for which we will take opportunities
to reduce debt levels.
The coming year will present further challenges and we must expect to offer support through rent concessions
and special discounts to licensees who find themselves in difficulty. Equally, we must anticipate that consumer
discretionary spending will remain under pressure and beer sales will go on declining as the UK moves further
into recession. However, if falling interest rates and lower inflation begin to engender a sense of greater
confidence amongst consumers, Enterprise will be well placed to return to a position of delivering solid growth
in shareholder value.

Accounts and dividends
The Group profit for the year, after taxation, amounted to £189 million (2007 — £291 million) and is dealt with
as shown in the Group Income Statement.
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 10.4 pence (2007 — 10.4 pence) per ordinary share to
be approved at the Annual General Meeting on 22 January 2009. The final dividend will be paid on 26 January
2009 to members on the register on 5 January 2009. When added to the interim dividend of 5.8 pence (2007 —
5.2 pence), this produces a total dividend for the year of 16.2 pence (2007 — 15.6 pence) per ordinary share.
Principal activities and review of the business
The principal activity of the Group continues to be that of a leased and tenanted pub operator in the UK.

General Meeting by rotation and offers himself for reappointment. The Board believes that Mr Reid’s
performance continues to be effective, that he demonstrates commitment to his role and has a range of skills
and experience relevant to the direction and control of the Company. In addition, Mr Reid considers that he has
sufficient time to commit to the Company’s affairs notwithstanding his other business commitments and has
no conflicting interests. Having been appointed since the last Annual General Meeting, the reappointment of
Mr Maloney is also being proposed.
Other than employment contracts, at no time during the year did any of the directors have an interest in any
contract with the Group. The interests of the directors in the share capital of the Company, other than with respect
to options to acquire ordinary shares (which are detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report), were as follows:

Company, to appoint one or more proxies and, if they are corporations, corporate representatives and to exercise
voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may receive a dividend and on a liquidation may share in the assets of
the Company. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s annual report and accounts.
Subject to meeting certain thresholds, holders of ordinary shares may requisition a general meeting of the
Company or the proposal of resolutions at Annual General Meetings.
Voting Rights and Restrictions on Transfer of Shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of ordinary shares present in person and
entitled to vote, and every proxy duly appointed by a member entitled to vote, has one vote and on a poll every
member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote for every ordinary share held. Further
details regarding voting at the Annual General Meeting can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages
22 to 23 and in the explanatory notes to the notice of the Annual General Meeting on pages 114 to 115. Details of
the exercise of voting rights attached to the ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Trusts are set out in the
section entitled ‘Shares held by the Employee Share Trusts’ below. Voting rights for the ordinary shares held in
treasury are suspended. None of the ordinary shares, including the shares held by the Employee Share Trusts, carry
any special rights with regard to control of the Company. Electronic and paper proxy appointments and voting
instructions must be received by the Company’s registrars not later than 48 hours before a general meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than:
 certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider
trading laws);
 pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code whereby the directors and certain employees of the
Company require approval to deal in the Company’s shares; and
 where a person with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s certificated shares has been served with
a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those
shares.
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the
transfer of ordinary shares and on voting rights.
Own shares acquired by the Company
At the Annual General Meeting held on 17 January 2008, the Company was given authority to purchase up to
76,145,817 of its ordinary shares during the next 18 months or until the date of its next Annual General
Meeting. During the financial year the Company, utilising this authority and the authority given at the Annual
General Meeting on 16 January 2007, made on market purchases totalling 5,489,619 of its own ordinary shares
of 2.5 pence each, representing 1.07% of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) at the beginning of
the year, for an aggregate consideration of £29.3 million (excluding costs). These shares were cancelled. As at
30 September 2008 50,000,000 shares were held in treasury. The maximum number of shares held in treasury
during the year ended 30 September 2008 was 50,000,000 on 1 October 2007 for a period of 365 days,
representing 8.9% of total called up share capital at that time. The present authority for the Company to
purchase its own shares will expire at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 22 January 2009. The directors
will be seeking a new authority for the Company to purchase its ordinary shares which will only be exercised if
market conditions make it advantageous to do so. It is expected that any shares purchased pursuant to a share
buy-back programme will be cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly. Alternatively, the
shares may be purchased and held as treasury shares. Further details are set out in the explanatory notes to the
notice of the Annual General Meeting on pages 114 to 115.
Shares held by Employee Share Trusts
The Company has established an employee benefit trust (‘EBT’), the trustee of which is Halifax EES Trustees
International Limited. As at 30 September 2008 the trustee held 8,768,087 shares, representing 1.73% of the
total called up share capital excluding treasury shares at that date, which are used to satisfy awards made under
the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and other share option schemes. The voting rights in relation to these shares
are exercisable by the trustee; however, in accordance with investor protection guidelines, the trustee abstains
from voting. The executive directors as employees of the Company are potential beneficiaries of shares held by
the EBT.

Directors’ Report
The Company had also established a Quest Trust to hold shares to satisfy awards made under the Save As You
Earn share option scheme, the trustee of which is Enterprise Inns Quest Trustees Limited. The Quest Trust was
terminated on 8 August 2008 and therefore as at 30 September 2008 this trustee held no shares. Before the
Quest was terminated, the executive directors as employees of the Company were potential beneficiaries of
shares held by the Quest. During the year, the Quest Trust purchased 119,488 of the Company’s shares. These
shares were purchased for a consideration of £0.5 million (net of expenses) and had a nominal value of £2,987.
The maximum number of shares held by the EBT and Quest Trust during the year ended 30 September 2008 was
10,027,700 on 1 October 2007, representing 1.96% of total called up share capital excluding treasury shares at
that time.
During the year, 1,819,637 shares with a nominal value of £45,491 were disposed of by the EBT and Quest Trust
by way of the exercise of share options under the share schemes. Of these, a total of 816,501 shares were
disposed of through the long-term incentive schemes for a consideration of £10 and a total of 390,456 shares
were disposed of through the Quest Trust for a consideration of £0.5 million.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (adopted by special resolution on 17 January 2008) may only be amended
by special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders.
Significant Agreements
The Company has entered into supply and distribution contracts with Scottish & Newcastle UK Limited and InBev
UK Limited which are terminable upon a change of control of the Company.
In addition, the Company is a party to certain funding documents which contain provisions that allow the
counterparties to terminate funding to the Company in certain circumstances where there has been a change of
control of the Company. These include:
 The second supplemental credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) dated 15 May 2006 between the
Company and the financial institutions named in the Credit Agreement which provides that if any person
or persons acting in concert gains control of the Company, the Company must promptly notify the agent
and the lenders must then negotiate with the Company with a view to continuing the loan facilities
under the Credit Agreement. If at the end of the required time frame, the Company has not received a
notice of continuance of the loan facilities from the lenders, the loan facilities will be terminated and all
of the loan commitments cancelled under the Credit Agreement; and
 The £60 million 6% Secured Bonds due 2014, the £125 million 6.875% Secured Bonds due 2025, the
£125 million 6.875% Secured Bonds due 2021, the £275 million 6.375% Secured Bonds due 2031, the
£600 million 6.5% Secured Bonds due 2018 (collectively the “Secured Bonds”), the terms and conditions
of each of which provide that following the occurrence of a restructuring event (defined in the terms and
conditions to include (i) any person or persons acting in concert becoming interested in more than 50%
of the shares of the Company, (ii) any person or group of connected persons acquiring control of the
Company, or (iii) any person or persons acquiring the right to appoint more than 50% of the directors of
Company) the Secured Bonds must, if they are not rated, after a written resolution of the bondholders, be
either redeemed by the Company or the Company must successfully seek an investment grade rating for
the Secured Bonds. If the Secured Bonds are rated, on a restructuring event, they must be redeemed by
the Company where such rating is below investment grade or later falls below investment grade.
Compensation for Loss of Office
There are no agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for
loss of office or employment that occurs as a result of a takeover bid. Further details of the directors’ service
contracts can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 33.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to grant the directors indemnities in relation to their
duties as directors, including qualifying third party indemnity provisions (within the meaning of the Companies

Directors’ Report
Act 2006) in respect of any liabilities incurred by them in connection with any negligence, default, breach of
duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company. No such indemnities have been granted.
Employment policies
The Group is dependent on the skills and commitment of its employees and recognises the importance of
creating a workplace in which all employees are inspired and enabled to give their best. A core set of common
values means that employees at all levels of the business are encouraged to make the fullest possible
contribution as their performance is central to the successful delivery of its objectives. To attract and retain these
skills the Group is committed to equal opportunities and the creation of an entirely non-discriminatory and
diverse working environment. The aim of the policy is to ensure that no job applicant or employee receives less
favourable treatment because of, amongst other matters, gender, marital status, race, age, sexual preference,
religion, belief or disability. All decisions are based on merit of the individual concerned. The Group is dedicated
to undertaking its business operations in a way which respects individual human rights, treats individuals with
dignity and allows freedom of association.
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the requirements
of the job can be adequately fulfilled by a handicapped or disabled person.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy wherever practicable to provide continuing
employment under normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career development and promotion
to disabled employees wherever appropriate.
The Group’s employment policies and procedures are described in detail in a Staff Handbook which is provided to
all employees upon joining the Group. The Staff Handbook is regularly reviewed and updated to take account of
relevant employment legislation and best practice, and new policies and procedures are developed if required.
These include specific policies on equal opportunities, flexible working, training and development, acceptance of
gifts and hospitality and whistle-blowing.
The Group has systems in place to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 to ensure the privacy of personal
information.
Employee involvement and reward
The Group actively encourages learning and development and believes that effective training is essential to the
maintenance and improvement of the Group’s success and individual performance. The Group is committed to
providing all employees with relevant training to meet the business needs of the Group and to improve
individual employee skills. In providing this training and support, we expect high standards and commitment in
return. All employees are provided with initial induction training and are set challenging personal objectives and
participate in discretionary bonus schemes.
The Group operates a comprehensive employee appraisal process which ensures that clear goals are set, personal
objectives are monitored, key competencies are assessed and any performance concerns addressed through
appropriate training and focus. Every employee has the opportunity to discuss work-related aspirations and
participate in appropriate training and development programmes.
During the year continued emphasis has been placed on effective communication regarding matters which may
affect employees and the overall performance and development of the Group. The policy of providing employees
with information about the Group has continued. Employee engagement is met through a variety of means,
including conducting an employee satisfaction survey, regular briefings and team meetings through its
management structure which allows a free flow of information and ideas via publications such as the ‘Innsider’
and ‘Eagle Eye’. Employees can also ask the executive management team questions on an anonymous basis via
the ‘Ask the Exec’ forum. In addition, an annual conference is held to which all employees are invited and which
provides an opportunity for employees to be made aware of key objectives and strategy. The use of email and the
corporate intranet supplement effective communication to all employees.

Directors’ Report
The Company continues to encourage employee ownership of its shares through the provision of the following
employee share plans administered by HBOS Employee Equity Solutions:
 The Save As You Earn Scheme in which 241 employees have entered into savings contracts for either five
or seven years at the end of which they are entitled to purchase shares at a discount of 20% to the
market price of the shares at the time of the issue of the options; and
 the Share Incentive Plan in which 294 employees have purchased shares out of pre-tax income up to
statutory limits which are held in a trust. Currently, the Company awards one free matching share for
each share bought by an employee.
In November 2007 the Company won the ifsProshare award for ‘Best overall performance in fostering Employee
Share Ownership’. This award demonstrates the Company’s continued commitment to encouraging employee
share ownership and reward.
Community, environment and corporate responsibility
The Group recognises its responsibilities to achieve good environmental practice and to continue to strive for
improvement in areas of environmental impact. Our approach is to work through education, communication and
direct action wherever possible. In addition the Group believes that the interests of responsible, entrepreneurial
pub businesses need to be aligned to the interests of local communities and consumers. We therefore seek to
ensure that our pubs provide a friendly, safe and controlled environment, and to promote the positive
contribution that pubs make to their local communities.
We work to ensure that we provide the right resources, energy and focus to meet the expectations of our
licensees and other stakeholders in this area. We have made good progress during the year which has been
recognised by our inclusion in the FTSE4Good index.
Full details of our responsibility policies and initiatives can be found on our website, www.enterpriseinns.com.
Charitable and Political Donations
At pub level, the Company supports local community initiatives and charitable causes through the appropriate
use of marketing investment. The Company does not make any corporate charitable donations. The Company has
not made any political donations during the year and intends to continue its policy of not doing so for the
foreseeable future.
Creditors’ payment policy and practice
The Group and the Company agree terms and conditions for their business transactions with suppliers. Payment
is then made in accordance with these terms, subject to the terms and conditions being met by the supplier.
At the year end the Group and the Company had an average of 43 days’ purchases outstanding in trade creditors.

Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors
are unaware; and
 the director has taken all of the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors
are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 234ZA of the
Companies Act 1985.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation to the Group financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the
European Union.
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the
financial position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In
preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable,
comparable and understandable information;

 state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply

Corporate Governance
Introduction
The Board recognises that good governance helps the business deliver its strategy, generate long-term
shareholder value and minimise risk. For the year under review the appropriate governance provisions are as set
out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance adopted by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2006
(the “Combined Code”).
The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance as set out in the Combined
Code provisions, the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control and appropriate best practice guidance issued by
investor bodies. Our corporate governance framework is directed in a manner which is responsible and in
accordance with high standards of honesty, transparency and accountability. The Board considers that this
statement on governance provides the information to enable shareholders to evaluate how the provisions and
principles of the Combined Code have been applied.
Statement by the directors on compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is responsible for the policies and controls put in place to discharge the Company’s responsibilities
under the Combined Code. These include, for example, a sound system of internal controls and risk management
procedures designed to ensure the Company’s policies achieve compliance.
Throughout the year ended 30 September 2008 the Company has been in full compliance with the provisions set
out in Section 1 of the Combined Code and the principles of good governance.
The Company has also complied with the Smith guidance on Audit Committees.
The Workings of the Board and its Committees
The Board
Role
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the success of the Group and for its overall strategic
direction, its values and its governance. It provides the leadership necessary to enable the business objectives to
be met whilst ensuring that obligations to its shareholders are safeguarded.
Composition
As at 30 September 2008 the Board comprised the Chairman, three executive directors and four independent
non-executive directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct and separate and clear divisions
of accountability and responsibility have been agreed by the Board, are set out in writing and operate effectively.
During the year the Board has again reviewed its composition and has concluded that its composition fully
satisfies the requirements of the business and ensures proper governance of the Group. Other than the
appointment of Mr D O Maloney as a non-executive director on 10 July 2008 there were no changes to the
membership of the Board during the year.
The Chairman, Mr H V Reid, has primary responsibility for leadership of the Board, sets its agenda and devotes
such time to his role as is necessary to properly discharge his duties. He facilitates the effective engagement of
the non-executive directors. He is responsible, jointly with the Chief Executive, for the effective communication
with the Company’s shareholders and representation of the Group externally.
The Chief Executive, Mr G E Tuppen, has executive responsibility for executing the Group’s strategy and
development. He leads the management of the Company in order to optimise long-term shareholder value by
meeting key strategic and financial objectives.
The Board requires that all non-executive directors are free from any relationship with the executive
management that could result in any conflict or affect their independent judgement. The Board recognises that
length of service can impact on the independence of a non-executive director and, having considered this, is
satisfied that all non-executives remain independent in character and judgement for the purposes of the
Combined Code. The Board membership and that of its Committees is designed to ensure that no one individual
or Group dominates proceedings and that their wide variety of skills allows effective leadership across the
Company’s business activities.

Corporate Governance
Mr Reid is seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 22 January 2009. The Board is satisfied that
Mr Reid continues to perform effectively and demonstrates commitment and time to his role and duties and has
a range of skills and experience relevant to his continued appointment as Chairman. In addition, Mr Reid
considers he has sufficient time to commit to the Company’s affairs notwithstanding his other business
commitments and has no conflicting interests. Newly appointed directors are required to submit themselves for
re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment to the Board. Mr Maloney is therefore
seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting on 22 January 2009 can be found in the Notice and Explanatory Notes of the meeting on pages
110 to 115.
Biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 7 and 8.
Operation of the Board
The Company has an effective Board which leads and controls the Company and is responsible to the
shareholders for its proper management and its success. The Board therefore provides entrepreneurial leadership,
sets and monitors the Company’s strategic aims, reviews management performance and examines major capital
expenditure and acquisition opportunities.
The Board has established, and reviewed during the year, guidelines, requiring that specific matters are reserved
for a decision by the full Board. This ensures that the Board maintains control over strategic, major financial and
key operational issues. Such matters include, for example, the approval of financial statements, material
acquisitions and disposals of assets, risk management and governance policies. All meetings of the Board are
structured to allow open discussion by all directors and ensure full participation in the decision-making process.
Meetings and Attendance
The Board held six scheduled meetings in the past year and is expected to hold a similar number of such
meetings over its next financial year. The Board can convene additional meetings as necessary to consider
matters that are time critical. In addition, two separate Strategic Business Reviews are held ‘off site’ annually at
which high level strategic issues, such as future business direction and its financial and operational implications
are reviewed and debated. These Strategic Business Reviews have a strong operational focus and also give the
Board the opportunity to hear contributions from the senior management team.

Corporate Governance
Non-executive directors and the Senior Independent Director
The non-executive directors complement the skills and experience of the executive directors and bring an
independent judgement to the decision-making process at Board and Committee level. Their role requires a time
commitment in the order of 15 days per annum plus additional time as necessary to properly discharge their
duties. In terms of commitments outside of the Company, any material changes must be reported to and pre-
cleared with the Chairman.
The Company has appointed a Senior Independent Director, Mr A J Stewart, whose role and responsibilities are
clearly defined, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Senior Independent Director is available to
shareholders if they have any concerns that cannot be resolved through contact via normal channels.
In compliance with the Combined Code the Senior Independent Director met with the other non-executives
during the year to discuss matters in a forum that did not include executive directors or the Chairman. In
addition, all of the non-executives including the Chairman met twice during the year without the executive
directors being present to discuss in detail the matters which they believed to be relevant for the purposes of
the Strategic Business Reviews, including key operational and financial issues, performance of the Chief
Executive and overall feedback arising from the performance evaluation process.
Information and Training
The Board and its committees are supplied with full and timely information which enables the proper discharge
of their responsibilities.
All directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional
advice at the Company’s expense. There is a formal written procedure concerning independent professional
advice setting out clear guidelines which have been agreed by the Board. The Company has arranged appropriate
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to provide cover in the event of legal action against its directors.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and its committees and is responsible for advising the
Chairman on matters of corporate governance, ensuring the good flow of information to the Board and its
committees and between the non-executives and senior management. The written responsibilities of the
Company Secretary are available on the Company’s website. During the year the Board has again reviewed the
joint roles of Mr D C George as Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary. As the Deputy Company Secretary
reports direct to the Board and Chairman on governance issues, has full day-to-day responsibility for the
Company Secretariat function within the Group and provides independent counsel to the non-executive directors,
the Board is of the view that given this delegation of responsibilities, there is no compromise to the
independence of the Company Secretary.
All new directors receive an appropriately tailored induction programme arranged to develop their knowledge
and understanding of the Group and the key business issues, including social, environmental and ethical issues.
The training needs of each director are regularly reviewed and assessed by the Board. Existing directors
undertake such professional development as is necessary for them to carry out their duties as directors. During
the year the directors have, amongst other matters, received appropriate guidance on the conflict of interest
provisions in the Companies Act 2006.
Re-election of directors
The Articles of Association of the Company require that any newly appointed directors will be subject to election
at the next following Annual General Meeting and also that each director shall retire from office at the Annual
General Meeting unless they were appointed or reappointed as a director at either of the last two Annual
General Meetings before that meeting. This is applied so that each director will submit themselves for election
or re-election at regular intervals and at least once every three years.
The Board has determined that re-election of the Chairman and non-executive directors is not automatic and is
subject to formal review and recommendation by the Nominations Committee and approval by shareholders.
Board Committees
In order to ensure effective leadership and governance the Board governs through clearly identified committees

which have delegated powers to deal with specific aspects of the Company’s affairs. A summary of the operation
of these committees is set out below. All committees of the Board that are subject to the requirements of the
Combined Code are chaired by an independent director or have a majority of independent directors as members.
The names and biographical details of all Board Committee members are set out on pages 7 and 8.
The Audit Committee
The Board’s obligation to establish formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it should apply
financial reporting and internal control principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the
Company’s external auditors is met through the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr D A Harding who has current and relevant financial experience. The
Committee’s other members are Mr A J Stewart, Mrs S E Murray and Mr D O Maloney. All members are
independent. The Committee met three times during the year to coincide with the financial reporting and audit
cycles of the Company including the submission of the interim and annual financial statements. Representatives
from the external auditors, the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer were in attendance at part
or all of each meeting by invitation. As a matter of best practice, the Committee is able to meet alone with
external auditors as required at the end of its meetings.
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in
accordance with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code. These are available on the Company’s
website.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of financial matters including the interim and annual
accounts prior to their submission to the Board, and monitoring the controls which are in force to ensure the
integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. The Committee advises the Board on the
appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration and discusses the nature and scope of their work.
The Committee has also been concerned to ensure that the appropriate standards of governance, reporting and
compliance are being met. The Company has in place a whistle-blowing policy under which employees may, in
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in such matters as financial reporting.
For the year under review the Committee:
 has monitored the integrity of the financial statements, interim and final report and accounts and
relevant regulatory announcements;
 agreed the annual audit plan and has considered external auditor reports and has monitored and followed
up management actions in response to issues raised;
 met regularly with management and with internal and external auditors to review the effectiveness of
internal controls and business risk management and is satisfied that proper and satisfactory internal
controls remain in place to identify and contain business risk;
 has monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function;
 reviewed and monitored the independence and objectivity of external auditors; and
 carried out an annual evaluation of its performance.
The Committee has adopted a policy on the engagement of external auditors for the provision of non-audit
services and reviews this annually.
The policy is designed to:
 ensure that the engagement does not impair the objectivity of the auditors’ opinion on the Group
financial statements;
 establish a transparent process and reporting to enable the Committee to monitor policy compliance; and
15809ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  4/12/08  16:07  Page 19 158 15809 04/12/2008 Proof 6
20 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008
Corporate Governance
 avoid unnecessary restrictions on the engagement of auditors for non-audit services where the provision
of advice is of a higher quality and more cost-effective than other providers.
The policy covers the type of services permitted, including:
 advice and assurance work regarding direct and indirect tax matters including tax compliance;
 due diligence investigations related to potential acquisitions and disposals; and
 accounting advice and reviews of accounting standards.
The Committee is confident that in reviewing the external auditors’ Annual Audit Results Report the objectivity
and independence of the auditors are not impaired by the provision of non-audit services. This report includes a
statement confirming compliance by the auditors with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standard 5 (‘Non-
Audit services provided to audit clients’). The Committee is satisfied that such non-audit work is best handled
by them due to knowledge of the Group. The Committee aims to have non-audit work carried out in a manner
that affords full value for money and considers it appropriate for commercial and practical reasons, including
confidentiality, to use the external auditors for certain non-audit services. The amount of non-audit fees charged
by auditors is disclosed in note 6 to the accounts.
The Nominations Committee
The Committee is chaired by Mr H V Reid and its members are the Chief Executive, Mr G E Tuppen and the four
non-executive directors Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding, Mrs S E Murray and Mr D O Maloney.
The Committee is responsible for proactively refreshing and reviewing the Board’s composition. The Committee
nominates, for approval by the Board, candidates for appointment to the Board, having regard to its balance
and structure. The Committee is also responsible for succession planning and takes into account the knowledge
and skills mix required by the Board in the future. The Committee meets as required and met three times
during the year. The Committee seeks the advice of external recruitment consultants as necessary and follows
a formal and transparent procedure to ensure that new appointments comply with the principles set out in the
Combined Code and satisfy the needs for the balance of the Board. Any appointments are based on merit and
against objective criteria, including the time available to, and the commitment which will be required of, the
potential director.
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in
accordance with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code to ensure that no director is involved in
discussions regarding his or her own succession. These terms of reference are available on the Company’s
website. The individual terms and conditions of appointment of directors can be inspected during normal office
hours at the Company’s registered office and at the Annual General Meeting.
During the year in review the Committee:
 reviewed the plan for the retirement of directors by rotation;
 reviewed the framework and the proposed timetable for succession planning for executive and non-
executive appointments;
 reviewed the composition of the Audit and Nominations Committees
 sought the advice of external recruitment consultants regarding the appointment of Mr D O Maloney;
 reviewed and recommended to the Board the appointment of Mr D O Maloney; and
 carried out an annual evaluation of its performance.
The Remuneration Committee
The Committee is chaired by Mr A J Stewart and its members are the three other non-executive directors
Mr D A Harding, Mrs S E Murray and Mr D O Maloney. The Committee is responsible for determining the

Corporate Governance
contract terms, remuneration and other benefits of the executive directors and senior management, including
performance related bonus schemes and the Chairman’s fee. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is
set by the Board.
The Committee appoints external remuneration consultants and advisers as necessary to provide remuneration
services and advice to the Remuneration Committee and the Company. The Committee met on six occasions
during the year.
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in
accordance with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code. These are available on the Company’s
website.
The responsibilities of the Committee, together with an explanation of how it applies the principles set out in
the Combined Code, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report which includes details of directors’
remuneration and directors’ interests in options, together with information on service contracts, and is set out
on pages 24 to 33.
During the period in review the Committee:
 determined the remuneration for executive directors and the Chairman;
 reviewed overall levels of remuneration for senior managers;
 determined the awards and, where relevant, performance targets under the Company’s incentive
arrangements under the Annual Bonus Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan 2005;
 agreed the content and presentation of the remuneration report for inclusion in the report and accounts;
and
 carried out an annual evaluation of its performance.
Executive Committee
The Board delegates day-to-day management of the Group to the Executive Committee which comprises the
three executive directors and is chaired by the Chief Executive. The Executive Committee generally meets
weekly and other members of the Group’s Executive Management and Senior Management Teams attend as
necessary to provide input and to facilitate communication of the Executive Committee’s decisions to the rest
of the Group.
Finance Committee, Disclosure Committee and Monitoring Committees
The Board has delegated, within agreed terms of reference, responsibility for certain matters of a routine nature
which are not reserved for full Board consideration to a Finance Committee. This Committee comprises two
executive directors, one of which must be the Chief Financial Officer. In addition and to ensure full compliance
with its obligations under the Disclosure Rules published by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has
established a Disclosure Committee comprising the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer to
maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to enable it to make timely and accurate disclosure of
information via a regulatory news service when it is impracticable to hold a full Board meeting. A separate
Monitoring Committee has been established to monitor compliance with the rules of the UK Listing Authority
including a policy based on the Model Code which covers dealings in securities and applies to directors,
persons discharging managerial responsibility and employee insiders.
Performance evaluation
Principle A.6 of the Combined Code provides that the Board should undertake a formal and rigorous annual
evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors. During the year the
Company has internally undertaken a critical self-assessment performance evaluation programme in
accordance with this principle and has effectively evaluated the Board, its Committees and its individual
directors, including the Chairman.

Corporate Governance
Board performance evaluation
The process was led by the Chairman and all directors completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to
score a number of performance criteria. The results of these questionnaires are compiled into a report by the
Deputy Company Secretary and the Chairman presented the findings to the Board. This year’s review found that
the Board’s performance, in light of difficult economic and market conditions, continued to be effective and
appropriate for the needs of the business. In addition, the Strategic Business Reviews provide valuable input
into future business development and a focus on operational performance with positive engagement and
contributions from Board members.
Board Committee performance evaluation
For the Board Committee performance evaluation processes each Committee Chairman and Committee
member completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria.
The results of these questionnaires were compiled into a report by the Deputy Company Secretary and the
Chairman presented the findings to the Board. This year’s review found that the Committees continued to fully
support the Board and the needs of the business, encouraged open and candid discussions between members,
were robust and continued to be of the right size.
Non-executive director performance evaluation
This process was led by the Chairman and all non-executive directors completed a self-appraisal questionnaire
in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria. Each non-executive director then met on a
confidential basis with the Chairman to review their questionnaire and to discuss matters in detail including
any matters arising from the evaluation of the Board and Committee performance. In addition, the Senior
Independent Director met with the other non-executives without the Chairman being present to review the
Chairman’s performance.
Executive director performance evaluation
This process was led by the Chief Executive and all executive directors completed a self-appraisal questionnaire
and were asked to score a number of performance criteria. Each executive director then met on a confidential
basis with the Chief Executive to review the questionnaire and to discuss matters in detail. Each executive
director is also set challenging performance objectives. The successful achievement of these objectives makes
up part of the short-term incentive criteria under the Annual Bonus Plan 2005.
Shareholder relations
The Board places considerable importance on maintaining clear communications with its stakeholders directed
to ensuring a mutual understanding of its objectives and has a continuing dialogue with institutional investors
to discuss the progress of the business and deal with a wide range of enquiries. This includes one on one
meetings, presentations after the preliminary announcement for the year and the results for the half year and
specific analyst presentations with feedback from the Company’s brokers as necessary.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring, via the Company Secretary, that views of major shareholders are fed
back to the Board on a regular basis. The effectiveness of how shareholder views are communicated forms part
of the annual Board performance evaluation process. During the year information about the progress of the
Company, including reports, regulatory announcements released through the London Stock Exchange and
presentations, is made available simultaneously on its website so that shareholders have full access to material
information. Directors regularly receive copies of analyst reports and reports on movements in major
shareholdings as well as key broker comments.
The Annual General Meeting, held in January each year, is the principal opportunity to encourage participation
by private investors and procedures at such meetings are in accordance with the Combined Code. The
Chairmen of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are available at the Annual General
Meeting to answer questions. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on
22 January 2009 can be found in the Notice of the meeting on pages 110 to 113. The Notice is sent by first
class post to shareholders entitled to receive a copy at least 20 working days before the Annual General
Meeting and details of proxy votes for and against are made available after the result of hand votes. In
accordance with the Combined Code, the Company has proposed in the Notice separate resolutions on each

substantive issue. Again this year the Company is, in line with relevant guidelines, offering shareholders a
facility for electronic proxy voting and voting through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service. The
voting results are announced on the same day to the London Stock Exchange and on the Company’s website.
The Company has adopted, pursuant to good investor practice, innovative ways of communicating with
shareholders and, in accordance with the provisions introduced in the Companies Act 2006, has given
shareholders the opportunity to receive shareholder communications, such as the annual report and accounts,
the interim report and notices of meetings, electronically via the Internet rather than in paper form through
the post.
Finally the Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, deal with a wide range of investor
queries on behalf of shareholders. Details of additional shareholder services are set out on page 109.
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the overall system of internal control for the Group and for reviewing its
effectiveness. It carries out such a review at least annually covering all material controls including financial,
operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
An ongoing process on internal control has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing risks
faced by the Group. This process is reviewed regularly by the Board which, with advice from its Audit
Committee, is satisfied that this meets the requirements of the guidance ‘Internal Control: Guidance for
Directors on the Combined Code’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in
1999 and the Turnbull guidance. The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. It should be
recognised that such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. This process has been in place since the start of the financial year and up to the date of
approval of the accounts.
The key procedures which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control are
as follows:
 Regular Board meetings to consider a schedule of matters reserved for directors’ consideration.
 An annual review by the Board of corporate strategy which includes a review of risks facing the
business, and how these risks are monitored and managed on an ongoing basis within the organisation.
This process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
 An established organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of
authority.
 An established internal audit function which implements the annual internal audit plan as agreed by
the Committee.
 Documented and enforced policies and procedures.
 Appointment of staff of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities.
 Comprehensive budgets and forecasts, approved by the Board, reviewed and revised on a regular basis,
with performance monitored against them and explanations obtained for material variances.
 A detailed investment approval process, requiring Board approval for major projects. Post-investment
appraisals are conducted and are reviewed by the Board.
 The consideration, as appropriate, by the Audit Committee of significant financial control matters.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit:
Remuneration Committee and advisers
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is composed entirely of independent non-executive
directors and is chaired by Mr A J Stewart, its other members being Mr D A Harding, Mrs S E Murray and Mr D O
Maloney. No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided. Mr H V
Reid and Mr G E Tuppen attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee if necessary except when their own
remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee’s key objectives are to:
 Determine and recommend to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration
package for executive directors.
 Monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule A and B of the Combined Code. This report also complies with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985
which incorporates the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
During the year the Committee and the Company has continued to use the services of Ernst & Young LLP (“E&Y”)
who have provided specific advice (not regarding remuneration) on matters relating to share schemes and the
Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans (and who were appointed by the Committee for this purpose). E&Y are the
Group’s auditors and also provide advisory services in respect of non-audit matters and taxation. In addition, the
Committee has sought advice relating to directors’ remuneration and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2005
from Hewitt New Bridge Street (who were appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the
Company save in respect of advice in connection with the operation of the Company’s incentive schemes and
executive remuneration more generally).
The Committee, amongst other matters, determines the level of awards made under the Company’s incentive
plans, considers feedback from shareholders and undertakes an annual review of its effectiveness.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure, the Committee
will ensure that the incentive structure for the executive directors and senior management will not raise
environmental, social or governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More
generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which
prevents it from taking into account ESG matters or, indeed, any other operational/financial risks that relate to
the Company’s business.
When setting the remuneration of the executive directors, due regard is given by the Committee to pay and
conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Remuneration Policy — Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is designed to ensure that the level and structure of remuneration
arrangements allows the Company to attract, retain and motivate the exceptional individuals required to
enhance shareholder value. Base salaries will be set accordingly, with a significant proportion of executive
directors’ remuneration performance-related so that appropriate levels of reward are available for outstanding
performance. In addition, the Committee is, at all times, mindful of remuneration practices in other relevant
companies.
To achieve this, the remuneration package comprises:
 Fixed elements: comprising basic salary, benefits and pensions.
 Performance related elements: comprising short-term performance related cash and deferred share
bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements satisfied by the award of shares.
15809ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  4/12/08  16:07  Page 24 15809 04/12/2008 Proof 6
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 25
Directors’ Remuneration Report
It is the Committee’s policy that the performance related elements of the package should equate to around two-
thirds of total remuneration for the executive directors based on an on-target, expected value approach to
valuing the package.
The Committee believes that these performance related incentive arrangements provide rewards which reflect an
appropriate balance between individual and Group performance and align the rewards to executive directors with
the long-term interests of shareholders. Share-based awards are satisfied by the use of existing shares held by an
Employee Benefit Trust.
The executive directors may accept outside appointments provided that such outside appointments do not in any
way prejudice their ability to perform their duties as executive directors of the Company. The extent to which any
executive director is allowed to retain any fees payable in respect of such outside appointments, or whether such
fees are remitted to the Company, will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows:
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly. The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually against
appropriate comparators and taking account of individual performance. Benefits include car allowances or the
use of a motor car, fuel, private medical insurances and professional fees. In determining the basic salary for the
executive directors the Committee takes account of the changes (if any) to the executive director’s
responsibilities, benchmark data received from its remuneration advisers and current market and economic
conditions.
Pensions
The pension contributions are amounts equal to 25% of basic salary. The Committee has agreed that from
1 October 2006 G E Tuppen would receive a sum equivalent to 25% of basic salary in lieu of his pension
contributions as a salary supplement (this is not included in any bonus and share incentive award calculations).
Current Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans (the “Plans”)
For the year in review the Company had the following relevant Plans:
 At the Annual General Meeting held on 24 January 2002 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the
Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2002 (“the 2002 Plan”). The 2002 Plan provided for participants to earn
non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term share incentives.
 At the Annual General Meeting held on 20 January 2005 ordinary resolutions were passed adopting the
Enterprise Inns 2005 Annual Bonus Plan and the Enterprise Inns 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (“the
2005 Plan”).
The 2005 Plan has replaced the 2002 Plan and no further awards will be made except under the 2005 Plan.
Further details of the plans are set out below.
Short-term cash and share incentives under the 2005 Plan
Under the terms of the 2005 Plan (currently in operation) executive directors are eligible to participate in an
annual cash bonus scheme as determined by the Committee. For the year under review the maximum award
level under the 2005 Plan for the Chief Executive was 125% of salary. For the other executive directors the
maximum award level was 100% of salary.
Awards under the 2005 Plan are subject to demanding Company performance targets such that no less than 75%
of an executive’s bonus will be subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted EPS growth targets, with
no more than 25% subject to challenging personal targets. 60% of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with
the remaining 40% deferred into shares (a Deferred Share Award). For the financial year ending 30 September
2007 the executive directors by agreement with the Committee elected to be awarded their entire bonus as a
Deferred Share Award with no cash bonus paid (details are set out in the table on page 31). Deferred share
awards may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period and then
15809ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  4/12/08  16:07  Page 25 158 15809 04/12/2008 Proof 6
26 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008
Directors’ Remuneration Report
remain exercisable for a further period of six months. Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are
calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum
targets.
The cash bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 29.
Long-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan
Under the 2002 Plan, awards of ordinary shares were made to participants upon achievement of compound
growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over three years (the final such award under the 2002 Plan was
made for the financial year 2003/04).
To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 5% compound
(15.8% simple), and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary (averaged over a three year period),
adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 20% compound (72.8% simple).
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth
in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets. Long-term incentives may not ordinarily be
exercised until 24 months after the end of the performance criteria period and then remain exercisable for a
further period of 108 months.
Long-term share incentives under the 2005 Plan
Under the 2005 Plan (which is currently in operation), long-term incentive awards have two elements:
 an award of Performance Shares (worth up to 150% of salary each year); and
 an award of Matching Shares linked to the co-investment of up to 25% of salary in ‘Investment Shares’,
which are then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that can count as Investment Shares are:
 shares subject to the Deferred Share Award under the 2005 Plan; and
 shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to the 25% of salary maximum.
Performance Share and Matching Share awards vest subject to the satisfaction of a sliding scale of average
compound annual adjusted EPS growth targets and the Company’s TSR performance against the FTSE 100. More
specifically, for awards made under the 2005 Plan in the past and (it is currently intended) in the future, one-half
of an award will be subject to a performance condition based on average compound annual adjusted EPS growth.
This EPS based condition will measure the Company’s average compound annual adjusted EPS growth by
comparing the Company’s adjusted EPS for the year prior to the date of grant (the “base year”) with the adjusted
EPS for the third financial year following the base year, such that awards will vest as follows:
Level of match under the relevant
Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award
Average compound portion of Performance Share (Matching Award Shares:
annual adjusted EPS growth Award that vests Investment Shares)
Less than 7% 0% 0:1
7% 20% 0.4:1
15% 100% 2:1
Straight-line vesting will occur if average compound annual adjusted EPS growth is between 7% and 15%.
The remaining half of the award will be subject to a TSR condition which compares the Company’s TSR
performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE 100 (as at
the date of grant) as follows:
15809ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  4/12/08  16:07  Page 26 15809 04/12/2008 Proof 6

Level of match under the relevant
Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award
Company’s TSR ranking v portion of Performance Share (Matching Award Shares:
the FTSE 100 Award that vests Investment Shares)
Below median 0% 0:1
Median 20% 0.4:1
Upper quintile 100% 2:1
Straight-line vesting will occur if the Company’s TSR ranking is between median and upper quintile.
All awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant and remain
exercisable for a further period of six months.
TSR will be calculated by averaging the Net Return Index of each Company over the six month period prior to
grant and vesting, unless the Committee determines that a shorter or longer period is a more appropriate way of
ensuring that the condition constitutes a fair measure of the Company’s TSR performance over the period.
In addition, irrespective of the Company’s TSR performance, no part of this portion of the award will vest unless
the Company’s adjusted EPS grows by at least 10% over the performance period, unless the Committee believes
that it is inappropriate to apply this underpin.
For the avoidance of doubt, if both the threshold TSR hurdle of median performance against the FTSE 100 and
the threshold adjusted EPS growth hurdle of 7% average compound annual adjusted growth are met, 20% of the
total award will vest.
The Committee believes that these performance conditions are appropriate for the following reasons:
 the adjusted EPS growth targets will encourage the executive team to deliver substantial annual adjusted
EPS growth over the three year performance period; and
 the TSR targets will require the Company to deliver above market returns to shareholders.
The Committee will, however, review the appropriateness of these performance conditions (and the operation of
the 2005 Plan as a whole) on a regular basis in light of the Company’s circumstances and prospects. The
Committee will seek independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR
targets are met.
Remuneration Policy — Non-Executive Directors
The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having
taken advice on appropriate levels in light of the time commitment and responsibilities of each individual. The
Chairman’s fee is approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract of no fixed term under which they
are entitled to receive twelve months’ notice of termination. There are no special provisions in the executive
directors’ contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office. The Committee would consider the
circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments
accordingly. A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the
context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.

(a) Benefits include car allowances or the use of a motor car, fuel, private medical insurances and
professional fees.
(b) The Chairman and non-executive directors are not eligible for performance related bonuses or share
awards under the Plans. The bonus disclosed relates to the cash bonus awarded under the 2005 Plan and
earned in the year ended 30 September 2008. The EPS target for these awards was not met and
consequently G E Tuppen received no cash bonus or Deferred Share Award under the 2005 Plan. The
bonus disclosed for D C George and W S Townsend reflects the part achievement of challenging personal
objectives during the year which have been measured objectively by the Committee and which were set
with the primary aim of encouraging delivery of long-term returns for shareholders. Details of the
Deferred Share awards made under the 2005 Plan are shown separately in this report.
(c) The 2007 totals for the executive directors included the cash bonus awarded under the 2005 Plan for the
year ended 30 September 2007. The executive directors subsequent to the publication of last year’s
report elected, with the approval of the Committee, to be awarded this cash bonus as a Deferred Share
Award, details of which are set out in the table on page 31.
(d) D O Maloney was appointed on 10 July 2008. Fees paid during the financial year reflect a pro rata
adjustment of the annual fee payable on appointment of £53,000 per annum.
(e) In addition, for the year under review, G E Tuppen was paid a salary supplement of £153,000 in lieu of a
contribution to his personal pension scheme.
In light of the remuneration review by the Committee, the base salaries for the Chief Executive, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Operating Officer were increased to reflect the view to move the base salaries closer to that of
the comparable levels of peers in the marketplace, to ensure competitiveness and to reflect the nature of each
of the roles.

set out below. These shares represented the deferral of the entire bonus payable under the 2005 Plan for the year 2006/07.

1. Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2008 were
authorised for issue by the Board on 17 November 2008. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company
incorporated and registered in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union.
Consolidated accounts are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made to the accounts of the
subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a
business combination. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
of profit or loss on sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been
reinstated. Any such goodwill is not included in determining any profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment
Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords’ fixtures and fittings and other assets are held
at cost. The Group’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued
each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out
such valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except
where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an
expense in the Income Statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the
revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in
value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlord’ fixtures and fittings are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions
to landlord’ fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to
write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease
term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line
basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment. Where any indications are
identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset
is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the
same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.

Notes to the Group Accounts
at 30 September 2008
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
Leases
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future
minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease payments are
apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as
operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as ‘intangible assets: operating lease premiums’ within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of
selling costs. Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for
disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be
highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is
actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and
operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Current assets held for sale
Current assets held for sale comprises tenants’ fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred
on disposal.
Repairs and maintenance
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Financial instruments
i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, syndicated debt finance, debentures, secured bonds and securitised
bonds are measured at amortised cost. This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the
debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage
of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as
derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are
subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date. Any change in the fair value of the instruments is
recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted. Hedge accounting is only adopted
where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it
meets the Group’s risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets the
conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement. Hedge
accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. In the
case of interest rate swaps, the ‘forecast transaction’ is the payment of interest.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
iv) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds
received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Called up share capital
and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium.
Net debt
Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash. Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to
banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation
The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred
tax. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between
the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to off set current tax assets
and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to
be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised
directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity. Tax is calculated using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events,
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably
estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount of the
provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the
obligation.
Pension obligations
The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the Income
Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The net amount
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the scheme’s liabilities and
the fair value of the scheme’s assets. This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit. The net of the expected
return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense.
Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No
gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.

Notes to the Group Accounts
at 30 September 2008
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of
discounts and VAT. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Sales of
beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees. Rents receivable are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period
to which the income relates.
Segmental reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable component of an entity that provides a product or service that is subject
to risks and returns that are different to those of other segments. The Group has one business segment, being the
operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate. The Group operates solely within the UK and therefore also has just
one geographical segment.
Share-based payments
The Group has taken advantage of the exception in IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2
only to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance
sheet date for management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by
calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income
Statement. A corresponding entry is made to equity. The fair value of share options is measured using valuation
models.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Operating profit
Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading
activities before net profit on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements from revaluation of pub estate,
interest, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the
Income Statement. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size
or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following:
a) Exceptional administrative expenses
The operating exceptional item shown within administrative expenses relates to legal, accountancy, professional
and advisory fees in respect of the ongoing review of REIT restructuring.
b) Net profit on sale of property, plant and equipment
Net profit arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
c) Movements from revaluation of pub estate
Any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the Income
Statement. If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in
value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised. Where pubs
identified for disposal are written down to ‘fair value less costs to sell’, the associated write-down is also
recognised in this line. Most of the impact of the annual revaluation exercise is accounted for in equity and
recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
d) Movement in fair value of financial instruments
The interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each Balance Sheet date and the movement is recognised in
the Income Statement unless hedge accounting is adopted. The movement in the fair value of swaps where hedge
accounting is not applied is shown as an exceptional item. Other movements include the unwind of the share buy
back liability.
Tax
A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the balance sheet relating to the pub estate. On transition to IFRS,
the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999. This led to an increase in
goodwill in respect of this deferred tax. As this pre-acquisition liability reduces due to capital gains indexation
relief, a credit is recognised in the Income Statement. This has been classified as an exceptional tax item due to its
size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same
period. All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in equity and recognised in
the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income
Statement.
New standards and interpretations
During the year the Group has adopted the capital disclosure requirements of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial
Statements’.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the
date of these financial statements. The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not expected to
have a material impact on the financial statements, although the amendment to IAS 1 may result in some changes
to the presentation of the financial statements. The effective dates below represent the latest date that the
Company will be required to implement the standard:
 Amendment to IAS 23 — Borrowing Costs — effective from 1 January 2009.
 IFRS 8 — Operating Segments — effective from 1 January 2009.
 IFRIC 14 — The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction —
effective 1 October 2008.
 Amendment to IAS 1 — Presentation of Financial Statements — effective 1 October 2009.
 Amendment to IAS 27 — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements — effective 1 October 2009.
 Amendment to IFRS 3 — Business Combinations — effective 1 July 2009.
 Amendment to IFRS 2 — Vesting Conditions and Cancellations — effective 1 September 2009.
 Amendment to IAS 39 — Eligible Hedged Items — effective 1 July 2009.
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that have
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:
a) Property, Plant and Equipment
Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual
published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”). The valuation is based on market observations
and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction
after proper marketing. Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their
market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub. Further information about the valuation of the
pub estate is provided in note 17 of these accounts.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 43
Notes to the Group Accounts
at 30 September 2008
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and
these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed
accounting policy for PPE.
b) Testing goodwill for impairment
The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate
goodwill to the Group of cash generating units (“CGUs”) that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects
the level at which goodwill is monitored. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit that the goodwill has
been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and
applying a suitable discount rate. Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 14.
c) Valuation of interest rate swaps
The Group measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The swap valuation rates are
derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date. The
fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract
rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date. The calculation
therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
d) Taxation
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a
liability will arise. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting
treatment.
e) Other
The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension
liability. However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Share buy-backs in close period
In accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ a financial liability has been recognised when the
Group enters into a contingent agreement with a third party which require the Group to purchase shares during the
close period. No contingent agreement had been entered into by the Group at 30 September 2008.
Presentation of interest rate swaps
The 2007 balance sheet has been adjusted in respect of the presentation of interest rate swap fair values. An
amendment to IAS 1 requires financial liabilities not held for trading to be presented as current or non-current on
the basis of settlement date. Previously, all interest rate swaps that were not designated as part of an effective
hedging relationship were presented as current liabilities. This has resulted in a reduction in current liabilities of
£18 million with a corresponding increase in non-current liabilities.

(i) The statutory corporation tax rate changed from 30% to 28% on 1 April 2008. Therefore, the applicable tax
rate in the note above is 29% for the year ended 30 September 2008, being six months of the year at 30%
and six months of the year at 28%.
(ii) On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the
revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over into other assets. The
deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occured
since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of £330 million as the fair value of the
net assets acquired had been reduced. As this pre-acquisition liability reduces due to capital gains indexation
relief, a credit is recognised in the Income Statement. This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to
its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the
same period. The exceptional indexation credit for the year ended 30 September 2008 is £33 million in total
(£1 million for property disposals and £32 million for retained properties) compared with £28 million
in 2007 (£4 million for property disposals and £24 million for retained properties). Indexation is calculated
with reference to the movement in the Retail Price Index during the year and the calculation is as follows:
2008 2007

12. Earnings per Ordinary share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on earnings of £189 million (2007 — £291 million) and on
497.4 million (2007 — 545.0 million) shares being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during
the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is
based on earnings adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax, of £195 million (2007 — £216 million)
and on 497.4 million (2007 — 545.0 million) shares being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue
during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in
treasury.

Impairment testing
Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. For this purpose, the goodwill is
allocated to the pub estate. This represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The impairment test
compares the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit with its carrying amount. At the year ended
30 September 2008 the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA using forecasts of cash flow over a five year period. The cash
flows have been risk adjusted from prior year to include the impacts of the smoking ban together with the
reduction in consumer spending as a result of the difficult economic conditions. The key assumptions in these
estimates have been reviewed by the Board of directors and are believed to be reasonable. Cash flows beyond
five years are extrapolated using a 3% growth rate (2007 — 3%). The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is
managements focus on an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of the estate through churn and capital
expenditure whilst remaining focused on meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand.
The discount rate is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) which has been risk adjusted
to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flow. In making this
adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted by using the highest level of Market Risk
premium and Company beta obtained from indepedent sources at the year end date to reflect the risk of the
Group relative to the market as a whole. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at
30 September 2008 was 8% (2007 — 8%).
As of 30 September 2008, the estimated value in use of the Group’s pub estate exceeded carrying amount by
£163 million and based on the risk adjusted cash flows as described above the pre-tax adjusted discount rate
could increase to 8.2% before any impairment would be required. Management have considered the volatility
within the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flow and a reduction of 0.5% in the growth rate
of cash flows would result in no impairment.
There is no impairment to goodwill in the period.

Revaluation of property, plant and equipment
With the exception of properties identified for disposal, the Group’s licensed land and buildings were revalued as
at 30 September 2008 by Humberts Leisure Limited and Christie & Co., independent Chartered Surveyors and by
the internal Head of Estates, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor.
The land and buildings were valued at market value (as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards
‘Red Book’), reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated
by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield. The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases
or tenancies under which the properties are let. Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location,
pub quality and tenure. The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK
pub sector.

17. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by
Humberts Leisure Limited. The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc has been valued by the Head of
Estates. The results of this internal valuation have been compared to those of the external valuers. This review
ensured that the results are consistent.
A representative sample of the pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited (“Unique”) has been valued by
Christie & Co. The method of this valuation have been applied across the rest of the Unique estate on a pub by
pub basis in line with the requirements of the securitisation. The results of both the Unique and Enterprise
valuations are also compared, ensuring consistency.
During the year Christie & Co. included a Red Book Guidance Note 5 disclosure in their valuation, which requires
the valuer to draw attention to uncertainty in the market which may have a material effect on the valuation.
Christie & Co. state they have used valuer judgement to interpret the most recent available evidence and current
market sentiments to arrive at their valuation, but caution that in the present economic circumstances the shelf
life of any valuation report is reduced.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current assets held for sale’ are held
at fair value less costs to sell. This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds (“ERV”) which
are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows:

Interest rate swaps
On 29 September 2006 the Group designated the £350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an
effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39. This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until
September 2011. As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly
in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised in the Income
Statement.
All of the Group’s swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows:

Financial instruments and risk
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds,
securitised bonds and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s
operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps and contracts to
purchase shares in a close period. The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising
from the Group’s sources of finance and meet the objective of the Group share buy-back strategy.
In the year to 30 September 2008 the Group repaid and cancelled £35 million of a £100 million uncommitted,
unsecured bank facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc and utilised £31 million of a £100 million committed,
secured bank facility with HBOS plc.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no
currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of
these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk
The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The
Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of
overdrafts, bank loans, debentures and securitised debt.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
 Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function
 Regular review of the Group’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile
 Maintenance of undrawn overdraft and bank facilities
 Management of share buy-back programme
At 30 September 2008, the nominal value of the Company’s borrowings (excluding interest rate swaps, liability for
share buy-back contracts and finance lease payables) comprised:
2008 2007
Syndicated and other bank borrowings 27% 27%

and interest payments, including interest rate swaps. The total amount of debt payable shown above differs from
the total book value of Group debt of £3,861 million as the book value of Group debt includes the fair value of
interest rate swaps which is based on discounted cash flows. The contractural maturity of trade and other
payables is within one year.
An analysis of minimum lease payments due under finance leases is set out in note 24.

The Liquidity Facility is due for renewal on 30 September 2009.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows its debenture and bonds except for the A2N bonds at a fixed rate. Bank debt and the A2N
bonds are borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at, a floating rate. The Group’s objective is to manage
exposure to changes in interest rates. This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest
rate swaps acquired by Group companies. At 30 September 2008, the Group’s borrowings were 89% fixed (after
including the impact of interest rate swaps) with an average interest rate of 6.5% for 10 years (2007 — 89% fixed
at an average rate of 6.5% for 11 years).
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments
fluctuates with changes in interest rates. The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if
interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a small amount
of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to
minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where
appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet is net of a bad debt
provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is
based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in
the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers
that the debt is no longer recoverable. At 30 September 2008 the value of collateral is £31 million (2007 — £30
million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables. An analysis of the provision held against
trade receivables is set out below. This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by
licensees.

22. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
There are no trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There are no indications as at 30 September 2008 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect
of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired. The
maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest
rate swaps classified as financial assets. The Group’s credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Group only
invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.
Security
Senior debt finance is secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which
comprise the Group, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries and Unique Pubs
Limited and its subsidiaries. The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such
Group companies. The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and
secured bonds. The value of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2008 is:
Property, Plant and Equipment £5,832 million (2007 — £5,683 million), operating lease premiums £18 million
(2007 — £19 million) and pubs held for sale £11 million (2007 — £11 million).
23. Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt
The Group defines capital as total equity. The capital structure is managed to support the Group’s objective of
maximising long-term shareholder value through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost-effective
borrowing and flexibility to fund buisness and acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to
optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group is based upon management’s judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key
elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Group’s operational and strategic requirements. The overall
financing strategy of the Group is presented to the Board annually for approval.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity. Net debt is
defined as the book value of the Group’s debt less cash (note 22). Equity is defined as total shareholders’ funds.

27. Pension
The Group makes defined contribution payments to employees’ own pension plans and these payments are
charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
RetailLink Management Limited (a subsidiary company) established a pension plan for its employees in January
1999. The plan has defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The plan is now closed to new members
and for the future accrual of benefits. The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the
plan was at 5 April 2008. This has been updated to 30 September 2008. The valuation was carried out by Mercer,
independent professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.

Ordinary shares carry no right to fixed income. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to vote at meetings.
On 17 January 2007 each of the Group’s issued and unissued existing ordinary shares of 5 pence each were sub-
divided into two new ordinary shares of 2.5 pence each.
At 30 September 2008, the Group owned 50 million (2007 — 50 million) of its own shares as treasury shares with
a nominal value of £1 million (2007 — £1 million) and a market value of £89 million (2007 — £293 million).
In addition, at 30 September 2008 the Group held 8,768,087 shares with a nominal value of £0.2 million and a
market value of £16 million (2007 — 10,027,700 shares, nominal value £0.3 million, market value £59 million).
These shares are held by the Employee Benefit Trust and Enterprise Inns Quest Trustees Limited and are shares
used to satisfy awards made under the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and other share option schemes (note 29).
During the year the Group made on market purchases totalling 5 million (2007 — 103 million) of its own ordinary
shares for an aggregate consideration of £29 million (2007 — £658 million) (excluding costs). These shares were
cancelled. Transaction costs of £0.2 million (2007 — £3 million) have been accounted for directly in equity in the
profit and loss reserve.

29. Share-based payments
The Group operates share-based payment schemes for both directors and other employees. Details of the Short-
Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”) and Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) which form part of the remuneration of the
Executive Directors are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 33.
The Group also operates an Employee Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”), a Savings Related Share Option Scheme
(“SAYE”) and a Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”).
A total expense of £2 million (2007 — £3 million) has been incurred in the year in relation to share-based
payments. This expense relates wholly to the equity-settled schemes described above.
Share Incentive Plan
The SIP is open to all employees. At times determined by the Company, employees may allocate the lower of
£1,500 and 10% of pre-tax salary to purchase shares out of their salary. The Board may also decide to award
matching shares. The shares are held in trust on behalf of the employee. If shares are removed from trust within
three years, any allocation of matching shares may be lost. Shares can be transferred tax-free to employees after a
period of five years. Matching shares were awarded in 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The cost of the matching shares is being spread over the three year vesting period of the scheme.
Details of the number of matching shares held in trust during the year are as follows:
2008 2007
Outstanding at beginning of year 115,172 84,670

Weighted average remaining contractual life 1.1 years 1.6 years
Employee Share Option Scheme
The ESOS is open to all employees. Share options are awarded to employees at the discretion of the Board. The
current intention of the Board is to issue options with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share at
grant date. Options will normally vest after three years if an employee remains in service and if EPS growth targets
are met. For options granted during the years ended 30 September 2006, 2007 and 2008 options will only vest in
full if the average compound annual percentage growth in adjusted EPS between the grant date and the third
anniversary of the grant date is 8.33%. Options may normally only be exercised during the period of seven years
commencing on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the option. Options will usually be settled by issuing
ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.

with the transitional provisions of this standard and of IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of IFRS’. Options will only
vest in full if certain performance criteria are met.

Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The SAYE scheme is open to executive directors and employees at the discretion of the Board. Participants
contract to save a fixed amount each month with a savings institution for a period of five or seven years. At the
end of the savings term, participants are given the option to purchase shares at a price set before the savings
began. The option price will be not less than 80% of the market value of a share on the date that participants are
invited to take part in the scheme, or the nominal value of a share if lower. Options will usually be settled using
ordinary shares held by Enterprise Inns Quest Trustees Ltd (an employee benefit trust) and will usually be
exercisable for six months after the fifth or seventh anniversary of the commencement of the savings contract.

STIP and LTIP
Executive directors are eligible to participate in an STIP and LTIP plan. A summary of the rules of these schemes
along with details of shares that have been granted and are outstanding in relation to individual directors is
included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 33.
Other members of the executive management team are also eligble to participate in an STIP scheme. Share awards
vest based on achievement of personal objectives and of Group EBITDA targets. Shares awarded vest equally on the
first and second anniversary of fulfilment of performance targets.

Directors pay £1 to exercise awards granted under the STIP and LTIP. This is a one-off charge. All of the shares
outstanding at 30 September 2008 are not yet exercisable.
† The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed
until after the date of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of STIP shares granted during the
year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2008. The number of shares granted
in 2007 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2007.

29. Share-based payments (continued)
The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the STIP was £5.30 (2007 — £5.25
restated for actual number of shares granted in 2007) and under the LTIP was £2.86 (2007 — £5.08).
The weighted average share price on exercise of shares and share options under all schemes during the year was
£4.53 (2007 — £6.53).
Fair value of share schemes
The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using
share option valuation models. The ESOS, SAYE and STIP schemes are valued using the Black–Scholes model. The
element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black–Scholes model. The
element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
The following tables list the inputs to the models for options and shares granted during the year:
ESOS SAYE
Weighted average: 2008 2007 2008 2007
Share price (£) 5.07 6.18 4.84 5.84
Exercise price (£) 5.07 6.18 4.25 4.67

Risk-free interest rate 4.69% 4.82% 4.4% 4.9%
Expected life of option (years) 2–4 years§ 2–4 years§ 3–5‡ 3–5‡
Expected share-price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of
the option. The expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met. This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria
have therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.
These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the
TSR element of the scheme.
† The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed
until after the date of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of STIP shares granted during the
year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2008. The 2007 weighted averages
have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2007.
§ Two STIP schemes are in place. One vests equally after two and three years and the other vests after four years.
‡ The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after three, four and five years.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the
Members of Enterprise Inns plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2008
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the
Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes 1 to 32. These Group financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year
ended 30 September 2008 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as
having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
Group financial statements. The other information comprises only the Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review (incorporating the Business Review), Directors and Advisers, the
Corporate Governance Statement, and the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming

our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:

European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 September 2008 and of its profit for the year
then ended;
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985

Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2008
1. Accounting Policies
The financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2008 were authorised for issue by
the Board on 17 November 2008. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and registered in
England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union .
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of the exemption provided under section 408 of the
Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
These accounts are for the Company and are not consolidated financial statements. Separate consolidated financial
statements for the Group are prepared under IFRS and are published separately within this document.
Property, plant and equipment
Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords’ fixtures and fittings and other assets are held
at cost. The Company’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued
each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out
such valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except
where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an
expense in the Income Statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the
revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in
value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords’ fixtures and fittings are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions
to landlords’ fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis
to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease
term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line
basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment. Where any indications are
identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset
is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the
same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.
Leases
Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of
future minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
payable. Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income
Statement.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as
operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as ‘intangible assets: operating lease premiums’ within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of
selling costs. Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for
disposal by the Company. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should
be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is
actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and
operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are initally recognised at fair value and then held at this value subject to an annual
impairment test.
Current assets held for sale
Current assets held for sale comprise tenants’ fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred
on disposal.
Financial instruments
i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, syndicated debt finance, debentures and secured bonds are measured
at amortised cost. This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with
the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings
across the life of the instrument.
iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified
as derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are
subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date. Any change in the fair value of the instruments is
recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted. Hedge accounting is only adopted
where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it
meets the Company’s risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly
effective.
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets the
conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement. Hedge
accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. In the
case of interest rate swaps, the ‘forecast transaction’ is the payment of interest.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
iv) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds
received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Called up Share Capital
and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium.
Net debt
Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash. Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to
banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation
The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred
tax. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between
the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to
be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised
directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity. Tax is calculated using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount
of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle
the obligation.
Pension obligations
The Company has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the Income
Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The net amount
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the scheme’s liabilities and
the fair value of the scheme’s assets. This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit. The net of the expected
return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense.
Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No
gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of
discounts and VAT. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Sales of
beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees. Rents receivable are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period
to which the income relates.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 and applied its requirements to those awards
granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance
sheet date for management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by
calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income
Statement. A corresponding entry is made to equity. The fair value of share options is measured using valuation
models.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
New standards and interpretations
During the year the Company has adopted the capital disclosure requirements of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial
Statements’.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the
date of these financial statements. The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not expected to
have a material impact on the financial statements, although the amendment to IAS 1 may result in some changes
to the presentation of the financial statements. The effective dates below represent the latest date that the
Company will be required to implement the standard:
 Amendment to IAS 23 — Borrowing Costs — effective from 1 January 2009.
 IFRS 8 — Operating Segments — effective from 1 January 2009.
 IFRIC 14 — The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction —
effective 1 October 2008.
 Amendment to IAS 1 — Presentation of Financial Statements — effective 1 October 2009.
 Amendment to IAS 27 — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements — effective 1 October 2009.
 Amendment to IFRS 3 — Business Combinations — effective 1 July 2009.
 Amendment to IFRS 2 — Vesting Conditions and Cancellations — effective 1 September 2009.
 Amendment to IAS 39 — Eligible Hedged Items — effective 1 July 2009.
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Company makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 87
Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2008
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
a) Property, Plant and Equipment
Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual
published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”). The valuation is based on market observations
and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction
after proper marketing. Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their
market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub. Further information about the valuation of the
pub estate is provided in note 4 of these accounts.
The Company estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and
these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed
accounting policy for PPE.
b) Valuation of interest rate swaps
The Company measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The swap valuation rates are
derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date. The
fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract
rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date. The calculation
therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
c) Taxation
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a
liability will arise. The Company reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate
accounting treatment.
d) Other
The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension
liability. However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Share buy-backs in close period
In accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ a financial liability has been recognised when the
Company enters into a contingent agreement with a third party which require the Company to purchase shares
during the close period. No contingent agreement had been entered into by the Company at 30 September 2008.
Presentation of interest rate swaps
The 2007 balance sheet has been adjusted in respect of the presentation of interest rate swap fair values. An
amendment to IAS 1 requires financial liabilities not held for trading to be presented as current or non-current on
the basis of settlement date. Previously, all interest rate swaps that were not designated as part of an effective
hedging relationship were presented as current liabilities. This has resulted in a reduction in current liabilities of
£11 million with a corresponding increase in non-current liabilities.

Revaluation of property, plant and equipment
With the exception of properties identified for disposal the Company’s licensed land and buildings were revalued
as at 30 September 2008 by Humberts Leisure Limited, independent Chartered Surveyors and by the internal
Head of Estates, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor.
The land and buildings were valued at market value (as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards
‘Red Book’), reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated
by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield. The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases
or tenancies under which the properties are let. Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location,
pub quality and tenure. The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK
pub sector.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in the Company have been valued by Humberts
Leisure Limited. The balance of the estate held in the Company has been valued by the Head of Estates. The
results of this internal valuation have been compared to those of the external valuers. This review ensured that
the results are consistent.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current assets held for sale’ are held
at fair value less costs to sell. This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds (“ERV”) which
are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as
follows:

The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2008 was £123 million (2007 — £113
million). Additions during the year include £2 million of property held under finance leases (2007 — £4 million).
At 30 September 2008, the Company had entered into contractual commitments to purchase £7 million (2007 —
£20 million) of property, plant and equipment.

Non-current assets held for sale comprises both freehold and leasehold licensed and unlicensed properties that
have been identified by the Company for disposal as part of the continued improvement in quality of its property
portfolio. Non-current assets held for sale will usually be sold for alternative use. The sale of all assets within this
category is expected to be completed within one year of the balance sheet date.
A balance of £nil (2007 — £1 million) in relation to these pubs is held within the revaluation reserve representing
revaluation surpluses.

Fair values
Bank borrowings, the debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone,
independent valuers. Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates. The finance lease payables
are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.

amortised cost. Interest rate swaps are held at fair value and finance lease payables represents the present value of future minimum
lease payments. The liability for close period share buy-back contracts represents an estimate of the amount that may be incurred on
share buy-backs during the period from 1 October to the date of the preliminary announcement of results. There is no difference between
the book value and the fair value of this provision. Other categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables.
However, there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these items.

Interest rate swaps
On 29 September 2006 the Company designated the £350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an
effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39. This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until
September 2011. As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly
in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised in the Income
Statement.
Both of the Company’s swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows:

Financial instruments and risk
The Company’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds and
cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operations. The
Company also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps and contracts to purchase shares
in a close period. The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Company’s
sources of finance and meet the objective of the Company’s share buy-back strategy.
In the year to 30 September 2008 the Company repaid and cancelled £35 million of a £100 million uncommitted,
unsecured bank facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no
currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of
these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk
The Company has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The
Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of
overdrafts, bank loans and debentures.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
 Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function
 Regular review of the Company’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile
 Maintenance of undrawn overdraft and bank facilities
 Management of share buy-back programme

9. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Company borrows its debenture and bonds at a fixed rate. Bank debt is borrowed at, and cash balances attract
interest at, a floating rate. The Company’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. This exposure
is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest rate swaps acquired by Group companies. At 30 September
2008, the Company’s borrowings were 83% fixed (after including the impact of interest rate swaps) with an average
interest rate of 6.5% for nine years (2007 — 82% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for ten years).
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments
fluctuates with changes in interest rates. The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if
interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Company. The Company is exposed to a small
amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Company’s
objective is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit
checks where appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet is net of a
bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable
accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account
collateral held in the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when
management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. At 30 September 2008 the value of collateral is
£25 million (2007 — £24 million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables. An analysis of the
provision held against trade receivables is set out below. This provision relates to trade receivables which are
primarily owed by licensees.

Provision as at 1 October 1 3
Increase in provision during the year 2 2

There are no trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There are no indications as at 30 September 2008 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect
of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired. The
maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest
rate swaps classified as financial assets. The Company’s credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Company
only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

9. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Security
Senior debt finance is secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which
comprise the Group, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries and Unique Pubs
Limited and its subsidiaries. The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such
Group companies. The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and
secured bonds. The value of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2008 is:
Property, Plant and Equipment £3,138 million (2007 — £3,039 million), operating lease premiums £7 million
(2007 — £7 million) and pubs held for sale £3 million (2007 — £7 million).
10. Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt
The Company defines capital as total equity. The capital structure is managed to support the Company’s objective
of maximising long-term shareholder value through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost-effective
borrowing and flexibility to fund buisness and acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to
optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Company is based upon management’s judgement of the appropriate balancing of all
key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Company’s operational and strategic requirements. The
overall financing strategy of the Company is presented to the Board annually for approval.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity. Net
debt is defined as the book value of the Company’s debt less cash and cash equivalents (note 9). Equity is defined
as total shareholders’ funds.

Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities in Relation to the
Company Financial Statements
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 105
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Company financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In
preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes 1 to 21. These Parent Company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended
30 September 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Parent
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view
and whether the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether
in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Parent Company financial
statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
Parent Company financial statements. The other information comprises only the Financial Highlights, the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review (incorporating the Business Review), Directors and Advisers
and the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Parent Company financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

In our opinion:
 the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted

Notes
1. A shareholder of the Company who is entitled to
attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting
may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak
and vote instead of him. A proxy does not need to
be a shareholder of the Company. You may appoint
more than one proxy provided each proxy is
appointed to exercise rights attached to different
shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy
to exercise rights attached to any one share. To
appoint more than one proxy, you will need to
complete a separate proxy form in relation to each
appointment. To request additional proxy forms,
please contact the Company’s Registrar. You will
need to state clearly on each proxy form the
number of shares in relation to which the proxy is
appointed. A failure to specify the number of
shares each proxy appointment relates to or
specifying a number of shares in excess of those
held by the member will result in the proxy
appointment being invalid.
2. A personalised form of proxy for use in connection
with the Annual General Meeting is enclosed with
the document of which this notice forms part. If
you do not have a personalised form of proxy and
believe that you should, please contact the
Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor
Services PLC, on 0870 889 4080 or at
Computershare Investor Services PLC, The
Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZY.
Completion and return of a form of proxy will not
preclude a shareholder from attending and voting
at the Annual General Meeting. Addresses
(including electronic addresses) in this document
are included strictly for the purposes specified and
not for any other purpose.
3. To appoint a proxy or proxies shareholders must
complete: (a) a form of proxy, sign it and return it,
together with the power of attorney or other
authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a
notarially certified copy of such authority, to the
Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor
Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road,
Bristol, BS99 6ZY; or (b) a CREST Proxy
Instruction (as set out in paragraph 6 below);
or (c) an online proxy appointment at
www.eproxyappointment.com (you will need to
enter the Control Number, together with your
unique PIN and Shareholder Reference Number
printed on your personalised form of proxy), in
each case so that it is received no later than
11.00 a.m. on 20 January 2009.
4. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a
person nominated under section 146 of the
Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (a
“Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement
between him/her and the shareholder by whom
he/she was nominated, have a right to be
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as
a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a
Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment
right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may,
under any such agreement, have a right to give
instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise
of voting rights.
5. The statement of the rights of shareholders in
relation to the appointment of proxies in
paragraphs 1 to 3 above does not apply to
Nominated Persons. The rights described in these
paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders
of the Company.
6. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or
proxies through the CREST electronic proxy
appointment service may do so for the Annual
General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the
meeting by using the procedures described in the
CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other
CREST sponsored members and those CREST
members who have appointed any voting service
provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or
voting service provider(s), who will be able to take
the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction
made using the CREST service to be valid, the
appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in
accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s
specifications and must contain the information
required for such instructions, as described in the
CREST Manual. The message, regardless of
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy
or an amendment to the instruction given to a
previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the
Company’s agent (ID 3RA50) by the latest time for
receipt of proxy appointments set out in paragraph
3 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will
be taken to be the time (as determined by the
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST
Applications Host) from which the Company’s
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After
this time any change of instructions to proxies

appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other
means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their
CREST sponsors or voting service providers should
note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not
make available special procedures in CREST for
any particular messages. Normal system timings
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to
the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to
take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal
member or sponsored member or has appointed
any voting service provider(s), to procure that his
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s))
such action as is necessary to ensure that a
message is transmitted by means of the CREST
system by any particular time. In this connection,
CREST members and, where applicable, their
CREST sponsors or voting service providers are
referred, in particular, to those sections of the
CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of
the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy
Instruction in the circumstances set out in
regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001.
7. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001, the Company gives
notice that only those shareholders included in the
register of members of the Company at 6.00 p.m.
on 20 January 2009 or, if the meeting is
adjourned, in the register of members at 6.00 p.m.
on the day which is two days before the day of any
adjourned meeting, will be entitled to attend and
to vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect
of the number of shares registered in their names
at that time. Changes to entries on the share
register after 6.00 p.m. on 20 January 2009 or, if
the meeting is adjourned, in the register of
members at 6.00 p.m. on the day which is two
days before the day of any adjourned meeting, will
be disregarded in determining the rights of any
person to attend or vote at the Annual General
Meeting.
8. In the case of joint holders, where more than one
of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy,
only the appointment submitted by the most
senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is
determined by the order in which the names of the
joint holders appear in the Company’s register of
members in respect of the joint holding (the first-
named being the most senior).
9. Copies of the directors’ service contracts or letters
of appointment are available for inspection at the
Company’s registered office during normal
business hours on any weekday (excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) until the
end of the Annual General Meeting.
10. If you have sold or otherwise transferred all your
ordinary shares in the Company, please forward
this document to the purchaser or transferee or to
the stockbroker, bank or other person through
whom the sale or transfer was effected for
transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
11. As at 9.00 a.m. on 2 December 2008, the
Company’s issued share capital comprised
555,977,435 ordinary shares of 2½ pence each.
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at
a general meeting of the Company and, therefore,
the total number of voting rights in the Company
as at 9.00 a.m. on 2 December 2008 is
555,977,435.
12. In order to facilitate voting by corporate
representatives at the meeting, arrangements will
be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if a
corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman
of the meeting as its corporate representative to
vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of
all of the other corporate representatives for that
shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those
corporate representatives will give voting
directions to the chairman and the chairman will
vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate
representative in accordance with those directions;
and (ii) if more than one corporate representative
for the same corporate shareholder attends the
meeting but the corporate shareholder has not
appointed the chairman of the meeting as its
corporate representative, a designated corporate
representative will be nominated, from those
corporate representatives who attend, who will
vote on a poll and the other corporate
representatives will give voting directions to that
designated corporate representative. Corporate
shareholders are referred to the guidance issued
by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators on proxies and corporate
representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details
of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample
form of appointment letter if the chairman is being
appointed as described in (i) above.

The notice of the Annual General Meeting of the
Company to be held on Thursday, 22 January 2009
is set out on pages 110 to 113 of the annual report
and accounts. The following notes provide an
explanation as to why the resolutions set out in
the notice are to be put to shareholders.
Resolutions 1 to 8 are ordinary resolutions. These
resolutions will be passed if more than 50% of the
votes cast for or against are in favour.
Resolution 1 — Laying of Accounts
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985
(the “1985 Act”) to present to the shareholders of the
Company at a general meeting the reports of the
directors and auditors, and the audited accounts of the
Company, for the year ended 30 September 2008. The
report of the directors and the audited accounts have
been approved by the directors, and the report of the
auditors has been approved by the auditors, and a
copy of each of these documents may be found in the
annual report and accounts, starting at page 9.
Resolution 2 — Remuneration Report
The 1985 Act requires the Company to seek
shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration
Report at the general meeting before which the
Company’s annual accounts are laid. The Directors’
Remuneration Report is included in the annual report
and accounts, starting at page 24. If shareholders vote
against the report the directors will still be paid, but
the Remuneration Committee will reconsider its
policy.
Resolution 3 — Declaration of a Final Dividend
An interim dividend of 5.8 pence (net) has already
been paid in respect of the 2007/2008 financial year.
The directors are recommending a final dividend of
10.4 pence (net) per ordinary share of 2½ pence,
payable on 26 January 2009 to holders on the register
as at 6.00 p.m. on 5 January 2009. The final dividend
will not be paid without shareholder approval and its
amount may not exceed the amount recommended by
the directors.
Resolutions 4 and 5 — Reappointment of
Mr H V Reid and Mr D O Maloney
The Company’s articles of association require that any
director who was not appointed or reappointed at
either of the last two annual general meetings before
this meeting must retire, although they may offer
themselves for reappointment. Accordingly, Mr H V
Reid is retiring and seeking reappointment. In
addition, the Company’s articles of association provide
that Mr D O Maloney, having being appointed as a
director since the last annual general meeting, must
stand for reappointment. Biographical information for
Mr H V Reid and Mr D O Maloney is shown on pages 7
and 8 of the annual report and accounts. Details of
why the Board believes they should be reappointed
are included in the directors’ report in the annual
report and accounts, starting at page 9.
Resolution 6 — Auditors’ appointment
The Companies Act 2006 requires that auditors be
appointed at each general meeting at which accounts are
laid, to hold office until the next such meeting. The
resolution seeks shareholder approval for the
reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit
Committee keeps under review the independence and
objectivity of the external auditors, further information on
which can be found in the annual report and accounts on
page 19. After considering relevant information, the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board of directors that
Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed.
Resolution 7 — Auditors’ remuneration
This resolution gives the directors the authority to
determine the remuneration of the auditors for the
audit work to be carried out by them in the next
financial year. The amount of the remuneration paid to
the auditors for the next financial year will be
disclosed in the next audited accounts of the
Company.
Resolution 8 — Authority to the directors to
allot shares
Under the 1985 Act the directors may only allot
shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. If
passed, this resolution will authorise the directors to
allot and issue new shares up to an aggregate
nominal value of £4,216,056.98 (up to 168,642,279
new ordinary shares of 2½ pence each), which is equal
to approximately one-third (33.33%) of the issued
share capital of the Company (excluding treasury
shares) as at 2 December 2008, being the latest
practicable date prior to the publication of the notice.
The authority will expire 15 months after the date of
passing of the resolution or, if earlier, at the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the
Company in 2010.
Passing this resolution will continue the directors’
flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders,
when opportunities arise, by issuing new shares. The
directors currently have no intention of issuing new
shares.

As at 2 December 2008, the latest practicable date
prior to the publication of the notice, the Company
had 555,977,435 ordinary shares of 2½ pence each in
issue and held 50,000,000 treasury shares, which is
equal to approximately 9.88% of the issued share
capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as
at that date.
Resolutions 9 and 10 are special resolutions.
These resolutions will be passed if not less than
75% of the votes cast for or against are in favour.
Resolution 9 — Disapplication of statutory pre-
emption rights
If the Company issues new shares for cash it must first
offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to
their current holdings, in compliance with their
statutory pre-emption rights. If passed, this resolution
will authorise the directors to modify these rights to
deal with legal, regulatory or practical problems that
may arise on a rights or other pre-emptive offer or
issue.
The resolution also seeks shareholder authority to issue
a limited number of shares for cash and/or sell treasury
shares without offering them to shareholders first. The
authority is for an aggregate nominal amount of up to
5% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued share
capital of the Company as at 2 December 2008, the
latest practicable date prior to the publication of the
notice (up to 27,798,871 new ordinary shares of 2½
pence each). The resolution complies with investor
protection guidelines, which limit any issue to 5% of
issued share capital in any one year. The authority will
expire at the same time as the authority to allot shares
given pursuant to resolution 8.
The directors consider this authority necessary in order
to give them flexibility to deal with opportunities as
they arise, subject to the restrictions contained in the
resolution.
Resolution 10 — Purchase of own shares by the
Company
If passed this resolution will grant the Company
authority for a period of up to 15 months after the
date of passing of the resolution to buy its own shares
in the market. The resolution limits the number of
shares that may be purchased to 14.99% of the
Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury
shares) as at 2 December 2008, the latest practicable
date prior to the publication of the notice. The price
per ordinary share that the Company may pay is set at
a minimum amount (excluding expenses) of 2½ pence
per ordinary share and a maximum amount (excluding
expenses) of the higher of: (i) 5% over the average of
the previous five days’ middle market prices; and (ii)
the higher of the price of the last independent trade
and the highest current independent bid on the
trading venue where the purchase is carried out. This
authority will only be exercised if market conditions
make it advantageous to do so.
The directors’ present intention is that shares
purchased pursuant to this authority will be cancelled
immediately on purchase. Alternatively, the shares
may be held in treasury (provided any treasury shares
held do not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued
share capital), sold for cash or (provided Listing Rule
requirements are met) transferred to an employee
share scheme. The effect of any cancellation would be
to reduce the number of shares in issue. For most
purposes, while held in treasury, shares are treated as
if they have been cancelled (for example, they carry
no voting rights and do not rank for dividends). The
directors will only make purchases under this
authority (whether or not under the rolling share buy-
back programme) if they believe that to do so would
result in an increased earnings per share and would be
in the interests of shareholders generally.
As at 2 December 2008, the latest practicable date
prior to the publication of the notice, options were
outstanding over 7,883,813 ordinary shares of 2½
pence each in the Company, representing
approximately 1.56% of the issued share capital of the
Company (excluding treasury shares) at that date. If
the proposed market purchase authority were used in
full, shares over which options were outstanding
would, as at that date, represent approximately 1.83%
of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding
treasury shares).

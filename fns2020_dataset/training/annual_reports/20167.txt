The financial data presented in the Overview and Strategic report relates to the 
Investment basis financial statements. The Investment basis is described on 
page  40 and the differences from, and the reconciliation to, the IFRS Audited 
financial statements are detailed on pages 54 to 57 .
Strong total shareholder return
Our share price increased from 316p on 28 March 2013 to 398p  
on 31 March 2014. After adjusting for dividends paid in the year,  
this represents a total shareholder return in the year of 30%.
We committed to pay a regular base dividend of 8.1p per share in 
respect of each financial year. A good level of realisations in the year 
has funded an additional dividend of 1 1.9p per share, so that the total 
proposed dividend for the year to 31 March 2014 is 20p per share.  
We paid one-third of this, 6.7p per share, in January 2014 as an interim 
dividend and, subject to shareholder approval, will pay the remaining 
balance of 13.3p per share as a final dividend in July 2014.

Delivering strong results
Chairman’ s statement
“ A strong performance as we 
continue implementing our 
strategic plan. ”
I am pleased to report a strong 
performance for the financial year to 
3 1  March 201 4. Simon Borrows and his 
executive team have made excellent 
headway in accomplishing many of the 
objectives in the three-year strategic 
plan we adopted in June 201 2 and 
have  achieved both strong levels of 
realisations and continued progress 
in  matching the level of our operating 
costs with our annual cash income.
Dividend
In May 2012, the Board announced a strengthened 
distribution policy designed to give shareholders a direct 
share in the success of the Group’s realisations by adopting 
a policy of returning to shareholders a proportion of gross 
cash proceeds subject to certain conditions. 
These conditions have been satisfied, and in November 2013 
we announced that we would be initiating additional 
shareholder distributions above the base dividend.
Given the strong level of realisations, the emphasis on 
selective investment in uncertain market conditions, and 
our healthy balance sheet position, we are proposing a total 
dividend for the financial year to 31 March 2014 of 20.0 pence 
per share, a yield of 6% on the 316 pence per share price 
at 28 March 2013. We paid one third of this, 6.7 pence per 
share, in January 2014 as an interim dividend. Subject to 
shareholder approval, we will pay the balance of 13.3 pence 
per share as a final dividend in July 2014.
Board changes
During the year, Willem Mesdag retired from the Board with 
effect from 30 November 2013. Willem had served as a 
non-executive Director on our Board since 2007 , including as 
Chair of the Valuations Committee, and I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank him for his valuable advice and counsel 
over that period. David Hutchison OBE, who is Chief Executive 
of Social Finance Ltd, joined our Board as a non-executive 
Director with effect from 1 1 November 2013. David has 
succeeded Willem as Chair of the Valuations Committee.
Outlook
We remain cautious overall on the economic outlook. While 
there appear to be some positive indicators in certain parts 
of the European economy, not least strong equity markets, 
overall levels of GDP growth remain low and we believe 
that any broader based recovery could take time, and the 
unwinding of recent monetary policy will not be without risk.
Despite this uncertain macroeconomic environment and 
relatively subdued levels of M&A activity in our core markets, 
our Private Equity business completed three new mid-market 
investments and one significant further investment: Basic-Fit, 
GIF , JMJ Associates and Scandlines, contributing to total cash 
investment of £372 million, including third-party funds.  
Within Infrastructure, the Group completed its acquisition  
of Barclays’ Infrastructure Funds Management business, 
adding over £700 million of assets under management and  
an experienced investment team based in London and Paris. 
We have also capitalised on buoyant credit markets in  
Debt Management, with the launch of four new CLO funds 
with aggregate third-party AUM of £1.2 billion.
The strength of the market for realisations and Simon Borrows’ 
success in leading 3i through an intensive restructuring process 
have allowed us again to demonstrate the strength of 3i’s 
franchise. We are confident that we will deliver the remaining 
objectives set out in the strategic plan, and we look forward 
to improving further the performance of the business and 
generating further shareholder value in years to come.

Strategic report
Delivering our strategic plan
Chief Executive’ s review
“We have met or exceeded all 
of  our strategic priorities and 
targets for the year . 3i is now  
a more streamlined, decisive 
organisation focused on high 
performance and delivering 
attractive shareholder returns. ”
Introduction
FY201 4 was another busy year for 
everyone at 3i. We met or exceeded all 
of our strategic priorities and targets 
for  the year , and I am pleased to report 
a  strong set of results. We are now 
almost two years into the three-year 
strategic plan that I set out in June 201 2. 
This year’ s strong performance 
benefited from the considerable 
progress made during our 
restructuring phase in FY201 3. 
3i generated a total shareholder return of 30% compared  
to 9% for the FTSE All-Share index. Like many UK-based 
companies, we faced currency headwinds this year and  
the performance is all the more credible in view of that. 
During the year, we delivered a good flow of realisations 
and a total return of 16.3%. This included a good progression 
in NAV per share to 348 pence at 31 March 2014, from 
31 1 pence at 31 March 2013. 
As announced in November 2013, given the strong level of 
realisations, the emphasis on selective investment in these 
high-priced market conditions and our healthy balance sheet 
position, we have initiated additional shareholder distributions. 
The total proposed dividend for the financial year to  
31 March 2014 is 20 pence per share, a yield of over 6% to  
the 316 pence share price at the close of 28 March 2013.  
We paid one-third of this, 6.7 pence per share, in January 2014 
as an interim dividend. Subject to shareholder approval, we 
will pay the balance of 13.3 pence per share as a final 
dividend in July 2014.
Simon Borrows  
Chief Executive 7
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Strategic report
Performance in the year
The Private Equity business made excellent progress this 
year, generating a gross investment return of £647 million 
(24% on opening value), reflecting the strong realisation 
activity and good earnings growth across the portfolio. 
We continue to see significant benefits from the asset 
management improvement initiatives launched in FY2013. 
The majority of our investments generated earnings growth 
during the year, with larger investments such as Action 
continuing to perform very well. A consequence of this strong 
performance is an increase in the carry payable we are 
accruing on our Proprietary Capital, although we have some 
way to go before this becomes a cash payment. Overall, the 
Private Equity investment portfolio is in much better shape 
than it was two years ago and I believe it offers significant 
potential for further value creation.
During the year, we delivered a good flow of Private Equity 
realisations, generating £669 million of total proceeds for 3i 
and realised profits over opening valuation of £201 million,  
an overall uplift of 43%. Including third-party funds managed 
by 3i, total Private Equity realisation proceeds in the period 
were £1.1 billion. These were achieved at a total money 
multiple of 1.8x, generating good returns on both proprietary 
and third-party capital for the benefit of our shareholders  
and fund investors. We realised a mix of investments over  
the year, including a good number of our smaller, more 
challenged investments. We have not sold any of our longer-
term hold investments which make up the largest part of our 
portfolio value. Their strong performance has led to material 
improvement in Eurofund V and the Growth Capital Fund, 
which have now recovered to 1.13x and 1.32x respectively 
of invested capital at 31 March 2014. This compares to 
0.91x and 1.04x at 31 March 2013 respectively.
As at 31 March 2014, our Private Equity portfolio comprised 
81 different investments, many of which have relatively low 
value. Over the next few years, as we continue to realise 
older and smaller value investments and pursue a focused 
investment strategy, we expect the number of investments 
held in our Private Equity portfolio to more than halve. This 
will create a much more manageable portfolio and generate 
further operating efficiencies.
For the Private Equity business, a key highlight of the year 
was the increased momentum in new investment activity 
with four key investments: Basic-Fit (leading European 
discount fitness operator), GIF (German-based specialist in 
transmission testing), JMJ (global management consultancy) 
and a substantial further investment in Scandlines (leading 
European ferry operator). In total, cash investment was 
£372 million including third-party funds, of which £276 million 
was 3i’s proprietary capital. We made these investments 
at careful prices and expect this group of assets to deliver 
considerable upside value over the medium term.
While this pick-up in new investment activity is encouraging, 
we remain highly selective given the current high-price 
environment. We continue to focus on our core sectors and 
geographies where we have real experience and where our 
international platform and capabilities are a differentiator.  
We focus on mid-market investments which we are able to 
secure using our local expertise and presence, away from 
highly competitive auction processes. A key aspect of our 
differentiated business model is that we lead investments 
with our own balance sheet. We aim to fund a majority 
of each investment with proprietary capital as well 
as managing the balance of third-party funds for our  
co-investors. This enables us to retain a material share  
of the alpha-generating economics. 8
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Strategic report
In Infrastructure, the European portfolio continued to  
perform well and generated a good level of cash income 
for the Group, through both dividends and advisory fees 
from 3i Infrastructure plc. However, the value of the 3i India 
Infrastructure Fund declined during the year, driven by the 
combination of a material depreciation in the Indian rupee  
and political and macroeconomic challenges in India.  
3i Infrastructure plc’s core European portfolio is expected  
to be the key driver of future performance and accounted  
for 78% of 3i’s underlying Infrastructure portfolio value 
at 31 March 2014, compared with 68% at 31 March 2013.
In November 2013, 3i completed the acquisition from Barclays 
of their European infrastructure fund management business, 
adding over £700 million of assets under management and 
experienced investment teams in both London and Paris. 
This business was a pioneer in the PPP market and currently 
manages two unlisted funds focused on UK and European 
PPP and low-risk energy projects. This strategic acquisition 
is a key milestone in the development of our Infrastructure 
business and I believe it will broaden and enhance our access 
to new investment opportunities, as well as providing 
a platform for future fundraising.
In February 2014, following the announcement of Cressida 
Hogg’s departure, we appointed Ben Loomes and Phil White 
as Managing Partners and Co-heads of the Infrastructure 
business. This important leadership change brings fresh 
impetus and further underlines 3i’s commitment to the next 
stage of development of its Infrastructure platform.
Furthermore, in May 2014, 3i Infrastructure plc announced 
that it had agreed, subject to shareholder approval, and 
approval from the Jersey Financial Services Commission,  
a number of amendments to the existing advisory agreement 
with 3i. These included extending the term of the advisory 
agreement for a minimum of a further five years.
There continues to be a strong demand for infrastructure 
assets as investors seek yield. While the market remains 
competitive, we are seeing a number of interesting 
investment opportunities in our target markets. For example, 
in June last year, 3i Infrastructure plc invested £62 million 
in Cross London Trains, which will own a key element 
of London’s commuter rail infrastructure. In addition, 
it announced investments in the National Military Museum 
(Netherlands) and Mersey Gateway Bridge (UK) primary 
PPP projects, sourced through our new PPP platform, 
and see a strong pipeline for further PPP investments.
In Debt Management, third-party management fee income 
remained steady at £32 million (201 3: £31 million), representing 
44% of the Group’s total third-party management fee income 
in the period. At 31 March 2014, the business managed 
£6.5 billion of assets through 28 funds, 17 in Europe and 
1 1 in the US.
Market activity was buoyant during the year, following the 
re-opening of the European CLO market early in 2013.  
Levels of new CLO issuance in the US were dampened in 
early 2014 by anticipated regulatory changes but have 
subsequently recovered. We capitalised on this with the 
launch of two new European CLOs (Harvest VII and Harvest 
VIII) and two new US CLOs (Jamestown III and COA Summit). 
Together, these new CLO funds added £1.2 billion of AUM 
including £40 million of proprietary capital.
During the year, Debt Management generated a gross 
investment return of £16 million, equating to 20% of its 
opening portfolio value.
Since the period end, we have made good progress towards 
launching further CLO funds and we have warehousing 
vehicles in place in both Europe and the US to seed these 
future launches.

Strategic report
Strategic objectives 
and progress
Last year, I set out a number of key strategic objectives:
  Cover operating costs with annual cash income
  Grow third-party income and generate 
a sustainable annual operating profit from 
our fund management activities
  Improve capital allocation, focusing on enhanced 
shareholder distributions and re-investment in 
our core investment businesses
Our progress against each of these objectives is 
described below.
Cover operating costs with annual 
cash income
Prior to the launch of 3i’s restructuring in 2012, the Group’s 
operating costs materially exceeded its annual cash income 
from management fees and portfolio income. An important 
target in FY2014 was to cover the Group’s operating costs 
with annual cash income. The major cost reduction 
programme announced in June 2012 was a key part 
of achieving this objective. 
In FY2013, we significantly outperformed our original target 
of £40 million of annualised run-rate operating cost savings, 
achieving £51 million of cost savings at 31 March 2013. In this 
context, we announced last year a new target of £60 million of 
cumulative run-rate cost savings to be achieved by 31 March 
2014. I am pleased to report that we exceeded this target 
as well, delivering £70 million of run-rate cost savings at 
31 March 2014. These savings represent over a third of the 
Group’s total opening run-rate cost base of £185 million 
at 31 March 2012, before we announced the restructuring.  
As a result, actual operating costs in the year were 
£136 million, 20% lower than last year (2013: £170 million), 
including restructuring costs of £9 million (2013: £30 million). 
Restructuring costs were higher than the £7 million 
estimated, in order to secure the higher savings. We expect 
the full benefits of this cost reduction programme to be 
realised during FY2015.
In FY2014, the Group’s cash income was consistent with the 
prior year at £132 million. This was driven by the acquisition 
of the European PPP platform in our Infrastructure business 
and the launch of new CLO funds and increased portfolio 
income from proprietary capital deployed in our Debt 
Management business. This offset the reduction in fee 
income from Private Equity as a result of net divestment 
activity, as well as the Growth Capital Fund coming to the 
end of its investment period in the previous year.
To help you track our progress, last year we introduced 
a new key performance indicator called “Annual operating 
cash profit”. This measures the difference between our 
annual cash income (cash fees from managing third-party 
funds and cash income from our proprietary capital portfolio) 
and our annual operating expenses, excluding restructuring 
costs. As noted above, in the past, 3i has operated at 
a material deficit on this measure. In FY2014, we achieved 
an annual operating cash profit of £5 million.
Grow third-party income and generate 
a  sustainable annual operating profit 
from  our  fund management activities
Our Fund Management platforms in Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management source and manage 
investments on behalf of both 3i and third-party funds.  
These platforms underpin our ability to make alpha-
generating investments on behalf of our shareholders, 
co-investors and fund investors. A key objective for us is 
to ensure that fees from these fund management activities, 
taken together, more than cover the costs of operating our 
platforms and that over time we are able to generate a 
sustainable annual operating profit. The costs of running  
our investment platforms include paying for our investment 
teams and the network of international offices, as well as  
the costs to the Group of providing support functions such  
as finance, information technology, compliance and  
human resources.
Our objective is to ensure that we maintain a profitable Fund 
Management platform overall, growing our AUM profitably. 
We have made strong progress in this regard. Since 31 March 
2012, total AUM has grown from £10.5 billion to £12.9 billion 
at 31 March 2014. Over the same period, through the cost 
reduction programme, we reduced our operating costs  
as a percentage of weighted average AUM from 1.5% at 
31 March 2012 to 1.0% at 31 March 2014, excluding 
restructuring costs.  10
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Strategic report
In order to assess properly the profitability of our fund 
management activities, we consider the fees that can  
be generated by our entire Fund Management platform, 
treating proprietary capital invested on the same basis  
as managed third-party funds. To do this, we calculate an 
internal fee payable to the Fund Management business for 
managing our proprietary capital and call this a “synthetic 
fee”. The standalone profitability of our Fund Management  
platform is then based on measuring the total fund 
management income (third-party fees plus synthetic fees) 
against the operating costs allocated to the platform, 
excluding restructuring and amortisation costs. To help you 
track this profitability, we have introduced a new key 
performance indicator called “Underlying Fund Management 
profit and margin” (further details on page 46). In FY2014, 
our fund management platform generated an underlying 
profit and margin of £33 million and 26% respectively, 
compared to £17 million and 13% in FY2013.
Over time, we believe that our Fund Management platform is 
capable of generating sustainable and growing annual profits, 
which in turn should create additional value for shareholders 
beyond the growth in value of our proprietary investments. 
This is an important building block of the 3i Value Build which 
I talked about in my last review and which is shown 
on page 13.
Improve capital allocation, focusing 
on  enhanced shareholder  distributions 
and  re-investment in our core 
investment businesses
As part of the strategic review, we fundamentally changed  
our capital allocation approach so that, over time, we aim  
to use less of our capital to pay operating costs, funding  
costs and debt repayment, and instead focus our capital 
on additional shareholder distributions and investment 
in our core businesses.
The chart below shows the average allocation of our capital 
over the three years between FY2010-12. On average, 68%  
of the total proceeds from realisations and cash income was 
used to pay operating and funding costs and debt repayment, 
leaving just 32% for shareholder distributions and investment 
in our core businesses. In FY2014, we improved this picture 
with 50% going to shareholder distributions and re-
investment. We expect further improvement in FY2015.

3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4

Business model
3i’s business is a mix of proprietary capital investing and 
managing third-party capital. This “hybrid” asset manager 
business model enables us to combine capital returns from 
our proprietary balance sheet and recurring management 
fee income from our fund management activities. We believe 
that this represents a differentiated and attractive value 
proposition for our shareholders.
Investing from our own balance sheet is part of our heritage. 
Currently, proprietary AUM amounts to £3.4 billion, 
accounting for 26% of the Group’s total AUM. 3i is the largest 
single investor in its own Private Equity and Infrastructure 
funds. Putting our own capital to work alongside third-party 
investors is a fundamental part of our business model and 
strategy, and gives 3i a true competitive advantage. We view 
our role as both an active owner as well as manager of 
third-party funds. This further reinforces the alignment 
between the interests of our shareholders, our co-investors 
and our fund investors. 
So, in addition to generating capital returns from proprietary 
capital investing (our Proprietary Capital activities), we also 
consider the profitability of our Fund Management platform. 
Both parts need to generate value for the Group. Our overall 
objectives are to maximise investment returns from our 
Proprietary Capital activities and grow our Fund Management 
activities profitably. 
We are already managing the Group with this much clearer 
delineation between Proprietary Capital and Fund 
Management. Going forward, you will be able to track our 
progress through new disclosures and a combination of KPIs 
measuring our performance as an investor of Proprietary 
Capital and separately as a Fund Management business,  
in addition to overall Group performance. These KPIs are 
shown on pages 16 and 17 . The performance of these 
activities is discussed in the Financial Review, starting on 
page 40 and further disclosure on the breakdown between 
Proprietary Capital and Fund Management is shown in Note 1 
to the Audited accounts on page 1 14.
Outlook
We have continued to be successful in implementing our 
strategic plan against a backdrop of ongoing challenges in 
the macroeconomic environment. Further regulation across 
the financial services industry is also presenting additional 
challenges for our business through further costs and 
increased complexity. 
Despite this, we see the power of the 3i business model 
coming back well. Our network of local teams across our 
key geographies and our proprietary capital are two key 
competitive advantages. For example, in our mid-market 
Private Equity business, we have had teams on the ground 
across Europe for over 30 years and our franchise in those 
markets is very strong. This enables us to access attractive 
investment opportunities and using our own capital affords 
us flexibility in our approach and timescale that few  
of our competitors have.
The current environment is a tricky one for new investments. 
There is an excess of capital looking for investment 
opportunities and this has driven up sellers’ price expectations. 
We have benefited from this in our realisation programme, 
however as we review new investment we will need to 
continue to be patient and disciplined. Our proposition can 
deliver healthy alpha-generating returns if we invest, manage 
and exit well. Careful investment in mid-market Private Equity 
using 3i’s competitive advantages will generate significant 
value for the Group, its shareholders and third-party investors 
as well as take 3i back to sector-leading performance.
Everyone at 3i is committed and working hard to continue  
to deliver against our strategic plan. I would like to thank the 
entire 3i team for their efforts this year. They are key to our 
success. We are all looking forward to making further good 
progress in FY2015.

3i’ s strategic goal is to be a leading international investment manager of proprietary

longer  term in:
 mid-market Private Equity;
 Infrastructure; and
 Debt Management.
Each of these businesses has different drivers and return characteristics. 
T ogether ,  they provide an attractive balance of income and capital returns.
We believe that the combination of our asset management skills across these 
complementary platforms, together with our strong balance sheet and access 
to  permanent capital, represents a differentiated and attractive value  proposition. 13

we are now required to fair value a number of intermediate 
holding companies that were previously consolidated line 
by line. This fair value approach, applied at the intermediate 
holding company level, effectively obscures the performance 
of our proprietary capital investments and associated 
transactions occurring in the intermediate holding companies. 
As a result, we have introduced separate “Investment basis” 
Statements of comprehensive income, financial position and 
cash flow to aid users of our report. 
The numbers presented in the Overview and Strategic report 
refer to this Investment basis and the table on page 20 
summarises our Investment basis financial results. A more 
detailed discussion of the impact of IFRS 10 is included 
on page 53 and the IFRS financial statements, together 
with a reconciliation to the Investment basis, are provided 
on pages 54 to 57 .
Segmental financial data
We manage the business using the Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management business line  
activities to organise resources and measure performance.
However, as the business has focused on the development 
and efficient management of total assets under management, 
it becomes increasingly relevant to consider the balance of 
fee income and operating costs from that fund management 
activity separately from the value and performance of 3i’s 
proprietary investment portfolio. Consequently, alongside 
the Investment basis statements, we have further analysed 
the performance of our balance sheet investments, 
our “Proprietary Capital” returns, and that of our fund 
management activities, our “Fund Management” returns. 
These are discussed in this section as well as being detailed 
in Note 1 to the Audited financial statements on page 1 14.
In order to assess the profitability of the Fund Management 
platform we have introduced the concept of a “synthetic fee”, 
from the Proprietary Capital business to the Fund 
Management business for its services in managing 
investments funded from our balance sheet. This has been 
benchmarked against our third-party capital arrangements 
in each business line and will be reviewed annually to ensure 
it remains appropriate. A fee of 1.5% is applied to Proprietary 
Capital invested in Private Equity and Infrastructure and 
0.5% in Debt Management.
Performance
The Group generated a total return of £478 million, or a profit 
on opening shareholders’ funds of 16.3% (2013: £373 million 
or 14.2%). This reflects further progress and achievement 
in the implementation of our strategic priorities, with 
good realisations at strong uplifts to opening value, an 
improvement in our cost and income balance, and a further 
reduction in gross debt and associated interest costs. 
However, continuing pressure in macro conditions has 
had a negative impact on the results in the year, principally 
in respect of foreign exchange.

Group overview
3i Group is an international investment 
manager with three complementary 
business lines. All our business lines 
invest using a combination of proprietary 
capital from the Group’ s own balance 
sheet and third-party funds. This 
Business review provides detail on 
our  performance for the  1 2 months 
to  3 1  March 201 4 (“the  period”) as well 
as  our financial position as at that date.
Summary financial data 
Since the adoption of IFRS by the Group in the year  
ended 31 March 2006, there has been discussion about 
whether investment companies, such as 3i, should be  
exempt from consolidation for its portfolio investments.  
The introduction of the IFRS 10 accounting standard has 
resolved this point with the introduction of an investment 
entity exception, which is an excellent outcome as 
consolidation of our portfolio investments would both be 
impractical and limit the usefulness of our statutory accounts. 
We have therefore decided to adopt this standard early 
The financial data presented in the Overview and Strategic 
report relates to the Investment basis financial statements.  
The differences from, and the reconciliation to, the IFRS Audited 
statements are detailed on pages 54 to 57. 20

and close of business on the last trading day of the current year plus shareholder distributions.

to 31 March 2013, as a percentage of weighted average assets under management.

between these activities.
5 Excluding Fund Management restructuring costs of £8 million and amortisation costs of £6 million (2013: £24 million, £6 million). 
The Group generated a gross investment return of 
£665 million (2013: £598 million). Split by business line, 
Private Equity generated £647 million, Debt Management 
£16 million and Infrastructure £2 million. Further detail  
about the performance of our business lines is set out on 
pages 23 to 29 for Private Equity, 30 to 34 for Infrastructure 
and 35 to 39 for Debt Management and Note 1 of the Audited 
financial statements on page 1 14.
As well as a good total return, the operating cash flow 
position has significantly improved and cash portfolio and  
fee income now cover the operating costs of the business.  
A modest increase in third-party assets under management 
and the successful cost reduction programme led to “annual 
operating cash profit” of £5 million in the period, exceeding 
our target to be breakeven by 31 March 2014. This compares 
with an £(8) million loss last year and an average loss of  
£(29) million pa in the period from FY201 1 to FY2013.  
Business review 21
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Strategic report
This means we are operating a much more financially robust 
platform. Sustaining this position by growing cash income 
and maintaining a relentless focus on costs remains a key 
objective. More detail on the annual operating cash profit 
measure and on operating expenses is set out on pages  
42 and 41 respectively.
The primary driver of the improvement in annual operating 
cash profit was a reduced level of operating expenses.  
The Group significantly exceeded its updated run-rate cost 
savings target of £60 million by 31 March 2014 (against 
an original target of £45 million), delivering cumulative  
like-for-like savings of £70 million, a 38% reduction from the 
£185 million opening run-rate cost base at 31 March 2012.
A consequence of the strong investment performance  
was an increase in the amount we accrued in the year  
for carry payable. The charge in the year was £85 million 
(2013: £12 million). Further detail is provided in the 
Financial review.
The Group’s Proprietary Capital portfolio performed well in 
the period with a gross investment return of £665 million, 
or 20.2% of opening portfolio, and an operating profit before 
carry of £539 million (2013: £598 million, 18.7%, £386 million). 
Strong realisations delivering cash proceeds of £677 million 
and realised profits of £202 million (2013: £606 million and 
£190 million) and good value growth of £475 million (2013: 
£253 million), were the largest contributors. The Private 
Equity portfolio performed strongly with average last 
12 month earnings growth of 19%. Portfolio income was 
stable at £101 million (2013: £103 million) and benefited  
from an increased contribution from Debt Management.  
This was offset by net interest payable of £51 million,  
which is materially lower than last year (2013: £95 million). 
The Proprietary Capital business also incurred operating 
expenses of £28 million (2013: £30 million) and a synthetic  
fee for investment management payable to the Fund 
Management business of £51 million (2013: £56 million).  
This synthetic fee was benchmarked against third-party 
arrangements. Foreign exchange volatility, and particularly 
the strength of sterling, led to a £1 16 million non-cash 
accounting charge in the period (2013: £30 million gain).
Net interest payable benefited from the further steps taken to 
reduce gross debt in the period, principally by the repayment 
of drawings under a revolving credit facility in April 2013. 
Gross interest payable of £54 million was below the target of 
£60 million in FY2014. As at 31 March 2014, gross debt was 
£857 million, a reduction of 21% since the start of the period 
and over 47% since 31 March 2012. Strong realisations mean 
that at 31 March 2014 net debt had reduced to £160 million 
compared to £335 million at 31 March 2013, even after 
reflecting the good investment activity in the latter part of 
the year. Gearing was 5% at the end of the period (2013: 1 1%).
The Group’s Fund Management income is driven by total 
assets under management (“AUM”) which were £12.9 billion 
at 31 March 2014 (2013: £12.9 billion). In the period, we  
closed the first new European CLO (Harvest VII) since  
the establishment of the Debt Management business 
in February 201 1, an important milestone for the business. 
This added €310 million to AUM and was followed by a further 
European CLO (Harvest VIII, €425 million) in March 2014. 
The US Debt Management business has continued to grow 
strongly, with two CLOs launched in the year, adding 
$900 million to AUM. 
The proportion of third-party assets under management 
grew to 74% from 71% during the year. Infrastructure 
grew following the acquisition of BIFM, completed in 
November 2013, which added a further £780 million of AUM. 
Private Equity AUM reduced in the year as a result of net 
divestment activity. 
Fees are earned on third-party capital and, as noted above, 
the Proprietary Capital business also generates a synthetic 
fee for the Fund Management business. Fund Management 
income in the year was flat at £127 million (2013: £127 million), 
notwithstanding the effect of net divestment in Private Equity. 
For the Fund Management business to be profitable on 
a sustainable basis, tight cost control is critical. The positive 
impact of the cost reduction programme initiated in 
June 2012 is now clearly shown in the results. Total Fund 
Management operating expenses fell by 23% in the period 
to £108 million (2013: £140 million), including £8 million 
of restructuring costs (2013: £24 million) and the addition 
of £6 million of costs relating to acquisitions in the period.
Consequently, the Fund Management business improved 
both its absolute profit and profit margin in the period. 
Fund Management operating profit before carry at £19 million 
represented a margin of 1 5% (201 3: £(1 3) million loss and (1 0)%). 
On an underlying basis, excluding restructuring and 
amortisation costs, the profit and margin were £33 million  
and 26% (2013: £1 7 million, 13%).
The acquisition of the Barclays Infrastructure Funds 
Management business (“BIFM”), which completed in 
November 2013, will further increase third-party fee income 
and positions the Infrastructure business for growth. 
Fees generated from the team’s managed funds marginally 
exceeded the operating costs of the acquired business 
in the period to 31 March 2014. 
The financial profile of the Group with regard to Proprietary 
Capital performance, annual operating cash profit, Fund 
Management profit and balance sheet strength has materially 
improved, and the Group has now met the criteria for making 
additional distributions set out in May 2012. Realisation 
proceeds, including the carry forward of £222 million of 
proceeds from the sale of Mold-Masters in the prior period, 
totalled £899 million at 31 March 2014. Investment levels 
have improved as momentum builds but we are at the 
lower end of capacity as prices remain high. Taking all these 
factors into account, the Board has therefore confirmed, as 
indicated in November 2013, that it proposes a total dividend 
of 20 pence per share for the year, of which 8.1 pence per 
share is our base dividend. Following the payment of an 
interim 6.7 pence per share dividend in January 2014, the 
final dividend proposed is 13.3 pence per share, subject 
to shareholder approval. 22

Assets under management
The Group’s total AUM increased by £41 million to 
£12,91 1 million during the year. Assets managed on 
behalf of third parties increased as a proportion of the 
total to 74% from 71% at the beginning of the year.
The acquisition of the Barclays Infrastructure Funds 
Management business, which invests in PPP projects  
and completed in November 2013, added £780 million  
of AUM to the Infrastructure business line. Debt Management 
successfully raised two CLOs in Europe and two CLOs in  
the US, which more than offset the reduction in the value  
of assets managed in the CLO and other Debt Management 
fund vehicles that have reached the end of their re-investment 
period. Net divestment activity in Private Equity led to a fall 
in AUM of £662 million. Movements in foreign exchange rates 
also had a negative impact of £374 million on total AUM.

Introduction
3i’ s Private Equity business employs 
59  investment professionals focused 
on  making and managing mid-market 
investments in northern Europe and 
North America.
The Private Equity business also manages the existing 
portfolio in southern Europe, Asia and Brazil. During the  
year we announced that we would not be making any new 
investments, or pursuing a fund raise, in Brazil and have 
reduced the cost and resources applied to it.
As at 31 March 2014, the Private Equity portfolio consisted 
of 81 companies with operations in over 80 countries. Assets 
under management at 31 March 2014 were £4.1 billion  
(2013: £4.9 billion) and the reduction reflects the net 
divestment activity seen in the period. However , the value  
of 3i’s proprietary capital invested in the Private Equity portfolio 
at 31 March 2014 was £2. 9 billion (201 3: £2.7 billion), due to good 
value growth across the portfolio more than offsetting net 
divestment activity.
The business performed well in the year and the gross 
investment return was £647 million, or 24% of the opening 
portfolio value (2013: £562 million, or 21%) reflecting strong 
realisation activity and good earnings growth in the portfolio.
Within this, the European and North American portfolio 
performed particularly well, delivering a gross investment 
return of £698 million (30%), while the portfolio in Asia and 
Brazil delivered a loss of £51 million (13% loss). 
Investment activity picked up in the second half of the year. 
We completed three new investments in JMJ, GIF and 
Basic-Fit, and there was a significant further investment as 
we completed the buyout of our co-shareholder in Scandlines.

and £28 million was invested from co-investment 
arrangements in three of the new investments made 
in the year, in return for management fees and other 
income as well as carried interest. 
Proprietary Capital of £188 million was invested in three  
new investments and £77 million in the further investment 
into Scandlines. In addition, £8 million was invested to 
support restructurings or covenant issues (2013: £13 million) 
and £3 million for other investments (2013: £2 million).  
Other non-cash investment includes capitalised interest  
of £167 million recognised in the loan portfolio (2013: 
£1 13 million). This included £28 million (2013: £7 million)  
of interest which was recognised in the prior year and now 
capitalised and £106 million (2013: £75 million) of interest 
provided against as a result of the principal loan value 
being below par.

Investment and

Merger and acquisition (“M&A”) volumes during the year 
to 31 December 2013 declined in Europe and in the smaller 
to mid-market segments (source: Capital IQ). This led to 
lower private equity deal flow and, with capital availability 
remaining high from both principal investors and debt 
providers, highly competitive auctions and high prices were 
a significant feature of market conditions (source: KPMG 
M&A Predictor, January 2014).
In this environment, we have remained selective and  
focused on sourcing deal flow outside of highly competitive 
processes. Private Equity invested a total of £372 million cash 
(2013: £182 million) in the year, of which 74% was Proprietary 
Capital and 26% third-party capital. Eurofund V invested 
£6 1 million in the Scandlines further investment in the year
Private Equity performance
In light of the market dynamics noted above, there has been 
a positive environment for exits and we have continued to 
make progress, in particular, in exiting our smaller or older 
investments. We were able to achieve a number of very 
successful realisations with carefully structured and 
executed exit plans generating competition among buyers 
and premium exit prices. We were also able to take advantage 
of strong equity markets, most notably in our IPO and partial 
exit from Quintiles.
Private Equity generated Proprietary Capital proceeds from 
realisations of £669 million (2013: £575 million) at a 43% uplift 
over opening portfolio value (2013: 49%). Notable exits 
included the sale of Xellia, which generated proceeds of 
£143 million and an uplift over opening portfolio value of 46%; 
the sale of Civica for £124 million and a 48% uplift on opening 
portfolio value; and the partial sale of shares in Quintiles 
which generated proceeds of £51 million and an uplift of 70% 
over opening portfolio value. The realisations from the Private 
Equity portfolio generated an aggregate money multiple 
of 1.8x (2013: 2.1x). The multiple incorporates the sale of 
Enterprise, a 2007 investment, which was written down by 
£201 million in FY201 1 and sold for £7 million in April 2013. 
Total proceeds of £1,091 million were generated in the 
period (2013: £733 million) on behalf of shareholders 
and third-party investors. 25

1  Following a change in presentation to align to strategy, foreign exchange revaluation movements on the portfolio are now shown as part of the 
gross investment return. Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The portfolio generated a gross investment return  
of £647 million or 24% of the opening portfolio (2013: 
£562 million, or 21%). Strong realisations at good uplifts  
over opening value, as set out on page 25, contributed 
£201 million of realised profit (2013: £190 million).
The remaining portfolio also performed well with value 
growth of £478 million in the year (2013: £250 million).  
This was underpinned by good value weighted earnings 
growth of 19%, a multiple increase of 20%, following rises 
in stock markets during the year and the re-rating of a small 
number of assets, and stable net debt in the portfolio of 3.1x 
EBITDA (2013: 10%, 7% and 3.2x). The majority of the portfolio 
(87% by value) grew earnings in the year and the larger 
investments continue to perform strongly. Chart 3 shows 
earnings growth rates across the portfolio.

Strategic report
In the case of Action, the Benelux headquartered discount 
retailer, EBITDA for valuation purposes is adjusted to reflect  
a run-rate basis. Action is growing strongly due, in large part, 
to its successful store roll-out programme. We believe this 
run-rate methodology fairly reflects the high growth 
characteristics of this business, and therefore its 
maintainable earnings. We continue to monitor closely  
the high level of transaction and IPO activity in the discount 
retail sector in order to appropriately benchmark value  
and have applied a 13.2x pre-discount and 12.5x post-discount 
EBITDA multiple at 31 March 2014. Action is the largest 
Private Equity investment by value, valued at £501 million 
at 31 March 2014 (2013: £280 million), after a recapitalisation 
which returned £59 million of proceeds in the year. At 
31 March 2014, Action represented 17% of the Private Equity 
portfolio (2013: 10%), and, based on the run-rate earnings  
and capital structure at 31 March 2014, a 1x movement 
in the EBITDA multiple applied would increase or decrease 
value by c.£50 million.
We also saw strong value growth from successful IPOs  
with Quintiles listing in May 2013, leading to unrealised  
value growth of £62 million in addition to realised profits of 
£21 million in the year. Since the period end, Phibro also listed 
in the US and its value at 31 March 2014 reflected the IPO 
price. Phibro recorded value growth of £42 million in the year.
Although performance overall was good, there were 
inevitably a small number of investments where company 
and geography specific issues impacted value. In total, we 
saw reductions in value of £134 million offsetting the general 
improvement. The largest negative movement related to 
Hobbs, which was reduced in value by £26 million earlier 
in the year; it was valued at £21 million at 31 March 2014, 
which was in line with the valuation at 31 December 2013.
Forecast earnings, used when the forecast EBITDA outlook 
is lower than the last 12 months’ data and a lead indicator 
of negative portfolio outlook, were used for only four 
investments at 31 March 2014, representing 9% of the 
portfolio by number and 3% by value (2013: 1 1, 22% by 
number and 1 1% by value). 
The net debt position of the portfolio reduced marginally 
in the period and the average ratio of net debt to EBITDA, 
for those assets valued on an earnings basis, was 3.1x at 
31 March 2014 (2013: 3.2x). Successful refinancings within the 
portfolio extended the maturity of portfolio debt, with 79% of 
the debt repayable in 2016 or later (2013: 65%). Chart 4 shows 
the ratio of net debt to EBITDA weighted by portfolio value. 
The combination of earnings growth and net debt reduction 
(“performance”) led to a value increase of £182 million  
(2013: £141 million).
Equity markets were strong throughout the year and the 
average EBITDA multiple in the FTSE 250 increased by 
20% to 13.3x in the period. As a matter of policy, we select 
an appropriate multiple for each investment based on a 
comparable set of quoted companies and we may also 
apply caps and discounts to these comparable multiple 
sets to take account of relevant size, sector and cycle 
considerations as appropriate.  
Against a strong market backdrop, we have applied these  
to a greater proportion of the portfolio during the year.  
The average EBITDA multiple used to value the Private Equity 
portfolio increased by 20% to 10.6x before marketability 
discount (2013: 8.8x) and 9.9x after marketability discount 
(2013: 7 .9x). This translated into a positive movement in the 
period of £216 million (2013: £36 million). Excluding Action, 
the average EBITDA multiple increased by 13% to 9.8x  
pre discount (2013: 8.7x) which represented 9.0x (2013: 7 .8x) 
post discount.
Portfolio income of £68 million (2013: £78 million) decreased 
as a result of net divestment activity. Income from loans  
and receivables reduced as a result of net divestment to 
£46 million (2013: £52 million), dividends received reduced 
to £13 million (2013: £22 million) but other portfolio income 
improved to £9 million (2013: £4 million) as we secured good 
fees on increased investment activity.
81% of the Private Equity portfolio value at 31 March 2014  
was invested outside the UK, with 59% in investments 
denominated in euros and 16% denominated in US dollars. 
The reduction in currency portfolio hedging during the year, 
and sterling’s appreciation against the euro and dollar, 
reduced the portfolio valuation at the balance sheet date 
by £100 million in the period (2013: £44 million gain).
The long-term performance of the Private Equity business 
is monitored through tracking the money multiple and IRR 
of investments. Information detailing the performance of the 
portfolio on a vintage by vintage basis, together with further 
portfolio analysis, is available on 3i’s website www.3i.com.

Priorities for the year ahead
We seek to use our local teams to find opportunities and 
selectively invest in our core markets of northern Europe and 
North America, focused on international growth businesses.
We will work with co-investment partners on new 
investments to strengthen relationships and further expand 
the group of investors we will work with in the future. 
We will continue to manage intensively the existing portfolio 
by implementing clear value-building strategies and 
realising investments well through carefully planned 
and executed exit strategies. This will benefit both 
3i and our third-party investors.
Private Equity performance
AUM reduced to £4,132 million at 31 March 2014 (2013: 
£4,851 million) as a result of the net divestment activity in  
the year and the strengthening of sterling against the euro.
We continued to build relationships with leading investors 
who can invest alongside 3i in future transactions in return  
for management fees, other income and carried interest.  
Two of the three new investments made in the period, 
JMJ and Basic-Fit, were partially funded through this route.
The performance of Eurofund V and the Growth Capital Fund 
improved markedly in the year. At 31 March 2014, Eurofund V 
had a gross money multiple of 1.13x invested capital  
(2013: 0.91x) with strong performance from Action, EMT,  
Hilite and Scandlines contributing to its improved value.  
The Growth Capital Fund also grew returns strongly, 
particularly supported by the performance of Quintiles  
and full realisation of Hyperion.
Table 7 above details the current Private Equity AUM.
Fee income from third parties reduced in the period, as funds 
that are past their investment periods continued to realise 
investments from their portfolios. We continue to focus on 
securing other fees as we increase investment to mitigate 
this effect, but the net divestment position overall led to 
a reduction in the third-party fee income to £17 million 
(2013: £19 million). Case study

Strategic report
We invested in UK-based Civica in 2008, 
alongside Eurofund V, in a public to 
private transaction. We backed the 
incumbent management team, led by 
Simon Downing as Chief Executive and, 
through our Business Leaders Network, 
introduced Mike Jeffries as Chairman, 
who brought 30 years of support services 
experience including similar roles at 
VT Group and WS Atkins.
Our investment helped accelerate Civica’s 
strong underlying organic growth, 
through the completion of 10 acquisitions 
in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, 
adding key product and geographical 
presence. Further, we supported the 
investment and diversification into 
business process outsourcing which 
helped significantly strengthen 
Civica’s strategic positioning, during 
a period of unprecedented change 
in Government spending.
In May 2013, having run a carefully 
planned sale process that attracted 
significant interest, we sold Civica to 
OMERS Private Equity. The enterprise 
value of the transaction was £390 million, 
and total proceeds to 3i of £124 million 
represented a 2.1x money multiple 
on its investment.

3i’s Infrastructure business is focused on making and managing infrastructure investments, and in managing for value 
the investments in the India Fund ahead of an exit. The strategy is built around the following components:

Strategic report
“The European portfolio 
continues to perform well,  
while the acquisition of  BIFM  
has increased the breadth 
of  capability in the team. ”
Introduction
3i’ s Infrastructure business employs 
3 1  investment professionals focused 
on  originating and managing both core 
and Public Private Partnership (“PPP”) 
infrastructure investments.
During the year we completed the acquisition of Barclays 
Infrastructure Fund Management business (“BIFM”),  
adding specialist investment skills in the PPP sector. 
The leadership of the Infrastructure business changed  
in the year. Cressida Hogg left 3i at the end of March and  
Ben Loomes and Phil White were appointed Managing 
Partners and Co-heads of the business.
At 31 March 2014, the underlying Infrastructure  
portfolio consisted of 17 investments, held through  
3i Infrastructure plc (“3iN”) and the 3i India Infrastructure 
Fund (“India Fund”). The business also managed an additional 
1 1 1 investments, held by the two funds managed by BIFM.  
3i has no proprietary capital invested in these two funds. 
Assets under management at 31 March 2014 were £2.3 billion 
(2013: £1.6 billion) and the increase primarily reflects the 
addition of two BIFM funds. The value of 3i’s Proprietary 
Capital invested in the Infrastructure portfolio at  
31 March 2014 was £487 million (2013: £507 million).

A total of £84 million was invested by the vehicles managed 
or advised by 3i. The largest single investment in the year 
was Cross London Trains, a company established to procure 
and lease the rolling stock for use on the Thameslink 
passenger rail franchise, made by 3iN. 3iN also completed 
the investments in the National Military Museum PPP project 
in The Netherlands for £5 million and an investment in the 
Mersey Gateway Bridge PPP project in the UK of £13 million.  
These deals were both sourced by the new PPP team. 
Table 8 provides details of the investments made in the year.
We sold one investment in the period, a stake in a small 
manager of PPP funds, generating proceeds of £2 million and 
a small profit on opening book value. Following the acquisition 
of BIFM, there was no longer a strategic reason for retaining 
a stake in that business.
Gross investment return in the period of £2 million, or 0% of 
the opening portfolio (2013: £22 million or 4%), was impacted 
by both operational and macroeconomic challenges in the 
India Fund portfolio as well as the marked weakening of the 
Indian rupee against sterling. The core European portfolio 
continued to perform well.
Investment and  
realisations activity
The level of competition for infrastructure assets in Europe 
remained high in the year as they continue to be in demand 
from an increasing range of investors for their defensive and 
cash yielding characteristics. This was intensified by high 
levels of debt availability for infrastructure investments. 
Consequently, the team maintained a prudent approach to 
new investment and the level of investment on behalf of its 
advised and managed vehicles remained relatively low. 32
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Strategic report
The portfolio generated a gross investment return 
of £2 million, or 0% of the opening portfolio 
(2013: £22 million or 4%).
The value of the Group’s 34% holding in 3iN increased by 1% 
in the year to 31 March 2014, generating an unrealised value 
gain for the Group of £5 million for the year. The Group also 
received dividend income of £21 million from 3iN in the  
year (2013: £18 million). This return was underpinned by 
the performance of 3iN’s European portfolio, which continued 
to generate good levels of income and value growth. 
In particular, 3iN’s holdings in Elenia and Eversholt saw 
strong value gains, underpinned by the re-financing of their 
acquisition debt facilities at attractive terms, as well as by 
their continued strong operational performance. Its 10% 
holding in AWG ended the year broadly flat in valuation terms. 
The ongoing regulatory review of the UK water sector is 
expected to conclude in December 2014. 3iN’s PPP portfolio 
also delivered robust value gains and good levels of income.
The valuation of the India Fund investments continued to be 
affected by a number of macroeconomic and market factors, 
resulting in an unrealised value loss of £18 million, which 
more than offset the gain generated by 3iN. The India Fund 
power investments, in particular, have experienced issues 
around fuel supply and costs and their ability to pass 
increased fuel costs to their customers. The road investments 
faced challenges in project execution due to delays relating 
to land acquisitions and working capital constraints in the 
construction sector.
At 31 March 2014, 22% of 3i’s Proprietary Capital underlying 
portfolio was denominated in Indian rupees (2013: 32%). 
The weakness in the Indian rupee and US dollar against 
sterling impacted the portfolio valuation at the balance sheet 
date. A translation charge of £7 million (2013: £6 million gain) 
further offset the good underlying performance in Europe 
in the period.

AUM increased to £2,294 million at 31 March 2014 (2013: 
£1,579 million) as a result of the acquisition of BIFM and 
growth in the NAV of 3iN, offset by a reduction due to foreign 
exchange translation in the AUM of the India Fund which 
is denominated in US dollars.
We continue to explore potential fund raising options, 
with a focus on primary PPP investing as a result of the 
expansion in capability in that area.
Table 10 below details the current Infrastructure AUM.
Fee income from third parties increased in the year to 
£24 million (2013: £21 million) which reflects stable 3iN fee 
income, four months of fee income from acquired funds and 
lower fee income from the India Fund. BIFM is expected 
to generate, prior to any additional fund raising, c.£7 million 
in fee income next year.
Priorities for the year ahead
In Europe, we will maintain our rigorous investment approach, 
focusing our activity in the core infrastructure and PPP 
project markets in Europe, building on our market-leading 
track record of returns. 
We will continue to work with the management teams of the 
portfolio to improve operational performance and deliver 
value over the long term.
We aim to increase AUM through future capital raisings 
for 3iN, as appropriate, and through targeted private fund 
raisings, principally focused on PPP investments.
In India, we will focus on managing the existing portfolio 
to maximise value in the realisation phase. Acquisition of Barclays’ Infrastructure Fund

The business currently manages 
two active unlisted funds that  
invest in UK and European PPP  
and energy projects, with assets 
under management of over 
£700 million. The acquisition has 
broadened the capabilities and 
expertise of 3i’s infrastructure 
investment team, expanding its  
access to the growing PPP and  
low-risk energy project market 
across Europe.
The 21-strong team, based at 
3i’s offices in London and Paris, 
was incorporated into 3i’s existing 
investment business. Since joining 
3i, the team has been working 
seamlessly with the core infrastructure 
investment team, completing 
two new investments in UK and 
European primary PPP projects 
for 3i Infrastructure plc: in the 
Dutch National Military Museum 
and the Mersey Gateway Bridge. 
The completion of this strategic 
acquisition was a significant milestone 
in the implementation of 3i’s strategy. 
It demonstrated our commitment 
to the growth of our infrastructure 
business and reaffirmed our objective 
to increase third-party fee income by 
growing assets under management. 
We intend to leverage our enhanced 
infrastructure investment platform to 
continue to bring incremental deal flow

Debt Management business model
3i’s Debt Management business is focused on raising and managing corporate debt funds in Europe and North America.
Introduction
3i’ s Debt Management business 
employs  29 investment professionals 
focused on  managing funds that invest 
in corporate debt in both Europe and 
North America. 
As at 31 March 2014, the Debt Management business 
managed 28 funds principally being Collateralised Loan 
Obligations (“CLOs”). Assets under management at 31 March 
2014 were £6.5 billion (2013: £6.4 billion) and the increase 
primarily reflects the raising of four CLOs during the year, 
including our first in Europe since the establishment of the 
business in 201 1. This AUM growth was offset by reductions 
in older funds as they passed their re-investment period and 
capital was distributed to investors. The value of 3i’s 
Proprietary Capital invested in the Debt Management portfolio 
at 31 March 2014 was £143 million (2013: £81 million).
Gross investment return in the period of £16 million or 20% 
of the opening portfolio (2013: £14 million or 33%) was good 
and reflected the strong performance of the funds and 
a consequent increase in both the valuation of our holdings 
and cash income in the year.
The level of investment activity increased as 3i invested in 
three of the four CLOs raised and also provided capital to 
establish warehouse facilities in order to build up portfolios 
of assets ahead of future fund raises. £6 1 million was invested 
in the year (2013: £23 million).

Investment and 
realisations activity
In 2013, the European CLO market re-opened, supported by 
increased economic confidence and increased private equity 
deal flow at the larger end of the market. During 2013, 
20 European CLOs were raised with a value of €7 .4 billion, 
while no CLOs were raised in 2012. The US CLO market 
continued to build on its momentum from 2012 during the 
first half of 2013, with record quarterly levels of CLO issuance 
seen in the second quarter. Increasing concerns about future 
US regulation (particularly the Volcker Rule) dampened 
activity in the second half, however issuance in early 2014 
was at strong levels, following the announcement by the 
Federal Reserve that banks will be given until July 2017 
to comply with the Volcker Rule. 
The Debt Management business closed two European CLOs 
in the period and 3i invested £34 million into these launches 
alongside third-party investors. There were two CLO launches 
in the US, into which 3i invested £6 million. In addition, 3i has 
committed £80 million to create warehouse facilities in both 
the US and Europe to support the creation of portfolios ahead 
of future fund launches. During the year, £21 million was 
invested into these facilities. 
Table 1 1 provides details of the investments made in the year.
Following a successful close and a period of good trading, the 
decision was taken to sell our equity holding in Jamestown I. 
This generated proceeds of £5.5 million, and crystallised 
a small realised profit.
Debt Management performance
Gross investment return
The portfolio generated a gross investment return 
of £16 million, or 20% of the opening portfolio  
(2013: £14 million or 33%).
A small realised gain was recognised on the sale 
of our equity holding in Jamestown I.
Unrealised gains of £10 million reflect uplifts in the  
mark-to-market valuations of the equity stakes in our  
CLOs, as well as the valuation movement of our holding  
in the Credit Opportunities Fund (Palace Street I) and 
the warehouse vehicles used to launch CLOs.
Yield is generated from the Debt Management portfolio both 
from distributions on our equity held in the CLOs and Palace 
Street I (£10 million) and interest received on our warehouse 
vehicles (£4 million).
Foreign exchange movements reflect the strengthening 
of sterling in the year, as most of our portfolio is denominated 
either in US dollars or euros.

Fund Management activity
AUM increased to £6,485 million at 31 March 2014 (2013: 
£6,440 million) as a result of the launch of two CLOs in 
Europe and two in North America. This was largely offset 
by the reduction in AUM in several of the CLOs that are now 
past their re-investment period and making distributions 
to investors and foreign exchange.
Table 13 on page 38 details the current Debt 
Management AUM.
Fee income from third parties increased to £32 million 
in the year (2013: £31 million) as AUM grew and we had 
the benefit of a full year of fees from acquisitions made 
in FY2013. Of this, 78% was generated in Europe and 
22% in the US. 
In the year ended 31 March 2013 catch-up fees relating 
to earlier periods of £6 million were received in relation to 
improved fund performance as accrued subordinated fees 
became payable once funds had met their performance 
hurdles. In the year ended 31 March 2014, no such fees 
were received. Therefore, excluding catch-up fees, fee 
income has increased by £7 million in the year.
CLO fees remain the core of the business and accounted 
for 81% of the total fees received in the year (2013: 79%). 
The active CLO markets in both Europe and the US,  
as discussed above, are therefore important. 
Priorities for the year ahead
We continue to manage the existing funds to maintain 
our strong track record of returns, ensuring we remain 
a preferred manager of corporate debt funds.
We will prioritise further CLO launches in both Europe and 
the US in order to replace maturing AUM and increase our 
investment potential.
We will maintain a focus on costs to ensure fees exceed 
operating expenses.
We will consider further inorganic growth opportunities, or 
diversification, where fee income from acquired management 
contracts or platforms would be incrementally profitable.

Case study

3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Strategic report
3i Debt Management teamed up with 
Resource Capital Markets (a subsidiary 
of Resource America) to underwrite 
the equity tranche which provided 
a high level of certainty of execution.
A total of €310 million was raised in a 
range of rated notes from a variety of 
investors after 3i Debt Management 
was able to demonstrate necessary 
access to credit markets and the ability 
to manage the resultant portfolio.
Successfully concluding Harvest CLO 
VII showed the ability of 3i Group to 
raise third-party capital. The equity 
investment is projected to deliver 
double digit returns and managing the 
portfolio will also generate attractive 
long-term annual management fees. 
Harvest VII closed in September 2013 
and has been followed by the larger 
€425 million Harvest CLO VIII which 
closed in March 2014.
Altogether, this brings the total of funds 
raised by 3i to US$2.8 billion from 
CLOs in the last 18 months. 
More information can be found at:  
 www.3i.com
Harvest CLO VII was  
the first new CLO in the 
Harvest series launched 
post the global financial 
crisis and since 3i’ s 
ownership. It  was also 
among the first post crisis 
European CLOs (so called 
CLO 2.0). CLOs buy 
corporate loans using 
securitisation techniques.  40

Basis
Since the adoption of IFRS by the Group in the year ended 
31 March 2006, there has been discussion about whether 
investment companies, such as 3i, should be exempt from 
consolidation for its portfolio investments. The introduction 
of the accounting standard, IFRS 10, has resolved this point 
with the introduction of an investment entity exception, which 
is an excellent outcome as consolidation of our portfolio 
investments would both be impractical and limit the 
usefulness of our statutory accounts. We have therefore 
decided to adopt this standard early to benefit from the 
exception. However, the detailed application of the standard 
has reduced the transparency of the Group’s underlying 
operating performance because we are now required to fair 
value a number of intermediate holding companies that were 
previously consolidated line by line. This fair value approach, 
applied at the intermediate holding company level, effectively 
obscures the performance of our proprietary capital 
investments and associated transactions occurring in 
the intermediate holding companies. As a result, we have 
introduced separate “Investment basis” Statements of 
comprehensive income, financial position and cash flow 
for the first time to aid users of our report. The numbers 
presented in the Overview and Strategic report refer to this 
Investment basis. A more detailed discussion of the impact 
of IFRS 10 is included on page 53.
The commentary in this section refers to the Investment basis 
financial statements because we believe they provide a more 
understandable view of our performance. On pages 54 to 57 , 
we have presented a reconciliation of our Investment basis 
financial statements to the audited IFRS statements which 
are presented in full from page 103 onwards. Total return and 
net assets are equal under each basis; the Investment basis 
is simply a “look through” of IFRS 10 to present the underlying 
investment performance.
We have also taken the opportunity to align our Investment 
basis total return statement more closely to how the business 
is managed on a day-to-day basis. Specifically, following the 
reduction in foreign exchange hedging and, instead, the 
consideration of foreign currency risks as part of the 
investment process, we have included net foreign exchange 
movements relating to the portfolio in a new subtotal, gross 
investment return, as the key measure of investment 
performance. The previous measure, gross portfolio return, 
excluded net foreign exchange movements. We have also 
separately analysed the impact of acquisition accounting as 
“Acquisition related earn-out charges”, which was previously 
included in carry payable.  41

1  Actual operating expenses measured as a percentage of weighted average AUM. Run-rate operating expenses measured as a percentage 
of closing AUM. 
We achieved annualised like-for-like run-rate operating cost 
savings of £70 million at 31 March 2014 against our run-rate 
of £185 million at 31 March 2012. This represents a reduction 
of 38% and exceeds our revised target to achieve cost savings 
of £60 million by 31 March 2014. Of this total, £19 million of 
run-rate savings were achieved during the year ended 
31 March 2014.
The main savings in operating costs since 31 March 2012 
have come from headcount reductions, with average 
headcount of 277 in 2014 compared to 358 in the prior year. 
The majority of the staff changes were implemented in the 
year ended 31 March 2013. As at 31 March 2014, headcount 
was 266, compared to 282 at 31 March 2013 and 435 at 
31 March 2012. The addition of 21 staff as a result of the BIFM 
acquisition was offset by a net reduction of 37 staff across 
the remainder of the Group during the year. The next most 
significant saving related to property costs, as a direct 
consequence of headcount changes.
Restructuring costs of £9 million were incurred during the 
year in order to effect further changes to staff, offices and 
other cost savings. This total was higher than the £7 million 
originally estimated, reflecting the costs of reducing the level 
of resource applied to Brazil and, in particular, the severance 
costs of the team, which were not anticipated in the original 
target. However, the ratio of run-rate cost savings to 
restructuring costs is better than originally targeted, with 
£70 million of run-rate cost savings achieved at a cost of 
£39 million, representing a 1.8x ratio, compared with the 
original target of £45 million savings and £30 million 
restructuring costs (1.5x).
The cost reduction initiatives outlined in the strategic 
announcement in June 2012 are largely complete and we 
will no longer report operating expenses on a run-rate basis 
as we expect it to converge and to be in line with the actuals 
in all material respects.
Operating profit includes gross investment return, 
management fee income generated from managing external 
funds, the costs of running our business, net interest payable, 
movements in the fair value of derivatives, other losses and 
carried interest receivable or payable. Finally, total return 
comprises operating profit less any tax charge and movement 
in the actuarial valuation of the historic defined benefit 
pension scheme.
Each of these aspects of our returns is considered in greater 
detail in this review.
The Group generated a total return of £478 million, or a profit 
on opening shareholders’ funds of 16.3% (2013: £373 million 
or 14.2%). This reflects further progress and achievement 
in the implementation of our strategic priorities, with good 
realisations at strong uplifts to opening value, an improvement 
in our cost and income balance, and a further reduction 
in gross debt. However, continuing strength in sterling had 
a negative impact on the results for the year in respect of 
foreign exchange translation. 
The operating profits of the Proprietary Capital and Fund 
Management business are analysed on pages 42 to 46 and 
the remaining items that contribute to total return on page 47 .
T otal operating expenses
Operating expenses of the Group were £136 million in the 
year (2013: £170 million) and included restructuring costs of 
£9 million (2013: £30 million) in respect of redundancy, office 
closures and organisational changes. Operating expenses as 
a percentage of weighted average AUM decreased to 1.0% 
(2013: 1.3%) as a result of the further reduction in like-for-like 
costs combined with the BIFM acquisition and new CLO fund 
launches in the year which increased the cost efficiency 
of the Group (excluding restructuring costs). 42

1  Operating expenses include accruals, the effect of which is not considered material.
In June 2012, the Group set an objective of generating cash 
income, from third-party fees and portfolio income, sufficient 
to cover the operating expenses incurred in the year, prior 
to restructuring costs. We call this “annual operating 
cash profit”.
The annual operating cash profit position improved from a 
loss of £(8) million in the year to 31 March 2013 to a profit of 
£5 million in the year to 31 March 2014. This is the first year 
the Group achieved an operating cash profit in more than a 
decade. This is a significant step in improving the profitability 
of the Group’s operating model. 
Third-party AUM increased during the year following the 
acquisition of BIFM and the launch of four Debt Management 
funds. The growth in third-party AUM, and a focus on 
generating cash income from the portfolio, has meant the 
Group has been able to maintain its cash income despite  
net divestment activity in Private Equity. Cash income was 
stable at £132 million (2013: £132 million), with a £5 million 
increase in third-party fees and a £5 million decrease in 
portfolio income. 
The benefits of the cost reduction programme are now being 
seen with actual costs (excluding restructuring costs) 
incurred during the year of £127 million (2013: £140 million) 
including £6 million of additional costs relating to acquisitions. 
The cost reduction programme has delivered £70 million 
of run-rate operating cost savings from the initial £185 million 
cost base, a reduction of 38%, before adding costs relating 
to acquired businesses. 
 
Proprietary Capital returns
Our Proprietary Capital business is assessed on operating 
profit before carry, which comprises gross investment return, 
operating expenses, a fee paid to the Fund Management 
business and balance sheet funding expenses such as 
interest payable. Overall operating profit before carry of 
£539 million (2013: £386 million) was £153 million higher 
than the prior year and this was underpinned by strong 
gross investment return and a reduction in costs. 
By business line, the gross investment return on the opening 
portfolio was 24% from Private Equity (2013: 21%), 0% from 
Infrastructure (2013: 4%) and 20% from Debt Management 
(2013: 33%). Private Equity accounts for 82% of the 
Proprietary Capital portfolio at 31 March 2014 (2013: 83%)  
and remains the primary driver of performance for the 
Proprietary Capital segment. Business line performance 
is discussed in more detail on pages 23 to 39.
Realised profits
Realised profits at £202 million in the year to 31 March 2014 
(2013: £190 million) demonstrated a second consecutive year 
of strong exits and were achieved at an uplift over opening 
value of 43% (2013: 46%). We continue to pursue exits through 
careful exit planning, particularly for our older, smaller and 
non-core geography assets. 
The majority of the realisations were from the Private Equity 
portfolio, which contributed £669 million of the £677 million 
proceeds. Table 4 on page 25 details the Private Equity 
realisations in the period and sets out the accounting uplift 
reflected in the annual total return and the longer-term 
cash-to-cash results. The Private Equity realisations 
completed in the year produced a money multiple of 
1.8x over their investment life.

Discounted Cash Flow
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation basis is used  
to value portfolio companies with predictable and stable  
cash flows. This is typically used for investments in our 
Infrastructure business, however one significant Private 
Equity investment, Scandlines is now valued on a DCF  
basis as it has a number of similar characteristics to an 
infrastructure investment. As at 31 March 2014, there were 
eight portfolio companies valued using the DCF valuation 
basis, the majority of which relate to the Group’s Indian 
Infrastructure portfolio. Value growth in Scandlines was  
offset by unrealised losses as a result of the continued 
challenging environment in India, leading to a net loss on 
cases valued using DCF models of £(8) million in the year  
(2013: £(41) million). 
Other
Where a different valuation basis is more appropriate for a 
portfolio company, the “other” category is used to determine 
fair value, for example, the sum of the parts of the business 
or industry specific methods. Unrealised losses of £10 million 
were incurred in the year to 31 March 2014 (2013: gains 
of £73 million). 
Quoted portfolio
The quoted portfolio was valued at £554 million at 31 March 
2014 and now represents 16% (2013: £431 million, 13%) of 
the Group’s total portfolio. The Group’s 34% investment in  
3i Infrastructure plc represents the majority of the quoted 
portfolio at £404 million. 3i Infrastructure plc’s share price 
increased by 1% in the year, resulting in value growth of 
£5 million. The IPO of Quintiles was completed in May 2013 
and following sales of the Group’s holding in the business,  
the value of Quintiles at 31 March 2014 was £122 million.  
The total investment return from Quintiles in the period, 
including realised profits, unrealised profits and income 
was £87 million. The IPO of Phibro was completed after 
the end of the period. At 31 March 2014 this continued 
to be valued on an earnings basis so is not included in 
the quoted portfolio.

indicates a lower maintainable earnings level. Where 
appropriate, adjustments are made to earnings on a  
pro forma basis for acquisitions, disposals and non-recurring 
items. In the case of one company, Action, which is 
experiencing significant growth due to its store roll-out 
programme, a run-rate adjustment is made to its earnings 
to reflect profitability of opened stores for valuation purposes. 
Improvements in the performance of the portfolio valued  
on an earnings basis resulted in an increase in value of  
£182 million (2013: £141 million). Value weighted earnings,  
the most relevant measure of NAV impact, increased by 19% 
in the year, demonstrating that the portfolio’s largest assets 
are delivering strong improvements in performance, while 
net debt in the portfolio reduced marginally to 3.1x 
(2013: 3.2x).
Multiple movements 
Increases in quoted prices for comparable businesses over 
the year, together with a re-rating of a small number of assets 
(most notably Action), have led to an increase in the weighted 
average EBITDA multiple of the portfolio to 10.6x before 
marketability discount (2013: 8.8x) and 9.9x after marketability 
discount (2013: 7 .9x). Excluding Action, the largest asset by 
value and the asset with the highest multiple applied to 
earnings, the weighted average EBITDA multiple of the 
portfolio has increased to 9.8x before marketability discount 
(2013: 8.7x) and 9.0x after marketability discount (2013: 7 .8x). 
The increase in the year has generated an increase in value 
of £216 million (2013: £36 million). 
Provisions
A provision is recognised where we anticipate that there  
is a 50% or greater chance that the Group’s investment in  
the portfolio company will fail within the next 1 2 months.  
No new provisions or reversals were made during the year .
Imminent sale
Portfolio companies which are well advanced in a negotiated  
sales process are valued on an imminent sale basis. At 
31 March 2014, while there are a number of ongoing sales 
processes, only two were sufficiently progressed to value  
on this basis and the uplift to imminent sale was £9 million 
(2013: £24 million). 45

Debt Management
The Debt Management business line has investments 
in a number of the CLOs which the Group manages, as 
well as in the Credit Opportunities Fund, Palace Street I 
and the 3i Senior Loan Fund. The Group also invests in 
Warehouse facilities to support the creation of portfolios  
for future fund launches.
The CLOs are valued on the basis, where possible, of quotes 
from the arranging brokers, substantiated by internal 
modelling of the future returns of the investment and 
third-party databases of prices. At 31 March 2014 the value of 
the equity stakes in CLOs was £67 million (2013: £26 million). 
Warehouse facilities are valued directly on the mark-to-
market of the underlying debt held, and at 31 March 2014 
these totalled £17 million (2013: £nil). The NAV of Palace Street 
I at 31 March 2014 was £53 million (2013: £48 million) and the 
value of the equity held in the US Senior Loan Fund was 
£6 million (2013: £7 million).

Income from the portfolio was £101 million in the year to 
31 March 2014 (2013: £103 million). Dividends of £44 million 
were received (2013: £46 million), including £21 million from  
3i Infrastructure plc, £5 million from Phibro, a US Private 
Equity healthcare investment, and £8 million from Debt 
Management investments. Interest income totalled 
£50 million (2013: £53 million).
A further £7 million in net deal fees was received in the year 
(2013: £4 million), principally relating to fees received on 
completing new investments and annual monitoring fees paid 
by portfolio companies. Of the total, £4 million was allocated 
to the Proprietary Capital business and £3 million to the Fund 
Management business, in line with the split of investment 
between proprietary capital and third-party funds.
Portfolio income received as cash during the year was 
£57 million (2013: £62 million). 
Net foreign exchange movements
The total net foreign exchange loss of £1 16 million (2013: 
£30 million gain) was driven by the strengthening of sterling 
against the euro (1.9%), US dollar (8.8%), Indian rupee (17 .3%), 
Brazilian real (18.8%) and Swedish krona (8.4%) resulting in 
losses of £17 million, £6 1 million, £14 million, £8 million and 
£8 million respectively. The net foreign exchange loss also 
reflects the translation of non-portfolio net assets, including 
non-sterling cash held at the balance sheet date. 
As at 31 March 2014, a 1% movement in the euro, US dollar 
and the rupee would give rise to a £13 million, £6 million and 
£1 million movement in total return respectively.
Proprietary Capital costs
Synthetic fees are included in the operating profit of the 
Proprietary Capital business to reflect the fees that this 
business would have to pay if the assets were managed 
externally at market rates. The fall in synthetic fees 
to £51 million (2013: £56 million) reflects the lower level 
of Proprietary Capital being managed as a result of net 
divestment during the period. 
A proportion of the Group’s total operating expenses is 
allocated to Proprietary Capital, being those costs assessed 
as having been incurred in running a listed investment trust.  
These include 100% of costs in relation to the CEO and Group 
Finance Director and elements of finance, IT, property and 
compliance. Operating expenses of £28 million were broadly 
flat compared to last year (2013: £30 million) as the 
substantial cost reductions in the Proprietary Capital 
business, made as part of the cost reduction programme, 
were implemented early in FY2013. A more detailed analysis 
of the Group’s total operating expenses is provided on page 41.
Net interest payable
Gross interest payable for the year was £54 million (2013: 
£101 million), 10% below the target of £60 million. During the 
year we further reduced gross debt, repaying £164 million 
of drawings under a revolving credit facility. The current gross 
debt position is detailed further on page 49 and in Note 21.
Interest receivable reduced to £3 million (2013: £6 million) 
in the year, as a result of the lower level of cash and deposits 
held by the Group and lower levels of interest received on 
that cash.
Derivative movements
The Group historically used foreign exchange and interest 
rate derivative contracts as part of its hedging programmes.  
The £10 million gain recognised from the fair value movement 
of the derivatives during the year (2013: £6 million loss), 
principally related to a long-term legacy interest rate swap, 
which has now been closed out. 
Consistent with the strategic focus on cash-to-cash returns, 
the residual foreign exchange derivatives will be closed out 
early if appropriate, depending on the balance of currency 
cash flows, or else allowed to expire and not be replaced. 
We will continue to consider foreign exchange risk at the point 
of investment and divestment and occasionally hedge these 
transactions with short-term derivatives. 46

Our Fund Management business comprises the investment 
teams of our Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt 
Management businesses.
It is assessed on operating profit before carry which 
comprises fee income from third parties as well as a 
synthetic fee received from the Proprietary Capital business, 
less operating expenses. Overall operating profit before carry 
of £19 million for the period was £32 million higher than the 
prior year, as fee income remained stable and the benefits 
of the cost reduction programme became apparent. 
The Group’s Fund Management income is driven by total 
assets under management (“AUM”), which were £12.9 billion 
at 31 March 2014 (2013: £12.9 billion). The acquisition of BIFM 
and the launch of four Debt Management funds offset a fall 
in AUM from the net divestment activity in Private Equity. 
The proportion of third-party assets under management 
grew to 74% from 71% during the year. 
For the Fund Management business to be profitable,  
costs have to be managed closely to ensure they remain 
appropriate and consistent with third-party benchmarks, 
where available. The positive impact of the cost reduction 
programme initiated in June 2012 is now clear. Fund 
Management operating expenses fell by 23% in the period  
to £108 million (2013: £140 million), including £8 million  
of restructuring costs (2013: £24 million) and the addition  
of £6 million of costs relating to acquisitions in the period.
Consequently, Fund Management improved both its absolute 
profit and profit margin in the period. Fund Management 
operating profit at £19 million represented a margin of 15%  
(2013: £13 million loss and (10)%). On an underlying basis, 
excluding restructuring and amortisation costs, operating 
profit was £33 million (2013: £17 million) at a margin of 26% 
(2013: 13%).
Fees receivable from external funds 
Fees earned from external funds of £73 million in the period 
were marginally higher than the prior year (2013: £71 million).
Our Debt Management business line continued to generate 
strong fund fee income of £32 million, in line with the prior 
year (2013: £31 million). In the year ended 31 March 2013, 
catch-up fees relating to earlier periods of £6 million were 
received in relation to improved fund performance, as 
accrued subordinated fees became payable once funds had 
met their performance hurdles. In the year ended 31 March 
2014, no such fees were received. Therefore, on a like-for-like 
basis, fee income has increased by £7 million in the year, 
underpinned by the launch of four new funds.
Advisory and management services to 3i Infrastructure plc 
and the 3i India Infrastructure Fund generated £22 million 
of fee income in the year (2013: £21 million). The acquisition 
of the BIFM platform further supplemented fee income from 
the Infrastructure business line by £2 million. 
Our managed Private Equity funds generated fee income 
of £17 million (2013: £19 million), the decline reflecting the 
full year impact of the Growth Capital Fund coming to the 
end of its investment period in December 2012 and net 
divestment activity. 
Fees receivable from Proprietary Capital
A synthetic fee is included in the operating profit of the Fund 
Management business to reflect the fees that would be 
received on proprietary investments if managed on behalf  
of third parties at market rates. A fee of 1.5% is charged on 
Private Equity and Infrastructure Proprietary Capital and 0.5% 
on Debt Management. The fall in synthetic fees to £51 million 
(2013: £56 million) reflects the lower level of Proprietary 
Capital being managed as a result of net divestment in 
Private Equity during the period. 
Fund Management costs
A proportion of the Group’s total operating expenses is 
allocated to the Fund Management activity. This includes 
all costs in relation to investment management and 
advisory activity as well as an allocation in relation to direct 
and indirect support functions, such as finance, IT, human 
resources, compliance, and property costs. Fund Management 
operating expenses fell by 23% in the period to £108 million 
(2013: £140 million). A more detailed analysis of the Group’s 
total operating expenses is provided on page 41. 47

The Group’s total return comprises the operating profit

businesses, net carried interest, tax and charges relating 
to defined benefit pension schemes.
Net carried interest and 
performance  fees payable
Net carried interest and performance fees payable in 
the year increased in line with the improved portfolio 
performance and realisations, with a net payable of 
£82 million (2013: £8 million payable).
Carried interest and performance fees are accrued on the 
realised and unrealised profits generated, taking relevant 
performance hurdles into consideration, assuming all 
investments were realised at the prevailing book value. 
Carry is only actually paid or received when the relevant 
performance hurdles are met, and the accrual is discounted 
to reflect expected payment periods.
Carry receivable is generated on third-party capital over 
the life of the relevant fund when relevant performance 
criteria are met. 
Our largest Private Equity fund, Eurofund V, which includes 
assets purchased in 2007–1 2, has not yet met the performance 
hurdle due to the weak performance of the 2007–09 vintages. 
Although we have seen a strong recovery in that fund’s 
multiple to 1.13x invested capital, the drag from these earlier 
investments means that we have not yet recognised carry 
receivable from this fund.
We pay carry to our investment teams on proprietary 
capital invested and share a proportion of carry receivable 
from third-party funds. This total carry payable is 
provided through schemes which have been structured 
historically over two year vintages to maximise flexibility 
in resource planning.
The improved performance of the portfolio over the last two 
years means that the majority of assets by value are now held 
in carry payable schemes that have met their performance 
hurdles, assuming the portfolio was realised at its 31 March 
2014 valuation. Of the accrual of £85 million, £18 million 
relates to the catch up in accrual on schemes that hit the 
hurdle this year. Hereafter, carry payable will increase 
or decrease broadly in line with the performance of the 
portfolio at rates of between 10% and 15%.
Pensions
The IAS 19 valuation of the Group’s UK defined benefit 
pension scheme was positively impacted by an increase 
in the discount rate, driven by an increase in AA corporate 
bond yields, and a decrease in inflation rates, resulting in a 
decrease in the value of the scheme’s liabilities. This resulted 
in a re-measurement gain of £1 1 million (2013: £21 million) 
for the year. 
The 2013 triennial valuation was completed in March 2014. 
It resulted in a very small surplus and consequently no 
further contributions were made or are planned as a result 
of this valuation. 48

1 Includes capitalised interest and other non-cash investment.
2 Other relates to foreign exchange and the provisioning of capitalised interest.
Strong realisations in the year and the negative impact of 
foreign exchange movements were offset by investment 
of £504 million and unrealised value growth of £475 million, 
resulting in an increase in the total Proprietary Capital 
portfolio value to £3,565 million at 31 March 2014 (2013: 
£3,295 million).
The weighting of Private Equity in the portfolio reduced 
marginally to 82% (2013: 83%) while Debt Management 
increased to 4% (2013: 2%). This reflects both the net 
divestment in Private Equity and the increase in funding 
of the Debt Management business to purchase equity 
stakes of CLOs launched in the year. The weighting of 
the Infrastructure portfolio remained relatively stable 
at 14% (2013: 15%).
Realisations in the year generated cash proceeds of  
£677 million (2013: £606 million), offset by cash investment of 
£337 million (2013: £149 million), resulting in net cash inflow 
of £340 million (2013: £457 million). A further £167 million 
of investment was in non-cash form (2013: £1 13 million) 
and total investment was £504 million (2013: £262 million).

operating expenses of £148 million (2013: £198 million) which,  
in addition to running costs and restructuring costs, includes 
carry paid and cash pension costs.
Net cash interest of £54 million was paid in the year, 
significantly below the £1 1 1 million paid last year.

Gross debt £857m £1,081m

Gearing 5% 11%
The Group further reinforced its conservative balance sheet 
approach, with gross debt reducing by 21% in the year to 
£857 million (2013: £1,081 million). A further £164 million 
drawn under the 2016 revolving credit facility was repaid 
in April 2013. This was funded by cash from realisation 
proceeds generated in the prior year. 
Net debt reduced following net divestment to £160 million 
(2013: £335 million). Gearing consequently reduced to 5%  
at 31 March 2014 (2013: 1 1%) as a result of both the decrease 
in net debt and the increase in shareholders’ funds to 
£3,308 million (2013: £2,934 million) following the total return 
of £478 million in the year to 31 March 2014.
Liquidity
Liquidity increased in the year to £1,197 million (2013: 
£1,082 million). This comprised cash and deposits of 
£697 million (2013: £746 million) and undrawn facilities of 
£500 million (2013: £336 million). The cash balance reduced 
primarily as a result of the repayment of debt in the year, 
with cash inflows from divestment activity being offset 
by investment and other operating cash flows. 
Foreign exchange hedging
As a result of the reduction in gross debt, and the increased 
concentration of the portfolio into a smaller number of 
individually significant assets, the Board decided to change 
its hedging policy in March 2013 and no longer to use 
derivatives for portfolio hedging purposes. As a result, 
the use of derivatives to hedge currency movements on 
a portfolio basis will be reduced over time and foreign 
exchange risk will now be considered as an integral part 
of the investment process rather than managed at the 
Group level. Specific short-term hedging on entry or exit 
of an investment may be used as appropriate.
Diluted NA V
The diluted NAV per share at 31 March 2014 was 348 pence 
(2013: 31 1 pence). This was driven by the total return in the 
year of £478 million (2013: £373 million), and partially offset 
by dividend payments in the year of £1 14 million (2013: 
£76 million). 50

IFRS 10 has resulted in a significant change to the presentation 
of the Group’s financial statements. There has been no change 
to the total return or net asset position of the Group.
The Group makes investments directly in portfolio companies 
held by 3i Group plc and indirectly, held through intermediate 
holding company and partnership structures (“Investment 
entity subsidiaries”). It also has other operational subsidiaries 
which provide services and other activities such as 
employment, regulatory activities, management and advice 
(“Trading subsidiaries”).
Since the adoption of IFRS in the year ended 31 March 2006, 
there has been discussion about whether investment 
companies such as 3i should be exempt from consolidation 
of its investments (the direct and indirectly held portfolio 
companies). IFRS 10 has resolved this point with the 
introduction of an investment entity exception confirming that 
portfolio companies should be accounted for at fair value, 
which is an excellent outcome. This is why we have decided to 
adopt the standard early. However, in the detailed application 
of the standard, investment entity subsidiaries are now also 
R econciliation of Investment basis to IFRS
accounted for on a fair value basis, which means that the 
financial effect of the underlying portfolio companies and fee 
income, operating expenses and carried interest incurred in 
investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into a single 
value shown as Investments in investment entities. Other 
items which were previously eliminated on consolidation are 
now included separately. The two diagrams below illustrate 
these changes, together with an illustrative example to show 
how information can be aggregated.
We have therefore introduced an “Investment basis” set of 
primary financial statements, prepared on a similar basis 
to the prior year financial statements, fair valuing portfolio 
companies at the level which we believe provides the most 
understandable financial information and consolidating 
associated transactions on a line-by-line basis.
A detailed reconciliation from the Investment basis to IFRS 
basis of the Statement of comprehensive income, Statement 
of financial position, and Cash flow statement is provided on 
pages 54 to 57 . Note 14 to the financial statements provides 
details of the activity within the investment entity subsidiaries.

Notes:  
1  Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of comprehensive income consolidates the line items of a number of previously consolidated subsidiaries into 
a single line item “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries”. In the “Investment basis” accounts we have disaggregated these line 
items to analyse our total return as if these investment entity subsidiaries were fully consolidated, consistent with prior periods. The adjustments 
simply reclassify the Statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal under the Investment basis and the 
IFRS basis. 
2  Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held directly 
by 3i Group plc and not those portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries. Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio 
income in relation to portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single “Fair value movement on 
investment entity subsidiaries” line. This is the most significant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts. 
3  Other items also aggregated into the “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries” line include fees receivable from external funds, 
audit fees, custodian fees, bank charges, other general and administration expenses, carried interest and tax.
4  Foreign exchange on investments has been reclassified as a result of IFRS 10. This is because the revaluation of assets held by investment 
entity subsidiaries will now be reflected in the fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries rather than being reflected as exchange 
movements. Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations has reduced given that many foreign operations are now treated 
as investment entities held at fair value rather than consolidated subsidiaries.
5  We have also taken this opportunity to re-present the impact of foreign exchange movements on our returns to be consistent with the current 
hedging policy. “Foreign exchange on investments” is now included in our gross investment return to show the currency risk relating to the 
portfolio more directly. 
6  The Credit Opportunities Fund (Palace Street I) was previously consolidated on a line-by-line basis and is now recognised as a fair value 
investment entity subsidiary under IFRS 10. We believe this is the appropriate treatment that effectively shows the performance of the Fund 
and have applied the same basis to the Investment basis statements in a change to previous presentation.

Notes:  
1  Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of financial position aggregates the line items of a number of previously consolidated subsidiaries into the 
single line item “Investments in investment entities”. In the Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as 
if the investment entity subsidiaries were consolidated, consistent with prior periods. The adjustment reclassifies items in the Statement of 
financial position. There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different. 
  The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is significantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by investment 
entity subsidiaries is aggregated into the “Investments in investment entities” line. We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the 
underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments, unquoted equity investments or loans and receivables. 
  Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates 
these items.
2  Cash balances held in investment entity subsidiaries are also aggregated into the “Investments in investment entities” line. At 31 March 2014, 
£36 million of cash was held in subsidiaries that are now classified as investment entity subsidiaries and is therefore included in the “Investments 
in investment entities” line. 
3  Intercompany balances between investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the 
IFRS basis. If an investment entity subsidiary has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset 
or liability of the investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary 
will be disclosed as an asset or liability in the Statement of financial position of the Group. Prior to the adoption of IFRS 10, these balances would 
have been eliminated on consolidation. 
4  The Credit Opportunities Fund (Palace Street I) was previously classified as a current asset and, following the adoption of IFRS 10, has been 
reclassified as non-current in both the Investment basis and IFRS statements.
5  Investment basis financial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under 
this basis.

Notes:  
1  The cash flow statement is impacted by the application of IFRS 10 as cash flows to and from investment entity subsidiaries are disclosed, 
rather than the cash flows to and from the underlying portfolio. 
  Therefore in our Investment basis financial statements, we have disclosed our cash flow statement on a “look through” basis, in order to reflect 
the underlying sources and uses of cash flows and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2  There is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis financial statements and the IFRS financial 
statements because there are cash balances held in investment entity subsidiary vehicles. Cash held within investment entity subsidiaries 
will not be shown in the IFRS statements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.

Risk
Principal risks and risk 
management
The Group faces a range of risks and uncertainties which 
could materially affect the achievement of its strategic 
objectives and, in turn, its financial performance.
This section describes our approach to risk management, 
and the process and governance framework that we have 
in place to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks. 
This is followed by a summary description of the principal 
risks facing the Group and the corresponding mitigating 
actions that are in place.
Approach to risk management
The Board is responsible for setting the overall strategic 
direction of the Group. As part of the strategic decision-
making process, the Board seeks to achieve an appropriate 
balance between taking risk and generating returns for our 
shareholders. The evaluation of strategic choices and new 
opportunities requires a detailed risk assessment, which 
takes into account the Board’s overall risk appetite. 
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to 
support the delivery of the strategic objectives determined by 
the Board. This framework includes the periodic assessment 
of changes and developments which potentially impact the 
Group’s overall risk profile, as well as the identification and 
assessment of key risks and the review of the effectiveness 
of the risk mitigation plans which have been put in place. 
Risk management framework 
and governance structure
3i’s risk management framework and associated governance 
structure are designed to ensure that there is an effective 
process and a clear organisational structure with well defined 
responsibilities to identify, assess, manage and monitor risk 
and operate at a number of levels throughout the Group.
The Board is responsible for overall risk management, 
which includes the Group’s risk governance or oversight 
structure, and for maintaining an appropriate internal 
control framework.
Responsibility for oversight of risk management is delegated 
to the Chief Executive who has established the Group Risk 
Committee to assist him to discharge this responsibility. 
They are guided by the Board’s appetite for risk and any 
specific limits set. The Group Risk Committee maintains the 
Group risk review, which summarises the Group’s principal 
risks and associated mitigating actions.
The Audit and Compliance Committee is updated by the 
Chief Executive, as Chairman of the Group Risk Committee, 
at each meeting on the outputs of the latest Group Risk 
Committee meeting and has the opportunity to contribute 
views or raise questions. 
The outputs of the latest Group Risk Committee meeting are 
also considered by the Board as a whole, with a particular 
focus on the potential impact on the setting and execution 
of the Group’s strategy.
The Group’s reporting cycle and dates of key meetings are 
co-ordinated to ensure that appropriate risk and strategic 
reviews are performed in alignment with the scheduled 
Board and Audit and Compliance Committee meetings. 
The Group Risk Committee typically reviews risks over 
a rolling 12-month time horizon. Longer-term risks are 
considered by the Board, as part of its annual strategic 
review, and then reflected in the Group risk review. 
In addition to the above, a number of other committees 
contribute to the Group’s overall risk governance structure. 
The Investment Committee meets as required to consider 
risk in relation to the acquisition, management and disposal 
of investments, within the authority limits delegated by 
the Board. 
The Conflicts Committee reviews the Group’s conflict policies 
and processes and meets periodically and as required to 
review any specific issues which may arise. 
The Treasury Transactions Committee provides formal 
approval for specific treasury related transactions, taking 
into consideration any risk management implications, subject 
to specific limits or delegated authority from the Board. 
The Group’s Brand and Values Committee considers risks 
which could potentially impact the Group’s brand and 
reputation, drawing upon the outputs of the Group’s 
risk review. 
The roles and membership of the above committees are 
described in more detail in the Governance section of this 
report. Further details on the risk management framework 
can also be found in 3i’s Pillar 3 disclosures at www.3i.com.
Assurance to the Audit and Compliance Committee on the 
robustness and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
processes is provided through the independent assessments 
by Internal Audit and the work of Group Compliance on 
regulatory risks. Management is also required to certify 
annually that risk mitigation controls have operated effectively 
throughout the year, that the Group’s policies have been 
complied with and any exceptions reported. Further 
information can be found in the Audit Committee report 
in the Governance section.  59
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Strategic report
Risk review process
The Group Risk Committee is responsible for carrying out 
a detailed risk review of the Group and meets at least four 
times a year, to coincide with meetings of the Executive 
Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee.  
The Group risk review process was enhanced in the prior 
financial year to include improved monitoring of key strategic 
and financial metrics, which are indicators of changes to the 
Group’s risk profile. The review includes the following 
reference data:
  Financial performance and strategic dashboards;
  Portfolio performance reports for Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management;
  Vintage control and asset allocation analysis;
  Macroeconomic and M&A market overview;
  Liquidity management and ICAAP review;
  Operating expenses;
  Responsible investment review;
  Risk reports for managed Alternative Investment 
Funds; and 
  Quarterly Group risk log.
Drawing upon the above, the Committee considers changes 
and developments since its last review and the potential for 
these to impact the Group’s overall risk profile and, therefore, 
its strategic delivery. The Committee evaluates the impact 
and likelihood of each key risk, with reference to associated 
measures and key performance indicators. The adequacy of 
current mitigation plans is assessed and, where necessary, 
additional actions agreed and reviewed at the 
subsequent meeting.
A number of focus topics are agreed in advance of each 
meeting, which involve a more in-depth analysis. Further 
details are set out under the Review of principal risks.
Changes and improvements
Following the implementation of the European AIFM Directive 
in July 2013, the Group has put in place a risk framework for 
each of its managed Alternative Investment Funds in line with 
the regulatory requirements. As part of this change, the 
Group Risk Committee receives and reviews risk reports for 
each AIF , which consider risks at the individual fund level, 
with reference to any risk limits applicable to the fund. 
Management completed a review of our Responsible Investing 
(“RI”)/Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) reporting 
framework in early 2014. As a result of the recommendations 
made, dedicated resource has been allocated to co-ordinate 
and manage 3i’s approach to RI and ESG risk management 
and detailed updates are now being provided to the Group 
Risk Committee with streamlined reporting to both the  
Audit and Compliance Committee and Brand and Values 
Committee. Further details on 3i’s approach to RI and ESG 
risk management can be found in the Corporate responsibility 
section of our website at www.3i.com.  60

Review of principal risks
The disclosures on the following pages are not an exhaustive 
list of risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, but rather 
a summary of those principal risks which have the potential 
to impact materially the Group’s financial performance and/or 
the achievement of its strategic objectives, and which are 
under active review by the Group Risk Committee and 
the Board. 
Strategic
The preceding sections provide an overview of 3i’s strategic 
priorities and progress against these. There were no 
fundamental changes in the Group’s strategy in the prior year 
and delivery remains on target. Accordingly, the Group’s risk 
profile has not been impacted by any significant changes 
in strategic direction. 
External 
The key external risks affecting 3i over the course of 
the financial year remained centred on the continuing 
challenging macroeconomic and market conditions and 
factors impacting these. There was also a significant 
increase in new regulatory requirements.
Economic stability, and confidence more generally, is 
vulnerable to weakening growth in developing markets, 
the pace and sustainability of economic recovery in Europe, 
and recent increases in geopolitical risk. The last includes 
developments in Eastern Europe and uncertainty around 
the outcome and impact of key elections, for example 
in Europe and India.
The Group is subject to a number of new regulatory 
requirements which are already in force or will come into 
force shortly. A key development is the European AIFM 
Directive, which came into force in July 2013. The Group is 
also affected by regulations under the European Market 
Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and Capital Requirements 
Directive IV (“CRDIV”). These changes will result in a significant 
increase in reporting requirements and additional costs to the 
business, and may potentially restrict some future activities.
The detailed application of IFRS 10 has led to wide debate 
across the investment management industry and accounting 
firms, and standard setting bodies continue to refine 
guidance. The Group has applied IFRS 10 in line with the 
guidance from the IFRIC meeting in January 2014 which 
was marginally supported, but not approved, by the IASB 
in March 2014. There is a risk that the interpretation of the 
standard will evolve further, for better or worse, resulting 
in future restatements of our statutory accounts.
Investment
Detailed commentaries on the performance of each of 3i’s 
business lines can be found in the Business review section. 
The Group’s key investment risks remain closely linked to 
the economic and market conditions, referred to above. 
The Private Equity business is the largest in terms of 
proprietary capital investment. Specific risks include the 
pricing of new investment opportunities; the potential 
operational underperformance of portfolio companies 
impacting earnings growth and valuations; and the timing 
of exits and cash returns. 
A cautious and selective approach has continued to be applied 
to new investment over the year. The overall health and 
performance of the Private Equity investment portfolio has 
continued to improve, with the Group’s larger investments 
growing strongly. The Group’s Private Equity investment 
portfolio has become relatively more concentrated over time, 
with increasing exposure to the performance of a smaller 
number of larger investments. As expected, the pace of 
realisations has slowed in the second part of the financial 
year. In this context, exit strategies and the divestment 
pipeline continue to be monitored closely. 
Specific risks to the Infrastructure business include the 
ability to maintain investment rates in a competitive market, 
where there is strong demand for infrastructure assets as 
investors seek yield. 3i completed the acquisition of Barclays 
Infrastructure Funds Management Limited (“BIFM”), a 
European infrastructure fund management business, in 
November 2013, and remains focused on increasing third-
party AUM through new investments, fund raising and other 
potential inorganic opportunities. The 3i India Infrastructure 
Fund has been affected by the depreciation in the Indian 
rupee against sterling and the US dollar as well as the 
broader macroeconomic challenges in India. The current 
focus is on managing the value of the existing Indian portfolio 
with no plans for further investment or fundraising in 
the region. 
The principal risk to the Debt Management business is the 
ability to grow AUM profitably in line with its business plan. 
The European CLO market has now re-opened and in 
September 2013 Debt Management launched its first 
European CLO (Harvest VII) since the establishment of the 
Debt Management platform in 201 1. A further European CLO 
(Harvest VIII) was launched in February 2014. The level of 
new CLO issuance in the US initially slowed following the 
introduction of the Volcker Rule but the business launched 
two further CLOs, Jamestown III, in December 2013 and the 
COA Summit CLO in March 2014. The CLO market is likely to 
remain somewhat disrupted until the US regulatory agencies 
provide further guidance on the implementation of the Volcker 
Rule. The business has put in place new warehousing vehicles 
in both Europe and the US to seed future CLO launches and 
the business is seeking to expand and diversify its product 
offering beyond its core CLO funds. Whilst in the warehouse 
phase, 3i is at risk of margin calls in the event of market falls. 
In extreme market conditions, it may not be possible to 
convert the warehouse to a CLO and it may be necessary 
to liquidate the warehouse at a financial loss. Stress tests 
are performed when a warehouse is set up, and monitored 
on a weekly basis thereafter. More detail is included 
in Note 32. 62

Strategic report
T reasury and funding
Details of the Group’s approach to the management of 
treasury and funding risks can be found in the Financial 
review section. 
The main risk management priorities have been the continued 
reduction of the Group’s funding costs, through lower levels of 
gross debt, and the monitoring of progress with the triennial 
valuation of the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme. 
Following the reduction of gross debt to below the £1 billion 
target ahead of schedule, and conclusion of the 2013 triennial 
pension fund valuation, the focus continues to be on 
monitoring liquidity and capital management in the context 
of the Group’s investment strategy. 
Operational 
The key areas of operational risk include the exposure to the 
loss of key people, and ensuring that investor skill sets and 
business development capabilities support the achievement 
of the strategic plan. Detailed resource plans are in place at 
the business line level and a Group organisational capability 
and succession review was presented to, and reviewed by, 
the Board in November 2013. 
Organisational developments have included progress with the 
implementation of a new asset accounting IT system (eFront), 
which has been closely monitored. The implementation of 
processes and controls to meet new regulatory, accounting 
and tax reporting requirements affecting the Group has been 
subject to detailed project planning, input from external 
advisers and regular updates to senior management and 
the Board. 
Group Risk Committee focus topics
In the course of the financial year, the Group Risk Committee 
has carried out a number of in-depth reviews. Topics covered 
have included integration planning for the BIFM acquisition; 
regulatory developments; and information security with 
a focus on cyber risk. 
Key risk factors and risk 
mitigation
The table opposite summarises the key risks under active 
review by the Group Risk Committee. The Group faces a range 
of other risks which are managed through similar risk 
mitigation plans at the operational level, and are subject to 
regular management reporting and appropriate oversight. 
Examples include currency, counterparty and interest rate 
exposures; people risks; business continuity; potential 
exposure to litigation; and changes to tax regulations.  
This broader range of risks is considered by the Committee 
as part of its determination and evaluation of the Group’s 
key risks.
Changes to the Group’ s risk 
profile during the financial year
The overall risk profile of the Group has been comparatively 
stable over the year, as the strategic plan moved from the 
“restructuring” phase, which involved extensive organisational 
changes and cost reductions in FY2013, to the “transition and 
delivery” phase in FY2014 and FY2015. 
The main factors which have impacted the risk profile during 
the year include: 
  Successful implementation of the first phase 
of the strategic plan underpinning increased 
shareholder confidence; 
  Strong performance of the Private Equity investment 
portfolio, including realisations;
  No significant individual portfolio write-downs since  
March 2012 and 18 months of improved portfolio 
monitoring;
  Reduction of gross debt and funding costs, and a shift 
of focus to liquidity and capital management;
  Met objective to cover annual operating expenses with cash 
income, improving the financial profile of the Group;
  Some key people changes, which have been 
carefully managed;
  New regulatory, accounting and tax reporting requirements, 
which require some operational changes and additional 
costs to ensure ongoing compliance;
  Implementation of new Private Equity IT system 
substantially complete;
  Successful integration of the activities of the Barclays 
European Infrastructure team; and
  Winding down of our operations in Brazil.
Although some risk categories remain stable overall, the 
underlying risks may have changed over the course of the 
year. An example includes people risk. While the restructuring 
phase is largely complete, and the level of people change 
reduced, there continues to be ongoing management of 
the organisational capability in line with delivering the 
strategic plan.

Environmental impact
In the year to 31 March 2014 our measured Scope 1 and 2 
emissions were 580 tonnes CO2e. This comprised: 
 
Scope Emissions source
CO2e emissions 
(tonnes) for year to 
31 March 2014
1 Combustion of fuel and operation 
of our facilities
200.89 
2 Electricity, heat, and cooling 
purchased for our own use
379.40 
Total 580.29
This equates to 2.09 tonnes CO2e per employee for the year 
to 31 March 2014, based on an average number of employees 
during the year of 277 .
We have reported on all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources fall 
within our consolidated financial statements. 
We have used the World Resources Institute and World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol as our methodology, combined with the UK 
Government conversion factors for company reporting 
to calculate our carbon footprint. It is not practical for us 
to obtain data relating to electricity consumption in our 
Singapore office or refrigerant losses for this period 
as the relevant data is not within our control.
Community
We focus our charitable activities on the disadvantaged, on 
young people and on education. Charities are supported on 
the basis of their effectiveness and impact. Our charitable 
giving for the year to 31 March 2014 totalled £250,000.
Transparency
As a publicly-listed company, 3i is subject to formal legal 
and regulatory disclosure requirements as well as the high 
expectations for transparency of our shareholders, fund 
investors, staff and the media. We firmly believe that 
transparency is crucial for building trust, and we take 
a proactive approach to communicating both financial 
and non-financial performance. Community Links

Anti-bribery and corruption
3i does not offer, pay or accept bribes. We are committed to 
working only with third-parties whose standards of business 
integrity are substantively consistent with ours. We also 
expect the businesses in which we invest to commit to 
avoiding bribery and to comply with anti-bribery laws 
applicable to their business.
A responsible employer
At 31 March 2014, 3i had a total of 266 employees and this is 
how they broke down by gender:

are included as Directors of 3i Group plc) and includes 27 people 
who were directors of undertakings included in the consolidation, 
of whom 25 are male and two are female.
Human rights
Whilst 3i does not have a formal human rights policy,  
our policies are consistent with internationally-proclaimed 
human rights principles. In particular, 3i is an equal 
opportunities employer in relation to the selection, training, 
career development and promotion of employees regardless 
of age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, religion  
and whether disabled or otherwise. 3i also has clear 
grievance and disciplinary procedures, an employee 
assistance programme and an independent, external  
“whistle blowing” hotline service. 
3i is also committed to ensuring that the businesses we 
invest in comply with all applicable laws in relation to their 
employees (amongst other things) and, where appropriate, 
that they work towards meeting relevant international 
standards (such as the ILO Fundamental Conventions) 
where these are more stringent. Summaries of relevant 
3i policies, including our policies on people, recruitment 
and selection, equal opportunities and diversity, health 
and safety and responsible investment are available at 
www.3i.com.
During the year, we became an accredited London Living 
Wage Employer. This means that every member of staff 
based in London, including contracted maintenance and 
reception teams, earns a “living wage” which is an hourly rate 
higher than the UK minimum wage and is set independently, 
updated annually and based on the cost of living in the UK.
A responsible investor
We are signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible 
Investing and have embedded specific responsible investment 
(“RI”) policies and procedures into our investment and 
portfolio company review processes. During the year, 
dedicated resource was allocated to co-ordinate and manage 
3i’s approach to RI and environmental, social and governance 
issues and opportunities. Further details of 3i’s approach 
as a responsible investor, including a summary of our 
Responsible Investment policy, are available at www.3i.com.
3i has supported 
Community Links for 
1 4  years and is currently 
supporting the Play , Sow 
and Grow community 
hub  in east London.
Play, Sow and Grow is a purpose built 
community space in Stratford, 
Newham, a borough that is ranked 
as the third most deprived in the UK, 
where 50% of children live in poverty 
and household income for most of 
these families is below the poverty line. 
Play, Sow and Grow uses the natural 
environment to deliver educational 
play schemes where children are 
encouraged to spend time outdoors. 
The garden contains growing fruit 
and vegetables, roaming hens and 
a tree house, sand pit and other 
play equipment. 
Over the past year, Play, Sow and Grow 
has engaged with 293 unique users 
and 7 local schools. Sessions were 
delivered via a range of activities 
including open access play for children 
between 5 and 1 1; stay and play for 
toddlers and parents; youth programmes 
for 12 to 16 year olds, including youth 
project workshops and Girl Guides; play 
activities for disabled children; summer 
schools, nature walks and daytrips; 
as well as activities for adults, such 
as cooking lessons, DIY, gardening, 
community clean-up and English 
language classes. 
In addition, the hub has engaged 
808 people of varying ages through a 
number of events, including children’s 
wildlife workshops; bird of prey 
displays; a summer horticultural 
school; and the Carols on the Green 
Christmas Concert. 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4

Chairman’ s introduction
“ After a period of significant change 
the  Board has focused on supporting 
management in the transition and 
delivery phase of 3i’ s strategy . ”
Introduction
This section of the report describes how 3i 
is  governed and managed. It gives details on 
our Board and Executive Committee members 
and explains how the Board is organised 
and  operates. It also explains the roles and 
composition of Board Committees and 
the  division of responsibilities between the 
Directors, including between the Chairman 
and  Chief Executive. This section also includes 
the Directors’ remuneration report and 
the  new Audit Committee report.
Good corporate governance is fundamental to 3i and its activities. 
Governance and oversight of the Group’s business model and strategy 
are critical to the delivery of value to the Group’s stakeholders. 
This is more important than ever given the current challenging 
and uncertain economic environment and the changing regulatory 
landscape that our sector faces.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall management 
and oversight of the Group and for its long-term success. In particular, 
the Board is responsible for agreeing the Group’s strategy, monitoring 
financial performance, setting and monitoring the Group’s risk appetite 
and maintaining an effective system of internal controls.
It is the Board’s responsibility to ensure that the Group has a clear 
strategy and that the necessary people, resources and structures 
are in place to support the delivery of this strategy.

Corporate Governance
Board and Committees structure 
It is the Board’s responsibility to ensure that there is an effective 
organisational and reporting structure in place such that there are 
clear reporting lines within the Group and well defined roles and 
responsibilities. This is to ensure that the right decisions are being 
made with involvement from the right people. 
The Board is assisted by various Principal Committees of the Board 
which report regularly to the Board. The Board committee structure 
is outlined in the diagram on page 71. The membership of these 
Committees is regularly reviewed by the Board. When considering 
Board Committee membership and chairmanship, the Board aims 
to ensure that undue reliance is not placed on particular Directors. 
These Board Committees all have clearly defined terms of reference. 
The terms of reference of the Audit and Compliance Committee, 
the Brand and Values Committee, the Nominations Committee, 
the Remuneration Committee and the Valuations Committee are 
available at www.3i.com. 
Day-to-day management of the Group is the responsibility of the Chief 
Executive. To assist him in this role, the Chief Executive has established 
a number of additional Committees. These are also outlined in the 
diagram on page 71. 
How the Board operates 
The Chairman leads the Board and ensures its effectiveness. He also 
organises its business and sets its agenda. In addition to the Chairman, 
there are currently five independent non-executive Directors who have 
a range of strong and complementary skills. 
The table set out on page 78 shows attendance at full meetings of the 
Board and its Principal Committees during the last year. In addition to 
those full meetings, a number of ad hoc meetings were held to deal with 
specific items as they arose. 
Before each Board and Committee meeting, relevant reports and papers, 
including financial performance data and detailed updates on the 
progress and implementation of the strategic plan where appropriate, 
are circulated to Directors. The Board has the opportunity to discuss 
these reports and updates and to challenge directly the Executive 
Directors and other senior management, who attend all or part of the 
Board meetings. 
The key responsibilities and areas of focus for the Board are: 
  Strategy – contribute to the development of, and agree, the Group’s 
strategy. This includes through review and discussion of reports and 
updates at Board meetings as well as through the annual strategy 
review meeting which is attended by the Board and, where relevant, 
members of the Executive Committee.
  Group financial and operational performance – review and 
monitor the performance of the Group, including through regular 
reporting and discussions with the Executive Committee and 
other senior management. 
  Senior management – ensure that the Executive Committee has 
the skills and resources to deliver the strategy and that appropriate 
succession and contingency planning is in place. 
  Evaluation and composition – review the performance of the Board 
and its Committees to ensure that they are effective. Ensure that 
the Board and its Committees comprise competent and capable 
individuals with a range of skills and experience who bring 
independent views to the decisions being made. 
  Internal controls – maintain an appropriate internal control framework.
  Risk – ensure that there are effective risk management policies 
and processes in place and an appropriate governance structure. 
The Board has approved a formal schedule of matters reserved to 
it and its duly authorised Committees for decision. This is described 
on page 77 . Matters delegated by the Board to management include 
implementation of the Board approved strategy, day-to-day 
management and operation of the business, the appointment 
and remuneration of all staff below the Executive Committee and 
the formulation and implementation of risk management policies 
and processes.

Corporate Governance
Division of responsibilities 
The Board approved division of responsibilities between the Directors is summarised below.  
 
Role of the Chairman Role of the Chief Executive Role of non-executive Directors
  Leads the Board in setting its agenda, 
agreeing strategy, monitoring financial and 
operational performance, and establishing 
the Group’s risk appetite. 
  Responsible for organising the business 
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness, 
and maintaining an effective system 
of internal controls. 
  Ensures that non-executive Directors 
receive relevant and accurate information 
to facilitate an open and effective discussion. 
This includes ensuring that the non-
executive Directors receive regular reports 
on shareholders’ views on the Group. 
  Responsible for the composition of the 
Board and facilitates the effective 
contribution of non-executive Directors and 
constructive relations between Executive 
and non-executive Directors. 
  Direct charge of the Group on a day-to-day 
basis and is accountable to the Board for 
the financial and operational performance 
of the Group. 
  Leads the Executive Committee to 
develop and implement the Group’s 
strategy and manage risk and the internal 
control framework. 
  Chairs the Investment Committee to review 
the acquisition, management and disposal 
of investments.
  Reports to the Board on financial and 
operational performance and progress 
in delivering the strategic objectives. 
  Regularly engages with shareholders 
and other key stakeholders on the Group’s 
activities and progress. 
  Scrutinise the performance of management 
in meeting agreed objectives and monitor 
the reporting of performance. 
  Seek assurance on the integrity of the 
financial information and that financial 
controls and systems of risk management 
are robust and defensible. 
  Determine appropriate levels of 
remuneration for Executive Directors 
and Executive Committee and have a 
prime role in appointing Directors and 
in succession planning. 
  Constructively challenge and help develop 
proposals on strategy; this occurs at 
meetings of the Board, and in particular 
at the annual review meeting to discuss 
ongoing strategy, the most recent of which 
took place in December 2013. 
Effectiveness 
During the year, the Board conducted its annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors. On this 
occasion, the process was led by the Chairman and conducted internally; 
the performance evaluation had been externally facilitated in the 
previous year by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited. The 
Chairman held one-on-one discussions informed by a checklist with 
all Directors, business unit heads, the Group Strategy Director, the 
Group General Counsel and Mr W Mesdag who retired from the 
Board in November 2013. The results of the evaluation process were 
reported to, and discussed by, the Board. 
The Board performance evaluation included consideration of the 
following topics. The evaluation considered the overall composition of 
the Board including plans for executive and non-executive succession 
over time, which included the need for further non-executive Director 
recruitment. Directors made various useful suggestions to further 
enhance the functioning of individual Board committees. It was agreed 
to review and refocus the terms of reference of the Brand and Values 
Committee on a range of specific reputation-linked issues. Steps taken 
previously to enable non-executive Directors to increase further their 
knowledge of the Group’s investments and engage more strongly with 
the Group’s investment business were judged to have been successful 
and some further steps were agreed for the coming year. This included 
additional presentations to the Board from business units. Non-executive 
Directors attend each year a number of management’s regular internal 
in-depth review discussions on individual portfolio companies which 
improves the Board’s insight into day-to-day performance of portfolio 
companies. A number of suggestions as to how to increase the  
value of the non-executive Directors’ involvement were made.  
Following enhancements to regular Board reports made in the previous 
year suggestions were made for further improvement so as to focus the 
papers more specifically on key matters and to include certain additional 
analysis and explanation. The process for setting the aims and agenda 
for the Board’s annual Strategy Day discussion was also refocused. 
In his role as Senior Independent Director, Mr R H Meddings led a review 
by the Directors of the performance of the Chairman and subsequently 
reported back to the Board and provided feedback to the Chairman. 
Investment policy
Under the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules 3i, as a closed-ended 
investment fund, is required to publish an investment policy containing 
information about policies on asset allocation, risk diversification and 
gearing. Prior shareholder approval is required for any material change 
to this published policy. Non-material changes can be made by the 
Board. The current investment policy is set out opposite. 
During the year, the Company has continued its approach of conservative 
balance sheet management. The Board recognises the need to manage 
liquidity and gross and net debt levels on a conservative basis such that 
the Company should be well-placed to deal with external events, take 
advantage of opportunities and manage its investment and divestment 
activities in a flexible manner. The Board has decided that gross debt 
should not currently exceed £1 billion and may at times be significantly 
below this limit.

Corporate Governance
Current Investment policy
  3i is an investment company which aims to provide its shareholders 
with quoted access to private equity, infrastructure and debt 
management investment returns. Currently, its main focus is on 
making quoted and unquoted equity and/or debt investments in 
businesses and funds across Europe, Asia and the Americas. The 
geographies, economic sectors, funds and asset classes in which 
3i invests continue to evolve as opportunities are identified. Proposed 
investments are assessed individually and all significant investments 
require approval from the Group’s Investment Committee. 
Overall investment targets are subject to periodic reviews and 
the investment portfolio is also reviewed to monitor exposure 
to specific geographies, economic sectors and asset classes.
  3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion of 
investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size 
as well as through the maturity profile of its investment portfolio. 
In addition, although 3i does not set maximum exposure limits 
for asset allocations, no more than 15% by value of 3i’s portfolio 
can be held in a single investment.
  Investments are generally funded with a mixture of debt and 
shareholders’ funds with a view to maximising returns to 
shareholders, whilst maintaining a strong capital base. 3i’s gearing 
depends not only on its level of debt, but also on the impact 
of market movements and other factors on the value of its 
investments. The Board takes this into account when, as required, 
it sets a precise maximum level of gearing. The Board has 
therefore set the maximum level of gearing at 150% and has set 
no minimum level of gearing. If the gearing ratio should exceed 
the 150% maximum limit, the Board will take steps to reduce the 
gearing ratio to below that limit as soon as practicable thereafter. 
3i is committed to achieving balance sheet efficiency.
Proposed amended Investment policy
  3i is an investment company which aims to provide its 
shareholders with quoted access to private equity, infrastructure 
and debt management investment returns. Currently, its main 
focus is on making quoted and unquoted equity and/or debt 
investments in businesses and funds across Europe, Asia and the 
Americas. The geographies, economic sectors, funds and asset 
classes in which 3i invests continue to evolve as opportunities 
are identified. Proposed investments are assessed individually 
and all significant investments require approval from the Group’s 
Investment Committee. Overall investment targets are subject 
to periodic reviews and the investment portfolio is also reviewed 
to monitor exposure to specific geographies, economic sectors 
and asset classes.
  3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion of 
investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size 
as well as through the maturity profile of its investment portfolio.
  Although 3i does not set maximum exposure limits for asset 
allocations, it does have a maximum exposure limit that, save as 
mentioned below, no investment will be made unless its cost does 
not exceed 15% of the investment portfolio value as shown in the 
last published valuation. A further investment may be made in 
an existing investee company provided the aggregate cost of that 
investment and of all other investments in that investee company 
does not exceed 15% of the investment portfolio value as shown 
in the last published valuation. A higher limit of 30% will apply 
to the Company’s investment in 3i Infrastructure plc. For the 
avoidance of doubt, 3i may retain an investment even if its 
carrying value is greater than 15% or 30% (as the case may be) 
of the portfolio value at the time of an updated valuation. 
  Investments are generally funded with a mixture of debt and 
shareholders’ funds with a view to maximising returns to 
shareholders, whilst maintaining a strong capital base. 3i’s 
gearing depends not only on its level of debt, but also on the 
impact of market movements and other factors on the value 
of its investments. The Board takes this into account when, as 
required, it sets a precise maximum level of gearing. The Board 
has therefore set the maximum level of gearing at 150% and 
has set no minimum level of gearing. If the gearing ratio should 
exceed the 150% maximum limit, the Board will take steps to 
reduce the gearing ratio to below that limit as soon as practicable 
thereafter. 3i is committed to achieving balance sheet efficiency.
S tatutory and corporate governance information 
Proposed changes to 
Investment policy
3i will continue to seek to diversify risk through significant dispersion  
of investments. Following the strategic review in June 2012, and the 
implementation of the asset management initiatives in the Private Equity 
business, the portfolio has performed strongly. The Board has taken the 
view that the investment policy should apply its maximum exposure limit 
for a single investment to cost, not value, to avoid good performance 
becoming a restriction on its ability to maximise shareholder value 
through requiring a premature disposal of an investment which 
reached a limit on value.
The Board therefore proposes to seek shareholder approval at 
the Annual General Meeting on 17 July 2014 to amend the current 
investment policy so that the 15% maximum exposure limit for a single 
investment relates to the cost of the investment as a proportion of the 
portfolio value as shown in the then most recent portfolio valuation.  
The proposed change also provides that a higher maximum exposure 
limit of 30% should apply to 3i’s investment in 3i Infrastructure plc, 
as that company is itself a diversified investment vehicle.
The proposed amended investment policy is set out below and further 
details are set out in the 2014 Notice of Annual General Meeting.
As a consequence, gearing, which is a function of both net debt and  
asset values, is expected to be in the range of 0%–30% for the immediate 
future. It should be noted that (subject always to the formal gearing limit 
in the Company’s investment policy statement set out below) the actual 
gearing level at any point in time will fluctuate, since it is a function of, 
among other things, asset valuations and the timing of investment and 
realisation cash flows. The Board anticipates that the Company may 
be in a net cash position during certain periods (for example during 
periods of high valuations where realisations might be expected to 
exceed investment) but may have net debt in other periods (for example 
where valuations are relatively low or after periods of low return flows). 74

Corporate Governance
Statutory and corporate governance information 
T ax and investment company status
The Company is an investment company as defined by section 833 
of the Companies Act 2006. HM Revenue & Customs has approved the 
Company as an investment trust under section 1 158 of the Corporation 
T ax Act 2010 and the Company directs its affairs to enable it to continue 
to remain so approved.
Regulation and management 
arrangements
3i Investments plc, 3i Debt Management Investments Limited, 3i BIFM 
Investments Limited, 3i Europe plc and 3i Nordic plc, all of which are 
subsidiaries of the Company, are authorised and regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) under the Financial Services 
and Markets Act 2000. Where applicable, certain Group subsidiaries’ 
businesses outside the United Kingdom are regulated locally by 
relevant authorities.
3i Investments plc acts as investment manager to the Company and 
certain of its subsidiaries. Contracts for these investment management 
and other services, for which regulatory authorisation is required, 
provide for fees based on the work done and costs incurred in providing 
such services. These contracts may be terminated by either party 
on reasonable notice.
3i plc provides the Group with certain corporate and administrative 
services, for which no regulatory authorisation is required, under 
contracts which provide for fees based on the work done and costs 
incurred in providing such services together with a performance fee 
based on realised profits on the sale of assets. 
The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) became 
effective in July 2013. 3i is currently in the process of registering  
3i Investments plc as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) 
which in turn manages three Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”), 
namely, 3i Group plc, 3i Growth Capital Fund and 3i Eurofund V. 3i has 
assessed the various requirements of the AIFMD and has made the 
necessary updates to its procedures to meet them. 
The Annual report and accounts meet the investor reporting 
requirements of AIFMD (as set out in FUND 3.2.2R of the FCA’s 
Investment Funds sourcebook) for 3i Group plc as a standalone entity. 
The Company’s profit for the year is stated in its Statement of changes 
in equity and its Financial position is shown on page 106. The Company 
performs substantially all of its investment related activities through 
its subsidiaries and therefore the Group’s consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive income is considered to be more useful to investors 
than a Company statement.
Furthermore in some instances the relevant AIFMD required disclosures 
have been made in relation to the Group on a consolidated basis rather 
than about 3i Group plc as a standalone entity. This is because 3i Group 
plc, as a standalone entity, operates through its group subsidiaries  
and therefore reporting on the Group’s activities provides more  
relevant information on the Company and its position. There have been  
no material changes to the Company’s operations in the past year. 
Although the disclosures required by FUND 3.2.2R of the FCA’s Investment 
Funds sourcebook are covered in this Annual report they are also, 
for convenience, summarised on the 3i website at www.3i.com. This 
will be updated as required and changes noted in future Annual reports. 
As part of complying with AIFMD there is a requirement for 
3i Investments plc, as AIFM, to appoint a depository for each AIF . 
We are well progressed with appointing Citibank International plc as 
depository and this will be completed prior to the AIFMD transitional 
deadline of 22 July 2014.
Results and dividends
Total comprehensive income for the year was £478 million (2013: 
£373 million). An interim dividend of 6.7p (comprising a base dividend 
of 2.7p and an additional dividend of 4.0p) per ordinary share in respect 
of the year to 31 March 2014 was paid on 8 January 2014. The Directors 
recommend a final dividend of 13.3p (comprising a base dividend of  
5.4p and an additional dividend of 7 .9p) per ordinary share be paid in 
respect of the year to 31 March 2014 to shareholders on the Register 
at the close of business on 20 June 2014.
The trustee of The 3i Group Employee Trust (“the Employee Trust”) 
has waived (subject to certain minor exceptions) dividends declared 
on shares in the Company held by the Employee Trust and the Trustee 
of The 3i Group Share Incentive Plan has waived dividends on unallocated 
shares in the Company held by it.
Share capital 
The issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2014 comprised 
971,803, 1 22 ordinary shares of 73 19/22p each and 4,635,018 B shares 
(cumulative preference shares of 1p each), representing 99.99% and 
0.01 % respectively of the Company’s issued share capital by 
nominal value. 
The issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 1 April 2013 
was 971,405, 1 27 ordinary shares and increased over the year by 
397 ,995 ordinary shares due to the issue of shares to the trustee of  
The 3i Group Share Incentive Plan and on the issue of shares under  
The 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan. At the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) on 18 July 2013, the Directors were authorised to repurchase  
up to 97 ,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company (representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
as at 15 May 2013) until the Company’s AGM in 2014 or 1 7 October 2014,  
if earlier. This authority was not exercised in the year. 
The issued B share capital of the Company as at 1 April 2013 was 
4,635,018 B shares and did not change in the year. At the AGM on  
18 July 2013, the Directors were authorised to repurchase up to 
4,635,018 B shares in the Company until the Company’s AGM in 2014 or  
1 7 October 2014, if earlier. This authority was not exercised in the year.  75

Debentures 
As detailed in Note 21 to the Accounts, as at 31 March 2014 the Company 
had in issue Notes issued under the 3i Group plc £2,000 million Note 
Issuance Programme. 
Directors ’ conflicts of interests 
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid conflicts of interest with the 
Company. The Company’s Articles of Association enable Directors 
to approve conflicts of interest and include other conflict of interest 
provisions. The Company has implemented processes to identify potential 
and actual conflicts of interest. Such conflicts are then considered for 
approval by the Board, subject, if necessary, to appropriate conditions. 
Directors ’ indemnities 
As permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association, the Company 
has maintained Qualifying Third-Party Indemnity Provisions (as defined 
under relevant legislation) for the benefit of the Company’s Directors 
throughout the year. 
Employment 
The employment policy of the Group is one of equal opportunity in the 
selection, training, career development and promotion of employees, 
regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, religion and 
whether disabled or otherwise.
3i treats applicants and employees with disabilities fairly and provides 
facilities, equipment and training to assist disabled employees to do their 
jobs. Arrangements are made as necessary to ensure support to job 
applicants who happen to be disabled and who respond to requests to 
inform the Company of any requirements. Should an employee become 
disabled during their employment, efforts would be made to retain them 
in their current employment or to explore the opportunities for their 
retraining or redeployment within 3i. Financial support is also provided by 
3i to support disabled employees who are unable to work, as appropriate 
to local market conditions. 
3i’s principal means of keeping in touch with the views of its employees 
is through employee appraisals, informal consultations, team briefings, 
and staff conferences. Managers throughout 3i have a continuing 
responsibility to keep their staff fully informed of developments and 
to communicate financial results and other matters of interest. This 
is achieved by structured communication including regular meetings 
of employees. 
3i is an equal opportunities employer and has clear grievance and 
disciplinary procedures in place. 3i also has an employee assistance 
programme which provides a confidential, free and independent 
counselling service and is available to all UK staff and their families 
in the UK. 
3i’s employment policies are designed to provide a competitive reward 
package which will attract and retain high quality staff, whilst ensuring 
that the relevant costs remain at an appropriate level. 
Remuneration policy is reviewed by the 3i Group plc Remuneration 
Committee, comprising 3i Group plc non-executive Directors.
3i’s remuneration policy is influenced by 3i’s financial and other 
performance conditions and market practices in the countries in which 
it operates. All employees receive a base salary and are also eligible to 
be considered for a performance-related annual variable incentive award. 
For those members of staff receiving higher levels of annual variable 
incentive awards, a proportion of such awards is delivered in 3i shares, 
vesting over a number of years. 
Where appropriate, employees are eligible to participate in 3i share 
schemes to encourage employees’ involvement in 3i’s performance. 
Investment executives in the Private Equity business line may also 
participate in carried interest schemes, which allow executives to share 
directly in any future profits on investments. Similarly, investment 
executives in the Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines 
may participate in asset-linked and/or fee-linked incentive arrangements. 
Employees participate in local state or company pension schemes 
as appropriate to local market conditions. 
Political donations 
In line with Group policy, during the year to 31 March 2014 no donations 
were made to political parties or organisations, or independent election 
candidates, and no political expenditure was incurred.
Significant agreements 
As at 31 March 2014 the Company was party to the following agreements 
that are subject to a renegotiation period on a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid: 
(a) £450 million multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated 
30 June 201 1, between the Company, 3i Holdings plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc 
and 1 2 other banks. The Company is required to notify Lloyds TSB Bank 
plc, as agent bank, within five days, of a change of control. This opens a 
20-day negotiation period to determine if the Majority Lenders (as defined 
in the agreement) are willing to continue the facility. Failing agreement, 
amounts outstanding would be repayable and the facility cancelled; and 
(b) £50 million multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated 
29 September 201 1, between the Company, 3i Holdings plc and Nordea 
Bank Finland PLC London Branch. The Company is required to notify 
the lender, within five days, of a change of control. This opens a 20-day 
negotiation period to determine if the lender is willing to continue the 
facility. Failing agreement amounts outstanding would be repayable 
and the facility cancelled.  76

Corporate Governance
Statement of Directors ’ 
responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and 
accounts in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and those 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) which have been 
adopted by the European Union. 
Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the Group financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that 
period. The Directors consider that this Annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. In preparing the Group 
financial statements the Directors: 
(a) select suitable accounting policies in accordance with International 
Accounting Standard 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently; 
(b) present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
(c) provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group’s financial position and financial performance; 
(d) state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
(e) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable. 
The Directors have a responsibility for ensuring that proper accounting 
records are kept which are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the Group 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
In accordance with the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules, 
the Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge that: 
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
(b) the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed in the Board 
of Directors and Executive Committee section. 
Going concern
The Directors have acknowledged their responsibilities in relation to 
the financial statements for the year to 31 March 2014.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out in the Business 
review section. The financial position of the Group, its capital structure, 
gearing and liquidity positions are described in the Financial review 
section. The Group’s policies on risk management, including treasury 
and funding risks, are contained in the Risk section. Further details are 
contained in the Financial statements and Notes including, in particular, 
details on financial risk management and derivative financial instruments.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. The Directors have considered the uncertainties 
inherent in current and expected future market conditions, their possible 
impact upon the financial performance of the Group and a report from 
the Group Finance Director on the outlook for liquidity. After consideration, 
the Directors are satisfied that the Company has and will maintain 
sufficient financial resources to enable it to continue operating in the 
foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts.
Audit information

Corporate Governance
This section of the Directors’ report contains 
the corporate governance statement required 
by FCA Disclosure and T ransparency Rule 7 .2.
Corporate governance
The Company seeks to comply with established best practice in the field 
of corporate governance. The Board has adopted core values and global 
policies which set out the behaviour expected of staff in their dealings 
with shareholders, customers, colleagues, suppliers and others who 
engage with the Company.
Throughout the year, the Company complied with the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012.
The Board’ s responsibilities  
and processes
The Board’s key responsibilities are described on page 70. It is 
responsible to shareholders for the overall management of the Group 
and may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the 
provisions of relevant statutes, the Company’s Articles of Association 
and any directions given by special resolution of the shareholders. The 
Articles of Association empower the Board to offer, allot, grant options 
over or otherwise deal with or dispose of the Company’s shares as the 
Board may decide. The Companies Act 2006 authorises the Company 
to make market purchases of its own shares if the purchase has first 
been authorised by a resolution of the Company.
At the AGM in July 2013, shareholders renewed the Board’s authority 
to allot ordinary shares and to repurchase ordinary shares on behalf 
of the Company subject to certain limits and also renewed the Board’s 
authority to repurchase B shares on behalf of the Company subject to 
certain limits. Details of the authorities which the Board will be seeking 
at the 2014 AGM are set out in the 2014 Notice of AGM.
The Articles of Association also specifically empower the Board to 
exercise the Company’s powers to borrow money and to mortgage 
or charge the Company’s assets and any uncalled capital and to issue 
debentures and other securities.
Matters reserved for the Board 
The Board has approved a formal schedule of matters reserved 
to it and its duly authorised Committees for decision. These include: 
  Approval of the Group’s overall strategy, strategic plan and annual 
operating budget; 
  Approval of the Company’s half-yearly and annual financial statements 
and changes in the Group’s accounting policies or practices; 
  Changes relating to the capital structure of the Company or its 
regulated status; 
  Major capital projects; 
  Major changes in the nature of business operations; 
  Investments and divestments in the ordinary course of business  
above certain limits set by the Board from time to time; 
  Adequacy of internal control systems; 
  Appointments to the Board and the Executive Committee; 
  Principal terms and conditions of employment of members  
of the Executive Committee; and 
  Changes in employee share schemes and other long-term  
incentive schemes. 
Matters delegated by the Board to management include implementation 
of the Board approved strategy, day-to-day operation of the business, 
the appointment and remuneration of all executives below the Executive 
Committee and the formulation and execution of risk management 
policies and procedures. 
A succession and contingency plan for executive leadership is prepared 
by management and reviewed periodically by the Board. The purpose 
of this plan is to identify suitable candidates for succession to key senior 
management positions, agree their training and development needs, 
and ensure the necessary human resources are in place for the 
Company to meet its objectives. 
Meetings of the Board 
The principal matters considered by the Board during the year 
(in addition to matters formally reserved to the Board) included: 
  The Group’s strategic model, related KPIs and annual budget; 
  Regular reports from the Chief Executive; 
  Regular reports from the Board’s committees; 
  The recommendations of the Valuations Committee on valuations 
of investments;
  The Annual report and accounts, half yearly report and quarterly 
interim management statements;
  The Group’s dividend policy;
  Organisational capability and succession plans; and
  The acquisition of Barclays Infrastructure Fund Management Limited. 
Reports and papers are circulated to the Directors in a timely manner 
in preparation for Board and Committee meetings. These papers are 
supplemented by information specifically requested by the Directors 
from time to time. 
Performance evaluation 
During the year, the Board conducted its annual evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its committees and individual Directors. 
Further details are given on page 72.

3  Although not members of the Brand and Values Committee all non-executive Directors are invited to attend and participate in the Committee’s meetings.
Appointment and re-election 
of Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, the Companies Acts 
and satisfactory performance evaluation, non-executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial three-year term. Before the third and sixth 
anniversaries of first appointment, the Director discusses with the Board 
whether it is appropriate for a further three-year term to be served.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association the minimum number of 
Directors is two and the maximum is 20, unless otherwise determined 
by the Company by ordinary resolution. Directors are appointed by 
ordinary resolution of shareholders or by the Board. The Company’s 
Articles of Association provide for Directors to retire by rotation at an 
AGM if they were appointed by the Board since the preceding AGM, they 
held office during the two preceding AGMs but did not retire at either 
of them, they held non-executive office for a continuous period of nine 
years or more at the date of that AGM, or they choose to retire from 
office. Shareholders can remove any Director by special resolution 
and appoint another person to be a director in their place by 
ordinary resolution.
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, retiring Directors are 
eligible for reappointment. The office of Director is vacated if the Director 
resigns, becomes bankrupt or is prohibited by law from being a Director 
or where the Board so resolves following the Director suffering from 
ill-health or being absent from Board meetings for 12 months without 
the Board’s permission.
In accordance with the Code all Directors choose to submit to 
reappointment every year. Accordingly, at the AGM to be held on  
17 July 2014, all the Directors will retire from office. All the Directors  
are eligible for and seek reappointment other than Mr R H Meddings 
who will retire as a Director at the conclusion of the AGM. The Board’s 
recommendation for the reappointment of Directors is set out in the 2014 
Notice of AGM.

The roles of the Chairman, 
Chief  Executive and Senior 
Independent Director
The Board approved division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
of the Board and the Chief Executive is described on page 72.
Mr R H Meddings has served as Senior Independent Director since 
October 2010, to whom, in accordance with the Code, concerns can 
be conveyed.
Directors
Directors’ biographical details are set out on page 68. The Board 
currently comprises the Chairman, five independent non-executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. Sir Adrian Montague served 
as Chairman and Mr J P Asquith, Mr S A Borrows, Mr A R Cox,  
Mr R H Meddings, Ms M G Verluyten and Mrs J S Wilson served 
as Directors throughout the year under review. Mr W Mesdag served 
as a Director until 30 November 2013 and Mr D A M Hutchison served 
as a Director from 1 1 November 2013.
In addition to fulfilling their legal responsibilities as Directors, non-
executive Directors are expected to bring an independent judgment 
to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards 
of conduct, and to help the Board provide the Company with effective 
leadership. Further details of their role are set out on page 72. Non-
executive Directors are expected to make available sufficient time 
to meet the requirements of the appointment. The average time 
commitment is expected to be around 15 days a year together with 
additional time for serving on the Board’s committees.
The Board’s discussions, and its approval of the Group’s strategic plan 
and annual budget, provide the non-executive Directors with the 
opportunity to contribute to and validate management’s plans and assist 
in the development of strategy. The non-executive Directors receive 
regular management accounts, reports and information which enable 
them to scrutinise the Company’s and management’s performance 
against agreed objectives.
Directors’ independence 
All the non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman, who was 
independent on appointment) were considered by the Board to be 
independent for the purposes of the Code in the year to 31 March 2014. 
The Board reviews non-executive Director independence at least 
annually, having regard to the potential relevance and materiality 
of a Director’s interests and relationships. No Director was materially 
interested in any contract or arrangement subsisting during or at the 
end of the financial period that was significant in relation to the 
business of the Company. 
Directors’ employment contracts 
Details of Executive Directors’ employment contracts are set out 
in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
T raining and development 
The Company has a training policy which provides a framework within 
which training for Directors is planned with the objective of ensuring 
Directors understand the duties and responsibilities of being a director 
of a listed company. All Directors are required to update their skills and 
maintain their familiarity with the Company and its business continually. 
Presentations on different aspects of the Company’s business are made 
regularly to the Board. On appointment, all non-executive Directors have 
discussions with the Chairman and the Chief Executive following which 
appropriate briefings on the responsibilities of Directors, the Company’s 
business and the Company’s procedures are arranged. The Company 
provides opportunities for non-executive Directors to obtain a thorough 
understanding of the Company’s business by meeting members of the 
senior management team who in turn arrange, as required, visits to 
investment or support teams. 
The Company has procedures for Directors to take independent legal 
or other professional advice about the performance of their duties. 
The Board’ s Committees 
As described on page 71, the Board is assisted by various principal 
committees of the Board which report regularly to it. 
Audit and Compliance Committee 
The membership and activities of the Audit and Compliance Committee 
are described in its report on pages 84 to 86.
Remuneration Committee 
The membership and activities of the Remuneration Committee are 
described in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee comprises Sir Adrian Montague (Chairman), 
Mr S A Borrows, Mr J P Asquith, Mr A R Cox, Mr D A M Hutchison,  
Mr R H Meddings, and Ms M G Verluyten, all of whom served throughout 
the year, save for Mr Hutchison who served from his appointment as 
a Director on 1 1 November 2013. Mr W Mesdag was a member of the 
Committee until his resignation from the Board on 30 November 2013. 
During the year, the Nominations Committee held seven meetings 
at which it: 
  Considered the size, balance, diversity (including gender) and 
composition of the Board, including succession planning, and the 
needs of the Company in terms of the desirable experience and 
qualifications of future appointees as non-executive Directors;
  Considered candidates for appointment as non-executive Director 
and recommended to the Board the appointment of Mr Hutchison; and
  Considered and put in train arrangements for selecting further 
candidates for recommendation to the Board for appointment 
as non-executive Director.  80
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Corporate Governance
The Company has a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the 
appointment of Directors with the objective of identifying the skills and 
experience profile required of new Directors and identifying suitable 
candidates. The procedure includes the appraisal and selection of 
potential candidates by the Committee, including (in the case of non-
executive Directors) whether they have sufficient time to fulfil their roles. 
Specialist recruitment consultants assist the Committee to identify 
suitable candidates for appointment. The Committee’s recommendations 
for appointment are put to the full Board for approval. 
Further to the publication of the Davies Report on Women on Boards,  
and Code Provision B.2.4, the Board strongly supports the principle  
of boardroom diversity, of which gender is one important aspect.  
The Board’s aim is to have a broad range of approaches, backgrounds, 
skills and experience represented on the Board and to make 
appointments on merit and against objective criteria, including diversity. 
External search consultancies engaged by the Company are instructed 
to put forward for all Board positions a diversity of candidates including 
women candidates. Neither of the two external search consultancies 
engaged by the Committee during the year, The Zygos Partnership and 
Russell Reynolds Associates, had other connections with the Company.
Valuations Committee 
The Valuations Committee comprises Mr D A M Hutchison (Chairman), 
Sir Adrian Montague, Ms M G Verluyten, Mr S A Borrows and 
Mrs J S Wilson, all of whom served throughout the year except 
Mr Hutchison who served from 30 November 2013 and Ms Verluyten 
who served from 3 December 2013. Mr W Mesdag was a member 
and Chairman of the Committee until his resignation as a Director 
on 30 November 2013.
During the year, the Valuations Committee met four times and: 
  Considered and made recommendations to the Audit and 
Compliance Committee and the Board on the quarterly valuations 
of the Group’s investments; 
  Received reports from the external Auditors on the valuations 
process and proposed valuations;
  Reviewed the Group’s valuation policies and procedures and 
recommended changes to the Audit and Compliance Committee  
and the Board where relevant; and
  Considered and made recommendations on all other matters relating 
to the valuations for the purpose of the accounts of the Company and 
the consolidated accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Company has a formal, robust process for valuing its investment 
portfolio and the investment portfolio of its subsidiaries. This process, 
and the policy which governs it, is reviewed annually. The Valuations 
Committee, under delegated authority from the Board of the Company, 
considers amendments and changes to the policy and recommends 
them to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board. The 
Valuation policy complies with applicable International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the guidelines issued by the International 
Private Equity Valuations Board (the IPEV guidelines). The policy is 
applied to all investment assets held by the Company or its subsidiaries, 
or vehicles managed or advised by the Company or its subsidiaries.
The valuation policy was reviewed formally in January 2014. The 
situations where run-rate earnings are appropriate, the application 
of caps and discounts and the valuation of equity stakes in CLOs were 
specifically discussed and recommended. The Committee also reviewed 
and recommended amendments to the policy in light of the application 
of AIFMD to ensure compliance.
In addition to the Committee members, meetings of the Valuations 
Committee are also attended by the Group Financial Controller, 
members of the central Valuations team and the external Auditors.
Brand and Values Committee 
The Brand and Values Committee comprises Sir Adrian Montague 
(Chairman), Mr S A Borrows and Mr K J Dunn, all of whom served 
throughout the year. In addition, all of the Company’s non-executive 
Directors are invited to attend meetings of the Committee and participate 
in its discussions. 
During the year, the Brand and Values Committee met twice. Activities 
in the year included considering and approving changes to the ESG 
management framework within the Group, reviewing and updating 
the Group’s Responsible Investment policy and receiving reports on 
reputational risk matters. It also reviewed proposed changes to the 
Committee’s own terms of reference intended to refocus the Committee 
on a range of specific reputation linked issues. 
T reasury T ransactions Committee
In addition to its Principal Committees, the Board also has a number 
of other standing committees established to consider specific items 
of business on an ad hoc basis as required. These include the Treasury 
Transactions Committee which comprises the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance Director and the Group Treasurer and 
meets as required to approve treasury transactions. At least two 
members of the Committee are required to attend meetings to form 
a quorum.
The Company Secretary 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, who advises the Board, through the Chairman, 
on governance matters. The Company’s Articles of Association and 
the schedule of matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised 
committees for decision provide that the appointment and removal 
of the Company Secretary is a matter for the full Board.

Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a purposeful 
relationship with shareholders. The Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director meet with the Company’s principal shareholders to 
discuss relevant issues as they arise. The Chairman maintains a dialogue 
with shareholders on strategy, corporate governance and Directors’ 
remuneration as required. The Board receives reports from the 
Company’s brokers on shareholder issues and non-executive Directors 
are invited to attend the Company’s presentations to analysts and are 
offered the opportunity to meet shareholders.
The Company also uses its AGM as an opportunity to communicate with 
its shareholders. At the Meeting, business presentations are generally 
made by the Chairman and the Chief Executive. The Chairmen of the 
Remuneration, Audit and Compliance, and Nominations Committees 
are generally available to answer shareholders’ questions. 
The 2013 Notice of AGM was dispatched to shareholders not less than 
20 working days before the Meeting. At that Meeting, voting on each 
resolution was taken on a poll and the poll results were made available 
on the Company’s website.
Rights and restrictions  
attaching to shares
A summary of the rights and restrictions attaching to shares as 
at 31 March 2014 is set out below.
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders in general meeting. Holders of ordinary 
shares and B shares enjoy the rights set out in the Articles of Association 
of the Company and under the laws of England and Wales. Any share 
may be issued with or have attached to it such rights and restrictions 
as the Company by ordinary resolution or, failing such resolution, 
the Board may decide.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at 
general meetings and to appoint proxies and, in the case of corporations, 
corporate representatives to attend, speak and vote at such meetings on 
their behalf. To attend and vote at a general meeting a shareholder must 
be entered on the register of members at such time (not being earlier 
than 48 hours before the meeting) as stated in the Notice of general 
meeting. On a poll, holders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote 
for each share held. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
the Company’s Annual report and accounts, to receive such dividends 
and other distributions as may lawfully be paid or declared on such 
shares and, on any liquidation of the Company, to share in the surplus 
assets of the Company after satisfaction of the entitlements of the 
holders of the B shares or such other shares with preferred rights 
as may then be in issue.
Holders of B shares are entitled, out of the profits available for 
distribution in any year and in priority to any payment of dividend 
or other distribution to holders of ordinary shares, to a cumulative 
preferential dividend of 3.75% per annum calculated on the amount 
of 127p per B share (“the Return Amount”). On a return of capital 
(other than a solvent intra-Group reorganisation) holders of B shares 
are entitled to receive in priority to any payment to holders of ordinary 
shares payment of the Return Amount together with any accrued but 
unpaid dividends but are not entitled to any further right of participation 
in the profits or assets of the Company.
Holders of B shares are not entitled to notice of or to attend, speak or 
vote at general meetings save where the B share dividend has remained 
unpaid for six months or more or where the business of the meeting 
includes consideration of a resolution for the winding-up of the Company 
(other than a solvent intra-Group reorganisation) in which case holders 
of B shares shall be entitled to attend, speak and vote only in relation to 
such resolution and in either case shall, on a poll, be entitled to one vote 
per B share held. 82

Corporate Governance
There are no restrictions on the transfer of fully paid shares in the 
Company, save as follows. The Board may decline to register: a transfer 
of uncertificated shares in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001; a transfer to more than four joint holders; 
a transfer of certificated shares which is not in respect of only one class 
of share; a transfer which is not accompanied by the certificate for the 
shares to which it relates; a transfer which is not duly stamped in 
circumstances where a duly stamped instrument is required; or a 
transfer where in accordance with section 794 of the Companies Act 
2006 a notice (under section 793 of that Act) has been served by the 
Company on a shareholder who has then failed to give the information 
required within the specified time. In the latter circumstances the 
Company may make the relevant shares subject to certain restrictions 
(including in respect of the ability to exercise voting rights, to transfer 
the shares validly and, except in the case of a liquidation, to receive 
the payment of sums due from the Company). Since 14 July 2009, the 
Company has been entitled to appoint a person to execute a transfer 
on behalf of all holders of B shares in acceptance of an offer, paying the 
holders such amount as they would have been entitled to on a winding-
up of the Company.
There are no shares carrying special rights with regard to control of the 
Company. There are no restrictions placed on voting rights of fully paid 
shares, save where in accordance with Article 12 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association a restriction notice has been served by the 
Company in respect of shares for failure to comply with statutory 
notices or where a transfer notice (as described below) has been 
served in respect of shares and has not yet been complied with.
In the circumstances specified in Article 38 of the Company’s Articles 
of Association the Company may serve a transfer notice on holders 
of shares. The relevant circumstances relate to: (a) potential tax 
disadvantage to the Company, (b) the number of “United States 
Residents” who own or hold shares becoming 75 or more, or (c) the 
Company being required to be registered as an investment company 
under relevant US legislation. The notice would require the transfer 
of relevant shares and pending such transfer the rights and privileges 
attaching to those shares would be suspended. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of its securities that may restrict the transfer of shares or exercise 
of voting rights. 
Portfolio management and 
voting policy 
In relation to unquoted investments, the Group’s approach is to seek 
to add value to the businesses in which the Group invests through the 
Group’s extensive experience, resources and contacts and through active 
engagement with the Boards of those companies. In relation to quoted 
investments, the Group’s policy is to exercise voting rights on all matters 
affecting its interests. 
Internal control 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and 
reviews its effectiveness at least annually. Such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
Through the regular meetings of the Board and the schedule of matters 
reserved to the Board or its duly authorised committees for decision, 
the Board aims to maintain full and effective control over appropriate 
strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. 
The Board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly 
defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. The Board 
considers and approves a strategic plan and budget on an annual basis 
and receives regular updates. In addition, there are established 
procedures and processes for planning and controlling expenditure and 
the making of investments. There are also information and reporting 
systems for monitoring the Group’s businesses and their performance. 
The Group Risk Committee is a management committee formed by the 
Chief Executive and its purpose is to review the business of the Group in 
order to ensure that business risk is considered, assessed and managed 
as an integral part of the business. There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks. 
This process was in place for the year to 31 March 2014 and up to 
the date of this report. Details of the risk management framework 
can be found in the Risk section. 
The overall internal control process is regularly reviewed by the Board 
and the Audit and Compliance Committee and complies with the 
internal control guidance for Directors on the Code issued by the 
Turnbull Committee. The internal control process established for 
the Group includes: 
Policies 
  Core values and global policies together comprising the Group’s high 
level principles and controls, with which all staff are expected 
to comply; 
  Detailed policies and procedures, with processes for reporting 
weaknesses and for monitoring corrective action; and 
  A Compliance manual, with procedures for reporting 
compliance therewith.

Processes 
  Appointment of experienced and professional staff, both by 
recruitment and promotion, of the necessary calibre to fulfil their 
allotted responsibilities;

evaluate the potential financial impact and likelihood of identified risks 
and possible new risk areas; 
  The setting of control, mitigation and monitoring procedures and the 
review of actual occurrences, identifying lessons to be learnt; 
  A comprehensive system of financial reporting to the Board, based 
on an annual budget with monthly reporting of actual results, 
analysis of variances, scrutiny of key performance indicators and 
regular re-forecasting; 
  Regular reports to the Board, which analyse funding requirements, 
track the generation and use of capital and the volume of liquidity, 
measure the Group’s exposure to exchange rate movements and 
record the level of compliance with the Group’s funding objectives; 
  A Group Compliance function whose role is to integrate regulatory 
compliance procedures and best practices into the Group’s 
systems; and 
  Well defined procedures governing the appraisal and approval of 
investments, including detailed investment and divestment approval 
procedures, incorporating appropriate levels of authority and regular 
post-investment reviews. 
Verification
  An Internal Audit function which undertakes periodic examination 
of business units and processes and recommends improvements 
in controls to management;
  The external auditors who are engaged to express an opinion on  
the annual financial statements; and
  An Audit and Compliance Committee which considers significant 
control matters and receives reports from Internal Audit, the external 
auditors and Group Compliance on a regular basis.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by Internal Audit 
and Group Compliance, which operate on an international basis and 
report to management and the Audit and Compliance Committee on the 
Group’s operations. The work of Internal Audit is focused on the areas of 
greatest risk to the Group determined with reference to the Group’s risk 
management process.
The external auditors independently and objectively review the approach 
of management to reporting operating results and financial condition. 
They also review and test the system of internal financial control and the 
information contained in the annual financial statements to the extent 
necessary for expressing their opinion.
Financial reporting
In the context of the above internal control framework, there are specific 
processes in place in relation to Financial Reporting, including:
  Comprehensive system of key control and oversight processes, 
including regular reconciliations, line manager reviews and systems’ 
access controls;
  Updates for consideration by the Audit and Compliance Committee 
of accounting developments, including draft and new accounting 
standards and legislation;
  A separate Valuations Committee which considers the Group’s 
investment valuation policies, application and outcome;
  Approval of the Group’s budget by the Board and regular updates 
on actual and forecast financial performance against budget;
  Reports from Internal Audit on matters relevant to the financial 
reporting process, including periodic assessments of internal controls, 
processes and fraud risk;
  Independent updates and reports from the external auditors on 
accounting developments, application of accounting standards,  
key accounting judgements and observations on systems and 
controls; and
  Regular risk reviews, including an assessment of risks to reliable 
financial reporting covering people, processes and systems, and 
updates on the management of identified risks or actual incidents.

Richard Meddings Chairman, Audit Committee
“The Audit Committee has had a busy 
year , particularly considering the 
changes to accounting standards 
and  the presentation of the 
Group’s performance.”

report we have presented since the 
recommendations of the Financial Reporting 
Council. In the report, I have set out the matters

Significant issues on the Financial statements
The Committee considered the following significant issues in relation to the results for the year:
Area of judgment What the Committee did
Valuation of the Proprietary Capital portfolio
The most material area of judgment in the financial statements relates 
to the valuation of the unquoted Proprietary Capital portfolio, which 
at 31 March 2014 was £3,01 1 million, or 91% of net assets, under the 
Investment basis.
In recognition of the importance of this area the Board has established 
a separate Valuations Committee to review the valuations policy, 
process and application to individual investments. This Committee 
provides quarterly reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee.
Portfolio valuations are prepared in accordance with IFRS and the 
IPEV guidelines. A detailed explanation of the valuations policy is 
provided on pages 156 to 158.
On behalf of the Board, the Committee receives and reviews quarterly 
reports from the Chairman of the Valuations Committee and the Group 
Finance Director, which support the published net asset value of the 
Group. The external auditors review the valuations and input from the 
external auditors includes detailed review by their valuations practice 
to support the audit team.
In addition to that regular review, during the year it specifically considered:
  the appropriateness and extent of capping and discounting multiples 
used to value the Private Equity portfolio in positive markets;
  the use of run-rate earnings in high growth companies, and in 
respect of the Group’s investment in Action in particular; and
  the need to enhance the valuation process in respect of equity 
investments in Debt Management as fund raising conditions 
improved and the amount of investment increased.
The Committee satisfied itself that the Valuations Committee had 
discharged its responsibilities appropriately through a review of the 
detailed Valuation Committee papers, enquiry of the Chairman of the 
Valuations Committee, the Group Finance Director and the external 
auditors. No adjustments to the valuations proposed were made as 
a result of those reviews.
Application of IFRS 1 0
The Group makes investments in portfolio companies, directly and 
on behalf of third-parties. In certain circumstances, as investment 
manager or adviser, the Group is assessed as having control of those 
investments under IFRS.
IFRS 10 acknowledges that as an investment company the nature 
of that control differs from that of a holding company of an operating 
subsidiary, and provides an investment entity exception from the 
requirement to consolidate its interests in portfolio companies, and 
allows the Group to continue to record its investments at fair value.
However, the detailed application of IFRS 10 also results in the 
deconsolidation of a number of intermediate holding companies in the 
Group which are now also recorded at fair value. The consequence of 
this is less transparency of the underlying performance of the Group’s 
Proprietary Capital investments and of other key performance 
indicators of the Group. 
Therefore, in the interest of transparency, and in the context of the need 
to ensure that the Annual report and accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable, the results are presented on an Investment basis, 
which continues to consolidate the intermediate holding companies. 
A reconciliation from the Investment basis to IFRS financial statements 
is provided in pages 54 to 57 , and the primary statements and Notes 
to the accounts (pages 103 to 151) have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS 10.
The Committee followed the developments of IFRS 10 closely, receiving 
regular reports from the Group Finance Director, Group Financial 
Controller and the external auditors and noting the guidance 
recommended by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) 
in January 2014, which was marginally supported, but not adopted 
by the IASB in March 2014.
It considered the merits of adopting the standard early, with effect from 
1 April 2013, and concluded that on balance it was preferable to do so, 
taking account of the impracticalities of potentially consolidating the 
many portfolio companies.
It reviewed the presentation of the Investment basis, the reconciliation 
to the IFRS financial statements, and the IFRS financial statements and 
the Notes to those statements. 
It made enquiries of the external auditors to understand the detailed 
application of IFRS 10.
The Committee concluded that the requirement to present an Annual 
report and accounts that is fair, balanced and understandable took 
precedence over the need to avoid the prevalence of non-GAAP 
measures in the strategic report. It was satisfied that the detailed 
explanation and reconciliation from the Investment basis and IFRS 
financial statements was sufficient to ensure transparency for the 
users of the financial statements. 86

Audit Committee report
Area of judgment What the Committee did
Segmental reporting
During the year, the Group has developed the business model which 
reflects that it has two principal activities: Proprietary Capital investing 
and Fund Management. 
Different proportions of Proprietary Capital are invested in Private 
Equity, in Infrastructure and in Debt Management, as illustrated in 
the Strategic report on page 12. 
Correspondingly different levels of third-party capital are managed 
or advised for each business line. The strategic intent is to ensure 
that the combined Fund Management activity as a whole is profitable 
on a sustainable basis.
The Committee considered the development of the presentation 
of the Group’s Proprietary Capital and Fund Management activities.
Using papers prepared by management during the course of the year, 
it reviewed the extent of segmental reporting and considered whether 
disclosure had been enhanced or reduced.
It reviewed the allocation methodology for the treatment of operating 
costs, carried interest payable and receivable and net interest payable.
It also reviewed the basis of calculation for the synthetic management 
fee applied to the Proprietary Capital and Fund Management results 
based on market rates and industry practice.
Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the segmental reporting 
should be augmented, at this stage of the Group’s strategic 
development, with consolidated Proprietary Capital and Fund 
Management returns data. 
Assessing external audit 
effectiveness
The Committee specifically reviews the effectiveness of the external 
auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , each year. It does so through the use 
of questionnaires completed by management, considering the extent 
of their contribution at its meetings throughout the course of the year, 
and in one-to-one meetings between Ernst & Young LLP and members 
of the Committee, and concluded that the audit was effective.
During the year the Committee reviewed the Audit Quality Inspections 
Annual Report and the Public Report on Ernst & Young LLP . It also 
considered the audit plan for the year, which includes the use of 
Ernst & Young LLP’s valuation practice to support the audit of the 
portfolio valuations.
Appointing the Auditor and 
safeguards on non-audit services
Ernst & Young LLP has been the Group’s statutory auditor since at least 
1994 when 3i Group became listed. The engagement audit partner was 
rotated this year. The Committee is aware of the new requirement to 
undertake a tender of the external audit every 10 years and change 
auditor at least every 20 years. The Committee last reviewed the audit 
market in 2008 and the audit fee structure in 2012.
The Committee has considered when to undertake a full tender. In doing 
so it has had regard to the extent of change in the Group following the 
strategic review in June 2012, which included a significant reduction 
in the headcount in the Finance team, the implementation of the new 
Private Equity financial system, a significant increase in reporting in 
accordance with the new requirements of AIFMD, EMIR, CRD IV and 
FATCA and the application of IFRS 10 in the current year. A full tender 
will therefore be conducted at an appropriate time between now and 
2018, when the current audit partner will be due for rotation.
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring the independence 
and objectivity of the Company’s auditors. It reviews the nature and 
extent of the services provided by them, the level of their fees and the 
element comprising non-audit fees.
The Committee Chairman is notified of all assignments allocated 
to Ernst & Young LLP over a set threshold, other than those related 
to due diligence within the Group’s investment process where the team 
engaged would be independent of the audit team. Appointments in 
relation to the investment process are reviewed separately by the 
Investment Committee. Safeguards have been put in place to reduce the 
likelihood of compromising auditor independence, including the following 
principles which are applied in respect of services provided by the 
auditors and other accounting firms and monitored by the Committee:
  Services required to be undertaken by the auditors, which include 
regulatory returns, formalities relating to borrowings, shareholder and 
other circulars. This work is normally allocated directly to the auditors;
  Services which it is most efficient for the auditors to provide. In this 
case, information relating to the service is largely derived from the 
Company’s audited financial records; for example, corporate tax 
services. This work is normally allocated to the auditors subject 
to consideration of any impact on their independence; and
  Services that could be provided by a number of firms including 
general consultancy work. All significant consultancy projects are 
normally put out to tender and work would be allocated to the auditors 
only if it did not present a potential threat to the independence of the 
audit team. Included in this category is due diligence work relating 
to the investment process. If this service were to be provided by the 
auditors, the specific team engaged would be independent of the 
audit team.
Details of the fees paid to the auditors are disclosed in Note 5 to the 
financial statements.

Directors ’ remuneration report
Jonathan Asquith, Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Statement by the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
As Remuneration Committee Chairman, I am pleased to introduce 
the Directors’ remuneration report for the financial year 1 April 2013 
to 31 March 2014 (“the year”) and to provide some details of the 
background against which the Committee’s decisions have been taken 
in the year. References to “the current year” relate to the financial year 
1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015.
This report is the first that has been prepared in accordance with the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (“the Regulations”). The report is 
presented in two sections:
  the Policy report, which is subject to a binding shareholder vote; and 
  the Implementation report, which sets out how the policy was 
implemented for the year and how we intend to apply the policy 
for the current year, which will be subject to an advisory vote.
Performance in the year
We are now almost two years into the multi-year strategic plan that 
was set out by our Chief Executive, Simon Borrows, in June 2012. 
Following the successful delivery of the first year’s Restructuring phase, 
the Company has moved into the Transition and delivery phase of the 
plan, and is now a more streamlined business delivering strong 
performance. The Committee’s decisions regarding the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors have been made based upon achievement 
against the strategic priorities for the year, with the highlights being:
Annual operating cash profit
In the past the Company has operated at a material annual operating 
cash deficit. The impact of the savings delivered by the restructuring, 
while maintaining cash income, resulted in a £5 million profit for the year.
Grow third-party income and generate 
a  sustainable  annual operating profit from 
our  fund  management activities
Assets under management grew by £4 1 million to £1 2,91 1 million during 
the year, and together with the cost reduction programme the Fund 
Management platform generated an underlying profit (excluding 
restructuring and amortisation costs) and margin of £33 million and 26% 
respectively, compared to £1 7 million and 1 3% for the previous year .
Improve capital allocation, focusing on enhanced 
shareholder distributions and re-investment in 
our  core investment businesses
There continues to be significant improvement in the shift away from using 
capital to pay operating costs, funding costs and debt repayment costs and 
towards more being used for shareholder distributions and reinvestment.
These significant achievements and progress made during the year 
are reflected in the remuneration decisions contained within the 
Implementation report.
Priorities for the Committee
The Company’s strategic objectives for the current year are reflected 
in the performance measures that will be applied to the annual bonus 
with our longer-term objectives reflected in the performance measures 
applicable to the LTIP awards. As the Restructuring and Transition 
phases of the strategic plan near completion we have reviewed the 
appropriateness of continuing to link 50% of the LTIP performance 
measures to a balanced scorecard of particular strategic measures. 
Following the review, and to ensure the performance measures remain 
appropriate, the strategic measures used last year will be replaced with 
a relative total shareholder return metric. The details of this are shown 
in more detail on page 101. The Committee considers the annual bonus 
objectives to be commercially sensitive, and while they are not fully 
disclosed on page 101 of the report, they will be disclosed retrospectively 
with the performance achieved against each of them.
The levels of pay that our Directors will be eligible to receive will remain 
substantially unchanged in the current year. Since the completion of our 
strategic reward review last year and following further consultation with 
some of our key shareholders, there have been two changes to our 
arrangements to reinforce the long-term alignment of our pay with 
shareholders, being:
  The increase in the deferral level of annual bonuses for Executive 
Directors and Executive Committee members from 40% to 50% of any 
bonus awarded starting with any bonus awarded in respect of FY2015. 
This deferral will continue to be invested in Company shares, and be 
released 25% per annum over four years; and
  As announced at last year’s Annual General Meeting, the timing of the 
release of LTIP awards will revert to the previous practice of being 
released 50% on the third anniversary and 25% on the fourth and fifth 
anniversaries of grant.
The Remuneration Committee values all feedback from shareholders, and 
hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Policy report
Remuneration policy table
The table below summarises the policy in respect of each element of the Company’s remuneration for Executive and non-executive Directors 
effective from the date of the 2014 Annual General Meeting. This policy will be put forward for shareholder approval at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006.
This policy remains unchanged from FY2014, except where highlighted below. While the Committee will consider the appropriateness of the 
Remuneration policy annually to ensure it continues to align with the business strategy, there is no current intention to revise the policy more 
often than every three years, unless required to through changes to regulations or legislation.

Notes to the Remuneration policy table
Performance conditions
The Committee selected the performance conditions used for 
determining the annual bonus and LTIP awards as they align directly 
with the short and long-term strategy of the business. These conditions 
are set annually by the Committee at levels that take into account the 
Board’s business plan.
Changes to the policy operated in FY201 4
There have been no changes to the remuneration policy from that which 
was applied during the year, other than an increase in the proportion 
of the annual bonus that is deferred over four years from 40% to 50%. 
This has been increased to align the Executive Directors’ interests 
more closely with those of shareholders.
Consistency with policy for all employees
All employees are eligible to receive salary, pension contributions 
and benefits and to be considered for a discretionary annual bonus, 
with the maximum opportunities reflecting the role and seniority of 
each employee. Other members of the Executive Committee are subject 
to the same bonus deferral arrangements as the Executive Directors. 
Higher-earning members of staff below Executive Committee have 
a portion of their bonus deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments 
over a three-year period.
Within each of the Group’s businesses, senior members of staff have 
a significant part of their compensation linked to the long-term 
performance of the Group’s and its clients’ investments through 
carried interest schemes or similar arrangements. 
Co-investment and carried interest plans
Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director, are permitted to participate in carried interest plans and similar 
arrangements. This was approved by shareholders on 4 July 2001 
and 6 July 201 1 when approving the Group’s Long-term Incentive Plan. 
No current Executive Director benefits from these arrangements.
Malus/Clawback policy
The Committee has agreed a policy, which applies to long-term incentive 
awards and deferred bonus share awards made during the year to 
Executive Directors (and certain other Senior Executives), under which 
awards may be forfeited or reduced prior to vesting in exceptional 
circumstances on such basis as the Committee considers fair , reasonable 
and proportionate. This would include material misstatement of Group 
financial statements, or cases where an individual is deemed to have 
caused a material loss for the Group as a result of reckless, negligent 
or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do 
not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid in its operation 
or implementation without seeking shareholder approval for 
a revised version of this Policy report. 92

Recruitment policy
In determining remuneration arrangements for new executive 
appointments to the Board (including internal promotions), the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, including the 
calibre of the individual, the nature of the role, local market practice,  
the individual’s current remuneration package, 3i remuneration policy, 
internal relativities and existing arrangements for other Executive 
Directors. For external appointments, some variation may be necessary 
in order to attract the successful candidate and to reflect particular skills 
or experience specifically required. 
The maximum level of variable pay (as expressed as a multiple of base 
salary) which may be awarded to new Executive Directors in respect 
of their appointment shall be no more generous than the combined 
maximum limits expressed in the Remuneration policy table above in 
respect of the Chief Executive, with an appropriate mix between annual 
bonus and LTIP opportunity, excluding any awards made to compensate 
the Executive Director for awards forfeited by their previous employer. 
It may be necessary to compensate the new Executive Director  
for variable pay being forfeited from their current employer.  
The Committee’s intention is that any such award would be no  
more generous than the awards being forfeited and would be 
determined on a comparable basis at the time of grant, including 
the pay out schedule and performance conditions, where appropriate. 
In determining whether it is appropriate to use such judgment, the 
Committee will ensure that any awards made are in the best interests 
of both the Company and its shareholders. The Committee is at all times 
conscious of the need to pay no more than is necessary, particularly 
when determining buy-out arrangements.
For an internal appointment of a new Executive Director, any existing 
awards made prior to becoming a Director would be allowed to vest 
and pay out in accordance with the existing plan rules.
In the event of the appointment of a new non-executive Director, 
remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with those detailed 
in the relevant table above.
Service contracts
The main terms of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who served in the year were as follows:
Provision Policy
Notice period   12 months’ notice if given by the Company
  6 months’ notice if given by the Executive Director
  Company policy is that Executive Directors’ notice periods should not normally exceed one year.  
Save for these notice periods the contracts have no unexpired terms.
Dates of contracts   Mr S A Borrows – 17 May 2012
  Mrs J S Wilson – 1 October 2008
T ermination payments   Mr Borrows’ contract entitles the Company to terminate employment without notice subject to making 
12 monthly payments thereafter equivalent to monthly basic pay and benefits less any amounts earned 
from alternative employment.
  All Directors’ contracts entitle the Company to give pay in lieu of notice.
Remuneration and benefits   The operation of all incentive plans, including being eligible to be considered for an annual bonus and 
Long-term Incentive Plan awards, is non-contractual.
  On termination of employment outstanding awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant 
plan rules.
The Chairman and the non-executive Directors do not have service contracts or contracts for services. Their appointment letters provide for 
no entitlement to compensation or other benefits on ceasing to be a Director. Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
headquarters in business hours.

Payment for loss of office
As outlined above, the Committee must satisfy any contractual 
obligations agreed with the Executive Directors. Details of the Directors’ 
notice periods are shown alongside the service contract information. 
An Executive Director may be eligible to receive a time pro-rated annual 
bonus in respect of the year up until he or she ceased employment.  
In determining whether to award any bonus, the Committee will assess 
performance during the financial year up to the date of cessation of 
active involvement in their management role. 
The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant 
share plan rules. The following table and the note below it summarise 
the leaver categories and the impact on the share awards which 
employees (including Executive Directors) may hold.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee reserves the right to 
make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above, 
where the terms of that payment were agreed (i) before the policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was 
not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the 
Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award 
or option over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the 
time the award is granted.

Committee to reduce awards in exceptional circumstances to Good Leavers or permit vesting (in whole or in part) of awards which would otherwise lapse to Bad Leavers. 
The Committee will report on the use of this discretion if it is exercised in relation to any Executive Director. 94

The assumptions made in preparing these graphs are that:
  Minimum – this includes only the fixed elements of pay, being base 
salary, benefits and pension;
  Actual – this represents the remuneration received by each Executive 
Director for their performance in the year;
  Maximum – this is calculated as the fixed elements and the maximum 
Annual Bonus and Long-term Incentive Plan awards; and
  Remuneration arising as a result of share price movements or rights 
to dividends and other distributions have been excluded.
Consideration of wider 
employee pay
As part of the annual Committee agenda, the Committee reviews the 
overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the Group. This ensures 
that the pay and conditions in the wider Group are taken into account 
when determining directors’ pay. In particular:
  Salary increases awarded over time to other employees are taken 
into account when considering salary increases for the Executive 
Directors; and
  The bonus awards made to Directors are considered and made in 
the context of discretionary bonus awards made within the business. 
These are based upon Company performance, and are closely 
correlated to the Executive Director bonus awards.
The Company does not consult with employees when preparing the 
Executive Director remuneration policy. However, a number of our 
employees are shareholders and so are able to express their views 
in the same way as other shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views
As part of the shareholder consultation process during 2012/13, the 
Company proposed moving the payment date for awards under the 
Long-term Incentive Plan to three years and six months following the 
date of award. The Committee received and considered feedback from 
shareholders on this point, and decided to retain the existing framework 
under which the awards have a performance period of three years and 
then are released in tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary 
of the date of grant. 
The Committee will continue to be mindful of shareholder views when 
evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and commits 
to consulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes to 
remuneration policy.

1 Benefits include a car allowance, provision of health insurance and, for Mrs Wilson, the value of the Share Incentive Plan matching share awards. 
2  Pension for Mr Borrows is a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions, and the pension value for Mrs Wilson is the combination of the value of the Company 
contributions made to the 3i Retirement Plan on her behalf and the salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions from March 2014.
3  Annual bonus awards made in respect of the current year are delivered as 60% cash immediately, and 40% payable in shares deferred for four years, subject  
to the malus/clawback policy. These shares are released in four equal annual instalments over the four years commencing June 2015 and carry the right to 
receive dividends and other distributions.
4  In addition to the table above, dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested deferred share awards were paid during the year (Mr Borrows £55k, Mrs Wilson £13k). 
5  The value shown in the LTIP (no performance condition) for Mr Borrows represents the award made in 2011 on joining the Company in recognition of awards 
forfeited on leaving his previous employment. The award value represents 171,087 shares vesting at a market price of 353.75 pence.
6 The fees shown for the non-executive Directors include fees used to purchase shares in the Company.
7  In addition to the fees shown above, Mr Borrows retained directors’ fees of £71k from The British Land Company PLC and £74k from Inchcape plc, and Mrs Wilson 
retained directors’ fees of £99k from Legal and General Group plc. 96

FY20 1 4 Annual bonus
The annual bonuses for Executive Directors for the year were awarded against a balanced scorecard agreed by the Committee in March 2013, 
based upon the strategic priorities announced in June 2012. The Committee uses the scorecard as a prompt and guide to judgment and considers 
the performance outcomes in the wider context of personal performance (including values and behaviours) risk, market and other factors. 
Performance against the strategic priorities set out in the 2013 Annual report and accounts was as follows: 
Strategic priority Priority for 201 3/ 1 4 Result

Over achieved
The Committee also took into account performance against the non-financial targets listed below, concluding that the Executive Directors have met or 
exceeded the Board’s expectations in each case:
  Maintain good engagement with investors and the quality of the Group’s shareholder register 
  Rearticulate the people strategy of the Group  
  Develop the strategic vision for the Group to the satisfaction of the Board 
  Continue the transformation of the Group’s culture 
As a result of these achievements, taking all of the above into consideration in the round, the Committee awarded Mr Borrows a bonus for the year 
of 370% of base salary (being 92.5% of his maximum bonus opportunity), and a bonus for the year to Mrs Wilson of 187 .5% of base salary (being 75% 
of her maximum bonus opportunity).

Details of share awards granted in the year
LTIP
Performance share awards were granted to the two Executive Directors during the year as shown in the table below.
Description of award A performance share based award, which releases shares, subject to satisfying the performance conditions, 
50% on the third anniversary of grant and 25% on the fourth and fifth anniversaries. 
Face value Chief Executive – 400% of salary, being 6 13,325 shares. 
Group Finance Director – 250% of salary, being 278,784 shares.
The share price used to make the award was the average mid-market closing price over the five working days 
starting with the day of the announcement of the 2013 annual results (358.7p).
Performance period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2016.
Performance targets 50% of the award is based on absolute TSR measured over the performance period, and vests:
  0% vesting below 10% pa TSR;
  20% vesting at 10% pa TSR;
  Straight-line vesting between 10% and 18% pa TSR; and
  100% vesting at 18% pa TSR.
50% of the award is based on achieving strategic targets that align costs with income and improving capital 
allocation, with:
  Half of this is based on progress achieved covering the Group’s operating costs with annual cash income; and
  Half of this is based on progress achieved in reducing remuneration costs relative to fee income.
20% of this portion of the award will vest for threshold performance. The Committee will assess performance 
against the strategic targets at the end of the performance period, and will use its judgment to determine vesting 
levels against an agreed framework.
The targets set for the strategic measures are commercially sensitive and are therefore not being disclosed in advance. 
At the end of the performance period and subject to commercial constraints, we commit to providing shareholders with 
as much context as possible on the framework used to assess performance against these targets and the rationale for 
the resulting vesting levels.
Remuneration  
Committee discretion
The Committee can reduce any award which would otherwise vest if gross debt or gearing targets are missed.
As part of the review of Executive Director remuneration policy during FY2013, the Company proposed moving the payment date for awards under the 
Long-term Incentive Plan to three years and six months following the date of award. Awards were granted on this basis in June 2013, prior to the AGM.
However, the Committee received and considered feedback from shareholders on this point, and decided to revert to the previous framework under 
which the awards have a performance period of three years and then are released in tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the date 
of grant. 
The Executive Directors voluntarily agreed to the terms of the 2013 award already made to them being adjusted to reflect this. In return, the 
Committee agreed that if the individual ceased employment following the third anniversary of the date of grant the award would not be pro-rated 
for time.

Share Incentive Plan
During the year Mrs Wilson participated in the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan which during the year allowed employees to invest up to 
£125 per month from pre-tax salary in ordinary shares (“partnership shares”). For each partnership share, the Company grants two free ordinary 
shares (“matching shares”) which are normally forfeited if employment ceases within three years of grant. Dividends are reinvested in further 
ordinary shares (“dividend shares”).
During the year Mrs Wilson purchased 408 partnership shares, and received 816 matching shares and 327 dividend shares at prices ranging 
between £3.296 and £4.144 per share, with an average price of £3.693. 
Pension arrangements
Mr Borrows receives a salary supplement of 12% of pensionable salary in lieu of pension (£15k in FY2014).
Mrs Wilson is a member of the 3i Retirement Plan, a defined contribution stakeholder pension scheme, which she joined with effect from 6 April 201 1. 
During the year, the Company made contributions of £48k to this plan and paid a salary supplement of £4k in respect of Mrs Wilson.
Mrs Wilson was also a member of the 3i Group Pension Plan, a defined benefit contributory scheme, in the year to 31 March 2014. Pension accrual 
ceased for all members with effect from 5 April 201 1, although a link to final pensionable salary is maintained for existing accrual up to the date 
of leaving the Company. Further details of the Plan are set out in Note 8 to the financial statements on pages 121 to 124.

Payments to past Directors
Mr Queen ceased his employment with the Group on 16 May 2012 and retained interests in two carried interest arrangements relating to his previous 
roles within the Group as Managing Partner, Infrastructure and Managing Partner, Growth Capital as previously disclosed. During the year he received 
carried interest payments of £176,709 (Primary Infrastructure 2005-06) and £13,288 (Pan European Growth Capital 2005-06). He did not receive any 
payments other than these carried interest payments.
Payments for loss of office

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Company’s share ownership and retention policy requires Executive Directors to build up over time, and thereafter maintain, a shareholding 
in the Company’s shares equivalent to at least 3.0 times gross salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 1.5 times gross salary for the Group 
Finance Director. In addition, shareholding targets have been introduced for other members of Executive Committee at the 1.5 times gross salary 
level and for partners in the Group’s businesses at 1.0 times gross salary. 
Details of Directors’ interests in the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2014 are shown below. The share price on 31 March 2014 was £3.979.

Statement of implementation 
of the remuneration policy 
in the coming year
A Group-wide 3% increase to salaries will take place in 2014, which will 
also be applied to Executive Director salaries. No changes to benefits, 
pension arrangements or maximum levels of annual bonus or LTIP 
awards for Executive Directors have been made for the current year. 
As part of the consultation with some of our key shareholders after the 
2013 AGM, we are increasing the level of deferral of any future annual 
bonus award made to Executive Directors to 50%. This will also apply 
to all members of the Executive Committee.
The relevant performance targets for the annual bonus and long-term 
incentive awards being granted in respect of the financial year to 
31 March 2015 are shown below.
Annual bonus scorecard
The annual bonuses for Executive Directors for FY2015 will be 
awarded against a balanced scorecard agreed by the Committee 
early in the financial year. The Committee will use the scorecard 
as a prompt and guide to judgment. 
The annual bonus scorecard for FY2015 will be based on portfolio 
returns, investment, operating profit and objectives relating to strategy, 
investor relations and culture. The Committee will also consider 
performance outcomes in the wider context of personal performance 
(including values and behaviours), risk, market and other factors.
The Committee considers that the targets set for the performance 
measures are commercially sensitive and as permitted by the 
Regulations, are therefore not being disclosed in advance. We will  
report to shareholders next year on performance against these 
targets and the resulting bonus outturns.
Long-term incentive targets
50% of the award is based on absolute TSR measured over the 
performance period, and vests:
  0% vesting below 10% pa TSR;
  20% vesting at 10% pa TSR;
  Straight-line vesting between 10% and 18% pa TSR; and
  100% vesting at 18% pa TSR.
50% of the award is based on relative TSR measured against 
the FTSE 250 Index over the performance period, and vests:
  0% for below median performance against the index;
  25% for median performance against the index;
  100% for upper quartile performance against the index; and
  Straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance.
Non-executive Director fees
The table below shows the non-executive Director fee structure  
as at 1 April 2014:
Chairman fee: £265,000 plus £30,000 of 3i shares
Non-executive Directors:
  Board membership fee
  Senior Independent Director fee
£50,000 plus 2,500 3i shares
£10,000
Committee fees:
  Chairman
  Member
£20,000

The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s  
website.
During the year, the Committee received external, independent advice 
from Kepler Associates (until September 2013) and Deloitte LLP 
(from October 2013).
The Committee decided to conduct a review of advisers during the year. 
The decision to appoint Deloitte as advisers with effect from  
October 2013 was led by the Committee Chairman in consultation  
with all other Committee members. Four potential advisers were 
interviewed and assessed against a range of requirements that were  
set by the Committee.
Both Kepler Associates and Deloitte are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operate under the code 
of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. 
Kepler Associates did not provide any services to the Group during 
the year other than to the Remuneration Committee. During the year, 
Deloitte LLP also provided 3i with certain tax advisory services. 
The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by both firms during 
the year and is satisfied that it has been objective and independent. 
The total fees for advice during the year were £87 ,695 (excluding VAT), 
of which £13,695 was paid to Kepler Associates and £74,000 to Deloitte.
The Chief Executive, the General Counsel, Company Secretary, 
Head of HR and the Remuneration Director attend Committee 
meetings by invitation, other than when their personal remuneration 
is being discussed.

Financial statements
3i Group plc (the “Company”) is a company registered in England and Wales. The Consolidated financial statements for the year to 31 March 2014 
comprise the Financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). Separate financial 
statements of the Company are also presented.
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group except where separately disclosed. 
A number of key accounting policies are disclosed below, but where possible, accounting policies have been shown as part of the Note that they 
specifically relate to in order to assist in understanding. 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 14 May 2014.
A Statement of compliance
These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, 
International Accounting Standards and their interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted 
for use in the European Union (“IFRS”) and in accordance and compliance with the Companies Act 2006.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The IASB has issued the following standards and interpretations to be applied to financial statements with periods commencing on or after the 
following dates:
Effective for period beginning on or after
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018
IAS 32 Amendment to offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014
IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for non financial assets – amendments to IAS 36 1 January 2014
IAS 39 Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting – amendments to IAS 39 1 January 2014
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements in the 
period of initial application and have decided not to adopt early.
The Group has applied IFRS 10 in line with the guidance given at the IFRIC meeting in January 2014 and supported by the IASB in March 2014.
Impact of the application of IFRS 1 0, 1 1 , 1 2 and 1 3, and IAS 1 9 
The Group applied, for the first time, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements and IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
(Revised 201 1) that require restatement of previous financial statements. Further, the application of IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement resulted in additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. 
The nature and the impact of each new standard and amendment are described below.
IFRS 1 0 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements
Under IFRS 10 a large number of entities within the Group have been classified as investment entities. As a result they are no longer consolidated 
and are instead held at fair value.
Impact on statement of comprehensive income
As a result of this change in treatment the total return generated by the investment entities is no longer presented on a line-by-line basis but 
combined and shown as a new line in the Statement of comprehensive income – “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries”. 
This has resulted in a restatement of prior year figures where previously consolidated line items are now aggregated into this line. 
The impact of this change by line item is: 
Realised profits over value on the disposal of investments (£(140) million); Unrealised profits on the revaluation of investments (£(94) million); 
Dividends (£(13) million); Income from loans and receivables (£(35)million); Fees receivable from external funds (£(27) million); Operating expenses 
(£23 million); Interest receivable (£(1) million); Carried interest receivable from external funds (£2 million); Carried interest and performance fees 
payable (£2 million); Income taxes (£3 million); Exchange movements (£(102) million); Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries 
(£491 million); and Income/(expense) from fair value subsidiaries (£(109) million). There is no overall change to total return.
The above amounts do not agree to the reconciliation on page 54 as differences are also caused by the reclassification of the Credit Opportunities 
Fund and the impact of IAS 19R.
Significant accounting policies 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Financial statements 109
Translation of investment entity subsidiaries which are non-sterling denominated will no longer be shown as part of other comprehensive income 
“Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations” and will now be included as part of the fair value movement on investment entity 
subsidiaries held at fair value. Consequently these translation amounts will no longer be shown as a movement in the translation reserve and it 
will become a movement in capital reserves. IFRS 10 has been retrospectively applied as if IFRS 10 was in effect from 1 April 2012. The translation 
reserve has been restated to reflect the impact of IFRS 10 for the year to 31 March 2012 by £157 million and for the year to 31 March 2013 
by £338 million with corresponding movements in capital reserves. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share of the Group have been restated as a result of adopting IFRS 10.
Impact on statement of financial position
The closing fair value of the net assets of the investment entities is now combined and stated in a new line “Investments in investment entities”. 
This has resulted in a restatement of prior year figures where previously consolidated line items are now aggregated into this line. 
The impact of this change by line item is: 
Quoted investments (£(188) million); Unquoted investments (£(1,427) million); Carried interest receivable (£(10) million); Intangible assets (£(22) million); 
Other current assets (£(20) million); Cash and cash equivalents (£(46) million); Trade and other payables (£50 million); Carried interest and 
performance fees payable (£30 million); Current income taxes (£2 million); Provisions (£1 million); and Investment in investment entities 
(£1,630 million). 
Cash balances held in investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the “Investments in investment entities” line and not consolidated. 
Intercompany balances between investment entity subsidiaries and consolidated Group entities which would have previously been eliminated on 
consolidation are no longer eliminated. There is no change to the net assets presented as a result of the adoption of IFRS 10, albeit that gross assets 
and gross liabilities have changed as a result of the changes to cash and intercompany balances. An opening balance sheet has also been provided 
this year to show the effect on the opening balances of the prior year.
Impact on cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is impacted by the adoption of IFRS 10 because the cash held by investment entity subsidiaries is no longer consolidated. 
It now forms part of the fair value of the investment entity subsidiary. Additionally, the cash flow statement now includes a new line to disclose the 
cash movements to and from investment entities, “Cash inflow/(outflow) from fair value subsidiaries”. This has resulted in a restatement of prior year 
figures where previously consolidated line items are now aggregated and disclosed in these lines. 
The impact of this change on cash and cash equivalents at 31 March 2013 is a reduction of £46 million and the change by line item is: Purchase  
of investments (£67 million); Proceeds from investments (£(253) million); Portfolio interest received (£(10) million); Portfolio dividends received  
(£(21) million); Fees received from external funds (£(28) million); Carried interest and performance fees paid (£8 million); Operating expenses 
(£36 million); Income taxes paid (£3 million); Acquisition of management contracts and other Debt Management business development (£10 million); 
Investment/Divestment into fair value subsidiaries (£197 million); and Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year (£(78) million).
The above amounts do not agree to the reconciliation on page 57 as differences are also caused by the reclassification of the Credit Opportunities 
Fund and the impact of IAS 19R.
IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements
The application of IFRS 1 1 had no material effect on the accounts of the Company or Group for the periods presented.
IFRS 1 2 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured 
entities. The requirements in IFRS 12 are more comprehensive than the previously existing disclosure requirements and include additional 
disclosures for unconsolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated structured entities. IFRS 12 disclosures and descriptions in relation to unconsolidated 
subsidiaries are provided in Notes 14 and 34 and structured entities impacted are provided in Note 32.
IFRS 1 3 F air Value Measurement
The Group has adopted IFRS 13 which relates to the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. In the current year, the methodology for 
calculating the fair value of its investment portfolio has been amended in respect of the loans, bonds and fixed income shares held in the investment 
portfolio. The Group will now value such instruments at fair value through profit and loss, rather than at amortised cost less impairment. This has 
no impact on the carrying value in the balance sheet. IFRS 13 requires more comprehensive disclosures around the sensitivities of Level 3 Inputs that 
are not based on observable market data. The relevant additional disclosures are provided in Note 13.
IAS 1 9 Employee Benefits
A description of the impact on the financial statements is included in Note 8 to the financial statements. 110

Financial statements
Significant accounting policies
B Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m) except 
where otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Assessment as investment entity
Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to account for most investments in controlled entities, as well 
as investments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through profit and loss. Subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage 
in permitted investment related activities with investees continue to be consolidated unless they are also investment entities. The criteria which 
define an investment entity are currently as follows:
  An entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment services;
  An entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income  
or both; and
  An entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
The Group’s annual and interim accounts clearly state its objective of investing directly into portfolio investments and providing investment 
management services to investors for the purpose of generating returns in the form of investment income and capital appreciation. The Group has 
always reported its investment in portfolio investments at fair value. It also produces reports for investors of the funds it manages and its internal 
management report on a fair value basis. The exit strategy for all investments held by the Group is assessed, initially, at the time of the first 
investment and this is documented in the investment paper submitted to the Investment Committee for approval. Subsequently it is then reviewed 
at least twice a year during semi annual portfolio review meetings.
The Board has also concluded that the Company meets the additional characteristics of an investment entity, in that it has more than one investment; 
the investments are predominantly in the form of equities and similar securities; it has more than one investor and its investors are not related 
parties. The Board has concluded that the Company therefore meets the definition of an investment entity. These conclusions will be reassessed 
on an annual basis for changes in any of these criteria or characteristics.
Application and significant judgments
A number of entities which the Group previously consolidated will now be recognised at fair value. The majority of the Group’s portfolio is held 
through intermediate holding entities which are now fair valued at the entity level as opposed to consolidating the intermediate holding entities and 
fair valuing the underlying portfolio. In addition, the Group is deemed to control a limited partnership, an entity in which it holds 46% of the equity. 
Consequently this is also fair valued at the entity level with the proportion of value attributable to 3i’s equity stake recognised. In coming to these 
conclusions a full consideration of the Group’s ownership, other shareholder dispersion, the Group’s role as agent or principal and other factors that 
lead to “control” have been considered. 
The most significant estimates relate to the fair valuation of the investment portfolio, the fair valuation of each investment entity subsidiary and the 
IAS 19 valuation of the defined benefit scheme. The valuation methodology for the investment portfolio is disclosed in Note 13 and details of the 
valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme is shown in Note 8. As a result of IFRS 10, we are required to fair value each investment entity 
subsidiary and have assessed this to be equal to the net asset value of the investment entity subsidiary at the balance sheet date with the exception 
of one entity which we value on a sum of parts basis. All investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for using accounting policies that are consistent 
with the Group’s, and the primary constituent of net asset value across investment entity subsidiaries is portfolio investment. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
The Statement of comprehensive income of the Company has been omitted from these financial statements in accordance with section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied across all Group entities for the purposes of producing these consolidated 
financial statements. 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4

C Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control, as defined by IFRS 10, is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group 
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
  Power over the investee (ie existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
  The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances 
in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
  Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
  The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the 
elements of control. 
3i Group plc, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is an investment entity and, as such, does not consolidate the investment entities it controls. 
Most of the Group’s interests in subsidiaries are recognised as fair value through profit or loss, and measured at fair value. This represents a change 
in accounting policy in the current year, more details of which are provided in Notes 14, 15 and 32. Those subsidiaries which provide investment 
related services, such as advisory, management or employment services are not classified at fair value through profit and loss and continue to 
be consolidated unless they additionally make investments, in which case they are fair valued. 
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments that 
are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value even though the Group may have 
significant influence over those companies. 
(iii) Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures that are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. 
(iv) Composition of the Group
The Group is made up of several different types of subsidiaries. The Group re-assesses the function performed by each type of subsidiary to 
determine its treatment under the IFRS 10 exemption from consolidation. The types of subsidiaries and their treatment under IFRS 10 are as follows:
General Partners (GPs) – Consolidated
  General Partners provide investment management services and do not hold any direct investments in portfolio assets. These entities are not 
investment entities. 
Investment managers/ advisers – Consolidated
  These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice. They do not hold any direct 
investments in portfolio assets. These entities are not investment entities. 
Investment managers/ advisers which also hold investments – F air valued
  These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice and also hold investments in assets 
held for capital appreciation. These entities are classified as investment entities and therefore are held at fair value. 
Holding companies of investment managers/ advisers – Consolidated
  These entities provide investment related services through their subsidiaries. They do not hold any direct investment in portfolio assets and these 
entities are not investment entities.  112
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Financial statements
Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures – F air valued 
  The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through its ultimate parent company as well as through other limited partnership and corporate 
subsidiaries which the Group has created to align the interests of the investment teams with the performance of the assets through the use 
of various carried interest schemes. The purpose of these limited partnerships and corporate holding vehicles, many of which also provide 
investment related services, is to invest for investment income and capital appreciation. These partnerships meet the definition of an investment 
entity and are classified at fair value through the profit and loss.
Portfolio investments – F air valued
  Following the introduction of IFRS 10, the test for accounting subsidiaries has been altered to take wider factors of control as well as actual equity 
ownership into account. This has resulted in 36 investments being classified as accounting subsidiaries. In accordance with the investment entity 
exception, these entities have been held at fair value with movements in fair value going through the profit and loss account. Further details can be 
found in Note 13. With one exception (Palace Street I) none of these subsidiaries are a UK Companies Act subsidiary.
Structured entities – F air valued
  The Group has interests in a number of unconsolidated structured entities, their current carrying value and a description of their activities 
is included in Note 32. 
D Income 
Gross investment return is equivalent to “revenue” for the purposes of IAS 1. It represents the overall increase in net assets from the investment 
portfolio net of deal-related costs and includes foreign exchange movements in respect of the investment portfolio. Investment income is analysed 
into the following components:
(a)  Realised profits or losses over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration received less 
any directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity and the repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value at the start of the 
accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of disposal.
(b)  Unrealised profits or losses on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the carrying value of investments between the start and 
end of the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of the movement.
(c)  Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries are the movement in the carrying value of group subsidiaries which are classified as 
investment entities under IFRS 10. The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through these entities which are usually limited partnerships 
or corporate subsidiaries. 
(d)  Portfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments. It is recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must 
be met before the income is recognised:
  Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income when the shareholders’ rights to receive 
payment have been established.
  Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset’s 
carrying value. When the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of a loan the Group recognises a provision 
against any interest accrued from the date of the assessment going forward until the investment is assessed to have recovered in value.
  Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is first made and through the life of the investment. Fees that 
are earned on a financing arrangement are considered to relate to a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and are 
recognised when that investment is made. Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to the investee company are 
recognised as that service is provided.
(e)  Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made in currencies that are different from the functional currency of the Group entity. 
Investments are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each subsequent reporting date investments are 
translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Significant accounting policies 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Financial statements 113
E Exchange differences
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of the Group entity entering into the transaction are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated 
to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling using exchange rates ruling at the date 
the fair value was determined.
(ii) Financial statements of non-sterling operations
The assets and liabilities of operations whose functional currency is not sterling, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated to sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of these operations are translated to sterling 
at rates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated within a separate component of equity, the Translation reserve, and are released upon disposal 
of the non-sterling operation.
In respect of non-sterling operations, cumulative translation differences on the consolidation of non-sterling operations are being accumulated 
from the date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2004, and not from the original acquisition date.
F T reasury assets and liabilities 
Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash flows and overall costs of borrowing. 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. De-recognition occurs when rights to cash flows from a financial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits as defined above 
and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, net 
of bank overdrafts.
(ii) Deposits
Deposits in the balance sheet comprise longer-term deposits with an original maturity of greater than three months. 114

1 Segmental analysis
Operating segments are the components of the entity whose results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief-operating-decision-maker to make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. The chief-operating-decision-maker for the Group is considered 
to be the Chief Executive. The Group considers the businesses’ activity on two bases. Firstly, as business divisions determined with reference to market 
focus, geographic focus, investment funding model and the Group’s management hierarchy. Secondly, in line with the strategy of the Group, it considers 
separate Proprietary Capital and Fund Management businesses focused on investment returns and Fund Management profits respectively.
The performance of the business divisions is primarily assessed based on Gross Investment Return. 
The Proprietary Capital segment is assessed based on Operating profit before carry which comprises Gross Investment Return, direct costs and 
a synthetic fee paid to the fund manager and funding expenses. 
The Fund Management segment is assessed based on Operating profit before carry which comprises fees receivable from external funds and 
a synthetic fee paid from the Proprietary Capital segment offset by operating expenses of the investment teams.
In line with IFRS 8, the tables below are presented on the Investment basis which is the basis used by the chief-operating-decision-maker to monitor 
the performance of the Group. A description of the Investment basis is provided on page 53 and a reconciliation of the Investment basis to the IFRS 
financial statements is provided on pages 54 to 57 .

These services are services that could be provided by a number of firms and include general consultancy work. Work is allocated to the auditors only 
if it does not impact the independence of the audit firm.
In addition to the above, Ernst & Young LLP has received fees from investee companies. It is estimated that Ernst & Young LLP receive less than 20% 
of the total investment-related fees paid to the four largest accounting firms.
Ernst & Young LLP also acts as auditor to the 3i Group Pension Plan. The appointment of the auditors to this Plan and the fees paid in respect of the 
audit are agreed by the trustees who act independently from the management of the Group. The aggregate fees paid to the Group’s auditors for audit 
services to the pension scheme during the year were less than £0.1 million (2013: less than £0.1 million).

7 Share-based payments
Accounting policy: 
The costs of share-based payments made by the Company in respect of subsidiaries’ employees are treated as additional investments in 
those subsidiaries.
The Group has equity-settled and cash settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees. Equity settled schemes are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc. The charge is 
adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the period. The movement in 
cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the vesting 
period. They are fair valued at each reporting date. The cost of cash settled share-based payment transactions are adjusted for the forfeitures 
of the participants rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments. The cost of the share-
based payments is allocated either to operating expenses (bonuses) or carried interest depending on the original driver of the award. Executive 
Director Long Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.
The total cost recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is shown below:

7 Share-based payments (continued)
The features of the Group’s share schemes are set out on pages 87 to 102. For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may 
be granted “phantom awards” under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the 
participant to acquire shares. The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2014 is £4 million  
(2013: £2 million). The intrinsic value of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions which have vested by 31 March 2014 is £nil 
(2013: £nil).
The following information shows details of the share-based payment awards made during the year.

Share options
At 31 March 2014 there were 3.7 million outstanding options for the Performance share awards (non-market condition). Due to a significant loss 
on return in the first year, the minimum vesting hurdle of a 10% Group return on opening equity over three years is not expected to be achieved. 
Share awards
Details of share awards outstanding during the year are as follows:
2014 2013
Outstanding at the start of the year 13,773,834 16,698,893
Granted 6,058,327 2,746,884
Exercised (1,503,366) (171,087)
Lapsed (874,032) (5,500,856)
Outstanding at the end of year 17,454,763 13,773,834
The awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average contractual life of 4.74 years (2013: 6.95 years). The cost of share awards 
is spread over the vesting period of two to four years.
A summary of the vesting conditions of share awards is as follows:
Performance share awards (market condition)
The performance condition for Performance shares issued before July 201 1 is based on the outperformance of the theoretical growth in value 
of a shareholding in the Company (with dividends reinvested) for the three-year performance period from grant (averaged over a 60-day period) 
compared to the growth in value of the FTSE 100 Index (with dividends reinvested) adjusted for mergers, demergers and de-listings over that period.
Performance share awards (non market condition)
Performance shares issued after June 201 1 will vest, subject to a vesting scale, if the annualised growth of the Group’s return on opening equity 
during the three-year performance period equals or exceeds 10% per annum.
Performance-based awards
Performance-based share awards are made to certain investment executives. These plans operate in a similar format to a carry scheme where 
a percentage of shares will vest once a realised profit hurdle has been achieved on a defined group of assets.
Deferred bonus plan
Certain employees receive an element of their bonus as a conditional award of shares which vest either in equal tranches annually over three or four 
years or at the end of three years. The awards are not subject to a performance condition. The fair value of the deferred shares is the share price at 
the date of the award.
Notes to the financial statements 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Financial statements 121
Share Incentive Plan
Eligible UK employees may participate in a HM Revenue and Customs approved Share Incentive Plan intended to encourage employees to invest 
in the Company’s shares. Accordingly it is not subject to a performance condition. During the year participants invested up to £125 per month from 
their pre-tax salaries in the Company’s shares (referred to as partnership shares). For each share so acquired the Company grants two free 
additional shares (referred to as matching shares) which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed (other than 
for certain permitted reasons) within three years of grant. From 6 April 2014 the limit has been increased to £150 per month.
Employee T rust
The Group has established the 3i Group Employee Trust which holds shares in 3i Group plc which can be used to meet its obligations under certain 
share schemes. The Trustee has full discretion as to the application of trust assets. However, in accordance with IFRS 10, 3i Group plc is considered 
the ultimate controlling party for accounting purposes and the operations of the 3i Group Employee Trust are consolidated by the Group.
8 Retirement benefits
Accounting policy:
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the Statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations 
being carried out at each balance sheet date. Interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset, calculated using the discount rate used to measure 
the defined benefit obligation, is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income. Re-measurement gains or losses are recognised in full 
as they arise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds 
the fair value of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the balance sheet where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations limited to the extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
Retirement benefit plans
(i) Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group. The assets of these 
plans are held separately from those of the Group. The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in France are members of a state managed retirement 
benefit plan operated by the country’s government. 3i Europe plc’s French branch is required to contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to 
the retirement benefit scheme to fund these benefits.
The total expense recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is £3 million (2013: £4 million), which represents the contributions payable 
to these plans. There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK (“the Plan”). The Plan is approved 
by HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, whose appointment is 
determined by the Plan’s documentation. The Plan is subject to UK funding regulations, which require the Group and the Trustees to agree a funding 
strategy and contribution schedule where necessary.
The Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006. The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits by members with 
effect from 5 April 201 1, although the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals. Members of the Plan have been invited to join the 
Group’s defined contribution plan with effect from 6 April 201 1. The defined benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent 
of the Company’s finances and are administered by the Trustees. The Trustees are responsible for managing and investing the Plan’s assets and for 
monitoring the Plan’s funding position. As the Plan is now closed to future accrual, measures have been taken to de-risk the Plan through changes 
to its investment policy. 
IAS 19 (Revised) became effective for accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2013, and as a result prior period financial statements have been 
restated to reflect the impact of the retrospective application of the standard. The main effect is that the expected returns on pension scheme assets 
and the interest cost on defined benefit obligations have been replaced by interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset, calculated using the 
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation. These amendments have been retrospectively applied and the prior period comparative 
figures restated accordingly. The result of this is a £4 million increase in interest payable and a £4 million increase in re-measurement gain included 
in other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 March 2013. The estimated effect on the current period figures is an increase in interest 
payable of £4 million and an increase in re-measurement gain of £4 million. 122

The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2014. This included an update 
to the membership data as part of the full triennial actuarial valuation (effective date 30 June 2013) that was completed in March 2014.
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service. 3i Deutschland GmbH and the German and Spanish 
branches of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for their employees and have agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an 
employee’s investment policy should it arise. The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is £1 million 
(2013: £3 million) and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is £15 million (2013: £17 million). The amounts recognised in 
profit/loss for the year and other comprehensive income for these schemes are a £1 million expense (2013: £1 million expense) and a £1 million 
gain (2013: £3 million expense) respectively.

The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows:
2014 2013
Discount rate 4.5% 4.4%
Expected rate of salary increases 5.9% 5.8%
Expected rate of pension increases 3.5% 3.4%
Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation 3.4% 3.3%
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation 2.4% 2.6%
In addition, it is assumed that members exchange 25% of pension for lump sum at retirement on the conversion terms in place at the previous 
actuarial valuation with an allowance for the terms to increase in future. Following the completion of the full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2013, 
the latest conversion terms have been reflected in the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2014. The impact of allowing for the latest conversion 
terms has been to increase the defined benefit obligation by around £13 million.
The duration of the Plan’s defined benefit obligation at the accounting date was around 21 years. The financial assumptions adopted are appropriate 
for a pension scheme with the Plan’s maturity. 124
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4

8 Retirement benefits (continued)
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2014 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables allowing for 
improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% (31 March 2013: 80% of the 
PNA00 tables allowing for improvements from 2000 in line with the CMI 2009 core projections with a long-term annual rate of future improvement 
of 1.5%). The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2034 (2013: 2033) is projected to be 33.3 (2013: 33.2) years compared to 
31.0 (2013: 30.7) years for someone reaching 60 in 2014.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Decrease by 0. 1 % Increase by £9 million
Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation Increase by 0. 1 % Increase by £8 million
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by £1 1 million
The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes 
in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its defined benefit plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plan’s assets may reduce the value of the defined benefit surplus and could affect the future funding requirements. 
To reduce the volatility of the Plan’s assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy that reduces the Plan’s equity holdings 
by switching them to bonds over time. The Plan’s assets are also diversified across different asset classes.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plan’s IAS 19 defined benefit obligation. However, the Plan holds a proportion of its assets 
in corporate bonds and so any increase in the defined benefit obligation would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plan’s assets.
Inflation risk The Plan’s defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the Plan’s assets 
are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation could reduce or eliminate the defined 
benefit surplus.
Life expectancy The Plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the 
Plan’s defined benefit obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 201 1 the Group ceased to make regular contributions 
to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 was completed in March 2014. The results of that valuation showed that the plan had an 
actuarial surplus of £1 million at 30 June 2013 and as a result the Group is not required to make contributions to the Plan at this time. The contingent 
asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 31, remains in place. The next triennial actuarial funding 
valuation exercise will be based on the financial position as at 30 June 2016.

1 0 Movement in the fair value of derivatives
Accounting policy: 
Derivative financial instruments may be used to manage the risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations of the investment portfolio and 
changes in interest rates on its borrowings. In such circumstances this is achieved by the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate 
swaps. All derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently re-measured to the fair value at each 
reporting date. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts for contracts with 
similar maturity profiles. The valuation technique incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and interest rates as inputs, and uses 
present value calculations. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest and 
exchange rates. This represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date. 
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value of financial instruments 
are taken to the Statement of comprehensive income.

foreign exchange contracts. Also during the year, the only residual long-term interest rate swap was closed out.
1 1 Carried interest and performance fees payable
Accounting policy:
Carried interest receivable
The Group earns a share of profits (“carried interest receivable”) from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties. These profits are earned 
when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest receivable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets 
in that fund were realised at fair value. Fair value is determined using the Group’s valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date. 
An accrual is made equal to the Group’s share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash already returned 
to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management funds. 
Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable made once the performance 
conditions in the scheme have been met.
Carried interest payable
The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments. “Carried interest payable” 
is the term used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest schemes. 
Carried interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in 
that scheme were realised at fair value. An accrual is made equal to the executive’s share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place 
in the carried interest scheme, discounted to reflect the likely actual cash payment date, which may be materially later than the time of the accrual.
Under IFRS 10, where carry payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded through 
“Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries”. An additional £69 million of carry payable was recognised in these entities 
(2013: £(5) million reduction).

Notes to the financial statements
1 2 Income taxes
Accounting policy: 
Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax. Tax is charged or credited in the Statement 
of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. This may differ from the profit included in the Statement of comprehensive 
income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit (“temporary differences”), and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Where there are taxable differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax liabilities are recognised except where the Group is able to 
control reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. However, where there are deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that both the temporary differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill and other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised using tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Total income taxes in the Statement of comprehensive income (2) (3)
The Group’s realised profits, fair value adjustments and impairment losses are primarily included in the Company, the affairs of which are directed 
so as to allow it to be approved as an investment trust. An investment trust is exempt from tax on capital gains, therefore the Group’s capital return 
will be largely non-taxable.
Including £3 million of tax charges incurred in fair valued entities, the total tax charge for the Group was £5 million. Under the Investment basis 
presentation, of the £5 million total tax charge, £1 million has been recognised as a reduction of realised profits and £1 million as a reduction in value 
growth because these tax charges relate to two specific overseas investments.

At 31 March 2014 the Group had carried forward tax losses of £1,360 million (2013: £1,242 million), capital losses of £78 million (2013: £68 million) 
and other temporary differences of £12 million (2013: £8 million). It is unlikely that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable 
future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these. Deferred income taxes are calculated 
using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20% (2013: 23%). 128

Notes to the financial statements
1 3 Investment portfolio
Accounting policy: 
Investments are recognised and de-recognised on the date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require 
the delivery or settlement of the investment. The Group manages its investments with a view to profiting from the receipt of investment income 
and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of equity investments.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value 
is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the 
balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is measured using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines (IPEV), details 
of which are available in “Portfolio valuation – an explanation” on pages 156 to 158.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair 
value on a different basis, applying 3i Group’s valuation policies. 
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the principal loan 
balance. The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year. If the fair value of an investment is 
assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a provision against any interest income accrued from the date of the 
assessment going forward. “Capitalisation at nil value” is the term used to describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully 
provided for. These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost with an equal reduction in portfolio value.
As a result of the early adoption of IFRS 10, and the exemption from consolidation, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Group’s 
unconsolidated subsidiaries is now presented as part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets 
and liabilities. A reconciliation of the fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 14.

The holding period of 3i’s investment portfolio is on average greater than one year. For this reason the portfolio is classified as non-current. It is not 
possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions include £98 million (2013: £47 million) in interest received by way of loan notes, of which £60 million (2013: £33 million) has been written 
down in the year to nil. Included within the Statement of comprehensive income is £29 million (2013: £19 million) of interest income, which reflects 
the net additions after write downs noted above, £6 million (2013: £5 million) of cash income and the capitalisation of prior year accrued income 
and non-capitalised accrued income £(15) million (2013: £nil).
Other movements include foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another. 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4

F air value hierarchy
The Group classifies financial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy:
Level Fair value input description Financial instruments
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) from active markets Quoted equity instruments
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable 
either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices)
Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments and loan instruments
Unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation 
guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement. Further information regarding the valuation 
of unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments can be found in the section Portfolio valuation – an explanation.
The Group’s investment portfolio for equity instruments and debt instruments are classified by the fair value hierarchy as follows:

This disclosure only relates to the directly held investment portfolio. The fair value hierarchy also applies to derivative financial instruments,  
see Note 20 for further details, and to Investments in investment entities, see Note 14 for details.
Investments in investment entities are fair valued at the entity’s net asset value with the significant part being attributable to the underlying portfolio. 
The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments with any other assets or liabilities within investment 
entities fair valued in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 130

Unquoted investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the Statement of comprehensive income; realised profits over 
value on disposal of investment of £144 million (2013: £55 million), dividend income of £12 million (2013: £12 million) and foreign exchange losses 
of £46 million (2013: £17 million gain). The transfer of equity from Level 3 to Level 1 reflects the IPO of Quintiles on 14 May 2013. 
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation – an explanation section. 
A reasonable alternative assumption would be to apply a standard marketability discount of 5% for all assets rather than the specific approach 
adopted. This would have a positive impact on the directly held unquoted investment portfolio of £1 1 1 million (2013: £84 million) or 9% (2013: 6%).
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact of £19 million (2013: 
£43 million) or 1% (2013: 3%).

1 4 Investments in investment entities
Accounting policy: 
Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
These entities are typically Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Group’s interests 
in investments in portfolio companies (Investment Entity Holding Companies) and were consolidated prior to the adoption of IFRS 10. All cash 
flows to/from investment entities are treated as a reduction/increase in the fair value of the investment entity.

restrictions on the transfer of funds from these entities to the Group.
Support
3i Group plc provides ongoing support to its investment entity subsidiaries for the purchase of portfolio investments. During the year, the Group 
provided support to its unconsolidated subsidiaries, with a net cash flow as noted in the table above. The Group has no contractual commitments 
or current intentions to provide any other financial or other support to its unconsolidated subsidiaries.
1 5 Interests in Group and fair value entities
Accounting policy: 
The Company has controlling equity interests in, and makes loans to, both consolidated and fair valued Group entities. In the Company’s books

Accounting policy:
Vehicles and office equipment
Vehicles and office equipment are depreciated by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: office equipment five years; 
computer equipment three years; computer software three years; motor vehicles four years.
Assets held under finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful life on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the lease 
term. Assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged in the Statement of comprehensive income over the period of the agreement and 
represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Leasehold improvements
Leasehold improvements are depreciated by equal annual instalments, over the shorter of their estimated useful lives and the lease term. 
Assets are reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows. Any change in the level of impairment is recognised directly in the 
Statement of comprehensive income.

Financial statements 133 1 9 Financial risk management
Introduction
A review of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section. This Note provides further 
detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval process. 
The Group’s Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
For the Group, this Note has been prepared using figures from the Investment basis financial statements as this provides the user with a more 
comprehensive reflection of the financial risks of the Group and is consistent with how Management assess and manage risk. An explanation 
and reconciliation of the Investment basis to IFRS is shown in the Strategic report on pages 53 to 57 . 
For the Company, this Note has been prepared on an IFRS basis.
Capital structure
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, long-term borrowings and shareholders’ equity. The type 
and maturity of the Group’s borrowings are analysed further in Note 21. Capital is managed with the objective of maximising long-term return 
to shareholders, whilst maintaining a capital base to allow the Group to operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development 
of the business.

2 Includes derivative financial liabilities of £4 million for 2014 and £60 million in 2013. B shares of £6 million, in 2014 and 2013 are also included in this figure.
Capital constraints
The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each subsidiary with 
sufficient reserves to meet local statutory/regulatory obligations. No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been 
able to distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.
The Group’s regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by the FCA. 
The last submission to the FCA demonstrated a significant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FCA’s prudential rules. The Group’s capital 
requirement is updated regularly following approval of the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) report by the Board of 
3i Investments plc. The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the FCA and remains at a significant regulatory capital 
surplus. The Group’s Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found on www.3i.com.
Financial risks
Concentration risk
The Group’s exposure to and mitigation of concentration risk is explained within the “investment” and “treasury and funding” sections in the Risk 
section. Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in Note 1, Segmental analysis, and 
in the 25 large investments table on pages 154 and 155.
Credit risk
The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, derivatives cash and deposits. The Group’s cash and deposits are held with a variety 
of counterparties with circa 87% of the Group’s surplus cash held on demand in AAA Liquidity funds. The balance is held on short-term deposit 
with 3i’s relationship banks. The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the 
individual portfolio companies. For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and 
interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Group’s investment. Where the portfolio company has 
failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Group’s policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan. Loan impairments are 
made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Group’s loan investment. In these cases an appropriate 
loan impairment is recorded to reflect the valuation shortfall. In accordance with IFRS 7 , the amounts shown as past due represent the total credit 
exposure, not the amount actually past due.

Market risk
The valuation of the Group’s investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio 
but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations. 
The Group’s sensitivity to these items is set out below.
(i) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is primarily being managed through a reduction in gross debt as noted in the Risk section. The direct impact of a movement in 
interest rates is relatively small as the Group’s outstanding debt is fixed rate. An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet 
position over a 12 month period, would lead to an approximate increase in total comprehensive income of £8 million (2013: £21 million increase) 
for the Group and £6 million (2013: £22 million increase) for the Company. This increase arises principally from changes in interest receivable 
on cash and deposits. 
In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and valuation of portfolio 
companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
(ii) Currency risk
The Group’s net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and all other currencies combined is shown 
in the table below. This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group and Company’s net assets to movements in foreign 
currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling. 
The Group considers currency risk on specific investment and realisation transactions and has reduced hedging on a consolidated basis over time. 
Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided on page 49 in the Financial review section.

(iii) Price risk – market fluctuations
The Group’s management of price risk, which arises primarily from quoted and unquoted equity instruments, is through the careful consideration 
of the investment, asset management and realisation decisions at the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee’s role in risk management 
is discussed further in the Risk section. A 15% change in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on the Statement 
of comprehensive income:

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates. 
In the prior year the Group announced a change to its hedging strategy and continued to reduce its use of derivatives to hedge exchange movements 
on its US dollar and euro portfolio. At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was £1 12 million 
(2013: £481 million).
Interest rate swaps
The Group closed out its remaining interest rate derivative during the year. 
The Group does not trade in derivatives. In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures 
they are hedging. It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in Note 13, derivative financial instruments are measured using Level 2 inputs, as described 
in Note 10.
2 1 Loans and borrowings
Accounting policy: 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received. After initial recognition, these are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the 
expected life of the liabilities.

The Group is subject to a financial covenant on its committed multi-currency facilities, the Asset Cover Ratio, defined as total assets (including cash) 
divided by loans and borrowings plus derivative financial liabilities. The Asset Cover Ratio limit is 1.45 at 31 March 2014 (2013: 1.45), the Asset Cover 
Ratio at 31 March 2014 is 5.33 (2013: 4.00).
All of the Group’s borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates. None of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group. The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £942 million (2013: £1,087 million), determined 
with reference to their published market prices which are included within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Gross debt also includes the liabilities relating to the Group’s B shares and net liabilities relating to derivative financial instruments.
22 Provisions
Accounting policy: 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. The provisions are measured 
at the Directors’ best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value if the effect 
is material. Changes in provisions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income for the period.

The provision for redundancy relates to staff reductions announced prior to 31 March. More detail on the Group restructuring is discussed in the  
Chief Executive’s review on page 9. Most of the provision is expected to be utilised in the next year.
The Group has a number of leasehold properties whose rent and unavoidable costs exceed the economic benefits expected to be received. These 
costs arise over the period of the lease, and have been provided for to the extent they are not covered by income from subleases. The leases covered 
by the provision have a remaining term of up to 13 years.
23 T rade and other payables
Accounting policy:
Liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be payable 
in respect of goods or services received up to the balance sheet date.

Other contingent liabilities
The Company has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on amounts drawn down by 3i Holdings plc under the committed multi-currency 
facilities. At 31 March 2014, 3i Holdings plc had no drawings (2013: £164 million) under these facilities.
The Company has provided a guarantee to the Trustees of the 3i Group Pension Plan in respect of liabilities of 3i plc to the Plan. 3i plc is the sponsor  
of the 3i Group Pension Plan. On 4 April 2012 the Company transferred eligible assets (£150 million of ordinary shares in 3i Infrastructure plc 
as defined by the agreement) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The Company will retain all income and capital rights in relation to the  
3i Infrastructure plc shares, as eligible assets, unless the Company becomes insolvent or fails to comply with material obligations in relation to the 
agreement with the Trustees, all of which are under its control. The fair value of eligible assets at 31 March 2014 was £162 million (2013: £160 million).
3i has entered into warehouse arrangements in the US and Europe to support the creation of senior secured debt portfolios ahead of future CLO fund 
launches. Whilst in the warehouse phase, 3i is subject to optional margin calls in the event of market falls. The current capital at risk is restricted 
to the £17 million invested at 31 March 2014. 
3i Group plc has provided an indemnification against an existing personal guarantee by the management of Fraser Sullivan Investment Management 
on the lease of a New York office taken over by 3i DM US LLC, a subsidiary of 3i Corporation. The guarantee covers lost rental income the landlord 
would suffer if 3i DM US LLC reneged on its lease obligations.
The current lease runs to October 2014 and the maximum exposure that 3i Corporation could be exposed to is US$350,000.
At 31 March 2014, there was no material litigation outstanding against the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.

Unconsolidated structured entities
The application of IFRS 12 in the period required additional disclosure on the Group’s exposure to unconsolidated structured entities. 
The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines. These structured entities fall into four categories, namely CLO’s, debt management warehouses, 
closed end limited partnerships (Private Equity and Infrastructure funds) and investments in certain portfolio investments. 
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities and the maximum 
exposure to loss. 
CLO structured entities
The Group manages CLO vehicles as part of its Debt Management business. These funds predominantly invest in senior secured loans and are 
financed by investors seeking credit rated, structured, investment returns. 
The Group manages these funds, in return for a management fee. The Group also typically invests into the equity tranche of these funds. The Group’s 
attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and performance fees are accrued 
when relevant performance hurdles are met. 
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Group’s involvement with these entities are summarised below:

Warehouse structured entities
Ahead of future CLO fund launches, warehouse facilities are usually established to support the creation of senior secured debt portfolios. 
These entities are financed by the Group along with the bank appointed to operate the warehouse facility. The Group makes a commitment 
to the warehouse, typically taking the first loss position and is at risk for margin calls if the portfolio underperforms. The Group’s attributable 
stakes in these warehouses are held at fair value.

The Group earned income of £2 million during the year from warehouse structured entities. 
Closed end limited partnerships
The Group manages a number of closed end limited partnerships, which are primarily Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in return for a 
management fee. The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital appreciation. Limited 
Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, finance these entities by committing capital to them and cash is drawn down or distributed 
for financing investment activity. 
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried interest 
is accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met. 
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Group’s involvement with these entities are summarised below:

Investments that are structured entities
The Group makes investments on behalf of itself and third party funds that it manages, for capital appreciation purposes. In a small number of cases, 
these investments fall under the classification of a structured entity as they are funds managed by the General Partner under a limited partnership 
agreement.
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value.

Notes to the financial statements 33 Business combination 
On 8 November 2013 3i Holdings Plc, a wholly owned Group subsidiary, acquired 100% of the share capital of Barclays Infrastructure Funds 
Management Limited (“BIFML ”). The acquisition formed part of the Group’s strategy to build its Infrastructure business and to grow external AUM. 
At the time of the transaction, BIFML was managing c. £780 million of AUM, comprising two active funds. Both of the funds mainly invest in Private 
Public Partnerships, Private Finance Initiative projects and other infrastructure related projects with similar characteristics in the UK and Europe 
(“PPP”). BIFML has four fully owned subsidiaries that serve as General Partners for these and other funds within the structure. As a result of the 
acquisition, 22 employees joined the Group. 
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of BIFML have been further reviewed since the date of completion and the consideration 
paid was:

Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements The list opposite comprises the principal subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2014 all of which were wholly-owned, with the exception of 3i Debt 
Management Limited, which is 63% owned and is in turn the 100% owner of 3i Debt Management Investments Limited and 3i Debt Management US 
LLC which is 80% owned. The Group has entered into agreements to purchase the remaining 37% of the equity of 3i Debt Management Limited and 
20% of 3i Debt Management US LLC, currently owned by management, over the next four years. They are incorporated in Great Britain and registered 
in England and Wales unless otherwise stated.
The introduction of IFRS 10 has resulted in a reassessment of the accounting subsidiaries of the Group. IFRS 10 has reduced the requirements for 
an entity to be classified as an accounting subsidiary and deems wider control issues, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key determinant when 
identifying accounting subsidiaries. Under IFRS 10, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed an accounting 
subsidiary. This is counter to the UK Companies Act where voting rights are the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries, with 
a larger than 50% holding of voting rights resulting in an entity being classified as a subsidiary. 
The accounting treatment of each subsidiary above is noted in the table, with 3i Debt Management Limited and 3i Debt Management Investments 
Limited being fair valued with movements recognised in the profit and loss as a result of the implementation of IFRS 10. 
As at 31 March 2014, the entire issued share capital of 3i Holdings plc and 63% of the issued share capital of 3i Debt Management Limited was held 
by the Company. The entire issued share capital of all the other principal subsidiary undertakings listed in the table above and 80% of 3i Debt 
Management US LLC was held by subsidiary undertakings of the Company.
In addition, under the application of IFRS 10, 36 of the portfolio investments are now considered to be accounting subsidiaries. As per the investment 
entity exception under IFRS 10, these are all held at fair value with movements shown in the profit and loss. The largest 25 portfolio companies 
by fair value are detailed on page 154 and 155. The combination of the table opposite and that on pages 154 and 155 are deemed by the Directors 
to fulfil the IFRS 12 disclosure of material subsidiaries. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the number of undertakings in respect of which the Company is required to disclose information under  
Schedule 4 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group’s (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 is such that compliance would  
result in information of excessive length being given. Full information will be annexed to the Company’s next annual return.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 from the requirements 
to deliver to the Register of Companies and publish the accounts of those limited partnerships included in the consolidated accounts of the Group.

Financial statements 151 Independent auditor’ s report to  
the members of 3i  Group plc
1 . Our opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
We have audited the Financial statements of 3i Group plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2014, which comprise the Statement of comprehensive 
income, the Group and parent Company Statement of financial position, 
the Group and parent Company Statement of changes in equity, the 
Group and parent Company Cash flow statement and the related Notes 1 
to 34. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the parent Company Financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
  the Financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2014 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
  the Group Financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
  the parent Company Financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006;
  the Financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect 
on our overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
  valuation of the unquoted investment portfolio;
  calculation of carried interest; and
  application and interpretation of new accounting standards, 
specifically IFRS 10.
3. Our response to these risks
  With the assistance of our valuation experts, we assessed the 
appropriateness of the techniques used to value the unquoted 
investment portfolio. We challenged management’s key assumptions 
used in preparing these valuations, such as earnings multiples and 
we performed analysis to confirm that these multiples were within 
an appropriate range with reference to other comparable company 
multiples and transaction multiples. We obtained corroborative 
evidence over the significant inputs used in valuation models.
  With regard to carried interest, we performed analytical procedures 
in respect of carry based on our knowledge of investment realisations, 
and the performance of the portfolio. In addition, on a sample basis, 
we reperformed management’s calculation of carried interest.
  Following the adoption of IFRS 10 for the first time, we challenged the 
judgements and assumptions that management have exercised in 
determining which group entities are investment entities, and those 
which are consolidated subsidiaries. We carried out analysis on the 
group structure, as well as the activities within the subsidiaries to 
confirm they have been treated as held at fair value or consolidated 
appropriately. We have audited the Financial statements to ensure 
that the standard has been applied correctly. 
4. Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our 
audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit and on 
the Financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the 
Financial statements are free from material misstatement we define 
materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, 
relying on the Financial statements, would be changed or influenced.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude 
of uncorrected and undetected misstatements that we judged would 
be material for the Financial statements as a whole. We determined 
materiality for the Group to be £33 million (2013: £29 million), which is 
1% of net asset value. Our evaluation of materiality requires professional 
judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative as well as 
quantitative considerations implicit in the definition.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgment is that overall 
performance materiality (that is our tolerance for misstatement in an 
individual account or balance) for the Group should be 50% of materiality, 
namely £16.6 million. Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure 
that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences in the financial 
statements as a whole do not exceed our materiality of £33 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £1.6 million, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds.
5. An overview of the scope of our audit 
We used a risk-based approach for determining our audit strategy, 
ensuring that our audit teams performed consistent procedures and 
focused on addressing the risks that are relevant to the business. 
This approach focused our audit effort towards higher risk areas, 
such as significant management judgments.
The investments balance is the most significant part of the balance 
sheet. Control over the valuation of these investments is exercised 
by 3i’s management in London, and as such is audited wholly by the 
UK audit team. In all other locations where the Group has operations, 
we performed other procedures to confirm there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement in the Group Financial statements.

Financial statements
Independent auditor’ s report Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the Financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Financial statements. 
6. Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial 
statements; or
  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
  otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that 
we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should 
have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from group entities not visited by us; or
  the parent Company Financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
  the Directors’ statement, set out on page 76, in relation to going 
concern; and
  the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
The scope of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
The scope of our audit of the Financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the Financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the Financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been applied consistently and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
Financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited Financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing our audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
The respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 76, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.

Portfolio and other information
Portfolio and other information
T wenty five large investments The UK Companies Act defines a subsidiary based on voting rights, with a greater than 50% majority of voting rights resulting in an entity being 
classified as a subsidiary. IFRS 10 applies a wider test and, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed 
an accounting subsidiary.

Portfolio valuation – an explanation
Policy
The valuation policy is the responsibility of the Board, with additional 
oversight and annual review from the Valuations Committee. Our policy 
is to value 3i’s investment portfolio at fair value and we achieve this 
by valuing investments on an appropriate basis, applying a consistent 
approach across the portfolio. The policy ensures that the portfolio 
valuation is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and, in 
so doing, is also compliant with the guidelines issued by the International 
Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation board (the “IPEV guidelines”). 
The policy covers the Group’s Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt 
Management investment valuations. Valuations of the investment 
portfolio of the Group and its subsidiaries are performed at each 
quarter end.
Fair value is the underlying principle and is defined as “the price that 
would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date” (IPEV guidelines, 
December 2012). Fair value is therefore an estimate and, as such, 
determining fair value requires the use of judgment.
Private equity valuation
Determining enterprise value
To arrive at the fair value of the Group’s Private Equity investments, 
we first estimate the entire value of the company we have invested 
in – the enterprise value. This enterprise value is determined using 
one of a selection of methodologies depending on the nature, facts 
and circumstances of the investment.
Where possible, we use methodologies which draw heavily on 
observable market prices, whether listed equity markets or reported 
merger and acquisition transactions.
The quoted assets in our portfolio are valued at their closing bid price 
at the balance sheet date.
The majority of the rest of our portfolio, however, is represented 
by unquoted investments. These are valued, in the vast majority of 
cases, with reference to market comparables, or to recent reported 
relevant transactions.
As unquoted investments are not traded on an active market, the Group 
adjusts the estimated enterprise value by a marketability or liquidity 
discount. The marketability or liquidity discount is applied to the total 
enterprise value and we apply a higher discount rate for investments 
where there are material restrictions on our ability to sell at a time 
of our choosing.
The table on page 158 of this document outlines in more detail the range 
of valuation methodologies available to us, as well as the inputs and 
adjustments necessary for each.
Apportioning the enterprise value between 3i, other 
shareholders and lenders
Once we have estimated the enterprise value, the following steps 
are taken:
1.  We subtract the value of any claims, net of free cash balances, 
that are more senior to the most senior of our investments.
2.  The resulting attributable enterprise value is apportioned to the 
Group’s investment, and equal ranking investments by other parties, 
according to contractual terms and conditions, to arrive at a fair 
value of the entirety of the investment. The value is then distributed 
amongst the different loan, equity and other financial 
instruments accordingly.
3.  If the value attributed to a specific shareholder loan investment in 
a company is less than its par or nominal value, a shortfall is implied, 
which is recognised in our valuation. In exceptional cases, we may 
judge that the shortfall is temporary; to recognise the shortfall 
in such a scenario would lead to unrepresentative volatility and 
hence we may choose not to recognise the shortfall.
Other factors
In applying this framework, there are additional considerations that 
are factored into the valuation of some assets.
Impacts from structuring
Structural rights are instruments convertible into equity or cash at 
specific points in time or linked to specific events. For example, where 
a majority shareholder chooses to sell, and we have a minority interest, 
we may have the right to a minimum return on our investment.
Debt instruments, in particular, may have structural rights. In the 
valuation, it is assumed third parties, such as lenders or holders of 
convertible instruments, fully exercise any structural rights they might 
have if they are “in the money”, and that the value to the Group may 
therefore be reduced by such rights held by third parties. The Group’s 
own structural rights are valued on the basis they are exercisable 
on the reporting date. 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4
Portfolio and other information 157
Assets classified as “terminal”
If we believe an investment has more than a 50% probability of failing 
in the 12 months following the valuation date, we value the investment 
on the basis of its expected recoverable amount in the event of failure. 
It is important to distinguish between our investment failing and the 
business failing; the failure of our investment does not always mean 
that the business has failed, just that our recoverable value has 
dropped significantly. This would generally result in the equity and loan 
components of our investment being valued at nil. Value movements 
in the period relating to investments classified as terminal are classified 
as provisions in our value movement analysis.
Infrastructure valuation
The primary valuation methodology used for infrastructure investments 
is the discounted cash flow method (“DCF”). Fair value is estimated 
by deriving the present value of the investment using reasonable 
assumptions of expected future cash flows and the terminal value 
and date, and the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate that quantifies 
the risk inherent to the investment. The discount rate is estimated with 
reference to the market risk-free rate, a risk adjusted premium and 
information specific to the investment or market sector.
Debt management valuation
The Group’s Debt Management business line typically invests in traded 
debt instruments and the subordinated notes that it is required to hold 
in the debt funds which it manages. The traded debt instruments and 
the subordinated notes are valued using a range of data including broker 
quotes if available, original arranging bank models, 3i internal forecasts 
and models, trading data where available, and data from third-party 
valuation providers. Broker quotes and trading data for more liquid 
holdings are preferred. 158

Portfolio valuation – an explanation
Methodology Description Inputs Adjustments
% of portfolio 
valued on 
this basis
Earnings 
(Private Equity)
Most commonly used Private 
Equity valuation methodology
Used for investments which are 
profitable and for which we can 
determine a set of listed 
companies and precedent 
transactions, where relevant, 
with similar characteristics
Earnings multiples are applied to the earnings of the company 
to determine the enterprise value
Earnings
Reported earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, such as 
restructuring expenses, for significant corporate actions and, 
in exceptional cases, run-rate adjustments to arrive at 
maintainable earnings
Most common measure is earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
Earnings used are usually the management accounts for the 
1 2 months to the quarter end preceding the reporting period, 
unless data from forecasts or the latest audited accounts 
provides a more reliable picture of maintainable earnings
Earnings multiples
The earnings multiple is derived from comparable listed 
companies or relevant market transaction multiples
We select companies in the same industry and, where possible, 
with a similar business model and profile in terms of size, products, 
services and customers, growth rates and geographic focus
We adjust for changes in the relative performance in the set 
of comparables
A marketability or liquidity 
discount is applied to the 
enterprise value, typically 
between 5% and 15%, 
using factors such as 
our alignment with 
management and 
other investors and 
our investment rights 
in the deal structure
65%
Quoted  
(Infrastructure/ 
Private Equity)
Used for investments 
in listed companies
Closing bid price at balance sheet date No adjustments  
or discounts applied
16%
Imminent sale  
(Infrastructure/ 
Private Equity)
Used where an asset is in 
a sales process, a price has 
been agreed but the transaction 
has not yet settled
Contracted proceeds for the transaction, or best estimate 
of the expected proceeds
A discount of typically 2.5% 
is applied to reflect any 
uncertain adjustments 
to expected proceeds
1%
Fund  
(Infrastructure/ 
Private Equity/ 
Debt Management)
Used for investments  
in unlisted funds
Net asset value reported by the fund manager Typically no further 
discount applied in addition 
to that applied by the 
fund manager
0%
Specific industry 
metrics
(Private Equity)
Used for investments in 
industries which have well 
defined metrics as bases 
for valuation – eg book value 
for insurance underwriters, or 
regulated asset bases for utilities
We create a set of comparable listed companies and derive 
the implied values of the relevant metric
We track and adjust this metric for relative performance,  
as in the case of earnings multiples 
Comparable companies are selected using the same criteria 
as described for the earnings methodology
An appropriate discount 
is applied, depending on 
the valuation metric used
3%
Discounted  
cash flow  
(Private Equity/
Infrastructure)
Appropriate for businesses with 
long-term stable cash flows, 
typically in infrastructure
Long-term cash flows are discounted at a rate which is 
benchmarked against market data, where possible, or adjusted 
from the rate at the initial investment based on changes in the  
risk profile of the investment
Discount already implicit in 
the discount rate applied to 
long-term cash flows – no 
further discounts applied
8%
Broker quotes 
(Debt Management)
Used to value traded debt 
instruments
Broker quotes obtained from banks which trade the specific 
instruments concerned
No discount is applied 4%
Other  
(Private Equity)
Used where elements of a business 
are valued on different bases
Values of separate elements prepared on one of the 
methodologies listed above
Discounts applied to 
separate elements as above 
3%
For a small proportion of our smaller investments (less than 1% of the portfolio value), the valuation is determined by a more mechanical approach 
using information from the latest audited accounts. Equity shares are valued at the higher of an earnings or net assets methodology. Fixed income 
shares and loan investments are measured using amortised cost and any implied impairment, in line with IFRS.
Consistent with IPEV guidelines, all equity investments are held at fair value using the most appropriate methodology and no investments are held 
at historical cost. 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 201 4

In the past, some of our shareholders have received unsolicited 
telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters 
from organisations or persons claiming or implying that they have 
some connection with the Company. These are typically from 
overseas based “brokers” who target UK shareholders offering 
to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk 
shares in UK or overseas investments. Shareholders are advised 
to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a discount or offers of free reports into the Company. These 
approaches are operated out of what is more commonly known 
as a “boiler room”. You may also be approached by brokers 
offering to purchase your shares for an upfront payment in the 
form of a broker fee, tax payment or de-restriction fee. This is 
a common secondary scam operated by the boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
  always ensure the firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Register and 
is allowed to give financial advice before handing over your money. You can check 
at www.fca.org.uk/register;
  double-check the caller is from the firm they say they are – ask for their name and 
telephone number and say you will call them back. Check their identity by calling the 
firm using the contact number listed on the FCA Register. This is important as there 
have been instances where an authorised firm’s website has been cloned but with 
a few subtle changes, such as a different phone number or false email address;
  check the FCA’s list of known unauthorised overseas firms. However, these firms 
change their name regularly, so even if a firm is not listed it does not mean they 
are legitimate. Always check that they are listed on the FCA Register; and
  if you have any doubts, call the Financial Conduct Authority Consumer Helpline 
on 0800 1 1 1 6768. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. 160

Norman Askew
Chairman
19 February 2007
We have delivered a robust performance in 2006,
with strong growth in North America and the UK
performing in line with expectations.
In 2006 we:
• Increased our home completions in the
UK and strengthened our order book;
• Grew home completions and profits
in North America, as a result of our
strategy of maximising forward sales
during the buoyant market conditions
of 2005;
• Achieved another good profit increase
from our businesses in Spain &Gibraltar;
• Increased equity shareholders’ 
funds per share by 7 .8 per cent 
to 364.7 pence; 
• Reduced our gearing to 18.6 per cent.
Growing dividends through the cycle
In line with our progressive dividend
policy, the Board recommends an
increase in the final dividend for 2006
to 9.75 pence per share from 8.9
pence in 2005. This, together with the
interim dividend of 5.0 pence paid on 
1 November 2006, makes a total
dividend for the year of 14.75 pence,
an increase of 10 per cent. 
Subject to confirmation at the Annual
General Meeting (AGM) on 2 May 2007 ,
the dividend will be paid on 2 July 2007
to shareholders on the register at close
of business on 25 May 2007 .
This dividend will be paid as a
conventional cash dividend but
Chairman’s Statement
02 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
shareholders are once again being
offered the opportunity to reinvest some
or all of their dividend under the
Dividend Re-Investment Plan, details 
of which are contained in the 2007
AGM circular to shareholders.
Board changes
As previously announced, Iain Napier
retired from the Board on 31 December
2006. Following his arrival at Taylor
Woodrow in early 2002, Iain oversaw
our transition to a focused housebuilder,
with the acquisition of Wilson Connolly
and the disposal of our non-core
Investment and Commercial Property
portfolios. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to extend our sincere
thanks for his leadership during a
period of enormous change and wish
Iain every success in his new role 
as Chairman of Imperial Tobacco.
Ian Smith, joined the Board as Chief
Executive on 2 January 2007 , bringing
with him extensive international
experience, along with a strong
background in strategy, in the logistics
and healthcare sectors. I look forward
to working with Ian to deliver further
success for Taylor Woodrow.
Graeme McCallum retired from the
Board in January 2007 . He joined us in
Norman Askew, Chairman Manfield Grange, two miles from the centre of
Northampton, offers 79 new homes, ranging from one 
to five bedrooms, built in the grounds of the former
Manfield Grange Children’s Hospital. 
A listed building, this magnificent restoration provides
modern homes and luxury apartments with original 
and historical features complemented by the latest in
high-specification features and fittings.
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 03
Above: Manfield Grange, Northampton, England Featuring a variety of four and five bedroom family homes,
River Heights is situated in the picturesque area of Steiner
Ranch, Texas, and is located within walking distance of the
town centre and is close to local schools.
04 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Above: River Heights, Steiner Ranch, Austin, Texas, USA Taylor Woodrow operates a portfolio of 
housing businesses in selected markets in the
UK, North America, Spain and Gibraltar, which
account for 98 per cent of our operating profits.
In addition to building new homes, we also 
have expertise in mixed-use development 
and construction, which help to support our
development of sustainable new communities.
Chief Executive’s Review 
It also enables us to mitigate the
impact of any short-term weakness 
in any particular market or sub-market.
Consequently, as the markets in Arizona,
California and Florida started to weaken
in 2005, we were able to reduce our
planned land spend in North America
for 2006 and allocate additional funding
to our UK Housing business.
Each business is targeted to:
• Deliver high-quality homes in which 
our customers want to live;
• Use capital efficiently;
• Identify and manage risk effectively;
• Deploy effective and disciplined 
processes and systems, which 
encourage continuous improvement 
and support ‘right first time’ results;
• Work closely with supply chain 
partners to improve the way in 
which business is conducted; 
• Recruit, retain and develop high-
quality staff.
Strategic priorities
The Group’s key strategic priorities 
are to:
• Improve operating margins and 
returns on capital from our UK 
Housing business;
• Deliver competitive operating profit
margins and return on capital in
North America, whilst positioning 
the business for growth as market
conditions allow;
• Consolidate stable performance from 
our business in Spain and Gibraltar, 
whilst building a platform for future 
growth; 
• Grow the profits of our Construction
business, while managing risk
effectively.
Structure and strategy
Our aim is to be the homebuilder 
of choice. Our primary business is 
the development of sustainable
communities of high-quality homes 
in selected markets in the UK, North
America, Spain and Gibraltar. We seek
to add shareholder value through 
the achievement of profitable growth 
and effective capital management. 
Our performance in delivering total
shareholder return can be seen on
page 40.
We are a national homebuilder in the
UK. In the United States we operate 
in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas.
We also build in Ontario, Canada. 
Our operations in Spain are focused on
the popular holiday destinations of the
Costa Blanca, Costa del Sol and Mallorca.
Operating a portfolio of housing
businesses allows us to allocate our
capital where we see the best
opportunities for risk-adjusted returns.

Monitoring our performance
Operating margin is
calculated using profit from
operations (excluding joint
ventures’ interest and tax) and
revenue (including that of joint
ventures). Please see Note 3
of the Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 56 for
further information. This
measure represents the
profitability of our operations.
Return on average capital
employed (ROACE) is
calculated using profit from
operations (excluding joint
ventures’ interest and tax) 
and capital employed 
(pre-goodwill). This measure
indicates how efficiently the
business is using its capital 
to generate profits.
Gearing is calculated as net
debt divided by shareholders’
funds and represents the 
level of borrowing within the
business.
Home completions include
sales from within joint ventures,
which are counted as a
proportion of a unit in line 
with the percentage of the
joint venture owned by 
Taylor Woodrow.
The order book represents
future business, consisting 
of houses or lots reserved 
or amounts yet to be invoiced
on construction contracts.
Landbank indicates the
‘stock’ available for new
housing, for which planning
consent has been received.
Some of the landbank is
owned outright, whilst other
plots are controlled through
options.
Customer satisfaction is
measured by each of our
businesses through the use 
of customer surveys. The way
in which these surveys are
conducted and the questions
that they contain vary by
business.
Results
Consolidated revenue for the year 
to 31 December 2006 was up 3 per
cent at £3,572.1m (2005: £3,476.9m).
Profit before tax was £405.6m (2005:
£411 .0m).
At 31 December 2006, total equity
before minority interests was £2,103.5m
(2005: £1,928.4m). Net debt was
£391 .3m (2005: £456.9m). Net gearing
was 18.6 per cent (2005: 23.7 per cent).
Basic earnings per share was 50.5
pence (2005: 50.6 pence). Equity
shareholders’ funds per share increased
by 7 .8 per cent to 364.7 pence.
Group housing has had a good year,
with our North American business
reporting another year of record profits.
Revenue increased to £3,128.4m
(2005: £2,864.9m), reflecting an
increase in both home and lot
completions. Profits from operations
were higher than last year, at £469.2m,
as the increase in completions
outweighed the reduction in overall
Group housing operating margin.
Some 53 per cent of 2006 Group
housing profit from operations* came
from overseas operations (2005: 49 per
cent). This reflects our decision to
increase investment into those markets
over the last few years.
The Group housing landbank (owned
and controlled) was reduced to 68,662 
plots (2005: 75,160), as a result of our
more cautious approach to land buying
in North America. The Group housing
order book stood at £1,070m 
(2005: £1,318m), with a decrease 
in North America offsetting increases 
in the UK and Spain.
*Throughout the Chief Executive's Review, profit from operations and operating margins 
exclude joint ventures' interest and tax (see Note 3, page 56). The Group’s share of joint 
venture revenue is used in the margin calculation (see Note 3, page 56).

Grand Union Village is a £130 million redevelopment of a 54 acre
brownfield site in West London into a mixed use, sustainable urban
village, set alongside the Grand Union Canal. 
When complete, over 800 homes, including apartments and family
homes, will be provided as well as a new canal basin known as
Engineer’s Wharf. A Community Development Trust, set up and part
funded by Taylor Woodrow, is now actively involving residents in the
creation and management of community facilities provided at the site.
The development was recognised with a Prince’s Foundation award in
February 2007 for creating a community design that has helped to
improve the quality of life for the people who live there.

2006 saw a return to more stable
market conditions in the UK. There
was, however, considerable regional
variation in the strength of markets.
London and the South-East were
particularly strong while the Midlands
and North remained subdued. Overall
visitor levels per site per week were 
up 12 per cent on 2005 and we also
saw an increase in the reservation rate
to 0.83 homes per site per week (2005:
0.81). Cancellation rates have also
improved, with the 2006 level of 17 per
cent being broadly in line with the long-
run industry average (2005: 20 per cent).
We have increased our average
number of active sites in 2006 to 207
(2005: 204). Home completions for 
the year were up 1 per cent to 8,294
(2005: 8,178) and we entered 2007
with an order book up by 30 per cent
to £534m (2005: £411m).
Average selling prices were higher at
£193k (2005: £185k). An increase in the
underlying price per square foot offset
the slight reduction in average square
footage of our homes from 960 sq ft 
to 952 sq ft. The latter was a result of
an increase in the proportion of social
housing completions to 15 per cent
(2005: 13 per cent) and the proportion
of apartment completions to 45 per
cent (2005: 40 per cent). 
UK Housing revenue increased by 11 .8
per cent, driven by the increases in
home completions and average selling
prices. Operating margins* were lower
at 12.0 per cent (2005: 14.2 per cent).
Results in 2005 benefited from a
higher level of land profits, primarily
due to the disposal of the Quartermile
project in Edinburgh. Revenue from
land sales in 2006 was £194.6m (2005:
£134.4m) and yielded lower profits and
margins than in 2005, due to an increased
proportion of recently-acquired land in
the mix. This is a result of our strategy
of acquiring large sites and selling on
those parcels of land that we do not
require for our homebuilding business.
Return on average capital employed for
the year was 14.0 per cent (2005: 15.2
per cent).
Our operating margin has declined in
2006, and consequently growth in margin
is the long-term key focus of our UK
Management. We are preparing a
number of new measures to extract
greater value from our sites. These will
complement our ongoing activity to
better manage cost:

2006 2005 Chief Executive’s Review continued
• Increasing the proportion of our 
homes that are built using our core 
range, which provides customers 
with the choice that they need, 
whilst also enabling us to achieve 
lower build costs;
• Further developing our ‘right 
first time’ approach to reduce
maintenance costs and increase
customer satisfaction; 
• Increasing build process efficiency.
We will be providing an update on our
progress with these initiatives when
we announce our interim results on 
31 July 2007 .
Our Supply Chain team works to deliver
value throughout the build process.
Their skills were recognised by the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply when Taylor Woodrow’s Supplier
Management Solution won the award
for ‘Best Use of Technology’ in 2006.
We continue to make good progress
with our strategic landbank, which
represents land that does not currently
have planning consent. Having
identified a site with strategic potential
we will typically agree a purchase
option arrangement with the landowner
and then work together to promote 
the land through the planning process.
Such options generally provide us with
the ability to purchase the land at a
discount to market value when suitable
planning consents are obtained. 
Sites brought through from the
strategic landbank typically generate
higher margins than those bought 
in the open market with a planning
consent in place. During 2006, 22 per
cent of our home completions were
strategically sourced (2005: 19 per
cent) and we aim to increase this to 
25 per cent of our completions by
2008. At the end of 2006 we had
79,000 potential plots within our
strategic landbank (2005: 80,000) and
39 per cent of the land in our landbank
originally came from strategic sources
(2005: 41 per cent).
10 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
The quality of the landbank is critical 
to delivering growth in future years. 
As well as the strength of the strategic
land outlined above, we have
maintained our investment in the 
UK landbank during 2006. As a result,
our year end landbank stood at 34,827
plots owned or controlled, broadly in
line with the position a year ago. This
represents 4.2 years of supply.
We are committed to developing
communities where people want to 
live, rather than just building a collection
of houses. For example, The Green
Building at Macintosh Village in
Manchester won the Civic Trust
Sustainability Award for its urban design
and use of materials. 
Customer satisfaction is a key priority
and our efforts in this area are reflected
in the improvements to our customer
satisfaction score. In 2006, the score
for our UK Housing business rose to 78
per cent (2005: 75 per cent).

Above: Senna Hill, Austin, Texas, USA at the start of the year were converted
into completions. Return on average
capital employed has reduced from 
the wholly exceptional levels achieved
last year, but still represents a very
strong result.
We entered 2006 with a record order
book of US$1,421m as a result of our
focus on pre-selling. Our order book 
of US$854m at the end of 2006
reflected the weaker market conditions
experienced during the year. 
We have been more cautious in the
land market in 2006, as land prices
adjusted downwards to reflect the
market conditions. Much of our land is
acquired under option initially and only
bought outright once planning consents
are in place. We carefully review the
terms of each option as it becomes
exercisable and, where terms are no
longer attractive due to changes in
market conditions, we approach the
land vendor to renegotiate. In many
instances we have managed to
improve terms, but there have also
been cases where we have allowed
options to lapse. We have undertaken 
a full review of our year-end land
positions which, in conjunction with
deposits on options not taken up, has
resulted in a pre-tax land write-off of
US$40m.
While we have continued to buy land
through our existing portfolio of
options, we have been very selective 
in replacing options during 2006. As 
a result, our landbank at the year end
stood at 31,353 plots (2005: 37 ,910
plots). This represents 4.4 years of
supply and allows us to continue to be
selective in our land purchasing in 2007 .
While short-term market prospects 
are difficult, commentators are united
in the belief that a recovery will occur.
There is very significant potential for
Taylor Woodrow in North America in
the medium-term. Our home
completions in North America are just
over a half of our completions in the UK
for 2006, but the Florida market alone 
is larger than the entire UK market.
Our business in Arizona, which is
focused on the Phoenix market, has
been tremendously successful since it
was acquired in 2002. Having originally
been centred on entry-level homes, the
business has been diversifying into the
mid-market and during 2006 launched 
a new product range, targeting growing
families and executive buyers. We
completed 1,245 homes in Arizona in
2006 (2005: 1,009) at an average selling
price of US$287k (2005: US$209k). The
business is also a highly successful
land developer, buying larger tracts of
land, identifying the plots that best suit
our product and selling on the remaining
plots to other builders. During the year
we completed the sale of 1,171 lots
(2005: 1,076). Whilst the market in
Arizona cooled during 2006, the long-
term fundamentals of population growth,
job growth and relative affordability
remain in place.

Our North American business has
delivered another excellent year of
profit growth, with profit from
operations* increasing by 11 per

impact of market weakness in Arizona,
California and Florida during 2006.
Home completions increased by 14 per

The Summit Collection at Shamrock
Estates, Phoenix, Arizona, USA In California we operate in two key
markets. In the North, our business 
is focused on the lower end of the 
mid-market in the San Francisco Bay
area. In Southern California we build 
in selected sub-markets from Riverside
and San Bernardino Counties
southwards to San Diego and eastwards
towards Palm Springs. Californian
markets in general weakened
significantly during 2006, primarily due
to interest rate rises and affordability
issues. However, our focus on the 
mid-market and providing high-quality
homes allows us to offer an attractive
proposition to our customers. During
the year we completed the sale of 
540 homes (2005: 721 homes) at an
average selling price of US$812k 
(2005: US$835k). We also achieved 156 
lot completions (2005: 378).
We operate from three divisions in
Florida. Our Central Florida division
covers the areas around St Petersburg,
Tampa, Bradenton and Sarasota. 
In South-East Florida we operate in the
Palm Beach area, whilst in South-West
Florida we are focused on the markets
between Fort Myers and Naples. 
We offer a wide range, from middle
market to luxury homes and
condominiums, targeted to move-up
families, retirees, and second home
purchasers. The Florida market has also
experienced more difficult conditions
following a number of years of very
strong house price appreciation. 
Home completions in 2006 were 835
(2005: 752) at an average selling price
of US$653k (2005: US$727k). Our land
development business in Florida is
primarily centred around our large-scale
developments, where we sell lots to
other homebuilders. In 2006 we
completed the sale of 499 lots (2005:
219 lots).
Our operations in Texas are active in
both Austin and Houston. These
markets did not experience the price
growth of other US regions in recent
years and are proving more stable
while other markets weaken. They offer 
good levels of affordability, particularly
in comparison to the western United
States. We have a strong reputation 
in Texas as a high-quality community
developer, which enables us to target
the ‘move-up’ market. We offer our
customers a range of innovative home
designs that deliver ‘affordable luxury’.
Home completions increased to 280
(2005: 190) with average sales prices 
up 5 per cent to US$447k (2005:
US$424k). We also have a strong 
land development business in Texas,
centred on our community at Steiner
Ranch in Austin. We completed on 306
lots in 2006 (2005: 353).
In Ontario, Canada, the group trades
under the Monarch brand which
benefits from a long-standing reputation
for quality and value. Operating in the
Greater Toronto Area and in Ottawa in
Eastern Ontario, Monarch builds 
low-rise, mid-market family homes 
Chief Executive’s Review continued
and high-rise condominiums as well 
as affordable, urban townhomes. The
Ontario market has not seen significant
house price inflation over recent years
and retains a good level of affordability.
In addition, the market was assisted by
the reduction in the level of Canadian
Goods and Services Tax during the
year. Completions in 2006 were 1,592
homes (2005: 1,260). The average sales
price was Can$322k (2005: Can$326k).
We also sell lots in Canada and
completed 508 during 2006 (2005: 709).
The continuing success of our business
in North America is a result of our
focus on high-quality developments,
professional finishes, and exceptional
customer service. In October 2006,
Taylor Woodrow received the honour 
of being the first homebuilder ever to
be inducted into the Builder Magazine
‘Hall of Fame for Design Excellence’. 
This prestigious award recognises
outstanding contributions to residential
design.
Our North America divisions are
consistently recognised by customers
and industry peers, winning some of
the most sought-after awards in the
business. In particular, our Arizona
division received five awards at ‘The
Nationals’ Awards 2006, recognising
Taylor Woodrow’s contribution to
innovation in home design, marketing
and sales.

We sold a total of 379 homes in 2006
(2005: 406) at an average selling price
of £205k (2005: £169k). This increase 
in average selling price reflects a
change in the mix of completions, with
a higher proportion of completions in
2006 coming from our developments in
Mallorca. We also took the opportunity
during the year to rebalance the land
portfolio by selling some of our holding
in the Malaga area.
Operating margins and returns on
capital have remained strong, albeit
below the exceptional levels achieved
in recent years.
The order book increased 23 per cent
to £100m (2005: £81m) and our year-
end landbank stood at 2,482 plots, up 
10 per cent (2005: 2,265).
The disappointing reduction in our
customer satisfaction score
predominantly results from difficulties
in obtaining habitation certificates, as
high levels of development activity
have put pressure on local town halls.
Construction
Our Construction business has
developed an excellent reputation within
its chosen markets focusing on repeat
work for blue chip clients, facilities
management, infrastructure and
government projects. This excellence
has once again been recognised with 
a number of industry awards in 2006,
including being named Building
magazine’s ‘Major Contractor of the
Year’ and winner of the overall
‘Constructing Excellence’ award. Profit
from operations* was £8.1m (2005:
£8.8m) and our increased order book 
of £1,165m at the year end (2005:
£707m) provides us with a solid
platform for 2007 .
During the year we have undertaken
projects ranging from the redevelopment
of the ticket hall at Kings Cross
Underground Station in London to the
design and build of the National
Assembly for Wales in Cardiff. We have
recently commenced work on the 
St Helens and Knowsley Hospitals PFI
Scheme and are also preferred bidder
on the Sheffield ‘Building Schools for the
Future’ programme. We achieved a
customer satisfaction score of 87 per
cent in 2006 (2005: 91 per cent).
Principal risks and uncertainties
As with any business, Taylor Woodrow
faces a number of risks and
uncertainties in the course of its 
day-to-day operations. By effectively
identifying and managing these risks,
we are able to improve our returns
thereby adding value for shareholders.
Economic and market environment
Customer demand is dependent upon
underlying economic conditions, such
as interest rates, unemployment levels
and general consumer confidence,
which are outside the Group’s control.

Our business in Spain trades under the
Taylor Woodrow brand and is primarily
focused on developing sites in popular
holiday destinations. Where we identify
appropriate opportunities, we also 
build homes designed to meet the
requirements of the local population.
In Gibraltar, Taylor Woodrow serves 
the luxury market through apartment
developments, selling off-plan well 
in advance of the start of construction.
After a strong performance in 2005, we
saw our markets in the Costa Blanca
and Costa del Sol slowing during 
2006. However, the market in Mallorca
continues to be good as a result of the
limited supply to meet the demand for Los Balcones, Los Arqueros Golf and
Country Club, Marbella, Spain  The impact of these factors on the
Group’s sales is mitigated to a degree
by operating in different geographic
markets, which may exhibit different
economic conditions at any particular
point in time.
We use the detailed knowledge of 
our local teams to select the locations
for our communities and the
appropriate home designs to meet
customer demand. We minimise the
level of speculative build that we
undertake by opening a sales office 
and showhomes at an early stage 
of development. Our selective use of
part-exchange has proved successful 
in making the process of buying a
home easier for our customers.
Planning system
The number of homes that we are able
to build in the course of a financial year
is dependent on the granting of suitable
planning permissions. Due to the time
taken to obtain planning permissions
on land, we hold a landbank to provide
greater certainty of the number of plots
available to be developed in the
following 12 months. We also look to
use option contracts to control land,
with ownership not being taken until
planning is more certain.
Delays to the expected timescale for
receipt of planning on a site may result
in a reduction in the number of homes
that we have available for sale.
Planners may also impose conditions
within planning consents, which may
lead to additional costs of developing 
a site. Our land specialists mitigate
these risks by working closely with 
the relevant planning authorities and
through the structure of land purchase
agreements.
In the UK, planning permissions can be
very specific, including the density, types
of housing and availability of car parking
spaces. If the views of the planners do
not coincide with our customers’
aspirations there will be an impact on
demand for our product. We work closely
with the government, both directly
and as a member of industry groups, 
to highlight such potential issues.
Land purchasing
Land is the major ‘raw material’ for the
Group and, as such, overpaying for land
would have a detrimental impact on our
profitability. To mitigate this risk, we
operate an investment appraisal process
for all significant land purchases, with
approval required from our Investment
Committee prior to such purchases
being completed. The Investment
Committee reviews the key information
on which bids are based and ensures
that projects meet our internal hurdle
rates for operating margin and return
on average capital employed.
Availability of sub-contractors
The vast majority of the work carried
out on site is performed by sub-
contractors. If they are not able to
Chief Executive’s Review continued
20 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 recruit sufficient numbers of skilled
employees, our developments may
suffer from delays or quality issues.
We vet all suppliers thoroughly prior 
to working with them to ensure 
that they meet our requirements for
environmental impact, health and
safety, quality and financial stability. 
We also play our part in addressing 
the skills shortage in the building
industry through apprenticeship
schemes and membership of the
Construction Industry Training Board.
Availability of materials
The key materials used within our
operations, such as bricks, blocks,
concrete, steel and timber, are in heavy
demand across the world. Changing
patterns of construction demand due to
factors ranging from changes in public
sector construction programmes to
natural disasters can have an influence
on the availability of such materials.
Our vetting process ensures that
materials are responsibly sourced from
financially stable suppliers and meet
our requirements for health, safety and
quality. We work closely with our key
supply chain partners, providing
forecasts of our demand to assist with
ensuring the availability of supply.
Site safety
Building sites are inherently dangerous
places. We recognise our responsibility
to provide our workforce with a safe
place of work and have a team of 
in-house Health and Safety specialists
who provide training and site reviews.
As detailed later in this review, we 
have a strong commitment to Health and
Safety, but we are continually looking
for ways to make further improvements.
Construction process
Construction, both of homes and other
projects, can be subject to delays 
and cost over-runs arising for a wide
variety of reasons. These include

adverse ground conditions, changes 
to the original design once build has
commenced and unfavourable weather.
We target selectively the type of 
work that we bid for, choosing not to
participate in projects where we
consider that the risks are too great.
We maintain detailed risk registers,
ensuring that risks are identified, 
priced or hedged and approved at the
appropriate level before taking on a
project. These registers are maintained
throughout the life of the project and
reviewed following the completion 
of the job to identify any key learning
points for future projects. We also
actively promote developments in
areas such as off-site manufacturing
which have the potential to reduce 
the risk of delay. The Calders Green development near Weston, sits in 
the middle of some of the most beautiful parkland that
Cheshire has to offer. It is a gated development of family
homes and apartments in a setting of lakes, streams 
and trees. 
22 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Above: Calders Green, Crewe, Cheshire, England Sustainability and the environment
Taylor Woodrow is committed to
continuous improvement in the design
and construction of new homes and
enhancing the built environment for
people who live in and near its new
communities, both now and in the
future. In order to measure our progress
against this aim, we focus on four key
areas of sustainability.
Urban regeneration is a major part of
our business, transforming areas of land
that are often derelict and sometimes
contaminated into desirable places to
live. During 2006 we commenced work
on Telford Millennium Community, which
will include up to 800 highly sustainable
homes along with associated
community, education and commercial
facilities on the site of a former colliery.
In 2006, 63 per cent of our UK homes
and 21 per cent of our North American
homes were developed on brownfield
(previously developed) land (2005: UK:
68 per cent, North America: 17 per
cent). Our Construction business also
undertakes regeneration projects and 
is currently working with Sandwell
Homes to deliver a five year package of
repairs and improvements to homes
across six towns in the West Midlands.
As the cost of buying a new home in
the UK continues to increase,
affordable housing (homes built for
registered social landlords or as part of
Key Worker programmes) is becoming
an increasing part of our business. 
We have developed a reputation for
delivering high-quality affordable
housing, making us a partner of choice
for housing associations. Affordable
housing increased as a proportion of
our business from 13 per cent in 2005
to 15 per cent in 2006.
Around 25 per cent of the UK’s carbon
dioxide emissions, a major cause of
climate change, come from the energy
that people use to heat, light and run
their homes. During the year we
commissioned thermal photography 
to compare the energy efficiency of
brand new and second-hand homes.
The results showed that new homes
are significantly more energy efficient
than those built twenty or thirty years
ago. The average SAP (Standard
Assessment Procedure) rating for our
UK homes was 97 in 2006 (2005: 98),
against a maximum possible score 
of 120.
Taylor Woodrow has also taken a
leading role in the deployment of the
EcoHomes scheme (an environmental
assessment method for house building
and refurbishment). In 2006, 950 of our
homes were certified to EcoHomes
standards representing 11 per cent of
our total UK completions (2005: 736, 
9 per cent). 
As a major homebuilder we have a
responsibility to play a major role in the
sustainability debate. As such, we
contributed to the consultation on the
UK Government’s draft Code for
Sustainable Homes and held our first
sustainability conference.
We closely monitor the environmental
performance of our business and have
continuous improvement initiatives
underway in three key areas:
• We successfully reduced the average
amount of construction waste
generated per UK home to 32.1 cu. yds
and the associated cost of disposal to
£291 (2005: 39.6 cu. yds and £351);
• We reduced the carbon dioxide
emissions from our UK operations
(including those generated during the
construction process, by our offices
and showhomes and by our company
vehicle fleet) from an estimated
20,204 tonnes in 2005 to an
estimated 19,034 tonnes in 2006; 
• We received a reduced total number 
of environmental prosecutions, 
notices and incidents during the year 
of 19 (2005: 29).
Sustainability and environmental issues
are becoming increasingly important in
North America and we have a number
of initiatives underway in our different
regions. For instance, our Florida
business has implemented a recycling
programme at its Palma Sola Trace
community, which has successfully
increased the amount of waste
material that is recycled or reused.
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 23
Community
Taylor Woodrow has a long history 
of contributing to local communities
through voluntary projects and other
activities. We set ourselves the
objective of further developing our
community programmes during 2006.
Examples of our work with
communities in the UK include:
• Our ongoing relationship with the 
charity Barnardo’s through our 
‘Building Futures’ partnership, 
through which team members raised
£11,447 for their local Barnardo’s 
projects (2005: £4,913). Many other 
company events raised additional 
funding for Barnardo’s of £26,000 
(2005: £19,200);
• Continuing our ‘Support the Team’ 
programme, we donated £28,959 
to match team members’ charitable 
fund-raising efforts (2005: 35,918);
• Rolling out our ‘Community in the 
Curriculum’ initiative to schools 
neighbouring our developments in 
Scotland and the West Midlands; 
• Developing policies for a company-
wide process for community 
consultation.
Our team in North America has a
strong culture of community
participation, which was further
enhanced during 2006. Examples of
the team’s contributions include:
• Team members from Texas raised 
more than $50,000 in walks 
benefiting the Juvenile Diabetes 
Research Foundation;
• Our team in Southern California 
raised more than $25,000 for 
HomeAid Orange County, a non-
profit organisation that helps build 
and renovate shelters for the 
transitionally homeless men, women,
and children in the community; 
• The Arizona division hosted an 
‘Easter Egg-Stravaganza’ for 
residents of one of its communities, 
which was attended by over 100 
residents with their children. More 
than 1,000 eggs were hidden, with 
prizes including gift certificates, toys 
and bicycles. 2006

Employees
The development of effective teams is
vital to our company. We are committed
to recruiting and retaining a talented
team that is motivated and focused to
deliver and exceed our business
objectives. This commitment is
supported by regular benchmarking of
our remuneration and benefits packages. 
We respect the rights of our people.
We promote:
• Good and safe conditions of work;
• The development and best use of 
talent;
• Equal opportunity employment; 
• Involvement of our people in the
planning and direction of their work.
We strive to make our project sites and
our offices safe working environments.
Our objective is to improve safety
performance through awareness
raising, monitoring and incentivisation. 
In the UK we have a programme of
active monitoring for site safety and
project performance is linked to bonus
schemes for site managers and senior
managers. During 2006 we conducted:
• 1,382 site inspections, which 
measure how well our project teams 
are implementing Health and Safety 
management (2005: 1,212); 
• 326 safety management audits, 
which measure how well our project 
teams have planned the management
of Health and Safety (2005: 342).
We have been recognised for our
leadership position within the sector. In
2006 our UK Housing and Construction
businesses each received Gold Awards
from the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents. During 2006
our accident frequency rate was 0.34
accidents per 100,000 man hours
(2005: 0.34).
In North America, we conduct
independent Health and Safety audits
of all construction sites twice a year
and set continuous improvement
targets. The results of the 2006 audits
were very good, with average scores of
93 per cent exceeding the target of 88
per cent.
Our Spanish business has achieved
certification to the occupational Health
and Safety management standard
18001 . The standard has been
successfully audited by Lloyds Register
and is being promoted to our
contractors and suppliers.
Despite the good progress made in
advancing the quality of our safety
management processes, we are deeply
saddened to report three fatalities in
our operations during the year.
We are committed to keeping our
employees informed of developments
within the business. Internal
communication methods include
weekly news bulletins, regular team
Chief Executive’s Review continued
24 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
briefings and frequent opportunities to
meet senior management face-to-face.
We undertake regular employee
surveys and benchmark the responses
against both previous results and
industry standards. Our 2006 survey
showed that 79 per cent of our
employees would recommend Taylor
Woodrow to others as a good place 
to work, an improvement on the 2004
figure of 74 per cent.
Our people are a key strength of our
business and their skills have once
again been recognised in industry
awards. Jerry Williams from our
Construction business was named
‘Project Manager of the Year’ for the
National Assembly for Wales at the
Chartered Institute of Building awards.
12 of our UK Housing site managers
received NHBC ‘Seal of Excellence’
Awards, with three winning ‘Regional
Awards’ and going through to the
overall UK final. Steve Vorres received
the NHBC UK Supreme Award, in the
multi-storey category, for the second
year running for our Victoria Wharf
development in Cardiff.

At 31 December 2006, the gross IAS19
deficit was £206m (2005: £220m). Net
of deferred tax, the deficit was £144m
(2005: £154m). Further information is
contained in Note 20 on page 68.
The company has now completed
discussions with the trustees of the
main defined benefit pension scheme
in the UK on the means of mitigating
this deficit. As we announced at our
Interim Results, the company has
agreed to increase its past service
deficit funding payments from £4.8m
per annum to £20m per annum for a
period of 10 years. This increase impacts
on cashflow but profit from operations
will not be affected. Also in line with
our previous announcement, the fund
was closed to future accrual for existing
members on 1 December 2006.
Equity shareholders’ funds
At the end of 2006, shareholders’ funds
were £2,103.5m, up from £1,928.4m at
the end of 2005. Equity shareholders’
funds per ordinary share rose to 364.7
pence at the end of 2006. This
represents an increase of 7 .8 per cent
from the previous year-end.
Shareholders' returns
Basic earnings per share stood at 
50.5 pence (2005: 50.6 pence). The
proposed final dividend of 9.75 pence
produces a total return of 14.75 pence
per ordinary share, an increase of 10
per cent over last year. This level of
dividend is consistent with the Board’s
policy of paying progressive dividends
through the business cycle.
The dividend is covered 3.4 times 
by earnings.
Cash flow and net debt
Operating cashflows before movements
in working capital were £460.9m (2005:
£461 .1m). Inventories increased by
£347 .5m which was partly funded by an
increase in creditors of £17 4.4m. Of this
26 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Chief Executive’s Review continued
latter increase, £131 .1m is represented 
by an increase in land creditors. Cash
generated by operations was £223.3m
(2005: £359.7m). Income taxes and
interest payments totalled £166.3m
(2005: £229.5m), resulting in net cash
from operating activities of £57 .0m
(2005:£130.2m).
Net debt at the year-end stood at
£391 .3m (2005: £456.9m) equivalent to
net gearing of 18.6 per cent (2005: 23.7
per cent). Interest on borrowings, net of
interest receivable was £55.0m (2005:
£54.4m). Average net debt for the year
was £837 .8m (2005: £823.4m). At the
year-end Taylor Woodrow had undrawn
committed revolving credit facilities
totalling £629.5m.
T axation
The effective tax rate in 2006 was 28.4
per cent (2005: 30.3 per cent).

well as providing retail, shopping, community
and leisure units. Public and private
waterside park areas will also be created.
The scheme consists mainly of apartments,
along with a number of three-storey
townhouses. The development has launched
successfully. With an in-depth knowledge of the
markets in which we operate, we are
well-placed to benefit from any land
acquisition opportunities that market
conditions might present.
We will continue to invest across our
portfolio where we see the best returns
for shareholders and I look forward to

Prospects for 2007
Our geographic portfolio of businesses
continues to provide us with alternative
investment and growth options.
The UK Housing market remains good.
Underlying fundamentals are strong
due to the continuing significant
undersupply of new housing. Whilst
Government is committed to introducing
policies that will increase the availability
of land for development, we have not
yet seen any increase in supply. Despite
strong price appreciation during 2006,
there were wide regional variations and
customer confidence could be damaged
in some of the weaker markets if
further interest rate rises materialise 
in 2007 . We anticipate an increase in
the number of home completions
during 2007 and will continue to focus
on improving our operating margins.
In North America, although the markets
in Arizona, California and parts of Florida
remain challenging and difficult to predict,
current market conditions in Texas 
and Ontario are healthy. We continue 
to be confident in the prospects for 
the business in the medium-term, but
expect to see significant reductions 
in both operating margin and return on
capital employed during 2007 . In 2007
the priority for our North American
management is to minimise the impact
of the market downturn in the short-
term, whilst taking the opportunity 
of the market downturn to position 
the business for accelerated growth 
in the future.
The market in Spain remains attractive
on a medium-term view, although any
weakness in the UK market in the
short-term could reduce demand for
property in Spain from British buyers.

The company operates a Dividend Re-Investment Plan, details

www.taylorwoodrow.com. 
Payment of dividend has been waived in part by the T rustee 
of the company’ s two Employee Share Ownership T rusts over
those T rusts’ combined holding of 5.1m shares and in full on 
the company’ s holding of 12.2m T reasury shares. Shares held 
in the T rusts are set aside to meet commitments under the
company’ s employee share plans. Shares held in T reasury result
from the acquisition of the company’ s own shares in 2004 and
provide the company with additional ﬂexibility in the
management of its capital base.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
CSR has become increasingly integrated within T aylor
Woodrow’ s business. In the Chief Executive’ s Review on pages
5 to 27 you will ﬁnd a broad outline and many examples of the
ways in which we continue to apply CSR principles throughout
everything we do. We draw these themes together in the
group’ s full CSR Report for 2006 which is published separately
in electronic form on the group’ s website
www.taylorwoodrow.com.
The Group’ s commitment to advancing CSR within T aylor
Woodrow is evidenced by the appointment from January 2007
of a full-time Director of CSR.
During 2006, we focused the business on a number of high-
level CSR objectives, covering the key areas of Sustainability,
Safety, Health and People, Environment and Community. These
are discussed in the full CSR report.
T reasury management and funding
The Group operates within policies and procedures approved 
by the Board. The Group’ s capitalisation policy establishes
overall parameters for the consolidated capital structure
together with guidelines in respect of interest and currency
translation exposures. The Group seeks to match long-term
assets with long-term funding and short-term assets with 
short-term funding. Strict controls are exercised on the use 
of ﬁnancial instruments in managing the Group’ s ﬁnancial risk.
The objectives are to ensure sufﬁcient liquidity is maintained to
meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and
proﬁtably. The Group does not undertake speculative or trading
activity in ﬁnancial instruments or foreign currencies.
The disclosures relating to the use of ﬁnancial instruments and
treasury risks faced by the Group, required under the EU’ s Fair
Value Directive, are detailed in Notes 15 to 19 to the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The Group maintains a balance between certainty and ﬂexibility
through the use of term borrowings, overdrafts and committed
revolving credit facilities with a range of maturity dates. It is the
Group’ s policy to maintain committed facilities or borrowings
with staggered maturity dates in order to ensure continuity of
funding.
T reasury functions are centralised in our main geographic
locations. All treasury operations must remain in compliance
with Group policy and are closely monitored by the Group
treasury department.
Equity, retained proﬁts and long-term ﬁxed interest debt are
used primarily to ﬁnance goodwill, ﬁxed assets and land. 
Short-term borrowings are required primarily to ﬁnance net
current assets, other than landbank assets of more than one
year, and work in progress and are therefore kept at a ﬂoating
rate. Where possible, temporary cash balances made available
by our construction business are used to reduce our short-term
borrowing requirements. The Group also uses derivatives to
manage interest rate exposure if economically appropriate.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’ s capital employed is in
currencies other than sterling with the result that currency
movements can affect the balance sheet. Where appropriate,
foreign currency translation exposure is reduced by ﬁnancing
overseas assets with borrowings of the same currency and by
the use of derivatives.
Research and development 
The company is committed to investing in research and
development projects where there are clearly-deﬁned business
beneﬁts. 
Charitable donations 
During the year Group companies donated £198,000 (2005:
£363,000) to various charities, £63,000 (2005: £96,000) in 
the UK and Europe and £135,000 (2005: £267 ,000) in North
America. An outline of the Group’ s programme of charitable 
giving appears elsewhere in the Chief Executive’ s Review 
and fuller details can be found in the on-line CSR 2006 report. 
Political donations
The company did not make any donations to political parties
during 2006 (2005: £nil). Business subscriptions were paid to
the Home Builders Federation of £192,000 (2005: £167 ,000)
and Homes for Scotland of £20,000 (2005: £nil) both of which
are active in supporting the interests of the housebuilding
sector. Some may consider that these payments may fall within
the meaning of ‘EU Political Expenditure’ as deﬁned by section
347A of the Companies Act 1985.

32 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Policy on payment of suppliers 
The nature of the Group’ s operations means that there 
is no single Group standard in respect of payment terms 
to suppliers. Generally, subsidiaries are responsible for
establishing payment terms with suppliers when entering 
into each transaction or series of linked transactions. In the
absence of dispute, valid payment requests are met as
expeditiously as possible within such terms. This policy
continues to apply in 2007 . T rade creditor days for the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2006 were 32 days (2005: 
31 days), based on the ratio of year -end Group trade creditors
(excluding subcontract retentions and unagreed claims of 
£13.2 million (2005: £12.9 million) and land creditors, see Note
20 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) to amounts
invoiced during the year by trade creditors. The company had 
no signiﬁcant trade creditors at 31 December 2006.
Important events since the year -end 
Except for any matters referred to elsewhere in this Report and
Accounts, there have been no other important events affecting
the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings since the end
of the ﬁnancial year.
This report of the directors was approved by the Board of
directors on 19 February 2007 . 
Richard I Morbey
Secretary
19 February 2007  Corporate Governance Statement
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006  33
The company is committed to the principles of corporate
governance contained in the July 2003 FRC Combined Code on
Corporate Governance which is appended to the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority (‘the Code’) and for which
the Board is accountable to shareholders. 
Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2006, the company
has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in
section 1 of the Code. 
Statement about applying the Principles of Good
Governance 
In complying with the Code, the company has applied the Main
and Supporting Principles of Good Governance of the Code.
Further explanation of how these Principles have been applied
is set out below and, in connection with directors’
remuneration, in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The
Chairman’ s Statement and the Chief Executive’ s Review seek
to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the
company’ s position and prospects. 
The Board and its committees 
At the date of this report the Board consists of seven directors
whose names, responsibilities and other details appear on
pages 28 and 29. T wo of the directors are executive and ﬁve 
are non-executive. The Board discharges its responsibilities 
by providing strategic and entrepreneurial leadership of the
company, within a framework of prudent and effective controls,
which enables risk to be assessed and managed. It sets the
company’ s strategic aims, ensures that the necessary ﬁnancial
and human resources are in place for the company to meet its
objectives and reviews management performance. It also
deﬁnes the company’ s values and standards and ensures that
its obligations to its shareholders and other stakeholders are
understood and met. 
The following documents have been published on the
company’ s website and outline the way the Board and its
committees operate, which the Board reviews at least annually: 
• Schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved for the decision 
of the Board; 
• Board policies covering operational matters, compliance 
and stakeholder policies;
• T erms of Reference of the Nomination, Audit and
Remuneration Committees, which outline their objectives
and responsibilities and which deﬁne a programme of
activities to support the discharge of those responsibilities. 
The Board has also adopted a framework of delegated
commercial and operational authorities, which deﬁne the scope
and powers of the Chief Executive and of operating
management. All directors have access to the advice and
services of the Company Secretary and the Board has
established a procedure whereby directors may take
independent professional advice at the company’ s expense
where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities
as directors. 
Board and committee balance, independence and
effectiveness
It is the company’ s policy that appointments to the Board are
made on merit and through a formal, rigorous and transparent
process against objective criteria recommended by the
Nomination Committee. The committee guides the whole
Board in arranging orderly succession for appointments to the
Board and to senior management. The work of all Board
committees is described later in this Statement.
There is a clearly established division of responsibilities
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive, set out in
writing, agreed by the Board, implemented by regular review
meetings between these ofﬁcers and validated by the Board
performance evaluation process. 
The Chairman is also Chairman of IMI plc, a FTSE 250 company.
The Board is satisﬁed that none of the other commitments of
the Chairman or other Board members detract from the extent
or quality of time which they are able to devote to the company. 
The appointment of all non-executive directors is for a speciﬁed
term and re-appointment is not automatic. During the three
years up to and including the 2007 Annual General Meeting,
every director will have sought re-election at least once. The
Board has reviewed and re-afﬁrmed that it considers all of the
non-executive directors, including the Chairman, to be
independent in character and judgement. Whenever any
director considers that he is or may be interested in any
contract or arrangement to which the company is or may be a
party, he gives due notice to the Board in accordance with the
Articles of Association. The Board has determined that any such
interests as may have arisen during the year are not material to
the director or to the companies concerned. 
The directors possess an appropriate balance of skills and
experience for the requirements of the business. The Board and
its committees operate within a framework of scheduled core
meetings and additional ad hoc meetings are held as required. 
In addition to formal meetings, the directors also participate in
an annual strategic planning away day at which strategic and
ﬁnancial plans are reviewed and developed. All directors visit
the company’ s operations on a regular basis, engaging with
employees at all levels in order to foster and maintain an
understanding of the business. 
The members of the Board and its committees, together with
their attendances at the core meetings during 2006 are shown
on the following page. The Company Secretary is also secretary
to the Board’ s committees.  Corporate Governance Statement continued
34 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Information and professional development 
The company has procedures whereby directors (including 
non-executive directors) receive formal induction, training and
continuing familiarisation about the company’ s business,
operations and systems, the principles underlying the discharge
of their duties as directors and wider issues relating to the
housing and construction sector. T raining needs are identiﬁed
and implemented. 
Performance evaluation of the Board, its committees 
and other functions 
In November and December 2006 the directors carried out the
fourth annual evaluation of the performance and effectiveness
of the Board and its committees, of individual directors and of
the internal and external auditors. The evaluations were
performed using the following framework: 
The Board, its members and its committees:
The evaluation of effectiveness of the Board and its committees
focused on a number of areas, including those concerned with
best practice based on the principles of the Combined Code
and good governance principles. The evaluation particularly
addressed commercial and operational effectiveness and the
interaction between the Board, the executive team and the
business. The evaluation was carried out by the Company
Secretary through structured, scored interviews with each
director, also taking soundings from the other members of the
Executive Committee. Additionally, the non-executive directors,
led by the senior independent director, met without the
Chairman present to appraise the Chairman’ s performance. 
The Chairman also held meetings with the non-executive
directors without the executives present. 
The directors reviewed the ﬁndings of the Board and committee
assessments in January 2007 and concurred with the
conclusions that Board members demonstrate commitment
and give sound guidance and direction to the business and that
the Board committees operate effectively. The evaluation found
that the quality of the Board’ s processes is high, that there had
been continuing improvement in the Board’ s scrutiny of the
company’ s risk management processes and that there had
been further improvement in the quality of business reporting.
Through the evaluation, the Board has set speciﬁc objectives for
2007 and has re-intensiﬁed its focus on succession planning
and further developing the interface with management.
The Risk Management and Audit (RMA) function: 
An evaluation of the internal RMA function was carried out
through consultation with the members of the Audit
Committee, the external auditors and the head of function. In
addition, management provided feedback. The evaluation, which
was reviewed by the Audit Committee in January 2007 , judged
the effectiveness of the performance of the function to be very
strong, demonstrably independent and well-managed. The
Audit Committee assessed the function to be excellent. 
The external auditors: 
An evaluation of the external auditors was carried out through
consultation with Board and Audit Committee members and
with senior management. The evaluation, which was reviewed
by the Audit Committee in November 2006, found the
performance of the external auditors to be very satisfactory.
Board committees and their work
Remuneration Committee and remuneration
The Board’ s policy and approach to the setting of remuneration
for directors and senior executives and the activities of the
Remuneration Committee are described in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 45. 
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee and their attendance
at meetings during 2006 are shown on page 34. The Nomination
Committee focused its main efforts during the year on succession
planning for the Board and senior management and, utilising
executive search consultants, the recruitment of the Group Chief
Executive and the President of the North American operation. In
addition the committee reviewed the balance of the Board’ s
composition.

Audit Committee and auditors 
The members of the Audit Committee are shown on page 34.
All members are independent non-executive directors. The
Board has determined that Andrew Dougal, the committee
Chairman, who is a member of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland, has recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience. The Chairman of the company, the Chief Executive,
Finance Director, Head of RMA, Group Financial Controller,
Katherine Innes Ker, representatives of the external auditors,
and senior executives of major Group companies attend
meetings of the committee by invitation.
The committee’ s remit includes reviewing the internal control
framework, the internal audit process, the ﬁnancial reporting
practices and the external audit process. It ensures that the
Board regularly assesses business risks, and their management
and mitigation. In doing so, the committee places reliance on
regular reports from the Executive Risk Committee whose
activities are described below. In monitoring the ﬁnancial
reporting practices the Audit Committee reviewed accounting
policies, areas of judgement, the going concern assumption
and compliance with accounting standards and the
requirements of the Code. The committee also reviewed, prior
to publication, the interim and annual ﬁnancial statements and
other major statements affecting the Group concerning price-
sensitive information. 
Appointment of the auditors for non-audit services 
The Audit Committee has approved a policy on employing the
auditors to provide services other than audit services, which 
is to require a competitive tender except in narrowly-deﬁned
circumstances where the company considers that for
conﬁdentiality, past knowledge or other reasons, there is an
advantage in using a single tender procurement procedure. 
The committee has determined that the following assignments
should not be undertaken by the auditors: 
• the provision of internal audit services; 
• advice on large IT systems. 
The Board is satisﬁed that this policy is conducive to the
maintenance of auditor independence and objectivity. 
Other Group committees 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee consists of all the executive directors
of the company, senior executives of major Group companies
and senior function heads. The Chief Executive chairs its
meetings. The committee meets monthly and directs, controls
and reviews the ﬁnancial and operational performance of all
Group companies and divisions, and key issues relating to
human resources, communications and legal matters. It deﬁnes
and recommends to the Board forward-looking business plans
and budgets. Within the delegated authorities framework, the
fortnightly investment sub-committee meetings review all
major investment proposals affecting the Group’ s business. 
The Group has a number of other committees which 
co-ordinate activities in areas such as risk management,
Corporate Social Responsibility improvement (including health,
safety and environmental matters), information technology
developments and other key activities. 
Internal control 
The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing
a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing
the signiﬁcant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly
reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of
the year to the date of approval of this report and which is in
accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for directors on the
Code published in July 2003. The Board is responsible for the
Group’ s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material mis-statement or loss. 
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Board
regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’ s system of
internal control. The Board’ s monitoring covers all controls,
including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and risk
management. This process is based principally on reviewing
reports from management to consider whether signiﬁcant risks
are identiﬁed, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether
any signiﬁcant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate
a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also
performed a speciﬁc assessment for the purpose of this Report
and Accounts. This assessment considers all signiﬁcant aspects
of internal control arising during the period covered by the
report including the work of RMA. The Audit Committee assists
the Board in discharging its review responsibilities. Key
elements of the system of internal control are detailed below.
A Group-level review is carried out by the members of the
Executive Committee to identify the major risks facing the
Group and to develop and implement appropriate initiatives 
to manage those risks. This process applies across the Group. 
Key operational and ﬁnancial risks are identiﬁed and assessed 
at the operating process level, while strategic risks are identiﬁed
as a part of the business planning process. Strategic risk
reviews are carried out in each of the operating divisions to
identify business risk, evaluate existing controls and develop
strategies to manage the risks that remain, the results of which
form part of the Board’ s assessment. Updates to these risk
assessments are reported to the Executive Committee. 
An Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Finance Director,
reports to the Executive Committee. This committee, which 
has formally agreed terms of reference, oversees the risk and
control framework of the Group and monitors the response 
to key risk issues identiﬁed through the assessment process.
The committee meets monthly and its ﬁndings are reviewed 
by the Audit Committee as part of an overall process whereby
assurance is obtained about the integrity of the risk
management and internal control process. During 2006 the
committee assessed the risk management and the internal
control framework of the T aylor Woodrow Group, reviewed
business change issues and RMA activities and received
presentations from process owners covering 27 areas of the
business.  Corporate Governance Statement continued
36 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Management 
The Chief Executive has responsibility for preparing and
reviewing a three-year corporate plan and the annual budgets.
These are subject to formal approval by the Board. Budgets are
re-examined in comparison with business forecasts throughout
the year to ensure they are sufﬁciently robust to reﬂect the
possible impact of changing economic circumstances. The
Chief Executive and the Board conduct regular and systematic
reviews of actual results and future projections with comparison
against budget and prior year, together with various treasury
reports. Disputes that may give rise to signiﬁcant litigation or
contractual claims are monitored monthly. 
The Chief Executive conducts quarterly business performance
reviews, at which an assessment is made of the progress
against objectives, changes to operational risk and adequacy 
of control. The Group has clearly-deﬁned policies, processes
and procedures governing all areas of the business, which are
accessible using a web-enabled intranet tool, which also
facilitates continuous improvement. An owner is identiﬁed for
each process, responsible for risk assessment and process
effectiveness. Operational compliance responsibilities are also
assigned to individual managers. For each process, key
operational controls have been identiﬁed and these are subject
to self-assessment. Deﬁned authority limits are in place. In
particular, any investment in land, property and other signiﬁcant
assets, including acquisitions and disposals, require detailed
appraisals and are subject to deﬁned authorisation levels and
post-investment review procedures. Investment decisions,
including Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, and tenders 
for contracts are subject to approval by the Board, the Chief
Executive or subsidiary operating management, depending 
on the value and nature of the investment or contract.
There is a clearly identiﬁable organisational structure and a
framework of delegated authority approved by the Board within
which individual responsibilities of senior executives of Group
companies are identiﬁed and can be monitored. The RMA
function oversees a programme of Controls Self Assessments
across the UK Development, Construction and North American
businesses. These activities are reinforced through process
compliance and other audits conducted by RMA. 
The RMA function reviews the effectiveness and efﬁciency of
the systems of internal control in place to safeguard the assets,
to quantify, price, transfer, avoid or mitigate risks and to monitor
the activities of the Group in accomplishing established
objectives. Regular reports from these reviews are provided to
the Board and reported to the Chief Executive, Audit Committee
and management, who consider them on a regular basis. The
Head of the RMA function has direct access to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and the Chairman and the Chief
Executive. A database of audit recommendations and
improvement initiatives is maintained. A monthly follow up
routine ensures that such improvements are implemented in 
a timely manner. 
Throughout the year the Board continually considers the
effectiveness of the Group’ s internal control systems. On 15
February 2007 it completed the annual assessment for the year
to 31 December 2006 by reviewing evidence from the Audit
Committee, operating divisions, RMA, and by taking account 
of events since the year -end. 
The annual employee performance appraisal process is
objective-based, with individual objectives cascaded down from
the appropriate business objectives. Development reviews
identify training needs to support achievement of objectives. 
Whistleblowing
The Group’ s whistleblowing policy is supported in the UK by 
an externally-facilitated procedure – ‘Safecall’ – through which
employees of the company may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns
about possible improprieties in ﬁnancial reporting or other
matters. Safecall is widely publicised within the company.
During 2006, 22 calls were made to Safecall, covering issues
including allegations of inappropriate personal behaviours in 
the workplace and other operational matters. All cases were
investigated by the Head of RMA and the closure and
outcomes reported to the Audit Committee. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board actively seeks and encourages engagement with
major institutional shareholders and other stakeholders and has
put in place arrangements designed to facilitate contact about
business, governance, remuneration and other issues. This
provides the opportunity for meetings with the Chairman, the
Senior Independent Director as well as the Chief Executive,
Finance Director and other executives in order to establish a
mutual understanding of objectives. The company also operates
a structured programme of investor relations, based on formal
announcements and publications covering the full year and
interim results. There are associated brieﬁngs for stockbroking
analysts and investors, the presentation material for which is
published on the company’ s website www.taylorwoodrow.com.
All directors receive formal reports and brieﬁngs during the year
about the company’ s investor relations programme and receive
detailed feedback through surveys, direct contact and other
means, through which they are able to develop an understanding
of the views of major shareholders about the company.
The Board encourages all shareholders to participate in the
Annual General Meeting. Information about the company 
and the Group, including full year and interim results and other
major announcements, is published on the company’ s website
www.taylorwoodrow.com.
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement
at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, that there 
is a reasonable expectation that the Group and the company
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
ﬁnancial statements.  Directors’ Remuneration Report
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006  37
Introduction
This Report describes the principles and practices applied by
the Board in setting and implementing the Group’ s reward and
incentive arrangements. It has been prepared in accordance
with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (‘the Act’) and
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. In it, we also describe how the
Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating 
to directors’ remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution
to approve the Report will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting of the company on 2 May 2007 .
The Act requires the auditors to report to the company’ s
shareholders on certain parts of the Report and to state
whether in their opinion those parts of the Report have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Act. The Report has
therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited 
and audited information. 
Unaudited information:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is constituted in accordance 
with the recommendations of the Combined Code. Its principal
terms of reference are to establish and maintain formal and
transparent procedures for developing policy on executive
remuneration and for ﬁxing the remuneration packages of
individual directors, and to monitor and report on them. In
discharging these duties, it makes recommendations to the
Board. The committee’ s remit includes:
• agreeing performance thresholds and targets;
• determining the remuneration of the Chief Executive,
executive directors and senior executives of the Group;
• determining amounts payable under the Bonus Plan;
• agreeing awards under the company’ s discretionary 
share-based reward plans.
The members of the committee during the ﬁnancial year were
Katherine Innes Ker (Committee Chairman), Norman Askew,
Mike Davies and Vernon Sankey, all of whom are independent
non-executive directors. Their details, including attendances at
meetings held during 2006, are listed in the Corporate
Governance Statement on page 34. None of the committee
members has any personal ﬁnancial interest other than as
shareholders, conﬂicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
No director plays a part in any decisions about his own
remuneration.
During 2006, the committee reviewed the current and proposed
remuneration and reward structure for executive directors and
senior managers. It considered the structure of the bonus plan,
the performance share plan and the associated deferred share
arrangements and oversaw the implementation of UK and
overseas share plans. Sub-committees were established 
to deal with routine administration and discretionary matters.
Advice to the committee and the company
In determining the directors’ remuneration for the year, the
committee drew on advice from T owers Perrin on directors’
remuneration packages. T owers Perrin who were appointed 
in 2003 received fees during 2006 totalling £16,500 (2005:
£1 1,000) They did not provide any other services to the
company or the Group. 
During 2006, the committee appointed New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP (NBS) to advise them on remuneration policy,
competitive levels and forms of pay and incentive plans for
executive directors; to review all equity-based and long-term
incentive plans; and to advise the committee of developments
and best practices in the areas of both remuneration and related
corporate governance requirements. NBS received fees in
respect of their services in 2006 totalling £35,000. They did not
provide any other services to the company or the Group. 
The committee also consulted Iain Napier as Chief Executive
and Alec Luhaste, the Group Director of Human Resources. 
KPMG LLP advised the company on executive pay and
practices, including share-based reward and on the valuation 
of the company’ s share plans for the purposes of IFRS 2. 
They received fees in respect of these services in 2006 
totalling £71,300 (2005: £55,700).
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
and other senior executives
The company’ s executive remuneration packages are designed
to be attractive, so as to motivate and retain high quality
management and to reward them for achieving a high level of
corporate performance in line with the best interests of
shareholders. The performance assessment of the executive
directors and key members of senior management and the
determination of their annual remuneration package is
undertaken by the committee. The remuneration packages of
the executive directors and senior management include a
signiﬁcant element of performance-related incentive
remuneration, set against challenging business performance
objectives. The committee has procedures in place to monitor
the size of potential pay awards. In 2006, the proportion of ﬁxed
pay of the executive directors was 56.1 per cent (2005: 58.3 per
cent) and variable pay was 43.9 per cent (2005: 41 .7 per cent).
The committee reviews annually the basis and component
parts of executives’ reward to ensure that they remain
appropriate and competitive. 
Subject to prior Board approval, executive directors are entitled
to accept one board appointment of an external listed company.
During 2006, Iain Napier and Peter Johnson were respectively
non-executive directors of Imperial T obacco Group plc (ITG) and
Shanks Group plc, from which they received the following fees:
Iain Napier £85,000 (2005: £77 ,500) (£20,000 of these fees, less
statutory deduction, was applied in the purchase of ITG shares.)
Peter Johnson £32,083 (2005: £18,885 (part year)). Peter
Johnson became a director of Oriel Securities Limited on 
20 December 2006 and received fees of £1,042 in respect 
of that period.
The Board has agreed that they may retain these fees.
Basic salary
The committee reviews the basic salaries of executive directors
and members of the Executive Committee annually and
whenever an individual changes position or responsibility. In
deciding appropriate levels, the committee makes its
judgement drawing on objective research from T owers Perrin
which gives up-to-date information on FTSE 150, FTSE 100 to
150 companies, and an industry-speciﬁc comparator group
comprising 26 companies representing the housing,
development and construction industry. The comparator group Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
38 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
consists of Amec, Balfour Beatty, Barratt Developments,
Bellway Homes, Berkeley Group Holdings, Bovis Homes Group,
British Land, Costain, Crest Nicholson, Galliford T ry, George
Wimpey, Hammerson, Hanson, John Laing, Kier Group,
Lafarge, Lend Lease, Liberty International, M J Gleeson,
McCarthy & Stone, Mowlem, Persimmon, Redrow Group,
RMC, Slough Estates and Wilson Bowden. 
Beginning with our principle of paying market median base pay
and median to upper -quartile total compensation, the
committee considers this research and its own judgement
when determining appropriate levels of remuneration, taking
into account the scale and scope of individuals’ responsibilities
and corporate performance. Basic salaries were reviewed in
November 2006 with any consequent changes being made
from 1 January 2007 . Reviews take account of the level of
remuneration elsewhere in the business. 
Executive directors’ contracts of service, which include details
of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual
General Meeting and generally as described in the 2007 Annual
General Meeting circular. 
Other beneﬁts, including beneﬁts-in-kind
The executive directors receive additional beneﬁts, principally 
a company-provided car or an allowance in lieu, life assurance,
private medical insurance and participation in an Income
Protection Plan. Beneﬁts-in-kind are not pensionable. 
Annual bonus and the deferred bonus plan
The company gives the opportunity for executive directors 
and senior managers to earn performance-related bonuses. 
The annual targets and objectives that must be met for each
ﬁnancial year are set by the committee, drawing on research 
by NBS. Account is also taken of the relative success of the
different parts of the business for which the executive directors
are responsible and the extent to which the overall strategic 
and operational objectives set by the Board are being met.
The maximum bonus award that can be made to an executive
director in any one year is currently 100 per cent of salary. 2006
bonus awards were dependent upon the achievement of a
number of ‘stretch’ business-speciﬁc and personal targets. 
The targets include factors which the Board considers to be
commercially conﬁdential if disclosed in detail, but which are
summarised as follows: 
• Achievement of speciﬁed levels of proﬁt before tax for 2006.
A signiﬁcant element of the bonus is dependent on this
target;
• Achievement of improvement in health and safety
performance, measured through safety management
performance and site inspection results;
• Achievement of speciﬁed customer satisfaction ratings;
• Other important and relevant business measures, including
return on capital employed, divisional operating proﬁt and
speciﬁc personal objectives.
The majority of the targets were achieved. 
Bonus awards for executive directors for 2006 ranged from 
92 per cent to 99 per cent of basic 2006 salary (2005: 7 4.3 
per cent to 98.2 per cent) and for other Executive Committee
members from 79 per cent to 97 per cent of basic 2006 salary
(2005: 45 per cent to 79 per cent). 
For 2007 , bonus targets have been set based broadly on the
2006 framework 
No bonus or deferred bonus is pensionable. 
Deferred Bonus Plan share matching award 
The committee considers that share ownership by executive
directors and senior executives strengthens the link between
their interests and those of the company’ s shareholders. For the
2006 ﬁnancial year the executive directors and selected senior
executives had the opportunity of participating in the deferred
bonus plan by investing some or all of their pre-tax bonus in the
purchase of shares in the company on either a gross or net
voluntary basis. If these shares remain undrawn for a period of
three years, the company will match them on a one for one
basis, provided that Group Earnings per share (EPS) shall have
grown by at least three per cent compound in real terms during
the ﬁnancial years 2006 - 2008. EPS is calculated using the
adjusted basic earnings per share as shown in Note 9 to the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Executive share-based reward
The Performance Share Plan
In order to incentivise executive directors and other senior
executives, the company has established a Performance Share
Plan (PSP). The Remuneration Committee is responsible for
supervising the plan and for granting or recommending of
awards under the PSP . Conditional awards of shares are made
to participants, entitling them to receive shares of the company
at no direct cost. Vesting occurs on the third anniversary of the
award, provided that the performance criterion is fulﬁlled. The
current plan rules have an over -riding limit for awards of 200 per
cent of basic salary per annum. The current general policy is to
restrict awards to 125 per cent, other than in exceptional
circumstances, such as senior level recruitment.
The PSP contains two elements: basic awards, which under
current policy are restricted to a current maximum of 75 per
cent of basic salary and additional enhanced awards, which
under current policy are restricted to a current maximum of 
50 per cent of basic salary. The enhanced awards, introduced
in 2005, are made on a discretionary basis to members of the
Executive Committee, including the executive directors. The
vesting criteria for these awards are as follows:  Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006  39
In 2006, conditional awards were made to 286 participants
(2005: 296), including two executive directors, in respect of a
total of 2,120,036 shares (2005: 2,644,102). Of these,1,910,642
were basic awards (2005: 2,356,526) and 209,394 were
enhanced awards (2005: 287 ,576). 
The performance criteria, which apply to all participants 
in the PSP , were chosen because EPS is considered to be an
appropriate indicator of management’ s success in advancing
the performance of the business. EPS is calculated as
described in Note 9 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
TSR was selected in order to incentivise improvement in
performance relative to the PSP peer group, whilst continuing
to focus on earnings growth. The peer group for this purpose
consists of: Barratt Developments, Bellway, Berkeley Group
Holdings, Bovis Homes Group, Crest Nicholson, George
Wimpey, McCarthy & Stone, Persimmon, Redrow Group 
and Wilson Bowden.
The company’ s performance against these criteria is calculated
by the Group Financial Controller from audited EPS and
published RPI data and veriﬁed by the Remuneration
Committee. 
The company is currently examining the present reward
arrangements for the senior management team and other key
executives in all of our markets. The review is focusing on
driving superior economic performance and includes
consideration of alternatives to the current Annual and Deferred
Bonus Plans and the Performance Share Plan.
The Board will announce its intentions once the review has
been concluded and will consult appropriately with
shareholders.
Executive Share Option Plan 
The T aylor Woodrow Executive Share Option Plan was
suspended on 9 October 2003 and is now closed for new
awards. 
All-employee share plans
United Kingdom
The company operates a Sharesave Plan under which all UK
team members with at least three months’ service can save 
up to £250 per month and receive three or ﬁve year options 
to acquire the company’ s shares priced at a discount of up to 
20 per cent of market value. During 2006, 1,063 employees 
(25 per cent of those eligible) (2005: 847) applied to join the
Plan. Options were granted over 1,409,702 shares 
(2005: 1,1 10,690) at an option price of 278.8p per share. 
A UK Share Purchase Plan was introduced in 2004, under which
all UK team members with at least three months’ service are
permitted to invest up to £1,500 per annum of their pre-tax
earned income in the purchase of partnership shares of the
company. Such shares, if held for a period of three years, attract
an award of free matching shares. Currently participants receive
one matching share for each partnership share purchased.
During 2006, 1,213 participants contributed to the Plan
(2005:1,162) and purchased 303,313 shares (2005: 332,622).
The executive directors are eligible to participate in these 
all-employee plans. 
Overseas Plans
During 2005, the company implemented an all-employee stock
purchase plan in the United States and introduced a share
incentive plan in Canada in 2006.
The United States Plan is based broadly on the UK Sharesave
Plan and entitles participants to contribute funds of up to a US$
amount equivalent to £3,000 per year of their post-tax income
to purchase shares of the company at a discount of 15 per cent
to the relevant market price. 
The Canadian Plan is based broadly on the UK Share Purchase
Plan and will entitle participants to contribute funds of up to a
Can$ amount equivalent to £1,500 per year of their post-tax
income to purchase shares of the company which, if held for a
period of three years, would be matched by the company.
Other matters affecting share plans
The rules of the PSP , the Deferred Bonus Plan, the Executive
Share Option Plan and the company’ s all-employee share plans
referred to above provide for the early vesting or exercise of
share entitlements in the event of a participant’ s death or
cessation of employment because of a change of control,
disability, redundancy or normal retirement. 
During 2006 the Board amended the Rules of the Deferred
Bonus Plan, Performance Share Plan and Sharesave Plan to
comply with the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006
to remove the prohibition on granting awards to employees
who are within one year of retirement and to set age 65 as the
normal retirement age for the purposes of those plans.

Pension arrangements
Details of the Group’ s principal UK pension schemes are given
in Note 20 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Following changes to the taxation treatment of UK pension
schemes in April 2006, the company reviewed the
appropriateness of pension provision for all employees. This
review resulted in a number of employees withdrawing from
company pension arrangements. In such circumstances the
company maintains lump sum life assurance cover and pays an
additional salary allowance/supplement to the employee equal
to the pension contribution that the company would otherwise
have paid.
Of the executive directors, Iain Napier and Graeme McCallum
withdrew respectively from the Personal Choice Plan (PCP) 
and the T aylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance
Fund. They both retain beneﬁts accrued up to April 2006 in
these pension arrangements.
T aylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund 
The Fund was closed to new entrants from 31 March 2002.
With effect from 1 September 2004, a restriction was applied
so as to limit the amount of any increase in pensionable salary
of members of this scheme to the lesser of the actual increase
in basic salary or the RPI, subject to a maximum of 5 per cent
per annum. The Fund ceased accrual of beneﬁts on 30
November 2006 and from 1 December 2006 existing active
Fund members were invited to participate in the PCP , referred 
to below and to which members and the company contribute. 
At 31 December 2006 Graeme McCallum was a deferred
member of the Wilson Connolly Holdings section of the Fund.
Details of Graeme McCallum’ s accrued pension entitlements
under the Fund and the opening and closing transfer values of
his accrued pension rights are shown in the tables of directors’
pension entitlements on page 45. 
The company contributed a sum to an individual deﬁned
contribution top up arrangement for each member calculated 
on the full basic salary. The company’ s contributions in respect
of Graeme McCallum for the three months to 31 March 2006
totalled £880 (2005: £2,603). 
T aylor Woodrow Personal Choice Plan 
With effect from 1 April 2002 the company introduced the PCP ,
a deﬁned contribution Pension Scheme which all new eligible
UK team members are invited to join. 
During the year, Iain Napier and Peter Johnson were members
of the PCP , although Iain Napier withdrew from the Plan in April
2006. The company contributed to their plans at the rate of 38
per cent and 34.5 per cent respectively of their basic salary for
the relevant periods and these Directors each contributed at the
rate of 5 per cent for those periods.
Pensions of former directors
Denis Mac Daid retired from the Board on 30 June 2005. His
pension is calculated with an assumed retirement date of 5
April 2006. The difference between beneﬁts calculated at that
date and Fund beneﬁts at his actual date of retirement is being
paid by the company to him by monthly instalments. The annual
equivalent of this payment is £19,260. This additional payment
will increase on 1 May annually in line with increases awarded
by the T rustees on Mr Mac Daid’ s main Fund beneﬁts and the
ﬁrst such increase was paid on 1 May 2006. The additional
payment also attracts dependents’ beneﬁts in line with his 
Fund pension. 
Iain Napier retired from the board on 31December 2006 but 
will remain employed by the company until 30 April 2007 . 
Graeme McCallum retired from the Board and the company 
on attaining his normal retirement age on 16 January 2007 . 
No other arrangements were made during the year for the
provision of pensions for former directors.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the company’ s performance,
measured by total shareholder return for the ﬁve-year period 
to 31 December 2006, compared with the performance of the
FTSE 250 Share Index also measured by total shareholder 
return. The FTSE 250 Share Index has been selected for this
comparison because the company is a constituent of that Index
and in order to provide consistency of comparison with the
2005 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Directors’ contracts
It is the company’ s policy that executive directors should have
contracts of employment providing for a maximum of one
year’ s notice. However, it may be necessary occasionally to
offer longer notice periods to new directors. Where this arises, 
it is the company’ s policy to reduce the notice period to one
year within one year of appointment of the director.
T erms and conditions of appointment of all directors are
available for inspection as described in the 2007 Annual General
Meeting circular to shareholders. 
The details of the directors’ contracts are summarised in the
table below:
Non-executive directors
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract, 
as their terms of engagement are regulated by letters of
appointment as follows:
Their fees are determined by the Board based on research of
fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies within
the FTSE 150 index and the sector peer group, subject to the
aggregate annual limit of £600,000 imposed by the Articles of
Association and are reviewed at two-yearly intervals. The
Chairman’ s fees were increased on 1 July 2005 from £150,000
to £170,000 per annum and will be reviewed in July 2007 . The
basic fees of each non-executive director were previously
reviewed in January 2005 and were increased on 1 January
2007 from £39,000 to £45,000. The Senior Independent
Director and the Remuneration Committee Chairman each
receive an additional fee of £5,000 and the Audit Committee
Chairman receives an additional fee of £10,000 in respect of
these services. Non-executive directors cannot participate 
in any of the company’ s share option plans and are not eligible
to join the company’ s pension scheme.

* Ian Smith’s contract contains a provision, which was agreed to in connection with his recruitment, that the company shall not serve notice before the earlier 
of the date of the first PSP award made to him and 31 December 2007.
It is the company’s policy that liquidated damages should not apply on the termination of an executive director’s contract. In accordance with this approach, payment
for early termination of contract (without cause) by the company is, in the case of each of the executive directors, to be determined in accordance with normal
principles of English law, which requires mitigation of liability on a case-by-case basis. Any such payment would typically be determined by reference to the main
elements of a director’s remuneration, namely: salary; contractual bonus; benefits-in-kind; and pension entitlements. The executive directors' contracts contain no
express provisions relating to a change of control of the company. In such event the directors’ rights and entitlements would be ascertained as stated above.

There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for outstanding share options during the 
financial year. 
The performance criteria relating to the Deferred Bonus Plan and the Performance Share Plan appear earlier in this Directors’
Remuneration Report. These plans replaced the Executive Bonus Plan and Executive Share Option Plan, which were subject 
to EPS–related performance conditions.
Awards vesting under the Executive Bonus Plan and Executive Share Option Plan in 2006 achieved the EPS-related performance
conditions and were consequently able to be exercised in full.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2006 was 426.25p and the range during the year was 303.25p to 436p.

19 February 2007 Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
46 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and Accounts and the ﬁnancial statements. The directors are
required to prepare accounts for the Group in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and have
chosen to prepare company ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(UK GAAP).
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the directors are required to
prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and 
of the proﬁt or loss of the company for that period. In preparing
these ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the ﬁnancial statements;
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the company, for safeguarding the
assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation
of a Directors’ Report and Directors’ Remuneration Report
which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
In the case of IFRS accounts International Accounting Standard
1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each
ﬁnancial year the company’ s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial
performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the
International Accounting Standards Board’ s ‘Framework for the
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’ . In
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by
compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting
Standards. Directors are also required to:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
speciﬁc requirements in International Financial Reporting
Standards is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions
on the entity’ s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance;
• Prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having
assessed the ability of the company to continue as a going
concern, management either intends to liquidate the entity or
to cease trading, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of T aylor Woodrow plc
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006  47
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of T aylor
Woodrow plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 which
comprise the Income Statement, the Balance Sheet, the Cash
Flow Statement, the Statement of Recognised Income and
Expense, the related notes 1 to 35 and the reconciliation of
changes in shareholders’ equity. These Group ﬁnancial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Directors' Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial
statements of T aylor Woodrow plc for the year ended 31
December 2006. 
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’ s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors' Remuneration Report and the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors'
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group
ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation and whether the part of the directors' remuneration
report described as having been audited has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in 
the Directors' Report is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial
statements. The information given in the Directors' Report
includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Chief
Executive’ s Review that is cross referred from the Introduction
to the Directors' Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reﬂects the company's compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2003 Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board's
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
as described in the contents section and consider whether 
it is consistent with the audited Group ﬁnancial statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the Group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors'
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made
by the directors in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group's circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁnancial statements and
the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited
are free from material mis-statement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 December 2006 
and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
• the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation; 
• the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report described as
having been audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; 
• the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent
with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in the accounting policies note to the Group
ﬁnancial statements, the Group in addition to complying with 
its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union, has also complied with the IFRSs as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board. In our opinion
the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group's affairs as 
at 31 December 2006 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended.
Deloitte & T ouche LLP
Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors 
London, UK
19 February 2007 48 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with applicable International Accounting Standards
(IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted for use in the European Union and as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board. 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on
the historical cost basis, except where stated below. The
principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial
statements of the company and entities controlled by the
company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to
govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an investee entity
so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. The existence and
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or
convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group
controls another entity.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair
values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deﬁciency of the cost of acquisition below the fair
values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on
acquisition) is credited to proﬁt and loss in the period of
acquisition. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the
minority’ s proportion of the fair values of the assets and
liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the
minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated
against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included in the consolidated income statement from
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of
disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are
made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses
are eliminated on consolidation. 
Joint ventures are consolidated under the equity accounting
method rather than the alternative treatment of proportionate
consolidation allowed under IAS 31 ‘Interests in joint ventures’ . 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the
cost of acquisition over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of
the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly
controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in
proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or jointly-controlled entity, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill
written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not
been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and
after eliminating sales within the Group. 
Revenue and proﬁt are recognised as follows:
(a) Private housing development properties and land sales.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable on legal completion.
(b) Contracting work.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be
estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by
reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at
the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of
work performed to date. Variations in contract work, claims and
incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable
that they will result in revenue and they are capable of being
reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent
of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in
which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract
costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is
recognised as an expense immediately.
T ender costs for construction
Signiﬁcant tender costs are treated as recoverable once the
directors consider that it is probable that the contract will be
won. This is presumed to be when preferred bidder status is
awarded. 
Foreign currencies
The individual statements of each Group company are
presented in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its functional currency).
T ransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies other than
the functional currency are retranslated at the rates prevailing
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair
value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation
are included in net proﬁt or loss for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’ s
overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing
on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are
translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless Accounting Policies continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006  49
exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly when a monthly average
exchange rate is used instead. Exchange differences arising 
are classiﬁed as reserves and transferred to the Group’ s
translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised
as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation 
is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected
to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as assets and
liabilities denominated in the functional currency of the
company in which they arise.
The Group enters into forward contracts and currency options
in order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange
transaction risks relating to the functional currency in
accordance with Group policy. It also uses foreign currency
borrowings and currency swaps to hedge its net investment
exposure to certain overseas subsidiaries (see below for details
of the Group’ s accounting policies in respect of such derivative
ﬁnancial instruments).
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Beneﬁts received and receivable (and costs paid and payable) 
as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Property and plant
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of
goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in
the balance sheet at their revalued amounts, being the fair value
at the date of revaluation, determined from market-based
evidence by appraisal undertaken by professional valuers, less
any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent
accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are performed
with sufﬁcient regularity such that the carrying amount does not
differ materially from that which would be determined using fair
values at the balance sheet date.
Any revaluation increase arising on the revaluation of such land
and buildings is credited to the properties revaluation reserve,
except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for
the same asset previously recognised as an expense, in which
case the increase is credited to the income statement to the
extent of the decrease previously charged. A decrease in
carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such land and
buildings is charged as an expense to the extent that it exceeds
the balance, if any, held in the properties revaluation reserve
relating to a previous revaluation of that asset.
On the subsequent sale or retirement of a revalued property,
the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in the properties
revaluation reserve is transferred directly to accumulated
proﬁts.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation
of assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is
charged, where material, on buildings over the expected useful
life of the asset. Other assets are depreciated using the
straight-line method, on the following bases:
Plant, ﬁxtures and equipment 20 - 25 per cent
Computer equipment 33 per cent
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in proﬁt
or loss.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the
Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
T rade receivables and other receivables
T rade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at
their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Financial Liability and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after
deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the
income statement using the effective interest method and are
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
T rade payables
T rade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are
stated at their nominal value. T rade payables on extended
terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair
value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of
the credit term and charged to ﬁnance costs.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency
options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings
and currency swaps to hedge its net investment exposure to
movements in exchange rates on translation of certain
individual ﬁnancial statements denominated in foreign
currencies other than pounds sterling which is the functional
currency of the company. Interest rate derivaties are used to
manage interest rate risk in respect of speciﬁc borrowings. 
The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for
speculative purposes. 50 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Accounting Policies continued
The use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s
policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide
written principles on the use of ﬁnancial derivatives. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that
are designated and effective as hedges of net investments in
foreign operations are recognised directly in reserves and the
ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the
income statement. 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair
value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value
attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding
entry in proﬁt or loss. Gains or losses from re-measuring 
the derivative, or for non-derivatives the foreign currency
component of its carrying amount, are recognised in proﬁt 
or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the
income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no
longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. At that time, any
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in
reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted transaction
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur,
the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in reserves is
transferred to the income statement for the period.
Inventories
Inventories, details of which are shown in Note 14, are stated 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Net
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in
marketing, selling and distribution.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently
payable and deferred tax.
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year.
T axable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’ s liability
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax
bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor
the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis using
the tax rates and laws that have then been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset
is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax 
is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement,
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in reserves.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based
payments’ . In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS
2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7
November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based
on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Employee beneﬁts
The Group accounts for pensions and similar beneﬁts under IAS
19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ . In respect of deﬁned beneﬁt plans,
obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst
plan assets are recorded at fair value. The operating and
ﬁnancing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the
income statement; service costs are spread systematically over
the lives of employees and ﬁnancing costs are recognised in the
periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income
and expense, rather than the ‘corridor method’ alternative
available under IAS 19. 
Payments to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged as an
expense as they fall due. Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006  51

1 . General information
T aylor Woodrow plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered
ofﬁce is given on page 90. The nature of the Group’ s operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 3 and in the Chief
Executive’ s Review on pages 5 to 27 .
These ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out on pages 48 and 49.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgments
Site valuations and work in progress
Internal site valuations are carried out at regular intervals throughout the year. The valuations will include an estimation of the costs
to complete and remaining revenues, in order to determine the proﬁt that the Group is able to recognise on the proportion of
completions in the period, for each development. In addition, the carrying value of work in progress can involve considerable
judgment around future margins from sites in assessing whether any impairment provisions need to be recognised.
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the
cash generating unit, the future growth rate of revenue and costs, and a suitable discount rate. The carrying amount of goodwill at
the balance sheet date was £363.1m.
Contracting work
Proﬁts in respect of contracts will be recognised by reference to the stage of completion when an estimate of a proﬁtable outcome
can be measured reliably. Determining the outcome of a contract will require a survey. This includes an estimate of the value of
costs to complete and in certain instances estimates of the contract price as well as any variations in the contract work.
Contingent liabilities
Note 31 describes an ongoing legal dispute in Florida. In making its judgment management considered the detailed criteria for 
the recognition of a provision set out in IAS 37 , and in particular the existence of a present obligation. Having taken legal advice, 
the directors are satisﬁed that recognition of a provision in the current year is not appropriate for all aspects of the dispute and that
some of the circumstances give rise to a possible obligation whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence of uncertain
future events.
Pensions
Note 20 details the main assumptions made for the accounting of the Group’ s deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes.
Tax
Aspects of tax accounting require considerable management judgment and interpretation of tax legislation across many
jurisdictions.

The fixed asset properties of the Group were valued as at 31 December 2006 by Knight Frank LLP , independent valuers not
connected with the Group, on a fair value basis in accordance with RICS valuation methodology, and that valuation was £9.6m. 
The income statement was credited with £1.4m of the £2.4m net surplus on revaluation in line with prior years’ deficit treatment. 
The revaluation surplus arises in a subsidiary and cannot be distributed to the parent due to legal restrictions in the United Kingdom.

15. Other ﬁnancial assets continued
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and, trade and other receivables, which represent the Group’s
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment 
of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is governed by Group policy that specifies the minimum credit
rating, maximum exposure and maximum tenor. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and
customers.

cent), thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk (see Chief Executive’s Review on pages 5 to 27).
Secured bank loans and overdrafts totalled £14.5m (2005: £6.8m). Secured bank loans and overdrafts are secured on certain fixed
asset properties and land.
The directors estimate the fair value of the Group’s bank borrowings to be equivalent to its book value.

18. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group has the following derivatives at 31 December 2006:
• Currency swaps relating to part of its 6.625 per cent bonds 2012 which have swapped £100m into US$160.5m to hedge
part of its investment in the United States of America and the interest on this has been swapped from 6.625 per cent to
floating rates based on US$ LIBOR applicable to periods of three months;
• Currency swaps relating to the 7.04 per cent loan notes 2008 acquired with Bryant Group plc in 2001. These notes were
issued by way of a US$81m 6.59 per cent fixed rate US private placement. The dollar proceeds were swapped into
£49.5m at a fixed rate of interest of 7.04 per cent;
• A five year collar, limiting the three month LIBOR interest rate to between 3.99 per cent and 6.5 per cent on £30m 
expired in December 2006;
• A ten year interest swap to December 2012, acquired with Wilson Connolly in 2003, on £35m from floating rate to a fixed
interest rate of 5.8 per cent;
• Forward contracts to hedge transaction risks and intra-group loans to buy US$1.2m and €16m against sterling.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of the Group’s derivatives is a net debtor of £6.1m (2005: £1.6m). These amounts are based 
on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date, comprising £15.2 m (2005: £6.7m) assets included in trade
and other receivables and £9.1m (2005: £5.1m) liabilities included in trade and other payables. The fair value of derivatives that are
designated and effective as net investment hedges amounting to £19.5m (2005: £7.2m) has been deferred in equity. Changes in
the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to £(1.8)m (2005: £0.5m) have been (credited) / charged to income 
in the year.

20. Retirement beneﬁt schemes
Retirement benefit obligation comprises gross pension liability of £205.9m (2005: £219.8m) and gross post-retirement health
care liability of £2.7m (2005: £2.7m).
The Group operates Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution pension schemes. In the UK, the T aylor Woodrow Group Pension
and Life Assurance Fund (TWGP&LAF) and the T aylor Woodrow NHS Pension Scheme (TWNHSPS) are funded Defined Benefit
schemes. The TWGP&LAF merged with the Bryant Group Pension Scheme (BGPS) on 24 June 2002 and with the Wilson
Connolly Holdings Pension Scheme (WCHPS), the Wainhomes Ltd Pension Scheme (WHLPS) and the Prestoplan Pension
Scheme (PPS) on 27 August 2004. The schemes are managed by trustees. All scheme assets are held separately from the
Group. With the exception of the TWNHSPS the Defined Benefit schemes are closed to new entrants and with effect from 
30 November 2006 to future pension accrual. An alternative Defined Contribution arrangement, the T aylor Woodrow Personal
Choice Plan, is offered to new employees and from 1 December 2006 to employees who previously accrued benefits in the
TWGP&LAF . Contributions of £6.7m (2005: £5.9m) were charged to income in respect of defined contribution schemes. The
Group also operates a number of overseas pension schemes of the defined benefit and defined contribution type.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the TWGP & LAF was carried out at 1 June 2004 and updated to 1 September 2004
to take account of subsequent mergers. The TWNHSPS commenced in December 2003 and the Actuary has completed his
initial valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2003. The projected unit method was used in all valuations and assets
were taken into account using market values. The next formal valuations of the TWGP&LAF and TWNHSPS are due to take place
on 1 June 2007 and 31 December 2006 respectively.
As part of the discussions with the T rustees of the TWGP&LAF around the closure of the scheme to future accrual, the Group
has agreed to increase deficit repair payments from the current level of £4.8m pa to £20m pa for the next 10 years. These
payments will be reviewed at each valuation. The first such payment was made on 19 December 2006. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2006

20. Retirement beneﬁt schemes continued
The main financial assumptions, which were used for the triennial funding valuation and are all relative to the inflation assumption,
are as set out below:
Assumptions TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS
Inflation 2.5% pa 2.5% pa
Investment return – pre/post retirement 5.0/3.0% pa 3.0/3.0% pa
General pay inflation 0% pa 1.0% pa
Pension increases 0% pa 0% pa
Valuation results TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS
Market value of assets £563.3m £0.05m
Past service liabilities £627.9m £0.09m
Scheme funding levels 90% 58%
The actuaries to each scheme calculated the long-term funding rates to be 16.0 per cent (TWGP&LAF) and 18 per cent (TWNHSPS)
of each scheme’s respective pensionable salary roll. 
The funding policy of the T rustees is to maintain a stable contribution rate with a funding level in excess of 100 per cent.
The valuations of the Group’s pension schemes have been updated to 31 December 2006 and the position of overseas schemes
has been included within the IAS 19 disclosures. The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items

The basis for the above assumptions are prescribed by IAS 19 and do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future
funding valuations of the Group’s pension schemes.
The key change in assumptions in the year relates to future bond yields. In addition, the company has strengthened its assumptions
in respect of underlying mortality by adoption of the 92 series tables, which for a 65 year-old male, the life expectancy assumed has
increased from 16.9 years to 19 years.
The fair value of assets and present value of obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements, are set out below:

T o develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns
on investments (particularly government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in
which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class
was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the
portfolio.

The gross post-retirement liability also includes £2.7m at 31 December 2006 (2005: £2.7m) in respect of continuing post-retirement
health care insurance premiums for retired long-service employees. The liability is based upon the actuarial assessment of the
remaining cost by a qualified actuary on a net present value basis at 31 December 2006. The cost is calculated assuming a discount
rate of 5 per cent per annum and an increase in medical expenses of 11.9 per cent per annum. The premium cost to the Group in
respect of retired long-service employees for 2006 was £0.2m (2005: £0.2m).

As explained in the statement of accounting policies, an expense is recorded in the Group’s income statement over the period from
the grant date to the vesting date of share options granted to employees. As there is a temporary difference between the accounting
and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded. The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax
deduction to be obtained in the future (based on the company’s share price at the balance sheet date) with the cumulative amount of
the expense recorded in the income statement. If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of
the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, in this share-based payment tax reserve.

31 . Contingent liabilities
Florida Litigation
On 20 November 2006, a jury trial in Florida awarded damages against several US-based T aylor Woodrow subsidiaries totalling
US$44.4m, or £22.7m at 31 December 2006 exchange rates. This award included US$20m of punitive damages. Some elements of
this award were issued on a joint or joint and several liability basis with unrelated third parties. The jury verdict does not become a
final judgment until post-trial motions, filed by T aylor Woodrow and other parties to the litigation, have been heard and ruled upon by
the judge. This case arose from The Beach Residences project in Sarasota, Florida, which contributed to profits in 2005 and 2006.
External legal opinion is that this award should be reduced by $14.6m as several of the awards were duplicative in nature, when the
original jury decision is confirmed in 2007, notwithstanding any reduction due to post-trial motions. The reduction due to the
duplicative awards leaves a resulting US$29.8 million, which represents £15.2 million at 31 December 2006 exchange rates as the
external legal interpretation of the original jury award.
In addition, T aylor Woodrow has an indemnity, from one of the co-defendants, which should give a level of reimbursement of some of
the US$29.8m referred to above. 
The directors continue to be confident that the judge, a post-trial motion or subsequent appeal will materially reduce the original jury
award. On some aspects of the case however, the directors have been able to make a reliable estimate of the likely outcome and a
suitable provision has been made. Due to commercial considerations, that could prejudice T aylor Woodrow, the amount provided is
not disclosed. 
However for the majority of the awards under the case, due to the fundamental uncertainties around the possible outcome of the
trial, no reliable estimate can be made to record a provision in the 2006 accounts for this preliminary jury award and accordingly no
provision has been recorded.
General 
The company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter-
indemnities in respect of bonds relating to the Group’s own contracts and given guarantees in respect of the Group’s share of certain
contractual obligations of joint ventures. 
Provision is made for the directors’ best estimate of all known legal claims and all legal actions in progress. The Group takes legal
advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the directors consider, based on that
advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was £3.74 (2005: £3.17). 
The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had a range of exercise prices from £nil to £2.79 (2005: £nil to £2.61) and a weighted
average remaining contractual life of 2.6 years (2005: 4.9 years).
For share options with non-market conditions granted during the current and preceding year the fair value of those options at grant
date were determined using the Binomial model. The inputs into that model were as follows:
2006 2005
Weighted average share price £3.74 £3.11
Weighted average exercise price £1.02 £0.68
Expected volatility 27.0%-29.3% 32.4%-32.9%
Expected life 3/5 years 3/5 years
Risk-free rate 4.5%-4.8% 4.33%-4.36%
Expected dividend yield 4.1% 3.6%-3.8%
The weighed average fair value of share options granted during the year is £2.56 (2005: £2.29). Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2006
78 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
33. Share-based payments continued
For shares options with market conditions granted during the current year, the fair value of these options were determined using 
the Monte Carlo simulation model. The inputs into that model were as follows:
2006 2005
Weighted average share price £3.82 £3.19
Weighted average exercise price £nil £nil
Expected volatility 27% 26%-30%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk-free rate 4.5% 4.2%
Expected dividend yield 4.1% 3.6%
The weighed average fair value of share options granted during the year is £1.01 (2005: £1.75).
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the expected term. 
The expected life used in the model is based on historic exercise patterns.
The Group recognised total expenses of £6.1m and £5.9m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2006 
and 2005 respectively.
34. Related party transactions
T ransactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are 
not disclosed in this note. T ransactions between the Group and its joint ventures are disclosed below. T ransactions between the
company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures are disclosed in the company’s separate financial statements.
T rading transactions
During the year, Group companies’ purchases from joint ventures totalled £30.7m (2005: £7.3m). Purchases were based on open
market values.
Remuneration of key management personnel
Details of the remuneration of the directors and members of the Executive Committee, who are the key management personnel 
of the Group, are contained in the audited part of the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 45 and form part of these financial
statements.
35. Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures

The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the
ﬁnancial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on ﬁnancial instruments when the relevant standard comes into
effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007 . Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of T aylor Woodrow plc
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006  79
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of
T aylor Woodrow plc for the year ended 31 December 2006
which comprise the Balance Sheet, the statement of
accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 18. These parent
company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements
of T aylor Woodrow plc for the year ended 31 December 2006
and on the information in the Directors' Remuneration Report
that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’ s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors' Remuneration Report and the parent company
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the Directors' Report is
consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. The
information given in the Directors' Report includes that speciﬁc
information presented in the Chief Executive’ s Review that is
cross referred from the introduction to the Directors' Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding directors' remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited parent company ﬁnancial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information
outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
parent company ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made
by the directors in the preparation of the parent company
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the company's circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the parent company ﬁnancial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company's affairs as
at 31 December 2006;
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
• the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent
with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

London, UK
19 February 2007 Accounting Policies
80 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
The following accounting policies have been used
consistently, unless otherwise stated, in dealing with items
which are considered material.
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards under
the historical cost convention. As permitted by the Companies
Act 1985 the company has not presented its own proﬁt and
loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the company is exempt
from the requirement to prepare a cash ﬂow statement on the
grounds that its consolidated ﬁnancial statements, which
include the company, are publicly available. 
Note 20, on pages 68 to 71, and Note 33, on pages 77 to 78,
to the T aylor Woodrow plc consolidated ﬁnancial statements
form part of these ﬁnancial statements. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Group undertakings
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less
any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates
expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax
rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of
income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods
different from those in which they are included in the ﬁnancial
statements. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Overseas currencies
T ransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded
in sterling at actual rates as of the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of
exchange prevailing at the year end. Any gain or loss arising
from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of
the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the
proﬁt and loss account. Unrealised exchange differences on
inter -company long-term loans and foreign currency
borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the company’ s
investment in overseas investments, are taken to revaluation
reserve. 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting 
The company uses foreign currency borrowings and currency
swaps to hedge its investment in overseas investments.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
that are designated and effective as hedges of investment in
overseas operations are recognised directly in reserves and
the ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the
proﬁt and loss account. The hedged items are adjusted for
changes in exchange rates, with gains or losses from 
re-measuring the carrying amount being recognised directly
in reserves. 
Share-based payments
The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 
‘Share-based payments’ . In accordance with the transitional
provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity
instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as 
of 1 January 2005.
The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,
based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
Employee beneﬁts
The company accounts for pensions and similar beneﬁts
under FRS17 ‘Retirement beneﬁts’ . In respect of deﬁned
beneﬁt plans, obligations are measured at discounted
present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. 
The operating and ﬁnancing costs of such plans are
recognised separately in the consolidated income statement;
service costs are spread systematically over the lives of
employees and ﬁnancing costs are recognised in the periods
in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised
immediately in the consolidated statement of recognised
income and expense. 
Payments to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged as an
expense as they fall due.
Own shares
The cost of the company’ s investment in its own shares,
which comprise shares held in treasury by the company and
shares held by employee beneﬁt trusts for the purpose of
funding certain of the company’ s share option plans, is
shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds.  Company Balance Sheet at 31 December 2006

8. Retirement beneﬁt obligations
The company participates in the T aylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund. This is a deﬁned beneﬁt multi-employer
plan, the assets and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The company is unable to identify its share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and accordingly accounts for the plan as if it were a deﬁned contribution plan. 
Information in respect of the scheme is provided in Note 20, on pages 68 and 71, to the T aylor Woodrow plc consolidated ﬁnancial
statements. The fair value of assets as disclosed in those ﬁnancial statements has been calculated in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ , in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘Retirement Beneﬁts’ 
(FRS 17) the total fair value of scheme assets would be £750.9m (2005: £707 .2m). All other information provided in those ﬁnancial
statements meets the disclosure requirements set out in FRS 17 . 
Contributions in respect of the deﬁned contribution scheme for directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on page 45.
There were no outstanding contributions at the year end.

15. Share-based payments
Details of share options granted by Group companies to employees, and that remain outstanding, over the company’s shares are
set out in Note 33, on pages 77 and 78, to the T aylor Woodrow plc consolidated financial statements. The company did not
recognise any expense related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the current or preceding year. 
16. Contingent liabilities
The company has, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter-indemnities in respect of bonds
relating to the Group’s own contracts.
Provision is made for the directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Group takes legal advice
as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the directors consider, based on that advice,
that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made. 
The company is also party to litigation as discussed in Note 31, on page 76, to the T aylor Woodrow plc consolidated financial
statements.

Electronic communications
Electronic communication offers mutual beneﬁts for the
company, for shareholders and for the environment.
The company already encourages all shareholders to receive
certain company documentation and publications electronically
via its website and many have already chosen this method.
With the ﬁrst stages of the Companies Act 2006 now in
operation, electronic communications has taken a further step
forward. Therefore we, like most other listed companies, will be
asking shareholders to approve an enabling resolution at the
2007 AGM. This would allow the company to establish 
e-communications as the normal means of communication
with individual shareholders, unless they choose otherwise.
In the meantime, we continue to encourage all shareholders 
to elect voluntarily to use e-communications as their preferred
means of receiving company material. Shareholders can sign up
for this facility by completing and returning the form enclosed
with the Notice of AGM or by logging onto our website at
www.taylorwoodrow.com. 
On-line facilities for shareholders
Y ou can access our Annual and Interim Reports and copies 
of recent shareholder communications on-line at
www.taylorwoodrow.com 
If you have registered for on-line access at Capita Registrars’
website, you can make on-line enquiries about your
shareholding and advise the company of changes in personal
details. T o register for on-line access, go to
www.taylorwoodrow.com. T o access some of these services
you will ﬁrst be required to apply on-line for a User ID. 
On-line proxies
Shareholders may also submit forms of proxy for shareholder
meetings on-line at www.taylorwoodrow.com. 
Dividend Re-Investment Plan
Y ou can choose to invest your cash dividends in purchasing
T aylor Woodrow shares on the market under the terms of the
Dividend Re-Investment Plan. For further information on the
Plan and how to join, go to www.taylorwoodrow.com. 
Dividend mandates
We encourage all shareholders to receive their cash dividends
by direct transfer to a bank or building society account. This
ensures that dividends are credited promptly to shareholders
without the cost and inconvenience of having to pay in dividend
cheques at a bank. If you wish to use this cost-effective and
simple facility, complete and return the dividend mandate form
attached to your dividend cheque. Additional mandate forms
may be obtained from Capita Registrars.
Duplicate share register accounts
If you are receiving more than one copy of our Annual Report, 
it may be that your shares are registered in two or more
accounts on the register of members. If that was not your
intention you might consider merging them into one single
entry. Please contact Capita Registrars who will be pleased 
to carry out your instructions. 
Shareholder Facilities
Low-cost share dealing services
We have arranged both telephone and on-line share dealing
services for buying and selling up to £25,000 worth of shares 
in T aylor Woodrow. Both services are operated by Capita
Registrars. T o use the services either telephone 
+44 (0) 870 458 4577 or visit www.capitadeal.com. T o deal, 
you will need to provide your surname, postcode, date of birth
and investor code (which can be found on your share
certiﬁcate).
T aylor W oodrow and ‘CREST’
T aylor Woodrow shares can be held in ‘CREST’ accounts, which
do not require share certiﬁcates. This may make it quicker and
easier for some shareholders to settle stock market

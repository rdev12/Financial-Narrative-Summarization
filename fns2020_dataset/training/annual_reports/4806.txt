Chairman’s Statement
John Rennocks
Chairman
Delivering strong returns to shareholders
As previously announced, I will be stepping 
down from the Board immediately after 
the AGM on 21 January 2015. I joined the 
Board in 2002 and became Chairman in 
2004, following the retirement of the late 
Christopher Thomas who had previously 
been Chief Executive and then Chairman of 
the Company for over 30 years. His guiding 
objective for the Company was to focus on 
consistently strong cash flow which would 
fund the Group’s growth strategy and 
deliver healthy and growing dividends; this 
has remained a fundamental principle of 
the Board during my Chairmanship of the 
Company over the last ten years. 
The Group’s strong cash flow is generated 
from businesses which focus on essential 
products and services within specialised 
market segments and deliver sustainable 
and attractive margins, through the quality 
of customer service, depth of technical 
support and value adding activities. It is 
this business model that has provided the 
Group with the resources over ten years to 
invest ca.£160m of our internally generated 
cash in value enhancing acquisitions to 
support our growth strategy and deliver 
strong shareholder value. 
The success in pursuing this strategy 
can be measured against the Group’s two 
principal corporate objectives of growth 
in adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) 
and total shareholder return (“TSR”). The 
target for adjusted EPS is to deliver strong 
double-digit growth over the business 
cycle and since 2004 the Group’s adjusted 
EPS has grown at a compound rate of 
16% p.a. The objective for TSR growth is to 
deliver upper quartile performance relative 
to the FTSE mid-250 Index Group (“FTSE-
250”) and over the last ten years, Diploma’s 
TSR has grown at a compound rate of 
24% p.a. compared with median growth 
of 13% p.a. in the FTSE-250. 
I believe that this sustained performance 
demonstrates the Board’s commitment 
to a clearly defined and well executed 
strategy, robust business model and 
relentless focus on strong cash generation. 
This has helped Diploma develop into a 
successful and resilient business capable 
of delivering strong shareholder value on 
a consistent basis and I am confident that 
it will continue to do so for many years.
Results
Group revenues increased in 2014 by 7% 
to £305.8m (2013: £285.5m) despite the 
significant strengthening of UK sterling 
against most major currencies in which 
the Group operates. With ca.75% of the 
Group’s revenues generated outside the 
UK, the £17.7m reduction in revenues from 
currency translation more than offset the 
contribution to revenue of £15.4m from 
acquisitions completed during the year. 
On an underlying basis, which is after 
adjusting for acquisitions and for currency 
effects on translation, Group revenues 
increased by 8% with each of the Group’s 
business Sectors reporting strong 
underlying growth during the year.
Adjusted operating margins remained 
robust at 18.5% (2013: 19.0%) and adjusted 
Adjusted EPS growth
+20% p.a.
TSR growth
+36% p.a.
Dividend growth

operating profit increased by 4% to 
£56.7m (2013: £54.3m). Gross margins in 
the Canadian and Australian healthcare 
businesses were impacted by transactional 
currency effects, but these were partly 
mitigated by tight control of operating 
costs and the benefits arising from the 
Group’s recent Investment for Growth 
programme which is now substantially 
complete.
 
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 3% 
to £56.2m (2013: £54.3m) and adjusted 
earnings per share, helped by a lower 
effective tax rate, increased by 4% to 36.1p 
(2013: 34.8p).
The Group generated strong free cash flow 
of £37.8m (2013: £31.6m), despite a larger 
investment in working capital, reflecting 
both much lower capital expenditure of 
£2.2m (2013: £4.6m) and a smaller cash 
contribution of £1.8m (2013: £4.7m) to 
the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust. 
With the acquisition environment 
improving, the Group invested £16.5m 
(2013: £2.2m) in acquisitions during the 
financial year. Shortly after the year end, 
the Group acquired 80% of TPD, which 
extends the Healthcare business into 
Ireland and the UK; this acquisition has 
taken the acquisition spend to ca.£26m 
in the 2014 calendar year. 
At 30 September 2014 the Group’s net 
cash funds increased by £2.0m to £21.3m 
after distributing £18.2m (2013: £17.4m) 
to shareholders during the year. 
Dividends
The strong balance sheet and free cash 
flow, supported by a good set of results has 
led the Board to recommend an increase 
in the final dividend of 8% to 11.6p per 
share (2013: 10.7p). Subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM, this dividend will be 
paid on 28 January 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at 28 November 2014.
The total dividend per share for the 
year will be 17.0p (2013: 15.7p) which 
represents an 8% increase on 2013. The 
dividend is well covered by adjusted 
EPS at 2.1 times, in line with the Board’s 
objective of targeting towards a two times 
level of cover. Dividends have increased 
progressively in each of the last 15 years 
and represent a total of almost £100m 
of cash distributed to shareholders over 
ten years. 
Governance
The Board and its Committees have 
worked effectively throughout the year, 
benefiting from a stable year, following 
a number of years of changes as we 
developed and refreshed the Board.  
The work of these Committees and the  
key achievements this year are set out  
in the Corporate Governance section of 
the Annual Report & Accounts.
I should like to thank all my colleagues 
on the Board, past and present, who 
have always been both supportive and 
challenging, as needed. Their wise counsel 
and experience has made a substantial 
contribution to the success of the Group. 
Finally, I am delighted that in John 
Nicholas, the Company has a highly 
successful businessman with broad and 
relevant experience, who I am confident 
will chair the Group well on the next stage 
of its journey and to further success. 
Employees
I have very much appreciated the 
consistently high levels of service, 
performance and hard work that our 
employees deliver year after year. I believe 
that this is largely due to our decentralised 
organisational structure which allows 
our employees to understand their 
responsibilities and gives them space to 
operate efficiently and effectively. This 
provides enormous strength to the Diploma 
businesses and helps explain the Group’s 
sustained success. I wish to sincerely thank 
all our employees for their tremendous hard 
work and for all they have achieved during 
my period with the Company.
Outlook
The Group’s performance this year has 
benefited from greater confidence in its 
principal markets with strong underlying 
revenue growth in each of the Group’s 
Sectors. Given the strong comparatives and 
the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, 
the Board expects growth to trend this year 
towards our target “GDP plus” rates.
The Group has a strong and proven 
business model, together with a good 
geographic spread of activities, strong 
free cash flow and balance sheet. With 
an improving acquisition environment 
and a good pipeline of opportunities, 
prospects for acquisition activity in 2015 
are encouraging. This provides the Board 
with confidence that further progress will 
be made in the new financial year.

Business Model
Our business model is designed to make us 
essential to our customers. 07 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
What we put in What we get out
Our businesses focus on supplying essential products 
and services funded by customers’ operating rather than 
capital budgets and supplied across a range of specialised 
industry segments.
The majority of the Group’s revenues are generated from 
consumable products. In many cases, the products will be used 
in repair and maintenance applications and refurbishment and 
upgrade programmes, rather than supplied to original equipment 
manufacturers. 
Recurring income and stable revenue growth
Our focus on essential products and services contributes to the 
Group’s record of stable revenue growth over the business cycle.
Our businesses target organic revenue growth, over the economic 
cycle, at a rate of 5–6% p.a. (“GDP plus” growth), with higher growth 
rates achieved at the Group level through carefully selected value 
enhancing acquisitions. 
Essential Products
Our businesses design their individual business models to 
provide solutions which closely meet the requirements of 
their customers. 
The solutions can be in the form of:
• Highly responsive customer service, such as the next day 
delivery from stock of essential, but low value items;
• Deep technical support, where we work closely with our 
customers in designing our products into their specific 
applications;
• Added value services which, if we did not provide these services, 
customers would have to pay others to provide them or would 
require them to invest in additional resources of their own.
Sustainable and attractive margins
By supplying solutions, not just products, we build strong long 
term relationships with our customers and suppliers, supporting 
sustainable and attractive margins.
Our businesses achieve sustainable and attractive gross margins 
by offering strongly differentiated products and customer focused 
solutions within specialised market segments. By running efficient 
operations, these gross margins are converted into healthy 
operating margins.
Essential Solutions
We encourage an entrepreneurial culture across our 
businesses, through a decentralised management structure. 
We want the managers to feel that they have the freedom to run 
their own businesses, while being able to draw upon the support 
and resources of a larger group where this is beneficial.
Within our businesses we have strong, self-standing management 
teams who are committed to and rewarded according to the 
success of their businesses. 
Agility and responsiveness
Our decentralised organisational model ensures that decisions 
are made close to the customer and that the businesses 
are agile and responsive to changes in the market and the 
competitive environment.

BUILD 09 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
Clear business criteria have been 
established to guide the Group’s 
acquisition programme:
• Fit with the Group’s business model  
of essential products, solutions  
and values;
• Marketing led with strong customer  
relationships;
• Secure supply of high quality,  
differentiated products;
• Capable management.
Acquisitions are intended to give entry  
into new but related markets and  
thereby extend the reach of the  
existing businesses and bring new 
growth opportunities. 
The acquisitions we make are of 
companies which are already successful 
and with a good track record. However, 
these businesses have typically reached 
the point where additional resources are 
needed to take them to the next level 
of growth.
Once the acquisition is integrated  
into the Group, with a solid platform 
established, the focus is on delivering 
stable, profitable growth. 
Except in the case of smaller, bolt-on 
acquisitions, the acquisitions will maintain 
their distinct sales and marketing identity 
and will be managed as independent 
business units. However, where there are 
opportunities for synergies with other 
Group businesses, these will be managed 
within larger business clusters.
The principal financial criteria are: 
• Track record of stable, profitable 
growth and cash generation;
• Exceed IRR threshold of 13% to  
ensure 20%+ return on investment.
Working with the management, we 
provide the investment required to build 
a solid foundation to allow the company 
to move to a new level of growth. The 
investment will normally be in new 
facilities and IT systems, increased but 
better managed working capital and 
additional management resource.
Typically synergies come in the  
following areas:
• Cross-selling between the businesses;
• Joint purchasing between the 
businesses;
• Shared back-office functions for 
finance and administration.
The Group invested £16.5m this 
year in acquisitions designed to build 
larger, broader based businesses in 
the Group’s three Sectors and extend 
the Group’s geographic coverage. 
These acquisitions comprised:
Life Sciences
• Chemzyme (Australia)
• DSL (20%) (Australia)
Seals
• Kentek (80%) (Finland, Russia and  
Baltic States)
• Ramsay (UK)
• AB Seals (UK)

To complement the Group’s organic 
growth strategy, the Group has an ongoing 
acquisition programme, designed to 
accelerate growth and to facilitate entry 
into related strategic markets.
Generate consistently 
strong cash flow to fund 
growth strategy and

Free cash flow is defined as the cash flow 
generated after tax, but before acquisitions

of the Group and its businesses in turning 
profit into cash through the careful 
management of working capital and 
investments in fixed assets.

Return on adjusted trading capital 
employed (“ROATCE”) is defined as

GROUP 13 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
In 2014, the Group has delivered underlying 
revenue growth of 8% (after adjusting for 
acquisitions and currency effects) with a 
strong performance across all three Sectors. 
Adjusted operating margins remained 
robust at 18.5% of revenue. In an improving 
environment for acquisitions, £16.5m was 
invested in acquisitions which contributed 
£15.4m to revenues this year. This addition 
to revenues was offset by the adverse 
translation effect of the stronger UK sterling 
which reduced revenues by £17.7m. Free 
cash flow increased by 20% to £37.8m and 
return on adjusted trading capital employed 
(“ROATCE”) was maintained at 25.8%.
Business model and growth strategy
The Group’s strategy is designed to 
generate strong, double-digit growth 
in earnings and shareholder value over 
the business cycle, by building larger, 
broader-based businesses in the three 
Group Sectors of Life Sciences, Seals 
and Controls. 
Our businesses target “GDP plus” levels 
of organic revenue growth over the 
business cycle. Stable and resilient revenue 
growth is achieved through our focus on 
essential products and services funded 
by customers’ operating rather than 
capital budgets and supplied across a 
range of specialised industry segments. 
By supplying essential solutions, not 
just products, we build strong long term 
relationships with our customers and 
suppliers, which support sustainable and 
attractive margins. Finally we encourage an 
entrepreneurial culture in our businesses 
through our decentralised management 
structure and these essential values ensure 
that decisions are made close to the 
customer and that the businesses are agile 
and responsive to changes in the market 
and the competitive environment. 
Overall growth is accelerated from the 
underlying GDP plus levels to the corporate 
target of strong, double-digit growth, 
through carefully selected, value-enhancing 
acquisitions which fit the business model 
and offer entry into new strategic markets. 
Acquisitions are not made just to add 
revenue and profit, but rather to bring into 
the Group successful businesses which have 
growth potential, capable management 
and a good track record of profitable 
growth and cash generation. As part of our 
Acquire, Build, Grow strategy, we invest in 
the businesses post acquisition to build a 
firm foundation to allow them to move to 
a new level of growth. These acquisitions 
form a critical part of our Sector growth 
strategies and are designed to generate a 
pre-tax return on investment of at least 20% 
and hence support our Group objective of 
consistently exceeding 20% ROATCE.
Performance against objectives and KPIs
The Group’s principal corporate objectives 
relate to growth in adjusted earnings per 
share (“EPS”) and total shareholder return 
(“TSR”). Growth in the year in adjusted EPS 
has been 4% and growth in TSR has been 
8%. Over a five year period, compound 
growth rates for adjusted EPS and TSR have 
been 20% p.a. and 36% p.a. respectively. 
Underpinning the principal corporate 
objectives are a set of further objectives, 
with related key performance indicators 
(“KPIs”) which are used to measure 
performance at the Group level, but 
also to drill down through the operating 
businesses. The first of these next level 
objectives is to generate stable “GDP plus” 
levels of underlying revenue growth over 
the business cycle. 
This year, after adjusting for translational 
currency effects and acquisitions, the 
Group increased revenues by 8% on an 
underlying basis, with strong performance 
across all three Sectors. Life Sciences 
benefited from strong consumable 
revenues across the businesses, offsetting 
weaker capital equipment and service 
revenues and delivered 9% underlying 
revenue growth. In Seals, underlying 
revenues grew by 7%, reflecting a more 
favourable performance in the Aftermarket 
businesses and continuing good growth 
in the Industrial OEM businesses. Controls 
returned to growth this year with good 
demand across its market sectors and 
particularly strong performances from the 
Civil Aerospace, Motorsport and Energy 
markets; underlying revenue growth of 
8% was achieved.
The objective for adjusted operating 
margins is to maintain stable attractive 
margins which reflect the focus 
on specialised segments, strongly 
differentiated products and customer 
focused solutions, combined with 
efficiently run operations. This year, 
adjusted operating margins were 18.5% 
which is comfortably within the five year 
average range of 18–19%. Gross margins 
in the Group’s Healthcare businesses 
came under increasing pressure during 
the year, from the transactional currency 
effects of the strong depreciation of the 
Canadian and Australian dollars. However, 
the impact on Group operating margins 
was limited by tight control of operating 
costs in the Healthcare businesses. More 
broadly, the Group’s Investment for Growth 
programme, started in 2012 and now 
nearing completion, has started to deliver 
the benefits we had expected. As revenues 
have increased, operational leverage has 
reduced operating costs as a percentage of 
revenue and these benefits have offset the 
impact of acquisitions joining the Group 
with lower initial operating margins. 
To achieve the Group’s objective of strong 
double-digit growth, acquisition spend at 
the level of ca.£25m p.a. is targeted. The 
level of spend this year of £16.5m is below 
this target level but is close to the five year 
average of ca.£16m p.a. and is well ahead 
of the prior year spend of only £2m. After 
the financial year end in early October 
2014, a further acquisition was completed 
of 80% of Technopath Distribution (“TPD”) 
and this has taken the acquisition spend to 
ca.£26m in the 2014 calendar year. 
The Group continues to focus strongly 
on free cash flow, which funds the growth 
strategy and allows the Company to provide 
healthy dividends to shareholders. In 2014, 
free cash flow was £37.8m, compared 
with a five year average of £31m p.a. and 
was equivalent to a conversion rate of 
over 90% of adjusted after tax earnings. 
Now that the Investment for Growth 
programme is approaching completion, 
capital expenditure is trending back to 
more normal levels and the principal 
determinant of free cash flow conversion

is now the effective management of 
working capital. The KPI used to measure 
and monitor this performance is working 
capital as a percentage of revenue; in 2014 
this increased to 17.2% compared with both 
the target and the five year average level 
of 16–17%. 
ROATCE is the final indicator of the 
overall performance of the Group 
and very importantly of its success in 
creating value for shareholders. ROATCE 
is measured as the pre-tax return on total 
Group investment excluding net cash, 
but including all goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets. ROATCE has exceeded 
the 20% target in each of the last five years 
and this year was 25.8%.
 
Acquisitions 
Acquisitions are an integral part of the 
Group’s strategy, designed to accelerate 
growth and to facilitate entry into related 
strategic markets. Despite sustained 
and increasing resources focused on 
identifying and completing value-enhancing 
acquisitions, acquisition spend does ebb and 
flow over time. The acquisition environment 
has improved this year after a period when 
the uncertainty over future economic 
prospects had made vendors very cautious, 
resulting in lengthening transaction 
processes and delayed completions. 
During the year, a number of acquisitions 
have been completed which are natural 
extensions of the Group’s existing 
businesses and which have extended the 
scope of the businesses into new products, 
market segments and geographies.
In Life Sciences, DHG extended its 
business in Australia with the acquisition 
of Chemzyme, which has now been 
integrated into DHG’s principal operations 
in Melbourne. During the year DHG also 
acquired the remaining 20% minority 
shareholdings in DSL and shortly after 
the year end, acquired 80% of TPD, an 
established supplier to the Biotechnology, 
Clinical Laboratory and Medical markets 
in Ireland and the UK. The acquisition of 
TPD represents an important first step in 
extending the scope of DHG’s business 
into the markets of Ireland and the UK, as 
well as adding important new products 
and suppliers.
In Seals, the Group acquired 80% of Kentek, 
a specialised filter distributor which adds a 
new product line and extends the reach of 
the Seals activities into the new markets of 
Finland, Russia and the Baltic States. During 
the year, two smaller acquisitions were 
completed in the UK, AB Seals and Ramsay 
Services, which will be managed by FPE 
Seals and M Seals respectively. RT Dygert 
also acquired the remaining 49% in the HPS 
Industrial OEM seal business in Seattle.
In Controls, the fastener business was 
strengthened through the acquisition 
of SFC, a UK fastener distributor which 
has a strong fit with Clarendon and brings 
specialist technical and design skills as well 
as added value assembly expertise. During 
the year, Filcon also acquired the goodwill 
and assets of Sacee, a supplier of specialist 
connectors to the Satellite sector in France; 
Sacee’s operations have been integrated 
into Filcon in Munich.
With an improving acquisition environment, 
a good pipeline of opportunities and 
additional corporate development resources 
in place, prospects for acquisition activity in 
2015 are encouraging.

Gross margins in the Healthcare 
businesses were also significantly 
impacted on a transactional basis by the 
strong depreciation of the Canadian and 
Australian dollars against the US dollar 
and the Euro. These currency effects were 
partly mitigated by an increased proportion 
of higher margin consumable product 
revenues this year, by price concessions 
negotiated with suppliers and by tight 
management of operating costs. There 
were also benefits starting to accrue 
from prior year investments and adjusted 
operating margins decreased by only 
80bps to 21.6%.
Free cash flow increased by 6% to £14.9m, 
reflecting a combination of lower capital 
expenditure and tax payments, offset in part 
by investment in higher working capital.
Strategy development
The DHG group of Healthcare businesses 
account for ca.80% of Life Sciences 
revenues. The DHG business model is to 
build strong market positions in growing 
niche healthcare markets. Products are 
sourced from high quality medical device 
manufacturers under the terms of long 
term exclusive distribution agreements. 
Full service solutions are provided by 
highly qualified technical sales and 
product application staff, working closely 
with surgeons, operating room nurses and 
laboratory technologists. A large proportion 
of revenues (ca.70%) are secured under 
multi-year customer contracts.
In Canada, the three principal businesses 
made good progress during the year 
in expanding the growth potential of 
their businesses with new products and 
new suppliers. Somagen revenues were 
boosted by the supply of new testing kits 
used in the roll-out of colorectal cancer 
screening programmes across three 
Provinces and made good progress with 
new best-in-class products in HbA1c 
diabetes testing and Autoimmunity. AMT 
continued to increase revenues in its new 
minimally invasive (“MI”) Surgery division, 
consolidating its position in the supply 
of specialised surgical instruments used 
in laparoscopic and other MI Surgery 
procedures. Vantage launched its new 
range of endoscopes offering significant 
benefits in terms of image quality and 
handling ability.
There remain significant opportunities for 
DHG in Canada to increase its share in 
its core specialised segments of Clinical 
Diagnostics, Electrosurgery, MI Surgery 
and GI Endoscopy with new products and 
suppliers. DHG is also actively seeking to 
extend its business, either organically or by 
acquisition, into other specialised medical 
disciplines where its business model can 
be deployed successfully.
In Australia, BGS and DSL have grown 
revenues strongly and have now been 
brought together under a newly formed 
leadership group and with operations and 
back office systems consolidated into a 
single facility in Melbourne. Now that DHG 
in Australia has established a firm base with 
sufficient critical mass, it is now looking for 
further opportunities to grow by adding 
bolt-on acquisitions. During the year, 
DHG acquired the assets and goodwill of 
Chemzyme, a small distributor supplying 
products to the sterilising departments in 
hospitals across Australia and New Zealand. 
Chemzyme has been integrated into the 
Melbourne operations and has extended 
the scope of the DHG business in Australia 
with a supplier which also is a key supplier 
to Vantage in Canada. DHG also during the 
year acquired the remaining 20% minority 
shareholdings in DSL.
Shortly after the year end, DHG acquired 
80% of TPD, an established supplier to the 
Biotechnology, Clinical Laboratory and 
Medical markets in Ireland and the UK. The 
acquisition of TPD represents an important 
first step in extending the scope of DHG’s 
business into the markets of Ireland and 
the UK as well as adding important new 
products and suppliers. Once DHG has 
firmly established its position in these new 
markets, opportunities will be explored in 
further new geographic territories.
The a1-group of Environmental businesses 
accounts for ca.20% of Sector revenues 
and supplies a range of products used in 
Environmental testing and Health & Safety 
applications. The a1-group has been 
successful in recent years by maintaining 
a sharp focus on attractive niche market 
segments and this year has delivered 
strong growth with stable operating 
margins. While maintaining its focus, the 
a1-group is also looking for carefully 
selected bolt-on acquisitions to introduce 
new growth opportunities.

Performance in the year
Reported revenues of the Life Sciences

the significant weakening in the Canadian 
and Australian dollars relative to UK sterling. 
On a constant currency basis, underlying 
revenues increased by 9%. Similarly on

Performance in the year
The Seals businesses increased revenues by 
13%, which included part year contributions 
from Kentek, acquired in January 2014, 
and two smaller bolt-on acquisitions in 
the UK. After adjusting for the additional 
contribution from these acquisitions and 
for the impact from currency translation, 
underlying revenues increased by 7%. The 
acquisition of Kentek and the continued 
development of the FPE Seals and M Seals 
businesses, through organic growth and 
bolt-on acquisitions, have increased the 
European region’s share of total Seals 
revenues to ca.25% in 2014. 
Across the Seals businesses, gross margins 
continued to be resilient, underpinned by 
essential product availability and added 
value technical service. Operating margins 
in the HFPG and FPE Seals businesses 
improved as they benefited from prior 
year investment in people, facilities and 
equipment. However, with Kentek joining 
the Group with lower initial operating 
margins, adjusted operating margins 
reduced by 30bps to 18.1%. 
Free cash flow increased by £0.5m to 
£16.4m, as capital expenditure decreased, 
but increased working capital reduced the 
contribution from higher operating profits. 
Strategy development
The Aftermarket Seals businesses account 
for ca.60% of Sector revenues and supply 
own-branded sealing products used in a 
broad range of heavy mobile machinery 
applications. The products are generally 
supplied from inventory on a next day 
delivery basis and are typically used in the 
repair and maintenance of equipment after 
it has completed its initial warranty or lease 
term. Our businesses act as a one-stop 
source of replacement components for all 
main brands of machinery and compared 
to the OEM dealer network, offer higher 
levels of customer service and more 
competitive pricing.
In North America, HFPG continues to 
penetrate the market through its superior 
marketing, its relentless sales approach 
and product development to extend the 
product line. HFPG is always looking to 
improve its service to customers and 
during the year, the level of sales processed 
online increased by 26% and now accounts 
for ca.20% of US revenues. Capacity is also 
expanding in the seal machining centres 
which respond to the demand from repair 
shop customers for hard-to-find and 
outsized seals on a 24 hour basis.
Outside North America, the Group 
continues to target an increased global 
footprint for Aftermarket, particularly 
in Europe and Asia Pacific. During the 
year, plans to create a more substantial, 
unified European Aftermarket Seals group 
continued to take shape, centred on FPE 
Seals and with operations in the UK and 
the Netherlands. FPE Seals added AB Seals 
as a bolt-on to its operations in the UK, 
strengthening coverage in the important 
South East region. The Group also acquired 
80% of Kentek, a specialised distributor of 
filters and related products, used in heavy 
mobile machinery and industrial equipment 
applications. Kentek extends the reach of 
the Seals activities into the new markets of 
Finland, Russia and the Baltic States, as well 
as adding filters to the Group’s product line. 
The Industrial OEM businesses account 
for ca.40% of Seals revenues and supply 
seals, O-rings and custom moulded 
and machined parts used in a range 
of specialised industrial equipment. 
The businesses work closely with their 
Industrial OEM customers to specify the 
most appropriate sealing material and 
design for the customer’s application 
and the most suitable seal manufacturer 
from which to source the parts. Once the 
part is designed in to the application, the 
businesses provide the necessary logistical 
and technical support, in most cases for 
the lifetime of the OEM’s product.
The Group’s growth strategy in the 
Industrial OEM Seal sector is to build and 
expand a group of businesses in North 
America and internationally. During 
the year, RT Dygert benefited from its 
investment in new elastomer compounds 
to penetrate new technically demanding 
applications. RT Dygert also acquired the 
remaining 49% in the HPS seal business 
in Seattle. Both All Seals and J Royal saw 
good gains in existing and new market 
segments with the introduction of new 
higher specification products. All Seals also 
benefited from its investment in a water-jet 
gasket cutting machine and in November, 
will open a branch operation in Houston, 
Texas. In Europe, M Seals acquired Ramsay 
Seals, a specialist distributor of O-rings 
which will give M Seals an entry into the 
Industrial OEM seal business in the UK, as 
well as adding strengths in the Aerospace 
and Oil & Gas sectors.

focus on specialised markets and added 
value opportunities. The benefits from 
investment programmes completed last 
year, enabled the businesses to gain some 
operational leverage which offset the 
impact from the lower initial operating 
margin of SFC.
Free cash flow increased by £0.6m to 
£11.4m, with reduced capital expenditure, 
but with working capital increasing to 
take advantage of opportunities within 
existing markets.
Strategy development
The Interconnect businesses account 
for 70% of Controls revenues and supply 
a range of high performance wiring, 
connectors, harness components, 
fasteners and control devices. These 
products are used in technically demanding 
applications, often in harsh environments, 
in industries including Aerospace, Defence, 
Motorsport, Energy and Medical as well as 
in other specialised Industrial applications. 
The products are generally used in 
refurbishment, upgrade and maintenance 
programmes for equipment in service and 
are supplied to major new build programmes 
only where smaller quantities are required 
from stock. The businesses act as a single 
source for a wide range of products, have 
strong technical knowledge to specify 
products for customer applications and 
offer ex-stock availability and a full range 
of added value services.
A key element of the growth strategy within 
Interconnect is to broaden the range of 
high performance products and added 
value services offered. As part of this 
strategy, a grouping of specialty fastener 
businesses is being built and this group 
was strengthened through the acquisition 
of SFC, a UK based distributor of fasteners 
and ancillary products to the Aerospace, 
Industrial and Motorsport sectors. SFC 
has a strong fit with Clarendon and brings 
specialist technical and design skills as well 
as added value assembly expertise. As the 
group’s supply of fasteners to the premium 
aircraft seating industry continues to grow 
strongly, Clarendon is extending production 
line-side support to key customers and 
exploiting further opportunities to export to 
sub-contract manufacturers.
Another important element of the growth 
strategy is to further penetrate specialised 
market sectors in Europe. During the 
year, Filcon acquired the goodwill and 
assets of Sacee, a supplier of specialist 
Performance in the year
The Controls businesses increased 
revenues by 10%, including part year 
contributions from SFC, a specialty fastener 
company acquired in June 2014 and Sacee, 
a small connector distributor acquired 
in October 2013. After adjusting for the 
contribution from these acquisitions and 
for the impact of currency translation, 
underlying revenues increased by 8%. 
Adjusted operating profits increased by 
10% to £15.3m and adjusted operating 
margins were held steady at 16.2%. 
Overall gross margins in the Controls 
businesses remained resilient with their 
connectors to the Satellite sector in France; 
Sacee’s operations have been successfully 
integrated into Filcon in Munich. In the 
Energy market, following its acquisition 
of Rayquick in late 2012, IS-Sommer was 
appointed by its key energy products 
supplier as one of only two master 
distributors in Germany.
The Fluid Controls businesses account 
for 30% of revenues and supply a 
range of fluid control products used 
broadly across the Food and Beverage 
industry. Products are used in a range 
of applications including food retailing 
and transportation, catering equipment, 
vending machines, coffee brewing, pure 
water and water cooling systems.
Hawco has had to respond to significant 
structural changes in its markets and now 
is seeing the benefits of its repositioning 
and developmental activities. The trend 
away from major out-of-town food retail 
stores and towards convenience stores 
initially dampened demand for Hawco’s 
equipment, but Hawco is now having good 
success in both the UK and Europe with its 
range of scroll compressors which offer 
a smaller footprint and greater efficiency. 
Hawco is also seeing growing demand 
for refrigeration units used in transport 
applications reflecting the increased use 
of home shopping and delivery. Sales 
into the Brewery sector have also been 
buoyed by the introduction of the scroll 
compressors and other improved products 
designed to provide “at source” cooling for 
smaller outlets such as cafes and bars. The 
Abbeychart business model and resources 
applied to the coffee and catering segments 
are also being reshaped to match changes 
in end-user tastes and to focus on growth 
segments where technical expertise can 
add value. During the year, Hawco’s offices 
were relocated, warehouse facilities were 
consolidated and the new Hawco ERP 
system was extended into Abbeychart. 
Geographically, the Controls businesses 
are still very concentrated in Northern 
Europe and in particular in the UK and 
Germany, where ca.80% of revenues 
are generated. The Group continues to 
look for new growth opportunities to 
expand into other geographic territories 
outside of Northern Europe, most likely 
through acquisitions which share the same 
specialised business model and stable 
financial characteristics. 18 DIPLOMA PLC Strategic Report

Finance Review
Nigel Lingwood
Group Finance Director
the impact on Healthcare gross margins 
from the weaker Canadian and Australian 
currencies will continue well into 2015. 
Transactional currency exposures in the rest 
of the Group’s businesses were not material.
The weaker gross margins in the Healthcare 
businesses were partly mitigated by a 
stronger mix of higher margin consumable 
revenues in these businesses and by strong 
control over operating costs. With resilient 
gross margins continuing in the Seals 
and Controls businesses and operational 
benefits now coming through from the 
Investment for Growth programme, Group 
adjusted operating margins reduced by 
only 50bps to 18.5%, compared with 19.0% 
reported last year. 
Investment for Growth programme
The Investment for Growth programme 
which was initiated in 2012 is now 
approaching completion. The programme 
comprised a series of specific investments 
and additional management resources 
designed to provide the foundation for the 
next phase of the Group’s growth. 
By the end of the 2014 financial year, 
£5.1m had been invested across the 
Group in modern and expanded facilities 
and in powerful and efficient new ERP 
systems. Of this total, £3.6m was in capital 
expenditure and £1.5m had been expensed. 
The remaining investment of ca.£0.3m 
will be spent in 2015 in completing the 
implementation of a new ERP system in 
the Canadian Healthcare businesses. The 
benefits resulting from these investments 
have started to positively impact in the 
second half of 2014, delivering greater 
operating efficiencies and improved 
management of working capital as 
revenues increased.
Investment was also made in additional 
senior managers at the Group’s Head Office 
and in the major businesses to strengthen 
corporate development resources, adding 
Results in 2014
Diploma reported a strong performance 
this year, with both underlying revenues 
and adjusted operating profit increasing 
by 8% respectively, as the businesses 
benefited from more positive economic 
conditions in most of its key markets. 
Reported revenues and adjusted operating 
profits were £305.8m and £56.7m 
respectively. Free cash flow was strong 
at £37.8m of which £16.5m was spent 
on acquisitions and the Group’s return 
on adjusted trading capital employed 
(“ROATCE”) remained strong at 25.8%.
Underlying revenues and adjusted 
operating profits are after adjusting for 
the contribution from businesses acquired 
during the year and for the impact on 
the translation of the results of the 
overseas businesses from the significant 
strengthening of UK sterling, in most 
of the major currencies in which the 
Group operates.
With ca.75% of the Group’s revenues 
generated overseas, the impact on 
reported results from currency translation 
has led to a reduction in revenues and 
adjusted operating profits of £17.7m 
and £4.1m respectively, on a constant 
currency basis. These translational currency 
effects more than offset contributions  
from acquisitions of £15.4m in revenue  
and £2.3m in adjusted operating profit.
The results of the Healthcare businesses, 
which represent 80% of Life Sciences 
revenues, were also impacted by the large 
depreciation of the Canadian and Australian 
dollars against the currencies in which these 
businesses purchase their products. This 
currency transactional exposure led to a 
300bps reduction in gross margins in these 
businesses, despite a substantial amount 
of this exposure being hedged through to 
June 2014 by forward currency contracts. 
As these are replaced by contracts which 
reflect more current exchange rates, 
“Strong focus on key 
performance metrics”  19 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
ca.£1.2m to annual operating costs. Outside 
the Investment for Growth programme, 
there was also further investment within the 
businesses to strengthen sales and business 
development resources and in regional 
management. These additional resources 
were in place at the beginning of 2014 
and gave the strong leadership required to 
extend the businesses into new areas and 
develop acquisition opportunities.
Adjusted profit before tax, earnings per 
share and dividends
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 
3% to £56.2m (2013: £54.3m). There was 
a net finance expense this year of £0.5m 
(2013: £Nil) which included £0.4m of bank 
facility and commitment fees, following 
the renewal of the Group’s bank facilities 
in June 2014. A change in the interest rate 
used to calculate the return on the pension 
scheme assets, required by IAS19 (revised), 
led to a net interest charge against profit this 
year of £0.2m, compared with net interest 
income of £0.2m last year. Statutory profit 
before tax was £49.8m (2013: £48.5m), after 
acquisition related charges of £6.4m (2013: 
£5.6m) and fair value remeasurements of 
the put options held over minority interests 
which this year were net £Nil (2013: £0.2m).
The Group’s adjusted effective accounting 
tax charge fell again in 2014 to 26.3% of 
adjusted profit before tax (2013: 27.3%). 
This reflected the benefit of a further 
reduction in the effective UK corporation 
tax rates to 22.0% (2013: 23.5%), together 
with the benefit of current and prior year 
manufacturing tax relief claims in the 
US Seals businesses which led to a lower 
effective tax rate in the US of 35% (2013: 
38%). The Group’s cash tax rate on adjusted 
profit before tax fell to 23.1% (2013: 27.3%) 
as UK tax payments benefited from the 
exercise of share awards last year under 
the Group’s LTIP.
Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) 
increased by 4% to 36.1p, compared with 
34.8p last year reflecting the benefit from 
the lower effective tax rate this year. IFRS 
basic earnings per share increased to 31.4p 
(2013: 30.7p).
The Board continues to pursue a policy 
of increasing dividends to shareholders 
each year, while targeting towards two 
times dividend cover (defined as the ratio 
of adjusted EPS to total dividends paid and 
proposed for the year). Given the strong 
underlying performance and encouraging 
prospects for acquisition activity in 2015, 
the Directors have recommended an 
increase in the final dividend of 8% to 11.6p 
per share. This gives a total dividend per 
share for the year of 17.0p per share which 
represents an 8% increase on the prior 
year dividend of 15.7p. The dividend cover 
moves to 2.1 times from 2.2 times reported 
last year.
Free cash flow
The Group continues to generate strong 
free cash flow which in 2014 was £37.8m 
(2013: £31.6m), despite funding an increase 
in working capital to support the stronger 
trading environment towards the end of 
the year. Free cash flow, which is before 
expenditure on acquisitions or returns to 
shareholders, represented 91% of adjusted 
profit after tax (2013: 80%).
The increase in funding of working 
capital of £4.6m (2013: £1.1m) led to a 
small reduction in operating cash flow 
of £0.9m to £55.0m (2013: £55.9m). This 
increase was driven by increased inventory 
of £4.6m (2013: £0.9m) which reflected a 
number of operational priorities, including 
contingencies held against a possible 
longshoreman’s dispute in the United 
States. The higher level of inventories at the 
year end led to the Group’s KPI metric of 
working capital as a proportion of revenue 
increasing to 17.2%, compared with 16.7% 
last year.
Group tax payments reduced by £1.8m 
to £13.0m (2013: £14.8m) despite higher 
profits, primarily because of the tax relief 
taken on the exercise of the LTIP share 
awards in 2013 and reflecting the benefit 
of small prior year tax repayments in the 
US Seals businesses. On an underlying 
basis and before the currency effects of 
translation, cash tax payments remained 
in line with last year at ca.27% of adjusted 
profit before tax. 
As anticipated last year, capital expenditure 
reduced to a more normal level of £2.2m 
(2013: £4.6m) as the Group’s Investment 
for Growth programme reached its final 
stages. During the year, £0.3m was invested 
in the ongoing ERP implementation in 
the Canadian Healthcare businesses 
which represents the final project in this 
programme. This compares with £2.0m of 
capital invested in this programme last year. 
Outside of the Investment for Growth 
programme, the Healthcare businesses in 
Canada and Australia also reduced their 
expenditure on acquiring field equipment to 
support customer contracts with hospitals 
to £0.7m (2013: £1.7m). Last year this 
expenditure included £1.0m on funding 
endoscopy contracts in Vantage structured 
on a cost per procedure (“CPP”) basis; these 
contracts have been delayed, pending 
the introduction in 2015 of a new series 
of endoscopes. In the Seals and Controls 
Sectors, £0.5m was spent on new tooling 
and warehouse equipment, including 
£0.1m on line-side equipment to support 
a new supply project in the IS Group. A 
further £0.2m was invested in refurbishing 
the office and warehouse facilities in 
Hawco and HKX and £0.5m was spent 
on upgrading the existing IT hardware and 
software infrastructure in a number of the 
Group’s businesses. 
The Company paid the PAYE income tax 
liability of £1.8m arising on the exercise 
of LTIP share awards, in exchange for 
reduced share awards to participants; the 
comparable payments last year of £4.7m 
related to the exercise of several awards 
which had vested in earlier years under 
the Company’s LTIP. 
The Group spent £16.5m of the free 
cash flow on acquisitions, as described 
below and £18.4m (2013: £17.6m) on 
paying dividends to both Company and 
minority shareholders.
Acquisitions completed during the year
The Group invested cash of £16.5m  
(2013: £2.2m) in acquisitions during 
the year, including £1.5m on acquiring 
outstanding minority interests and £0.1m 
of deferred consideration.

ROATCE. The comparative ROATCEs for

The Group continues to maintain a strong 
balance sheet with net cash funds increasing 
during the year by £2.0m to £21.3m at 
30 September 2014. Surplus cash funds 
are generally repatriated to the UK, unless 
they are required locally to meet certain 
commitments, including acquisitions.
On 28 June 2014, the Group renewed its 
existing revolving multi-currency credit 
facility at £25m, with an option for the 
Group to extend this facility to £50m, 
subject to market pricing. This facility, 
which is generally utilised to meet any 
shortfall in cash to fund acquisitions, 
is committed until June 2017 and was 
renewed on more favourable terms than 
the previous facility. 
Employee pension obligations
Pension benefits to existing employees, 
both in the UK and overseas, are provided 
through defined contribution schemes  
at an aggregate cost in 2014 of £1.7m 
(2013: £1.5m).
The Group also maintains a small legacy 
defined benefit pension scheme in the UK 
which has been closed to new entrants and 
further accruals for many years. The latest 
triennial actuarial valuation was carried out 
as at 30 September 2013 and the funding 
deficit remained unchanged at £2.7m, with 
strong equity returns in 2013 offsetting 
the large reduction in bond yields since 
the last valuation was completed in 2010. 
The Group continues to make regular 
cash contributions to the scheme at an 
annual rate of £0.3m, as agreed with the 
actuary, with the objective of eliminating 
the funding deficit over eight years. The 
Group continues to look for opportunities 
to provide sufficient security to the 
Trustees in order to limit any requirement 
to increase the existing cash contribution 
to the scheme.
On an accounting basis, a further reduction 
of ca.0.5% in bond yields since last year was 
again offset by stronger equity returns and 
the accounting deficit improved to £4.3m at 
30 September 2014 (2013: £4.7m). Scheme 
assets which are largely represented by 
equities, increased by £1.6m to £24.9m 
while pension liabilities increased by £1.2m 
to £29.2m.

acquired for cash consideration of £1.5m. 
The acquisition of Kentek in January 
2014 included put/call options over the 
outstanding 20% of share capital held by 
management in this business which were 
valued at £2.3m. 
At 30 September 2014, the put options over 
the outstanding minority interests held in 
M Seals and Kentek were valued at £3.5m, 
based on the Directors’ latest estimate of 
the Earnings before Interest and Tax (“EBIT”) 
of these businesses when these options 
are expected to crystallise. The Directors 
expect to acquire 10% of the outstanding 
minority interest in Kentek within the next 
six months, with the remaining interest likely 
be exercised between the next two and 
five years. 
In addition to the liability to minority 
shareholders, the Group also has a 
liability at 30 September 2014 for deferred 
consideration of up to £0.5m (2013: £0.2m) 
primarily relating to acquisitions completed 
during the year and which, subject to 
achievement of performance conditions, 
will be paid before the end of the 2015 
calendar year. During the year, deferred 
consideration of £0.1m was paid to the 
vendor of BGS, the Australian Healthcare 
business acquired in 2010 and there 
remains £0.1m which will be paid shortly.
Return on adjusted trading capital 
employed and capital management
A key metric that the Group uses to provide 
an indication of the overall profitability of 
the Group and its success in creating value 
for shareholders is the Return on Adjusted 
Trading Capital Employed (“ROATCE”). This 
is a pre-tax measure which is applied against 
the fixed assets and working capital of the 
Group, together with all the acquisition 
related charges and goodwill previously 
written off. At 30 September 2014, the 
Group ROATCE remained unchanged 
from last year at 25.8%. Adjusted trading 
capital employed is set out in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
At the Sector level, we have this year 
amended the basis of the ROATCE 
calculation to be consistent with that used 
to calculate Group ROATCE. In particular, 
all previously written off acquisition related 
charges and goodwill is now included in 
each Sector’s trading capital employed 
for the purposes of calculating Sector 
The largest investment was £9.9m in 
acquiring 80% of Kentek, a business based 
in Finland, but with a large proportion of 
its sales being carried out across Russia 
in supplying filters and related products 
for a range of heavy mobile machinery. 
A further £5.0m, was invested in acquiring 
several small, but strategically important 
businesses which extend either the product 
or geography of the Group’s existing 
businesses. These acquisitions added £9.0m 
to the Group’s acquired intangible assets 
which at 30 September 2014 were £28.6m, 
after amortisation of £5.6m (2013: £5.6m). 
Goodwill increased by £6.0m to £80.2m at 
30 September 2014, after making some small 
fair value adjustments to the assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is assessed 
each year to determine whether there 
has been any impairment in the historic 
value of goodwill acquired. This year the 
assessment has been carried out at a 
Sector level rather than a business unit 
level as this more accurately reflects the 
level at which management monitor the 
value of goodwill. The exercise to assess 
whether goodwill has been impaired which 
is described in note 10 to the consolidated 
financial statements, concluded that there 
had been no impairment in the value of 
goodwill at 30 September 2014. 
Shortly after the year end, the DHG 
business completed the acquisition of 80% 
of Technopath Distribution Limited for cash 
consideration of £9.6m and debt acquired 
of £1.5m. Put/call options have also been 
included which allows the Group to acquire 
the outstanding minority shares over a 
period of up to five years. 
Liabilities to minority shareholders
At 30 September 2014, the Group’s 
liability to purchase outstanding minority 
shareholdings had increased modestly to 
£3.5m (2013: £2.8m). During the year, the 
outstanding minority interests of 20% in

Life Sciences
The Life Sciences Sector businesses supply 
a range of consumables, instrumentation 
and related services to the healthcare and 
environmental industries.
Healthcare
The Diploma Healthcare Group (“DHG”) in Canada comprises three 
principal operating businesses which supply to the ca.600 public 
hospitals across the country as well as to private clinics and laboratories. 
Somagen Diagnostics (“Somagen”) supplies a range of consumables  
and instruments used in the diagnostic testing of blood, tissue and other 
samples in hospital pathology laboratories. It is also a leading supplier  
to the growing, assisted reproductive technology (“ART”) market. AMT 
Electrosurgery (“AMT”) supplies specialised electrosurgery equipment 
and consumables for use in hospital operating rooms. AMT is also 
building a portfolio of specialised surgical instruments and devices used 
in minimally invasive (“MI”) Surgery. Vantage Endoscopy (“Vantage”) 
supplies medical devices and related consumables and services to 
GI Endoscopy suites in hospitals and private clinics. 
DHG also operates in Australia and New Zealand through Diagnostic 
Solutions (“DSL”) and Big Green Surgical (“BGS”) which are both located 
in Melbourne. BGS and DSL focus on similar markets respectively to  
the AMT and Somagen businesses and share a number of common 
suppliers. In October 2014, DHG extended its operations into Ireland 
and the UK with the acquisition of Technopath Distribution (“TPD”).
Environmental
The a1-Group is a supplier to Environmental testing laboratories and to 
Health & Safety engineers. The a1-envirosciences business, based in 
Germany, supplies a range of specialised environmental analysers and  
a range of containment enclosures for potent powder handling. The 
a1-CBISS business, based in the UK, supplies equipment and services for 
the monitoring and control of environmental emissions, as well as a range 
of gas detection devices.

Market drivers
The DHG businesses in Canada supply into areas of Healthcare 
which are predominantly public sector funded. Private sector funding 
in Canada is mostly focused on areas where DHG does not participate, 
including dental, cosmetic and eye surgery and pharmaceuticals. The 
principal demand driver for DHG is therefore the level of healthcare 
spending funded by the Canadian Government.
The Canadian Healthcare industry is a proven, long term growth 
environment for medical device distribution. A growing, aging and 
well educated population demands high standards of service delivery, 
helping to ensure ongoing growing demand; per capita healthcare 
spending in Canada is in the top 20% of OECD countries. The Canadian 
Health Act (“the Act”) ensures universal coverage for all insured persons 
for all medically necessary services provided by hospitals, physicians 
and other healthcare providers. The Provinces are responsible for the 
delivery of the healthcare services, but the Federal Government controls 
delivery through Federal Provincial transfer payments, which represent 
the largest source of revenues for the Provinces.
The relative stability and consistency in funding by each of the 
Provinces, guaranteed through the Act, ensures that the market remains 
well funded through the economic cycle. Over many years, healthcare 
expenditure has grown steadily with annual variations mostly dependent 
on the periodic additional tranches of funding provided by individual 
Provinces. In periods when the economy is slower, as has been the case 
in 2013 and 2014, healthcare funding may be constrained. This can be 
experienced through targeted controls imposed on the number of 
laboratory tests and operating procedures as well as more rigorous 
tendering processes for expenditure on capital equipment. Even during 
such periods, however, healthcare funding has shown positive growth 
albeit at reduced levels.
The Healthcare market in Australia shares with Canada many of the same 
attractive characteristics for specialised distribution. While privately funded 
healthcare is more prevalent in areas such as surgery and laboratory 
testing, public sector healthcare funding is still large and supported  
by a stable, resource based economy. As with Canada, there is a large 
geography to be covered, low population density and purchasing 
processes that vary by State. These characteristics necessarily demand  
a significant investment by manufacturers in technical sales and service 
resource which makes the specialised distribution model more attractive 
as an efficient way to serve the market. The Australian Healthcare market 
has experienced similar economic pressures to those in Canada but 
again has shown some growth, driven by increased private sector 
spending offsetting decreased spending in real terms in the public sector.
The a1-group supplies to customers in the Environmental industry in 
the UK, Germany and France. The market demand is largely driven by 
Environmental and Health & Safety regulations and growth in recent 
years has been driven by the need to be compliant with a range of EU 
regulations. Since market demand is driven by regulation, this ensures 
reasonably steady demand for essential consumable products and 
services, though customers may defer capital expenditure during 
significant downturns in the economy.

ROATCE 21.9% 22.3%
Reported revenues of the Life Sciences businesses decreased by 2% 
to £91.4m (2013: £93.2m) because of the translational currency impact 
from the significant weakening in the Canadian and Australian dollars 
relative to UK sterling. On a constant currency basis, underlying 
revenues increased by 9%. Similarly on a reported basis, adjusted 
operating profit decreased in UK sterling terms by 6% to £19.7m 
(2013: £20.9m), but increased by 8% on a constant currency basis.
Gross margins in the Healthcare businesses were significantly impacted 
by the strong depreciation of the Canadian and Australian dollars against 
the US dollar and the Euro, which are the currencies in which their 
products are mostly purchased; the impact was increasingly felt as the 
year progressed, with existing hedging contracts being replaced by less 
favourable contracts. These transactional currency effects were partly 
mitigated by an increased proportion of higher margin consumable 
product revenues this year and by price concessions negotiated with 
suppliers. However, Sector gross margins still reduced by 190bps in the 
first half and by 300bps in the second half, compared to the prior year 
comparable periods. The impact of these reduced gross margins was 
limited by tight management of operating costs and the benefits from 
prior year investments and adjusted operating margins decreased by only 
80bps to 21.6% (2013: 22.4%).
Capital expenditure in the Sector was £1.2m (2013: £2.8m), which included 
£0.7m invested in field equipment for placement in hospitals and clinics 
by the Healthcare businesses and £0.3m invested in the new ERP systems 
in Somagen and Vantage as part of the Group’s broader Investment for 
Growth programme. Somagen completed the installation of its new 
ERP system in February 2014 and the implementation at Vantage is well 
underway, with plans to go live in the first half of the new financial year. 
The implementation of the new ERP system in AMT will be completed 
in the second half of 2015. Free cash flow increased by 6% to £14.9m 
(2013: £14.1m), reflecting lower capital expenditure and tax payments, 
offset in part by higher investment in working capital.
Healthcare
Revenues from the DHG group of Healthcare businesses, which 
account for 80% of Sector revenues, increased by 8% after adjusting for 
translational currency effects and for the initial contribution from a small 
business acquired in Australia. 
The Canadian Healthcare businesses increased revenues by 6% in local 
currency, with very strong consumable revenues more than offsetting 
weaker capital and service revenues. Somagen was the strongest 
performer with increased consumable revenues across its key suppliers 
and boosted by the supply of testing kits used in the roll-out of 
colorectal cancer screening programmes across three Provinces. 
Capital equipment sales have been at a somewhat reduced level this 
year, but good progress has been made in establishing Somagen in the 
HbA1c diabetes testing market with best in class technology and as a key 
player in the Autoimmunity market. Somagen has also been successful 
in adding new suppliers and products in specialised market segments 
including quality control products used in calibrating and monitoring 
clinical diagnostic instrumentation, automated testing of urine and 
sterile fluids and specialised immunoassay technology to assess the 
progression of diseases by tracking specific proteins and antibodies. 
These efforts have contributed to Somagen entering the new financial 
year with a good backlog of capital equipment orders and good 
prospects for sales of new instrumentation.
AMT’s core electrosurgery business, led by the new Penevac 1 product 
(combined electrode and smoke evacuation device), continued to deliver 
strong double-digit growth in volume terms, though growth in value 
terms has been constrained by keener pricing in certain central buying 
group tenders. Though these tenders can put pressure on the pricing of 
core products such as the Penevac and the Megapad grounding pad, 
success generally results in higher unit volumes for these core products, 
as well as the opportunity to achieve preferred status for a broader range 
of products. AMT also made further progress in its minimally invasive 
(“MI”) Surgery division, consolidating its position in the supply of 
specialised surgical instruments and devices used in laparoscopic and 
other MI Surgery procedures. Good advances have been made with 
core product lines, ranging from surgical instruments used in standard 
laparoscopic procedures, to leading edge interventional radiology and 
oncology products for use in the treatment of cancer and cancer 
related conditions.
Vantage continued to generate strong growth in revenues from 
consumable products and service which this year accounted for 
ca.80% of Vantage revenues (2013: ca.65%). In particular there were 
strong performances from the sale of argon plasma probes, from the 
specialty chemicals used in endoscope reprocessors and from tubing 
sets for endoscopes as well as from other endoscopic accessories 
including specialist retrieval devices. Capital equipment revenues were 
significantly reduced compared with the prior year, when Vantage had 
an exceptionally strong year for sales of endoscope reprocessors and 
argon plasma coagulation units. Vantage’s supplier of endoscopes 
has this year launched its new 600 series endoscope range, offering 
significant benefits in terms of image quality and handling ability. 
Vantage has been trialling the new endoscopes with target customers 
in the second half of the year and the response has been positive 
which should give momentum to capital sales in the new financial year.
In Australia and New Zealand, revenues from DSL and BGS increased 
by 19% in local currency. BGS generated strong growth by penetrating 
the existing market for smoke evacuation products, as well as creating 
new demand for these products. BGS also continued to deliver steady 
growth in electrosurgical grounding pads and laparoscopic electrodes. 
DSL has continued to generate good growth in its consumable products 
and service business, but had a softer year for capital sales. Encouraging 
progress was made, however, in developing opportunities in HbA1c 
diabetes testing, haemoglobin testing and autoimmunity. Following 
the integration last year of operations and back office functions in 
Melbourne, DSL and BGS are successfully operating as distinct sales 
and marketing businesses, benefiting from a single leadership group 
and shared operations and back office systems in Melbourne – giving 
the efficiencies and critical mass of a shared services group.

Life Sciences 25 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
During the year, DHG acquired the remaining 20% minority shareholdings 
in DSL and in July 2014, DHG acquired the assets and goodwill of 
Chemzyme Australia, a small distributor of enzymatic cleaning products 
supplied to the sterilising departments in hospitals across Australia and 
New Zealand. Chemzyme has been integrated successfully into DHG’s 
operations in Melbourne. The principal supplier to Chemzyme has signed 
a new ten year exclusive distribution agreement with DHG in Australia as 
well as extending its agreement with Vantage in Canada.
Shortly after the year end, in early October 2014, DHG acquired 80% of 
TPD, an established supplier to the Biotechnology, Clinical Laboratory 
and Medical markets in Ireland and the UK. The principal owner 
managers of the business will remain as Directors of TPD and retain a 
20% minority shareholding with put and call options to allow the Group 
to acquire the shares over a period of up to five years. TPD employs 
ca.40 staff at its principal location in Ballina, County Tipperary and 
shares certain key suppliers with the DHG business in Canada. The 
acquisition of TPD represents an important first step in extending the 
scope of the Group’s Healthcare businesses into the markets of Ireland 
and the UK, as well as adding important new products and suppliers.
Environmental
Revenues from the Environmental businesses, which account for 20% 
of Sector revenues increased by 14% in constant currency terms. The 
a1-envirosciences business based in Germany increased revenues by 
8%, generating good sales of analytical instruments in both the UK and 
Germany, while increasing the penetration of its laboratory enclosure 
systems across Europe. The business has also enjoyed an increase in 
service revenues following an investment in engineering staff last year. 
During the year, the business’s largest supplier of analytical instruments 
extended its exclusive distribution arrangements with a1-envirosciences 
to include France.
The a1-CBISS business based in the UK experienced another strong 
year of trading, with revenues growing by 20%. There was further strong 
growth in sales of CEMS (continuous emissions monitoring systems) 
equipment for both alternative energy and conventional electricity 
generating stations, though more demanding tender requirements had 
an impact on gross margins. a1-CBISS also benefited from its strong

The Seals Sector businesses supply a 
range of hydraulic seals, gaskets, filters, 
cylinders, components and kits used in 
heavy mobile machinery and specialised 
industrial equipment.
Aftermarket
The Aftermarket businesses supply sealing and associated products to 
support a broad range of mobile machinery in applications including 
heavy construction, logging, mining, agriculture, material handling (lift 
trucks, fork lifts and dump trucks) and refuse collection. The products 
are generally supplied on a next day delivery basis and are used in the 
repair and maintenance of equipment after it has completed its initial 
warranty period or lease term, or has been sold on in the pre-used 
market. The main customers are machinery and cylinder repair shops, 
engine and transmission rebuilders and other heavy equipment 
parts distributors. 
Industrial OEM
The Industrial OEM businesses supply seals, gaskets, O-rings and 
custom moulded and machined parts to a range of Industrial OEM 
customers. The businesses work closely with customers to select the 
most appropriate seal material and manufacturer for the application, 
provide technical support and guidance during the product 
development process and provide the logistics capabilities to supply 
from inventory for small to medium sized production runs.

Market drivers
The principal market drivers for both the Aftermarket and Industrial 
OEM Seals businesses is the growth in the general industrial economies, 
in particular North America where ca.70% of Sector revenues are 
generated. In 2014, the USA economy is forecast to show annual GDP 
growth of 2.8% (2013: 2.8%) as the economy contracted during the 
severe winter weather but then returned to steady growth. In Canada, 
2014 GDP growth is forecast to improve to 2.7% (2013: 1.9%). In general , 
the economic conditions in the principal South and Central American 
economies served by the Aftermarket businesses have been challenging.
In Europe, where ca.25% of Sector revenues are generated, the industrial 
economies have been variable in 2013 and 2014. The UK economy 
showed growth in the early part of 2014, whilst the Continental 
European markets have remained broadly flat.
For the Aftermarket businesses, activity and spending levels in the US 
Heavy Construction sector are important, since this market accounts 
for over 50% of Aftermarket Seals revenues. Statistics on total US 
Construction Spend include non-residential and infrastructure spend, 
as well as residential housing activity. Following the significant drop in 
spending ahead of the 2008 financial crisis the index started to recover 
in 2010 and the rate of steady annual growth has continued into 2013 
and 2014.
 
US Construction Equipment unit sales of heavy mobile equipment 
(including excavators above 12 tonnes, crawler dozers and wheeled 
loaders), is an important short term indicator for the HKX attachment kit 
business. It is also important as a medium term indicator for Hercules’ 
replacement hydraulic seals activities, as the new heavy equipment will 
move out of the dealer warranty period in the coming years. There was 
an exceptional level of growth from 2009 to 2012 as tighter emissions 
legislation accelerated machine replacement and hire companies 
re-equipped their fleets. The rate of growth slowed significantly in 
2013 across all heavy mobile equipment types but recovered in 2014.
 
For the Industrial OEM seal businesses, the most appropriate indicator 
is the US Industrial Production Index, which has continued at a near 
constant, modest growth rate since the 2008/2009 recession. The index 
moved above pre-recession levels in the second half of 2013 and has 
continued to rise in the first half of 2014. 28 DIPLOMA PLC Strategic Report

2014 2013
Revenue £119.8m £106.1m
Adjusted operating profit £21.7m £19.5m
Adjusted operating margin 18.1% 18.4%
Free cash flow £16.4m £15.9m
ROATCE 26.0% 27.1%
The Seals businesses increased revenues by 13% to £119.8m (2013: 
£106.1m) which included part year contributions from Kentek, acquired 
in January 2014 and two smaller bolt-on acquisitions in the UK. After 
adjusting for the additional contribution from these acquisitions and for 
the impact from currency translation, underlying revenues increased by 
7%. The acquisition of Kentek and the continued development of the 
FPE Seals and M Seals businesses, through organic growth and bolt-on 
acquisitions, have increased the European region’s share of total Seals 
revenues from ca.15% in 2013 to ca.25% in 2014. 
Adjusted operating profits increased by 11% to £21.7m (2013: £19.5m), 
but with Kentek joining the Group with lower initial operating margins, 
adjusted operating margins reduced by 30bps to 18.1% (2013: 18.4%). 
Across the Seals businesses, gross margins continued to be resilient, 
underpinned by essential product availability and added value technical 
service. Operating margins in the HFPG and FPE Seals businesses 
improved as they benefited from prior year investment in people, 
facilities and equipment. 
Free cash flow increased by £0.5m to £16.4m (2013: £15.9m), as 
increased working capital, particularly in the US businesses, reduced 
the contribution from higher operating profits. Capital expenditure 
decreased to £0.5m (2013: £0.9m) following the completion last year of 
the Investment for Growth programme. In HKX, £0.3m was invested in 
new automated tube-bending equipment and on expanding the facility 
to manage higher growth in this business. Further investment was also 
made in the Clearwater facility in vertical storage carousels to deliver 
increased efficiencies in inventory handling. 
Aftermarket
The Aftermarket businesses, which now account for ca.60% of Sector 
revenues, reported a 21% increase in overall revenues. After adjusting for 
currency translation and the acquisitions of Kentek and AB Seals, 
underlying revenues increased by 5%. 
In the US, Hercules Bulldog grew domestic sales by a robust 6%, despite 
the disruption caused to general infrastructure projects and heavy 
construction activities by the severe winter conditions across much of 
the US which extended through to the end of May. Sales to smaller 
sub-distributors and OEM cylinder manufacturers increased strongly 
compared to the prior year and the US business continued to develop 
its electronic trading capabilities. The level of sales processed online 
increased by 26% and now accounts for ca.20% of Hercules Bulldog 
revenues in the US. The seal machining centres in Hercules Bulldog also 
continued to deliver good growth, with strong demand from repair shop 
customers looking to source hard-to-find and outsized seals within 
24 hours. Capacity will be further expanded with a fourth machine 
which is on order for delivery in 2015. Revenues from exports outside 
the US, which account for 25% of Hercules Bulldog sales, decreased by 
5% with reduced demand in Mexico, Central America and Saudi Arabia 
impacting performance, particularly in the first half of the year. 
The Hercules Canada businesses in Ontario and Quebec delivered 
growth at a similar level to the US, supported by strong sales to OEM 
cylinder manufacturers. The first half of the year was more challenging 
as the Canadian economy adjusted to the downturn in demand for 
natural resources, but the businesses continued to be successful in 
winning key orders as confidence returned in the second half. The 
operation in Barrie, Ontario successfully completed its move to a new, 
custom built facility in October 2013, providing Hercules Canada with a 
first class platform for future growth.
HKX had an excellent year and resumed its upward momentum after a 
pause in 2013 following several periods of exceptional growth. Revenues 
increased by 14% with strong demand from the core excavator dealers 
and from specialist installers linked to the equipment OEMs. During 
2014, the new emissions regulations for heavy mobile equipment 
continued to be implemented, with the machines fitted with Tier 4 
Interim technology beginning to be phased out and replaced by Tier 4 
Final technology equipment. With OEM engineering resources focused 
on this technology transition, more excavators were delivered to dealers 
without attachments which provided increased demand for HKX’s 
attachment kits. In 2014, HKX also successfully introduced new products 
and a quality enhancement programme. It also invested in improved 
automated tube-bending equipment and re-engineered process flows 
in its expanded facility in the US. 
In the European region, plans to create a more substantial, unified 
European Seals Aftermarket group continued to take shape in 2014. 
These Aftermarket activities are now centred on FPE Seals with its 
operations in the UK and the Netherlands. FPE Seals delivered strong 
organic revenue growth of 11% in the year against the background of a 
positive economic environment in the UK, although Continental Europe 
remains challenging. There was continued success in expanding sales 
of hydraulic cylinder metal parts and the seal machining centre installed 
at the Doncaster operation in late 2013, also contributed to the positive 
overall result. FPE Seals acquired AB Seals in February 2014, a small 
addition to its UK operations which is based in Gravesend, Kent and 
strengthens the FPE Seals coverage of the important South East region 
of the UK. 
Outside the core, directly-served markets in the Americas and Europe, 
the principal products sold by the Aftermarket businesses are the 
Bulldog branded seal and gasket kits. With effect from October 2014, 
FPE Seals will take over responsibility, from Hercules Bulldog, for the 
sales of these Bulldog products to the Middle East and Africa creating 
a unified EMEA Aftermarket sales region. Hercules Bulldog will retain 
responsibility for Bulldog sales in the Americas.
In January 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of 80% of Kentek, a 
specialised distributor of filters and related products, used in heavy mobile 
machinery and industrial equipment applications. Kentek is based in 
Finland with operations in Russia and the Baltic States and the acquisition 
extends the reach of the Seals activities into these new markets. Kentek 
has solid, long term relationships with its key suppliers and customers in 
each of its territories and has performed well and in line with expectations 
since acquisition. The business has managed the inevitable pressures 
exerted on the Russian economy and the international supply chain by 
sanctions imposed following the conflicts in Ukraine and Crimea. 
Sector Review continued
Seals 29 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
Industrial OEM
The Industrial OEM businesses, which account for ca.40% of Sector 
revenues, reported a 3% increase in revenues. After adjusting for 
currency and the small acquisition of Ramsay Services, underlying 
revenue growth was 8%. 
In North America, the Industrial OEM businesses (RT Dygert, J Royal and 
All Seals) all performed well in a generally positive industrial economy. 
As in the prior year, the Industrial OEM businesses continued with 
initiatives to move up the value chain, by procuring higher level technical 
approvals to meet the more stringent demands of customers. The 
businesses have continued to gain expertise in the approval processes 
and in qualifying new products for new and existing OEM customers.
RT Dygert delivered another year of solid growth, increasing revenues by 
5% and benefiting from its investment in the development of regulatory-
compliant elastomer compounds to penetrate the Pharmaceutical, Water 
and Petrochemical industries. Solid gains were also made in the supply 
of parts to catalogue houses and these gains more than offset a small 
reduction in demand from the traditional mid-West cylinder producers. 
In July 2014, RT Dygert acquired the outstanding 49% shareholding in 
the HPS business in Seattle, taking its ownership to 100%. HPS delivered 
strong growth in 2014 benefiting from demand for its heavy duty and 
harsh environment seals for specialist construction equipment. 
All Seals delivered a strong performance in 2014, increasing revenues 
by 11%, as the investment in people and equipment in prior periods 
came through in the results. All Seals reported good gains in the Water, 
Oil & Gas and Medical sectors with the introduction of new, higher 
specification products and the addition of new customers. The Seals 
Sector’s first water-jet gasket cutting machine became fully operational 
during the year, supporting the growing demand for rapid turnaround 
custom gaskets and contributing to the overall positive revenue growth. 
In November 2014, All Seals will open a branch operation in Houston, 
Texas to serve the large Texas Oil & Gas sector.
J Royal delivered 16% revenue growth in 2014, benefiting from the 
significant investments made last year in management and sales 
resources. Development lead times can be lengthy for new product 
introductions as OEM customers, prior to ordering production-level 
quantities, require the completion of stringent quality control processes. 
In 2014, J Royal saw the results of its efforts in the successful introduction 
of many new products to existing OEM customers. J Royal also benefited 
from exceptionally strong demand from the Water sector and filter 
manufacturers and was also successful in penetrating new, smaller 
customer accounts across the Eastern US, as its expanded sales team 
began to win new business. 
In Europe, M Seals had a mixed year in its different markets, but 
increased overall revenues by 8%, helped by the contribution from the 
acquisition of Ramsay Services. Revenues in the long-established Danish 
territory were flat as the Danish markets hovered between contraction 
and growth in the year. The Swedish operation continued to deliver 
double-digit growth and the business is now expanding out of its 
Southern base with the addition of a dedicated sales person for the 
important industrial region around Stockholm. Sales of large bearing 
seals to Chinese wind power customers were subdued for a second 
year as the Chinese wind power industry struggled to regain its earlier 
momentum. In December 2013, our European Industrial OEM activities 
were expanded through the acquisition of Ramsay Services, located in 
Gateshead in the UK. Ramsay is a small, specialist distributor of O-rings 
and holds the AS9120 accreditation for the Aerospace sector, as well as 
having valuable expertise in the UK Oil & Gas sector. M Seals has taken 
full responsibility for the Ramsay operation and the business has 
performed well since acquisition.

Market drivers
Industrial economic background
The Controls businesses focus on specialised, technical applications 
in a range of industries, with over 90% of Sector revenues generated in 
the UK and Continental Europe (principally Germany). The background 
market drivers are therefore the growth of the industrial economies in 
the UK and Germany.
A good indicator of the health of the UK industrial economy is the UK 
Index of Production. This index tracks the severe decline in 2009 caused 
by the financial crisis, partial recovery in 2010 and then a continued 
steady decline in 2011 and 2012. Towards the end of 2012, the index 
returned to growth and has increased steadily through to 2014. This 
reflects increased confidence in the UK economy in general, although 
activity remains below pre-recession levels.
Similarly, the German Production Sector Output Index again tracks the 
severe decline in 2008 and 2009, but shows a sharper recovery until 
2011. The index has since stabilised around pre-recession levels.
Specific industry drivers – Interconnect
Although influenced by the general industrial economic cycles, there are 
also more specific drivers within the main market segments served by 
the Interconnect businesses.
The Civil Aerospace market continued to grow steadily with growth in 
World Passenger Traffic averaging 5–6% p.a. New aircraft continue to 
come into service with the trend towards replacing ageing fleets with 
more fuel efficient wider bodied aircraft. The Civil Aircraft markets are 
also seeing increased activity in the interiors market where the wide 
range of complex seating and entertainment systems is driving growth. 
The Defence markets in the UK and Germany remain subdued following 
the reduction in government spending on defence following the 
reduction in activity in conflict areas. The recent engagement in 
conflicts in 2014 may however prompt a review of defence spending 
levels in the UK and Germany.
In the UK, the Motorsport market has benefited from change of the 
Formula 1 engine to the new 1.6 V6 turbo engine and the new ERS 
(Energy Recovery System) technology. Activity in preparation for the 
new Formula E series has also gained momentum.
Specific industry drivers – Fluid Controls
The Fluid Controls business generate almost 70% of their revenues 
from the Food and Beverage sector in the UK. In Food Retailing, there 
are significant structural changes which are impacting segment growth 
rates including the trend away from major out-of-town stores to 
convenience stores and the increase in home shopping and delivery. 
These trends, along with the increasing need for “at source” cooling in 
smaller Brewery industry outlets, are driving demand for smaller, more 
energy efficient components as supplied by Hawco.
The coffee market sector continues to grow and the UK retail coffee 
market has reached over £1 billion p.a. Abbeychart supplies both 
the coffee machine manufacturers and the aftermarket sector, 
predominately in the UK but also in Europe. The traditional hot and cold 
drinks vending and pure water operator/contractor sectors are facing a 
period of consolidation due to limited growth and excess capacity. 32 DIPLOMA PLC Strategic Report

Adjusted operating margin 16.2% 16.1%
Free cash flow £11.4m £10.8m
ROATCE 33.2% 32.0%
The Controls businesses increased revenues by 10% to £94.6m 
(2013: £86.2m), including part year contributions from Specialty Fasteners 
and Components (“SFC”), acquired in June 2014 and Sacee, a small 
connector distributor acquired in October 2013. After adjusting for the 
contribution from these acquisitions and for the impact of currency 
translation, underlying revenues increased by 8%. 
Adjusted operating profits increased by 10% to £15.3m (2013: £13.9m) 
and adjusted operating margins held steady at 16.2% (2013: 16.1%). 
Overall gross margins in the Controls businesses remained resilient with 
their focus on specialised markets and added value opportunities. The 
benefits from investment programmes completed last year also enabled 
the businesses to gain some operational leverage which offset the 
impact from the lower initial operating margin of SFC.
Free cash flow increased by £0.6m to £11.4m (2013: £10.8m), with 
working capital increasing to take advantage of opportunities within 
existing markets; this investment more than offset the contribution 
from increased operating profits. Capital expenditure reduced by 
£0.4m to £0.5m (2013: £0.9m) following completion last year of the 
new IS-Rayfast facility and Hawco’s investment in a new ERP system, 
as part of the Group’s broader Investment for Growth programme. 
The IS-Group invested £0.2m in upgrading its IT infrastructure by 
replacing older servers and adding further functionality to its existing 
manufacturing systems at IS-Cabletec. Hawco invested £0.2m in the 
relocation of its sales and administrative offices and extending the new 
ERP system into the Abbeychart business. 
Interconnect
The Interconnect businesses, which account for ca.70% of Sector 
revenues, increased revenues by 10% in UK sterling terms. After adjusting 
for acquisitions and currency translation effects, underlying revenues 
increased by 8%, reflecting good demand across the market sectors and 
particularly strong performances from the Civil Aerospace, Energy and 
Motorsport markets. 
Aerospace and Defence accounts for ca.40% of Interconnect revenues and 
in 2014, revenues increased by 5%, with Civil Aerospace maintaining strong 
positive momentum while the Military segments appeared to be stabilising. 
In Civil Aerospace, the supply of fasteners to the premium aircraft seating 
industry continued to grow, with Clarendon extending production line-side 
support to key customers and exploiting further opportunities to export to 
sub-contract manufacturers. There was also steady demand for the full 
range of electrical harnessing and protection products. In Military 
Aerospace, by contrast, the reduced annual production rate of Eurofighter 
aircraft continued to have an impact on sales of specialist connectors and 
bonding leads. 
The broader Defence markets in the UK remained subdued but the 
businesses were still able to deliver modest growth over the prior year. 
While no new major defence projects were initiated, there were signs that 
activity levels were higher at several specialist military harness contractors. 
IS-Rayfast also leveraged its excellent stocking profile to provide a rapid 
turnaround to support projects including the Astute 6 submarine build and 
modest upgrades to Hawk and Jaguar aircraft. There was continuing 
demand for IS-Cabletec’s cable protection products and an additional 
braiding machine was added during the year to meet increased production 
requirements. In Germany, Filcon’s traditionally strong sales of specialist 
connectors to the larger legacy military radio and engine projects were 
softer in 2014. As with the UK, however, IS-Sommer saw improved, general 
demand from German military harness sub-contractors. 
Sales to specialised Industrial markets (ca.25% of Interconnect revenues) 
were positive with revenues growing by 11%. In the UK, there was good, 
across-the-board demand for specialist tubing and for added value services 
such as re-spooling wire onto compact spools for repair and refurbishment 
customers. In Germany, there was also a strong performance in the 
Industrial markets, despite the uncertain manufacturing environment in  
the Eurozone countries. IS-Sommer continued to win business through  
an invigorated field sales team, again supported by superior stocking and 
value added services. Sales in the US benefited from the generally positive 
manufacturing environment.
Motorsport accounts for ca.20% of Interconnect revenues and this sector 
delivered revenue growth of 21% in 2014. There were gains in the UK, 
Germany and the US and across both the harnessing and fastener product 
groups. It was a record year for Motorsport revenues, primarily driven by the 
changes introduced to the Formula 1 racing series. For the 2014 season, the 
new 1.6 litre V6 turbo engine was introduced as well as upgraded Energy 
Recovery Systems. These changes required substantial development 
engineering and design work and our businesses closely supported the 
teams and engine manufacturers to ensure the new technologies were 
successfully introduced. Beyond Formula 1, the Formula E series prepared 
for the inaugural race and there was continued success in the US in 
servicing the Nascar and United Sports Cars series. In Germany, Filcon 
continued to grow its sales to VW and Porsche for the supply of connectors 
for the VW World Engine and for the Le Mans and GT car series.
In the Energy market (ca.10% of Interconnect revenues), IS-Sommer 
supplies components used in repair and refurbishment of low and medium 
voltage electricity distribution in Germany. In 2014, revenues increased by 
13% driven by a higher level of refurbishment work by its customers and 
benefiting from development work carried out in the prior year. Following 
its acquisition of Rayquick in late 2012, IS-Sommer secured its appointment 
as one of only two German master distributors for its key energy products 
supplier. In the UK, the businesses are focused on a small number of key 
customers involved in portable electricity generators, subsea power 
transmission cables and the manufacture of batteries. As the market is 
concentrated in a small number of key customers, demand can vary 
significantly and 2014 was a particularly positive year.
In October 2013, Filcon acquired the assets and goodwill of the Sacee 
business which supplies specialist connectors to the Satellite sector 
in France; its operations were successfully integrated into Filcon in Munich. 
In June 2014, the fastener business was strengthened by the acquisition of 
SFC, a UK based distributor of fasteners and ancillary products to the 
Aerospace, Industrial and Motorsport sectors. SFC has a strong fit 
Sector Review continued
Controls 33 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
with Clarendon and brings a long-standing reputation for technical 
competence, design skills and added-value assembly expertise to our 
rapidly expanding fastener activities. These acquisitions have strengthened 
the Group’s position in attractive segments of the Interconnect market and 
the performance of both businesses since acquisition has been good and 
in line with expectations. .
Fluid Controls
The Fluid Controls businesses, which account for ca.30% of Sector 
revenues, increased revenues by 9%. The Hawco business made 
significant gains in the core Food & Beverage sector, following a 
subdued prior year which had included delayed investments by 
customers and a hang-over of surplus catering equipment from the 
2012 London Olympics. 
In Food Retailing, Hawco has had to respond to significant 
structural changes in the industry and now is seeing the benefits of its 
repositioning and developmental activities. The trend away from major 
out-of-town food retail stores and towards convenience stores initially 
dampened demand for Hawco’s equipment, but Hawco is now having 
good success in both the UK and Europe with its range of scroll 
compressors which offer a smaller footprint and greater efficiency. 
Hawco is also seeing growing demand for refrigeration units used in 
transport applications reflecting the increased use of home shopping 
and delivery. Sales into the Brewery sector have also been buoyed by 
the introduction of scroll compressors and other improved products 
designed to provide at source cooling for smaller outlets such as cafes 
and bars. This reduces the need for cellar cooling space, is more energy 
efficient and avoids product waste as the beer is only cooled 
when needed. 
The Abbeychart business faced a mixed environment in its key markets 
with Coffee and Catering continuing to perform well but with demand 
from the Vending machine and pure Water applications weakening. In 
the Coffee and Catering markets, Abbeychart supplies to the equipment 
OEMs and in the traditional hot and cold drinks Vending market, the 
primary customers are the equipment operators that supply ingredients 
and maintain the machines. There have been attempts to drive 
consolidation in the fragmented Vending operators’ market and it may 
take some time before the results of this activity are clear. The Hawco 
Group will continue to realign the Abbeychart business model and 
resources to match changes in end-user tastes and to focus on 
growth markets where technical expertise can add value.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
 Risk: Strategic
Downturn in major markets
Adverse changes in the major markets in which the businesses operate 
can have a significant impact on performance. The effects will either be 
seen in terms of slowing revenue growth, due to reduced or delayed 
demand for products and services, or margin pressures due to 
increased competition.
A number of characteristics of the Group’s businesses moderate the 
impact of economic and business cycles on the Group as a whole:
• The Group’s businesses operate in three different Sectors with different 
cyclical characteristics and across a number of geographic markets.
• The businesses offer specialised products and services; this offers 
a degree of protection against customers quickly switching 
business to achieve a better price.
• A high proportion of the Group’s revenues comprise consumable 
products which are purchased as part of customers’ operating 
expenditure, rather than through capital budgets.
• In many cases the products are used in repair, maintenance and 
refurbishment applications, rather than original equipment 
manufacture.
Mitigation
The businesses identify key market drivers and monitor the trends  
and forecasts, as well as maintaining close relationships with key 
customers who may give an early warning of slowing demand. 
Changes to cost levels and inventories can then be made in a 
measured way to mitigate the effects.
Significant global events are closely monitored to determine any 
potential impact on key markets.
Loss of key supplier(s)
For manufacturer-branded products, there are risks to the business if a 
major supplier decides to cancel a distribution agreement or if the supplier 
is acquired by a company which has its own distribution channels in the 
relevant market. There is also the risk of a supplier taking away exclusivity 
and either setting up direct operations or appointing another distributor.
In times of rapid economic expansion in activity, such as after a global 
recession, there is also a risk that the lead times to supply key product  
can become very long.
Currently no single supplier represents more than 10% of Group 
revenue and only five single suppliers represent more than 2% each 
of Group revenue.
Relationships with suppliers have normally been built up over many 
years and a strong degree of interdependence has been established. 
The average length of the principal supplier relationships in each 
of the Sectors is over ten years.
The strength of the relationship with each supplier and the volume of 
activity generally ensures continuity of supply, when there is shortage 
of product.
Mitigation
Actions to mitigate the risks include:
• Long term, multi-year exclusive contracts signed with suppliers with 
change of control clauses, where possible, included in contracts for 
protection or compensation in the event of acquisition.
• Collaborative projects undertaken and relationships maintained with 
individuals at many levels of the supplier organisation, together with 
regular review meetings and adherence to contractual terms.
• Regular review of inventory levels.
• Bundling and kitting of products and provision of added 
value services.
• Periodic research of alternative suppliers as part of 
contingency planning.
Risk assessment and evaluation is an integral part of the Group’s annual 
planning cycle and market specific risks are evaluated as part of the 
annual budgeting process.
Each operating business is required each year to identify and document 
the significant strategic, operational, financial and accounting risks 
facing the business. For each significant risk, a number of scenarios are 
mapped out and an assessment is made of the likelihood and impact of 
each risk scenario. 
Finally, plans and processes are established which are designed to 
control each risk and minimise its potential impact. The risk assessments 
from each of the operating businesses are reviewed with the Executive 
Directors and a consolidated risk assessment is reviewed by the Board.
The principal risks and uncertainties which are currently judged to have 
the largest potential impact on the Group’s long term performance are 
set out below. There have been no significant changes to these risks and 
uncertainties, or their potential impact on the Group, since last year. 35 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
 Risk: Strategic
Loss of major customer(s)
The loss of one or more major customers can be a material risk. The nature of the Group’s businesses is such that there is not a high 
level of dependence on any individual customers and no single 
customer represents more than 5% of Sector revenue or more than 
2% of Group revenue.
Mitigation
Specific large customers are important to individual operating businesses 
and a high level of effort is invested in ensuring that these customers are 
retained and encouraged not to switch to another supplier. 
In addition to providing high levels of customer service, close 
integration is established where possible with customers’ systems 
and processes.
Product liability
There is a risk that products supplied by a Group business may 
fail in service, which could lead to a claim under product liability. The 
businesses, in their Terms and Conditions of sale with customers, will 
typically mirror the Terms and Conditions of purchase from the suppliers. 
In this way the liability can be limited and subrogated to the supplier.
However, if a legal claim is made it will typically draw in our business as 
a party to the claim and the business may be exposed to legal costs and 
potential damages if the claim succeeds and the supplier fails to meet 
its liabilities for whatever reason. Product liability insurance can be 
limited in terms of its scope of insurable events, such as product recall. 
Mitigation
Technically qualified personnel and control systems are in place to ensure 
products meet quality requirements. The Group’s businesses are required 
to undertake product risk assessments and comprehensive Supplier 
Quality Assurance assessments. The Group has also established 
Group-wide product liability insurance which provides worldwide 
umbrella insurance cover of £20m in all Sectors. 
The Group’s businesses may also elect not to supply products if they 
are not fully confident that the products will meet the demands of the 
operating environment.
The Group’s businesses continue to invest in new testing equipment; 
employees have also undergone product liability training during the 
year and are regularly reviewed to demonstrate compliance with 
Group policies and procedures relating to product liability.
Loss of key personnel
The success of the Group is built upon strong, self-standing management 
teams in the operating businesses, committed to the success of their 
respective businesses. As a result, the loss of key personnel can have a 
significant impact on performance, at least for a time. 
As set out on page 38, the average length of service for all personnel 
in the Group is over six years.
Mitigation
Contractual terms such as notice periods and non-compete clauses can 
mitigate the risk in the short term. However, more successful initiatives 
focus on ensuring a challenging work environment with appropriate 
reward systems. The Group places very high importance on planning the 
development, motivation and reward for key managers in the operating 
businesses including:
• Ensuring a challenging working environment where managers feel 
they have control over, and responsibility for their businesses. 
• Establishing management development programmes to ensure 
a broad base of talented managers.
• Offering a balanced and competitive compensation package 
with a combination of salary, annual bonus and long term cash 
incentive plans targeted at the individual business level.
• Giving the freedom, encouragement, financial resources and 
strategic support for managers to pursue ambitious growth plans. 36 DIPLOMA PLC Strategic Report
 Risk: Operational
Major damage to premises
The Group’s businesses mostly operate from combined office/warehouse 
facilities which are dedicated to each business and not shared with other 
Group businesses. 
Major damage to the facilities from fire, malicious damage or natural 
disaster would impact a business for a period until the damage is repaired 
or alternative facilities have been established.
However, the Group has not suffered any major damage to premises 
in recent years and in Clearwater, Florida there has been no significant 
hurricane activity for at least the last five years.
Mitigation
The business where the risk is greatest is Hercules in Clearwater, Florida 
which is most at risk from an environmental disaster caused by a 
hurricane or tornado. The building structure has been designed to 
withstand 150mph winds, electricity generators have been installed 
on site and a specific disaster plan has been drawn up and is regularly 
reviewed. 
Contingency plans include:
• Backup power generators.
• Materials on hand to secure the facility.
• Communications rerouted to other branches or interim locations.
• IT recovery plan using backup server in separate location.
• Regular building inspection and weather monitoring.
• Plans to drop-ship product from suppliers direct to customers.
The other businesses have also developed plans in the event of 
incidents, including fire and security alarms and regular fire drills. 
Insurance policies are also in place including property, contents and 
business interruption cover which would mitigate the financial impact.
However, the priority in such an event is to become fully operational 
as quickly as possible so as to minimise disruption to customers. Plans 
to ensure a quick and orderly recovery have been developed by the 
businesses and are periodically reviewed. 
Loss of Information Technology (“IT”) systems
Computer systems are critical to the businesses since their success is  
built on high levels of customer service and quick response. A complete 
failure of IT systems, with the loss of trading and other records, 
would be more damaging to the businesses than major physical 
damage to facilities.
Mitigation
Business interruption insurance cover is held across the Group and 
contingency plans have been drawn up in all businesses. The recovery 
plans differ by individual business, but will include some or all of the 
following elements:
• Full data backups as a matter of routine are automatically taken on a 
regular basis each week and stored online.
• Backup servers identified and communication reroute options 
identified.
• Service contracts with IT providers with access to replacement 
servers.
• Uninterruptible power sources and backup generators where 
required.
• Virus checkers and firewalls.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued 37 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
 Risk: Financial and Accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial and accounting 
risks, including foreign currency, liquidity, interest rate and credit. The 
policies for managing these financial risks, as well as the management 
of capital risks, are set out in note 19 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The principal financial and accounting risks are summarised 
below. The Group’s overall management of the financial risks is carried 
out by a central treasury team under policies and procedures which are 
reviewed and approved by the Board. 
The treasury team identifies, evaluates and where appropriate, 
hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s 
operating businesses. The treasury team does not undertake 
speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no 
underlying exposure.
The principal accounting risk is that of inventory obsolescence which 
is managed by the operating businesses.
Foreign currency – Translational exposure
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in currency rates will affect 
the Group’s results. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to 
foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and 
the Euro. The net assets of the Group’s operations outside the UK are also 
exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
During the year ended 30 September 2014, ca.75% of the Group’s revenue 
and adjusted operating profits were earned in currencies other than 
UK sterling. In comparison to the prior year, the net effect of currency 
translation was to decrease revenue by £17.7m and decrease adjusted 
operating profit by £4.1m. It is estimated that a further strengthening of 
UK sterling by 10% against all the currencies in which the Group does 
business, would reduce adjusted operating profit before tax 
by approximately £4.3m (8%), due to currency translation.
Currency exposures also arise on the net assets of the Group’s foreign 
operations. At 30 September 2014, the Group’s non-UK sterling net 
assets in overseas businesses was £144.9m (2013: £132.9m), which 
represented 77% of the Group’s net assets. It is estimated that a further 
strengthening of UK sterling of 10% against all the non-UK sterling net 
assets would reduce shareholders’ funds by £13.2m.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas 
earnings and of year end exchange rates, used in the translation of 
overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the 
Group, are shown in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
Mitigation
The Group does not hedge translational exposure.
Foreign currency – Transactional exposure
The Group’s UK businesses are exposed to foreign currency risk on  
those purchases that are denominated in a currency other than  
their local currency, principally US dollars, Euro and Japanese yen.  
The Group’s Canadian and Australian businesses are also exposed
to a similar risk as the majority of their purchases are denominated 
in US dollars and Euros. The Group’s US businesses do not have any 
material foreign currency transactional risk.
Mitigation
The Group’s businesses may hedge up to 80% of forecast (being a 
maximum of 18 months) foreign currency exposures using forward 
foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group classifies its forward foreign exchange contracts, which 
hedge forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges and states them at 
fair value. 
Inventory obsolescence
Working capital management is critical to success in specialised industrial 
businesses as this has a major impact on cash flow. The principal risk to 
working capital is in inventory obsolescence and write-off.
The charge against operating profit in respect of old or surplus 
inventory is ca.£1m each year, but inventories are generally not 
subject to technological obsolescence.
Mitigation
Inventory write-offs are controlled and minimised by active management 
of inventory levels based on sales forecasts and regular cycle counts. 
Where necessary, a provision is made to cover both excess inventory 
and potential obsolescence. 38 DIPLOMA PLC Strategic Report
Corporate Responsibility
Employees
Building and developing the skills, competencies, motivation and 
teamwork of employees is recognised by the Board as being key 
to achieving the Group’s business objectives. The stability and 
commitment of the employees is demonstrated by the average length 
of service which has remained high. In addition the number of working 
days lost to sickness is ca. 1% a year. These measures remain consistent 
across each of the Group’s Sectors. 
Key employee statistics
2014 2013 2012

Average staff turnover 21.5% 20.4% 16.7%
Sick days lost per person 3.0 2.2 2.3
The increase in sick days lost per person is heavily influenced by a small 
number of employees who are on long term sick leave.
Set out below is an analysis of the number of employees by gender at 
the year end.
2014 2013
Male Female Male Female

The Group values the commitment of its employees and recognises the 
importance of communication to good working relationships. The Group 
keeps employees informed on matters relating to their employment, on 
business developments and on financial and economic factors affecting 
the Group. This is achieved through management briefings, internal 
announcements, the Group’s website and by the distribution of 
Preliminary and Interim Announcements and press releases. 
Copies of the Annual Review and Annual Report & Accounts are also 
made available in the operating businesses. This communication 
programme enables employees to gain a better understanding of 
the Group’s business objectives and their roles in achieving them. 
Both employment policy and practice in the Group are based on 
non-discrimination and equal opportunities. Ability and aptitude are 
the determining factors in the selection, training, career development 
and promotion of all employees. 
The Group remains supportive of the employment and advancement of 
disabled persons. Applications for employment by disabled persons are 
always fully considered, bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and 
abilities of the applicants concerned. If an employee is, or becomes 
disabled during their period of employment, the Group will, if necessary 
and to the extent possible, adapt the work environment to enable the 
employee to continue in their current position or retrain the employee for 
duties suited to their abilities following disablement. At 30 September 2014 
the Group employed one disabled employee. 
Employment policies throughout the Group have been established 
to comply with relevant legislation and codes of practice relating to 
employment, Health & Safety and equal opportunities. The Group 
provides good quality working environments and facilities for employees 
and training and development appropriate to each of their roles.
Some of the Group’s operating companies have structured 
apprenticeship schemes for technical staff and the Group provides 
sponsorship for high potential employees for higher education courses 
where appropriate. Vocational training is also provided and some staff 
are enrolled on National Vocational Qualification (“NVQ”) or similar level 
courses. Employees are actively encouraged to undertake Continuing 
Professional Development (“CPD”).
In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, 
employees are required to seek approval of the Company before dealing 
in its shares.
Health & Safety
The Group is fully committed to ensuring clean, safe and healthy 
working conditions. The Group actively promotes a strong safety culture 
and ensures a collective responsibility for ensuring Health & Safety 
standards are continually improved.
The Group Chief Operating Officer, Iain Henderson, has overall 
responsibility for Health & Safety procedures across the Group. 
However, in line with the Group’s decentralised management 
approach, accountability for Health & Safety is with local management 
to match local regulatory requirements, culture and specific business 
needs. The Group requires that each operating business conducts 
Health & Safety reviews against its specific operational risk profile and 
local regulatory requirements.
2014 2013 2012
Minor injuries 55 54 21
Reportable lost time incidents

5 1 2
1 Three or more days’ absence from workplace.
The level of minor injuries has remained constant, despite the increased 
number of employees and new businesses acquired during the year.
While the number of reportable lost time incidents has increased, only 
one of the injuries resulted in greater than five days’ lost time. The most 
common types of injury relate to minor cuts, slips/trips or lifting injuries.
All injuries are fully investigated and corrective actions and preventative 
measures put in place to ensure that the injury does not reoccur and 
future risks are mitigated.
Health & Safety forms part of the induction process for new employees 
and where relevant, more specialist training is provided for specific 
functions. The Group has good coverage of employees who have 
formal Health & Safety training and/or qualifications and this has 
continued to increase during 2014.
Human rights
The Group’s activities are substantially carried out in developed 
countries that have strong legislation governing human rights. 
The Group complies fully with appropriate legislation in the 
countries in which it operates. 39 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
Environmental
The Group comprises sales and marketing focused businesses which 
essentially receive products from suppliers and despatch them to 
customers. The Group’s businesses do not operate delivery fleets; they 
use third party carriers to deliver their products to customers and to 
provide much of their packaging requirements. The Group’s ability to 
control the environmental impact of its logistics partners is therefore 
limited. The primary impact on the environment, which is entirely in the 
Group’s control, is consumption of the normal business energy sources 
such as heating and power, which the Group aims to minimise.
The Group ensures it minimises its impact on the environment through 
compliance with relevant environmental legislation. The Group is 
committed to identifying and assessing environmental risks, such as 
packaging waste, arising from its operations. 
Waste management initiatives are encouraged and supported by the 
Group and materials are recycled where practical.
Local management are committed to good environmental 
management practices throughout our operations. The Managing 
Directors have responsibility for environmental performance of their 
operating businesses and each subsidiary is required to implement 
initiatives to meet their responsibilities. 
Each facility participates in recycling paper, plastic, cardboard, and wood 
from pallets and continues to focus on minimising energy consumption 
through the efficient use of heating and lighting. In addition a number of 
the businesses now use fully recycled and biodegradable filler materials 
for packaging.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Last year, the UK Government introduced a requirement that UK listed 
companies should report their global levels of greenhouse gas  
(“GHG”) emissions in their Annual Report & Accounts. The mandatory 
requirement is for disclosure of scope 1 and 2 only (direct emissions, 
e.g. heating, cooling, transport fuel and indirect emissions, e.g. from 
purchased electricity) and only to the extent that such emissions are 
the responsibility of the Company.
The Group have considered the six main Greenhouse Gases (“GHG’s”) 
and report emissions in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (CO
2
e) for Scope 1 
(direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions. These emissions are calculated 
following the GHG Protocol and UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines. The Group has used DEFRA UK GHG Conversion 
Factors, US Environmental Protection Agency Emission Factors and 
International Energy Agency Factors. 
As a distributor with no owned logistics or freight, the Group’s primary 
direct energy usage and related CO
2
 emissions arise from the Group’s 
facilities. Where possible the Group has reported billed data which 
represents ca.80% of the Group’s global emissions. For the remaining 
entities the Group has used an estimation using sales data and local 
conversion factors.
An intensity ratio of CO
2
e per £1m turnover has been selected, which 
will allow a comparison of our performance over time and with other 
similar types of business.

Business ethics
The Group recognises its obligations towards the parties with whom 
the Group has business dealings including customers, shareholders, 
employers, suppliers and advisors. 
In general, the interactions with these parties are managed at a local 
level by senior management and the Group expects a high standard of 
expertise and business principles to be maintained in such dealings.
The Group’s policy towards suppliers is that each operating business is 
responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions under which they 
trade with their suppliers. The Group does not operate a formal code 
that it follows with regard to payments to suppliers. Group companies 
agree payment terms with their suppliers when they enter into binding 
purchasing contracts for the supply of goods or services. Suppliers are, 
in that way, made aware of these terms. Group companies seek to abide 
by these payment terms when they are satisfied that the supplier has 
provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms 
and conditions.
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are important to the 
long term development and sustainability of the operating businesses. 
The Group considers the environmental and social impacts of 
conducting business on the community and this forms part of the 
business decision making process. Many community activities and 
events are fully supported by the Group and this relationship is managed 
by the local management teams.
Some highlights from the year include:
In North America
 – Various charitable donations made locally at each business by 
employees for local charities such as United Way, Clothes to Kids, 
Haven House (abused women), food banks, schools and cancer 
awareness.
 – Hercules Canada sponsorship of charity golf tournaments.
 – Educational support via scholarships and schools engagement 
through the National Fluid Power Association.
In Europe
 – IS Group and Clarendon supported Red Bull Racing in their 
chosen charity Wings for Life, raising over £9,000 for spinal cord 
injury research. Support included a “Tough Mudder” event, 
a charity ball, car washes and many other events.
 – SFC supported the Race2Recovery charity by supplying products 
used on two vehicles competing in the 2014 Dakar Rally. The 
charity supports combat injured team members with life-
changing injuries participating in Motorsport.
The Group also contributes to local worthwhile causes and charities  
and in 2014 the Group made donations of £42,698 (2013: £32,359).  
No political donations were made. 40 DIPLOMA PLC Governance

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present Diploma’s report on Corporate Governance on 
behalf of our Board.
Set out in this section of the Annual Report & Accounts is a report on  
the activities of the Board and each of its three Committees which are 
responsible for ensuring that the Board fully discharges its governance 
duties and applies the principles of good governance as set out in the 
2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”).
In my Report to shareholders on Governance in 2011, I set out clear 
objectives for the Board to develop its policies and processes to ensure 
that the Board would be able to meet the stringent governance standards 
required for a Company that is now firmly established in the FTSE 250 
constituent group. I am pleased that, as I come to the end of my term 
with the Company, we have made good progress in meeting those 
objectives with a refreshed set of non‑ Executive members of the Board 
and its Committees. Further amendments in the Board’s existing 
governance processes will be required next year as the FRC continues  
to revise and expand the scope of the Code with the publication of the 
2014 Code.
The Committees have been focused this year on ensuring that the 
Board’s governance polices remain both robust and in line with best 
practice and appropriate to manage the development of the Group as 
it continues to broaden its activities into new markets and geographies. 
As part of this work, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
further the appropriateness of the Group’s remuneration policies, 
which has included a consultation exercise with the Company’s 
larger shareholders.
Following the announcement of my intention to retire from the Board in 
2015, the Nomination Committee has worked diligently with the Chief 
Executive Officer to ensure that a transparent and orderly process has 
been followed to identify and appoint John Nicholas as my replacement 
as Chairman of the Company.
The Nomination Committee has also begun an exercise to identify  
and appoint a new non‑ Executive Director which will ensure that the 
Company continues to maintain an appropriate composition and 
structure for the Board and its Committees, with the right balance of  
skills and experience to lead Diploma as it continues to grow.

Compliance with the Code
Diploma PLC is required to state whether it has complied with the Main 
Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in September 2012. Set out on pages 43 to 
67 is an explanation of how the Company has complied with the main 
Principles of the Code. 
The Board confirms that throughout the financial year, the Company 
applied all of the Principles set out in sections A to E of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code for the period under review. The Board also confirms 
that it complies with all of the Provisions of the Code as at the date of 
this Report with the exception of one; namely the Company’s evaluation 
of the Board has not been externally facilitated at least every three years, 
as explained further on page 45. In addition and as explained in the 2013 
Annual Report & Accounts, the Company had not identified a Senior 
Independent Director from 1 October 2013 until 15 November 2013 
when John Nicholas was appointed as Senior Independent Director. 
The Company’s auditor Deloitte LLP , is required to review whether the 
above statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for their 
review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if it 
does not reflect such compliance. 
The Audit Committee has had to extend its activities to ensure that 
the Group’s newly acquired Russian businesses comply fully with 
new international sanctions. The Committee has also worked with 
management to develop further its procedures for maintaining 
compliance with the Group’s anti‑ Bribery and Corruption policy.
Finally, as always I would like to encourage shareholders to find the 
time to attend our AGM on Wednesday, 21 January 2015. It provides 
an excellent opportunity to meet the Executive Directors and the 
independent non‑ Executive Directors on the Board whose Committees’ 
Reports are set out in the following pages of this Report on Governance.

Audit Committee
Chaired by Marie‑ Louise Clayton
Number of meetings in the year: six
Role of the Committee

fraud and whistleblowing.
Nomination Committee
Chaired by John Rennocks

Remuneration Committee
Chaired by John Nicholas
Number of meetings in the year: eight
Role of the Committee
The Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, the 
framework and policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors. The remuneration of the non‑ Executive Directors 
is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The 
Committee takes into account the business strategy of the Group 
and how remuneration policy should reflect and support that strategy. 44 DIPLOMA PLC Governance
Leadership
Board composition 
The Board comprises a Chairman, three Executive Directors and three 
independent non‑ Executive Directors. The non‑ Executive Directors 
are appointed for specified terms and the details of their respective 
appointments are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on 
page 59. The biographical details of the Board members are set out on 
pages 40 and 41.
The existing Chairman has confirmed that he will stand down from his 
role as Chairman and retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting on 21 January 2015.
The Board has appointed John Nicholas, who is currently a non‑ Executive Director and the Senior Independent Director of the 
Company, as Chairman‑ designate. As a consequence of this 
appointment, the Board has also asked the Nomination Committee 
to set up an appropriate process to identify and recommend for 
appointment a new non‑ Executive Director. This process has not 
yet concluded as at the date of this Report.
Activities of the Board
The Company’s governance framework is set out on page 43 together 
with a summary of the formal terms of reference. The core activities of 
the Board and its Committees are planned on an annual basis and this 
framework forms the basic structure within which the Board operates.
The Board’s terms of reference also set out the separate and distinct 
roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairman is responsible for the overall leadership and governance 
of the Board and ensures that the Directors have an understanding of 
the views of the Company’s major shareholders. The Chairman sets the 
Board’s agenda and ensures that there is a healthy culture of challenge 
and debate at Board and Committee meetings.
The Board appoints the Chief Executive and monitors his performance  
in leading the Company and providing operational and performance 
management in delivering the agreed strategy. The Chief Executive is 
responsible for developing, for the Board’s approval, appropriate values 
and standards to guide all activities undertaken by the Company and for 
maintaining good relationships and communications with investors.
The approval of acquisitions, for the most part, is a matter reserved for 
the Board, save that it delegates to the Chief Executive the responsibility 
for such activities to a specified level of authority. Similarly, there are 
authority levels covering capital expenditure which can be exercised  
by the Chief Executive. Beyond these levels of authority, projects are 
referred to the Board for approval.
Other matters reserved to the Board include treasury policies, internal 
control and risk management.
The Company has purchased insurance to cover its Directors and 
Officers against the costs of defending themselves in legal proceedings 
taken against them in that capacity and in respect of any damages 
resulting from those proceedings.
The Company also indemnifies its Directors and Officers to the  
extent permitted by law. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity 
provides cover where the Director or Officer has acted fraudulently  
or dishonestly.
To ensure that non‑ Executive Directors can constructively challenge 
and support proposals on strategy, the Board has adopted a process  
of reviewing and approving the agreed strategy for the Company on a 
two/three yearly basis. It is intended that the next formal review of the 
Company’s strategy will be carried out by the Board in June 2015 at one 
of the Group’s businesses based in the US. The previous formal strategy 
development review took place in October 2012 at the Group’s business 
in Swindon, UK. 
Meetings of the Board
The Board has six scheduled meetings each year and meets more 
frequently as required. It met on seven occasions during the year under 
review and attendance at these meetings is set out on page 42.
Each Director is expected to attend all meetings of the Board 
or Committees of which they are a member. In addition senior 
management from across the Group and advisors attend certain 
meetings for the discussion of specific items in greater depth.
This exposure to the members of senior management from across the 
businesses helps enhance the Board’s understanding of the businesses, 
the implementation of strategy and the changing dynamics of the 
markets in which the businesses operate.
Effectiveness
Independent non‑ Executive Directors
The non‑ Executive Directors are determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement and there are no relationships 
or circumstances which could affect, or appear to affect, a Director’s 
judgement. The Chairman, John Rennocks was considered independent 
by the Board both at the time of his appointment as Director on 12 July 
2002 and as Chairman on 7 January 2004. In accordance with the 
Code, the ongoing test of independence for the Chairman is not 
appropriate. The Chairman‑ designate, John Nicholas is considered 
by the Board to be independent.
All non‑ Executive Directors are advised of the likely time commitments 
at appointment. The ability of individual Directors to allocate sufficient 
time to the discharge of their responsibilities is considered as part of the 
Directors’ annual evaluation process, overseen by the Chairman. Any 
issues concerning the Chairman’s time commitment are dealt with by 
the Nomination Committee, chaired for this purpose by the Senior 
Independent Director.
Each non‑ Executive Director is required to inform the Board of any 
changes to their other appointments.
During the year, the Chairman has also held meetings with the 
non‑Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present.
The appointments of non‑ Executive Directors are subject to formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedures which are described more fully 
in the Report from the Nomination Committee which is set out on 
page 51.
Corporate Governance continued 45 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Diversity
The Board is committed to a culture that attracts and retains talented 
people to deliver outstanding performance and further enhance the 
success of the Group. In that culture, diversity across a range of criteria is 
valued, primarily in relation to skills, knowledge and experience and also 
in other criteria such as gender and ethnicity. The Board has considered 
setting objectives in relation to diversity, but does not believe that such 
objectives are appropriate at this juncture, given the relatively small 
Board. The Board will however keep this matter under review, 
particularly in light of Board succession and development.
Information and professional development
An induction programme is agreed for all new Directors aimed at ensuring 
that they are able to develop an understanding and awareness of the 
Group’s core processes, its people and businesses. The non‑ Executive 
Directors’ awareness of the businesses is further developed through 
periodic visits to the principal business locations and presentations to the 
Board by senior management of the businesses.
Following the new appointments to the Board last year, a managed 
induction programme was set up which included a visit by each of the 
new non‑ Executive Directors to the major business units in each of the 
Group’s Sectors where they had an opportunity to meet with senior 
management in these businesses. Meetings were held individually 
between each of the non‑ Executive Directors and the Executive 
Directors and with some of the principal advisors to the Company.
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Chief Executive and the 
Group Company Secretary, is responsible for ensuring that Directors 
are supplied with information in a timely manner that is in a form and of 
a quality appropriate to enable them to discharge their duties. In the 
normal course of business, the Chief Executive gives an oral report to 
the Board at each meeting and information is provided and reported 
through formal Board reports that include information on operational 
matters and strategic developments. There are also reports on the 
performance of the Group’s businesses, financial performance relative 
to the budget, business development and investor relations.
The training needs of the Directors are periodically discussed at Board 
meetings and where appropriate, briefings as necessary are provided on 
various elements of corporate governance and other regulatory issues.
The Group Company Secretary acts as an advisor to the Board on 
matters concerning governance and regulatory issues and ensures 
compliance with Board procedures. All Directors have access to his 
advice and a procedure also exists for Directors to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. No such advice was 
sought during the year. The appointment and removal of the Group 
Company Secretary and his remuneration are matters for the Board  
as a whole.
Board evaluation
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of effectiveness using 
specifically designed evaluation forms and under the direction of the 
Chairman. This exercise encompasses an evaluation of the performance 
of the Board as a whole, as well as of each of the Committees and 
individuals. Feedback on Board performance is presented by the 
Chairman to a meeting of the Board and actions and objectives are 
agreed for the following year.
The Board had intended this year to carry out an evaluation of the Board 
using external facilitation. However, with the impending appointment of 
a new Chairman and as the current non‑ Executive Directors have only 
been members of the Board for a relatively short period, it was decided 
to postpone this externally facilitated evaluation of the Board until 2015. 
The Board therefore continued with its normal internal evaluation 
exercise this year, as described above. This exercise was completed in 
September 2014 and identified the following areas that the Board 
wished to address in 2015:
• strengthen the Board’s competencies through appointment of a new 
non‑ Executive Director with broad industrial experience gained in an 
international environment;
• seek more regular presentations at Board meetings from senior 
management across the Group; and 
• target a meeting of the Board to focus on management of risk and 
review of effectiveness of Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems. 
The Board will report next year on the progress it has made with 
these objectives. 
The decision to postpone the externally facilitated evaluation this 
year has led to the Company not being in compliance with the Code 
Provision which requires that such an external facilitation is carried out  
at least every three years. 
Re‑ election
All Directors to the Board are subject to election by the shareholders  
at the first AGM following their appointment by the Board and in 
accordance with the Code, all Directors will also stand for re‑ election 
annually at the AGM.
Conflicts of interest
Directors are subject to a statutory duty under the Companies Act 2006 
(“the Act”) to avoid a situation where they have, or could have, a direct  
or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly could conflict, with the 
Company’s interests. The Act allows directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate, where the 
Articles of Association contain a provision to this effect. The Act also 
allows the Articles to contain other provisions for dealing with Directors’ 
conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty. 
Procedures adopted to deal with conflicts of interest continue to 
operate effectively and the Board’s authorisation powers are being 
exercised properly in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association.
Accountability
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report & Accounts 
present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects.
The Board is also responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives and 
for maintaining sound risk management and internal control systems. It 
also reviews the effectiveness of these systems through the work of the 
Audit Committee as reported on in the Report of the Audit Committee on 
pages 47 to 50. 46 DIPLOMA PLC Governance
The key risks which the Board has focused on this year are set out in the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on page 34 to 37. The Board is 
committed to providing shareholders with a clear assessment of the 
Company’s financial position and prospects. This is achieved through 
this Annual Report & Accounts, the Annual Review and through other 
periodic financial statements and announcements.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a well‑ developed investor relations programme 
managed by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. Through 
this programme, the Company maintains regular contact with major 
shareholders to communicate clearly the Group’s objectives and 
monitors movements in significant shareholdings.
During the past three years, these communications have been 
enhanced by the introduction of Investor Days, both in the UK and in 
Canada which were well attended. In addition, Investor Roadshows are 
now held each year in the US as well as in the UK and formal investor 
presentations are made twice a year to groups of private client fund 
managers. 
Most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Finance Director through presentations made twice a year on 
the operating and financial performance of the Group and its longer term 
strategy. The Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance Director generally 
deal with questions from individual shareholders. All financial and trading 
announcements are published immediately on the Company’s website, 
including copies of the presentations made to analysts and 
key shareholders.
The non‑ Executive Directors are given regular updates as to the views 
of institutional shareholders and an independent insight is sought 
through research carried out twice a year by the Company’s advisors, 
focused on both investors and analysts.
Through these processes, the Board is kept abreast of key issues and 
the opportunity is available on request for shareholders to meet the 
Chairman or Senior Independent Director, separately from the 
Executive Directors.
Electronic communications to shareholders include the Notice of the AGM 
which is sent at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. The Company 
proposes a separate resolution on each substantially separate issue and for 
each resolution, proxy appointment forms provide shareholders with the 
option to vote in advance of the AGM.
All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions at the Company’s 
AGM when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer give a statement 
on the Group’s performance during the year, together with a statement 
on current trading conditions. The Chairman of the Board and of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees will normally be available to 
answer questions at the meeting.
The Board has resolved, in line with best practice, to conduct a poll  
on each resolution proposed at the AGM. The results of the AGM 
resolutions, including details of votes cast, are published on the 
Company’s website.

Marie‑ Louise Clayton
Chairman of Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my report on the activities of the Audit 
Committee in the year ended 30 September 2014.
It has been another busy year for the Committee and much has been 
reviewed and reported from across the Group. The Committee held six 
meetings during the year, during which it focused in particular on the 
integrity of the Group’s financial reporting and on the effectiveness of 
both the internal and external audit.
The Committee also focused attention on ensuring that the Group’s 
policies relating to anti‑ Bribery and Corruption continue to develop. 
This is a significant challenge in a decentralised group such as ours with 
businesses operating over a wide spread of geographies and markets. 
The Committee was pleased to support management’s response to 
these challenges by developing a comprehensive e‑learning training 
programme which will initially focus on anti‑ bribery training, before 
being extended to other matters of governance. This training will be 
provided to all employees across the Group and is due to commence 
early in the new financial year.
The acquisition of Kentek Oy and subsequent political upheaval in 
Ukraine has also challenged the Committee to closely review the scope 
of international sanctions applied against certain Russian operations and 
to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place in the Group’s Russian 
businesses to ensure that compliance with these sanctions is maintained.
I have continued to meet separately with the Company’s auditor to seek 
their views on the strength and depth of financial reporting and internal 
control processes over the Group’s activities. Based on this discussion 
and on the report the Committee receives from the Group’s Internal 
Audit manager, I am satisfied that management maintains a strong focus 
on ensuring that robust systems of internal control are in place across 
the Group’s businesses.

Audit Committee
The Committee is chaired by Marie‑ Louise Clayton and comprises 
independent non‑ Executive Directors. The Chairman of the Committee 
and John Nicholas are both qualified accountants, who have recent and 
relevant financial experience.
John Rennocks, the Chairman of the Company, resigned from the  
Audit Committee on 13 November 2012 in accordance with good 
governance practice, but continues to attend meetings at the invitation 
of the Committee.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Executive Directors also attend Committee meetings and the 
Internal Audit manager also attended two Committee meetings. The 
Committee met with the external auditor during the year, without the 
Executive Directors being present.
Engagement of the external auditor
The external auditor is engaged to express an opinion on the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company. The audit includes the 
review and testing of the systems of internal financial control and the 
data contained in the financial statements, to the extent necessary 
for expressing an audit opinion on the truth and fairness of the 
financial statements.
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s auditor since its appointment in 
2008. Deloitte LLP provides the Committee with relevant reports, reviews 
and advice throughout the year, as set out in their terms of engagement. 
In accordance with UK regulations, the Company’s auditor adheres to a 
rotation policy based on best practice and a new Group lead engagement 
partner was appointed in 2013 in place of the previous lead engagement 
partner who had completed a term of five years in that role. 
During the year, the Committee carried out an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. The assessment was led by 
the Chairman of the Committee, assisted by the Group Finance Director 
and focused on certain criteria which the Committee considered to be 
important factors in demonstrating an effective audit process. These 
factors included the quality of audit staff, the planning and execution of 
the audit and the role of management in the audit process. Following 
this assessment, the Committee concluded that the external audit 
process remained effective and that it provides an appropriate 
independent challenge of the Group’s senior management.
The Committee remains satisfied that Deloitte continues to provide 
a robust and effective audit and supports the work of the Committee 
through clear and objective communication on developments in 
financial reporting and governance. The Committee supports the 
requirement of the Code that the audit should be put out to tender 
at least once every ten years. The Committee will be reviewing the 
Company’s audit tender timetable and processes as part of a wider 
review of the Competition & Markets Authority Order which is effective 
from 1 January 2015.

Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of its monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements,  
the Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies have been 
adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates and 
judgements and seeks support from the external auditors to assess them. 
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 30 September 2014 are set 
out below: 
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets:
The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill and the 
assumptions underlying the impairment review. In particular, the 
Committee discussed with management and the external auditor the 
background to the change of the level at which goodwill is assessed for 
impairment, as described further in note 10 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The Committee was satisfied that this change was reasonable 
and appropriate. The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment 
largely relate to the assumptions underlying the calculations of the value 
in use of the business or Sector being tested for impairment. These 
judgements are primarily the calculation of the discount rate, the 
achievability of long term business plans and macroeconomic 
assumptions underlying the valuation process. This area is a prime 
source of audit focus and accordingly the external auditor provided 
detailed reporting to the Committee.
Valuation of inventory:
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance Director  
that set out the gross balances by business, together with any related 
provision against the carrying value. The Committee reviewed the bases 
used to value and confirm existence of inventory held across the Group; 
they also considered the appropriateness of provisions held against the 
carrying value of inventory, having regard to the age and volumes of 
inventory, relative to expected usage. These matters were also discussed 
with the Group Finance Director and the external auditor. 
Recoverability of accounts receivable:
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance Director  
that set out the gross balances by business, together with any related 
provision against the carrying value. The Committee reviewed the  
report of work done by the external auditor on trade receivables to 
confirm both existence and recoverability; the appropriateness 
of provisions held against the carrying value of accounts receivable were 
also considered, having regard to the age and creditworthiness of the 
customer. These matters were also discussed with the Group Finance 
Director and the external auditor. 
The Committee was satisfied that each of the matters set out above  
had been fully and adequately addressed by the Executive Directors, 
appropriately tested and reviewed by the external auditor and that the 
disclosures made in the Annual Report & Accounts were appropriate. 
In addition to the main issues reviewed above, the Committee also seeks 
confirmation from the auditor that the Group’s businesses follow 
appropriate policies to recognise material streams of revenue and that 
the audit work carried out more generally has assessed any instances 
where management may be able to override key internal controls 
designed to guard against fraud or material misstatement. The auditor 
also reports to the Committee on other less material matters relating to 
the Group’s small defined pension scheme, the Group’s taxation 
position and any legal provisions existing at the reporting date.
Risk management and internal control
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a clear organisational structure with defined 
authority levels. The day‑to‑day running of the Group’s business is 
delegated to the Executive Directors of the Company. The Executive 
Directors visit each operating unit on a regular basis and meet with both 
operational and finance management and staff.
Key financial and operational measures are reported on a weekly and/or 
monthly basis and are measured against both budget and half year 
reforecasts which have been approved and reviewed by the Board.  
On an annual basis, each business unit is required to implement a risk 
assessment process on the key strategic, operational, financial and 
accounting risks to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks  
to the Group’s business. They include common definitions of risk and 
ensure, as far as practicable, that the policies and procedures established 
by the Board are appropriate to manage the perceived risks to the 
Group. These assessments are supplemented by a detailed evaluation  
of the key financial controls of the business units which are critically 
reviewed by the Group’s Internal Audit manager. The Committee 
annually reviews the results of these assessments and the key strategic 
and operating risks of the Group identified by management. During the 
year, the risk assessment process revealed no significant risks of which 
the Board was not previously aware.
The risks and uncertainties which are currently judged to have the most 
significant impact on the Group’s long term performance are set out on 
pages 34 to 37. 
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems for the period from 1 October 
2013 to the date of this Report. Taking into account the results of this 
year’s business risk assessment process and the reports from the Internal 
Audit manager, the Board, with the advice of the Committee, is satisfied 
that the Group has in place effective risk management and internal 
control systems. 50 DIPLOMA PLC Governance
Internal audit
The Group’s finance department includes a separate Internal Audit 
function. This is managed by a qualified internal auditor who is based  
in Toronto, Canada. On larger audit engagements the Internal Audit 
manager is assisted by the Group finance team at Diploma PLC. 
A full programme of internal audit visits has been completed during the 
year. The scope of work carried out by internal audit generally focuses 
on the internal financial controls and risk management procedures 
operating within each business. In January, the Internal Audit manager 
presents his audit plan for the year to the Committee for their approval. 
Written reports are prepared on the results of each visit which set out 
weaknesses identified during the work, together with recommendations 
to improve the control environment. These reports are reviewed and 
discussed with the Executive Directors.
At the conclusion of the financial year, the Internal Audit manager 
reports to the Committee on the results of the audit work carried out in 
the year. The Committee reviews management’s response to matters 
raised, including the time taken to resolve such matters. There were no 
significant matters identified in the internal audits undertaken during  
the year, but recommendations were made in relation to ensuring the 
completeness and sufficiency of cycle counts of inventories and to 
ensuring that the procedures for chasing older receivable balances 
remained robust and were consistently applied. The Internal Audit 
manager also assisted the Committee in its oversight of the Group’s 
controls designed to ensure compliance with the policy on anti‑ Bribery 
and Corruption. As part of this work Internal Audit work ensured that 
appropriate support was provided in relation to employee’s claims for 
reimbursement of expenditure on entertaining customers and suppliers.
The Internal Audit manager also reported to the Committee that good 
progress had been made by the Group’s businesses in implementing 
recommendations made last year and in particular in improving 
procedures operating over supplier masterfile data and credit 
card terminals.
The Committee continues to keep under review the need for a more 
independent Internal Audit function in the Group. The Committee 
remains satisfied that the Group’s system of internal control is appropriate 
for a group of the size and nature of Diploma PLC and the Committee’s 
current view is that a separate formal independent Internal Audit function 
is not required at this time.
Non‑ audit fees
The Committee has established a set of guidelines covering the type 
of non‑audit work that can be assigned to the external auditor. These 
guidelines were reviewed and updated last year and relate to advisory 
services where the auditor’s detailed knowledge of the Group’s affairs 
means that it may be best placed to carry out such work. This extends 
to, but is not restricted to, shareholder and other circulars, regulatory 
reports, and on occasions, work in connection with disposals.
The external auditor may only provide such services where these do not 
conflict with their statutory responsibilities and ethical guidance. Work in 
connection with acquisitions, including due diligence reviews, is not 
provided by the auditor, but is placed with other firms.
Taxation services are generally not provided by the auditor; a separate 
firm is retained to provide tax advice, including any assistance with tax 
compliance matters generally. During the year the Company continued to 
use the tax department of Deloitte LLP to provide advice to the Company 
in connection with legislation relating to controlled foreign companies. 
This legislation was significantly amended by HM Government during the 
year and the implications are currently being assessed by the Company 
with the assistance of Deloitte LLP tax advisors. As this is not a significant 
assignment, the Committee remains satisfied that the work is sufficiently 
ring‑ fenced so as not to conflict with the duties of Deloitte LLP as auditor.
In other circumstances, proposed assignments are generally put out to 
tender and decisions to award work taken on the basis of demonstrable 
competence and cost effectiveness.
The Committee assures itself of the auditor’s independence by receiving 
regular reports which provide details of any assignments and related 
fees carried out by the auditor in addition to their normal audit work,  
and these are reviewed against the above guidelines.
Details of the external auditor’s total fees, including non‑ audit fees of 
£12,000 paid to Deloitte LLP during the year are set out in note 27 to  
the financial statements.
Sanctions
In January 2014, the Company acquired Kentek, a specialised 
distributor of filters and related products which is based in Finland and 
with substantial operations in Russia and the Baltic States. Shortly after 
completion of the acquisition, and in response to political developments 
in Ukraine, the EU and US implemented various sanctions against a 
growing list of market sectors, corporations and individuals based in 
Russia. As a consequence, the Audit Committee worked with senior 
management of the Company, in conjunction with local management 
of Kentek, to determine the scope and reach of these sanctions and 
have implemented a system to ensure ongoing compliance with this 
new sanctions regime. The Committee has received reports on 
compliance with these sanctions and will continue to monitor 
developments until the sanctions are suspended or revoked.
Anti‑ Bribery and Whistleblowing
Diploma has a Group‑ wide anti‑ Bribery and Corruption policy to comply 
with the Bribery Act 2010 and it periodically reviews its procedures to 
ensure continued effective compliance in its businesses around the world. 
During the year, the Group developed an e‑learning training programme 
on anti‑ Bribery and Corruption which will be undertaken by all Group 
employees during the new financial year and periodically thereafter.
During the year, the Committee formally reviewed the Group’s 
Whistleblowing Policy, which provides the framework to encourage 
and give employees confidence to “blow the whistle” and report 
irregularities. Employees are encouraged to raise concerns with 
designated individuals, including the Executive Directors, the Group 
Company Secretary or the Chairman of the Audit Committee. All such 
reports are investigated and reported to the Committee, together with 
details of corrective action taken. The Group’s Whistleblowing Policy is 
monitored by the Committee and no matters were reported to the 
Committee under this policy during the year.
Audit Committee Report continued 51 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
The Nomination Committee is chaired by John Rennocks, the Chairman 
of the Company. The Committee is chaired by the Senior Independent 
Director on any matter concerning the chairmanship of the Company. 
The Committee comprises the non‑ Executive Directors.
The Group Company Secretary acts as a Secretary to the Committee. 
Chairmanship
During the year, John Rennocks after 12 years’ service on the Board, 
indicated his intention to retire from the Board. At this stage, John did 
not specify the actual timing of his retirement, as he was keen to ensure 
that an orderly succession took place with the full support of the existing 
members of the Board. 
The Committee carefully considered the process it should follow to 
appoint a Chairman and concluded, in view of the relatively small Board 
size and the importance of close but challenging working relationships, 
that it was in the best long term interests of the Company to appoint a 
Chairman with good knowledge and experience of the Company and 
the Board. The Committee invited the Chief Executive and the existing 
Chairman to lead the selection process. 
The Committee took informal soundings from existing members of  
the Board and from the Company’s advisors. At the conclusion of this 
exercise and in light of his demonstrable commitment and suitability  
for the role, the Committee proposed to the Board that John Nicholas 
should replace John Rennocks as Chairman of the Board.
On 11 November 2014, John Rennocks confirmed to the Board that  
he would retire as Chairman at the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) on 21 January 2015. Following this decision, the Board 
confirmed its intention to appoint John Nicholas as successor to John 
Rennocks as Chairman of the Board, with effect from the conclusion of 
the AGM in 2015.
The Committee has now commenced a formal search, using the 
appointment process described below, for a new independent 
non‑ Executive Director to preserve balance on the Board. In this search 
process, the Committee is working with Norman Broadbent LLP, which 
has no other connection with the Company. The Committee has also 
commenced plans to appoint a new Senior Independent Director and 
make changes to Board Committees which will be required following 
the change of Chairman. These new appointments will formally be 
announced once they have been confirmed by the Board.
Succession planning
The Board annually reviews succession planning for the Executive 
Directors and for the senior management cadre comprising ca.80 senior 
managers across the Group’s businesses. The next review will take place 
in January 2015 in conjunction with the Remuneration Committee’s 
review of compensation for the senior management cadre. The Board 
will also focus more substantially on future succession plans at the Board 
Strategy Review meeting to be held in June 2015.
Appointment of Directors
As part of any appointment process for new Directors, the Committee 
determines the selection criteria for each Director which takes account 
of diversity, including gender and sets out a detailed description of the 
requirements for the role. The Committee works with external search 
agencies as appropriate, who draw up a long‑list of candidates from  
a range of industries and backgrounds for initial appraisal by the 
Committee. From this, a shortlist is prepared of suitable candidates  
that most closely meet the selection criteria and these candidates are 
interviewed by members of the Committee. Following these interviews, 
the Committee recommends to the Board the appointment of a Director.
The Committee implements the Board’s policy on diversity as set out on 
page 45.

Nomination Committee Report 52 DIPLOMA PLC Governance
Remuneration Committee Report
John Nicholas
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
At the time of last year’s Report, I advised shareholders that the 
Committee intended to undertake a review of its Remuneration Policy 
for Executive Directors to ensure that it met investors’ preference for 
simplicity and transparency, as well as remaining appropriate as the 
Company develops. 
As part of this review, the Committee sought the view of the Company’s 
larger shareholders representing over 50% in value of the Group’s shares. 
This review has now concluded and as a result, the Committee proposes 
to make a number of changes to its Remuneration Policy. I summarise 
these below and they are described in more detail later in this Report. 
It is important that the Remuneration Policy maintains the correct 
balance between delivering reward for shorter term execution of the 
Group’s strategy of delivering GDP+ annual growth in earnings, whilst 
also encouraging the long term creation of value by executing the 
Group’s acquisition strategy to deliver significant value to shareholders. 
As a result the Committee intends to make the following changes to the 
remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors:
• The base salaries of the Executive Directors’ will be re‑ positioned 
from 1 October 2014 through a one‑ off increase of 8% which  
in aggregate, amounts to ca.£79,000. This adjustment recognises 
that base salaries of the Executive Directors were not competitive 
when compared with peers of a similar size or in a similar sector. 
General pay inflation increases will normally apply thereafter.
• In future the Company will only grant long term incentive awards 
under the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) within the Company’s 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). No new awards will be made 
under the Share Matching Plan (“SMP”).
• The size of the awards under the LTIP will be reduced to 175% (from 
200%) and the award at threshold vesting will be reduced to 25% 
(from 30%). 
• The vesting of 50% of awards under the PSP is based on growth in 
adjusted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) (the other 50% is based on 
relative TSR performance). In future the target for adjusted EPS will be 
an absolute target and will no longer be inflation linked. It is currently 
intended that the adjusted EPS growth target for maximum vesting 
will be 14% p.a.; however these targets will be reviewed annually to 
ensure they remain demanding and stretching.
• Going forward, future Executive Director appointees will be subject to 
deferral arrangements. The Committee does not believe it appropriate 
to defer share awards for existing Executive Directors as each Executive 
Director is already aligned to shareholders’ interests through their 
substantial shareholdings in the Company.
• The Committee will no longer retain any general overriding discretion 
in relation to the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors. 
The revised Remuneration Policy, including the changes to PSP awards  
and performance conditions are subject to shareholder approval at the 
Company’s AGM in January. Full details will be set out in the Notice of AGM. 
The Company’s continuing strong financial performance is reflected in 
another year of growth in total shareholder return which, for the past six 
years has delivered a 468% return, compared with 143% for the FTSE 250 
Index. This excellent performance has again pushed the Company to the 
upper quartile of TSR performance in the FTSE 250 Index and has 
contributed to the Executive Directors receiving 61% of their awards 
under the Company’s three year LTIP . 
With respect to short term performance, Diploma has delivered strong 
underlying growth of 8% in revenues and adjusted profits during the year. 
Adjusted EPS increased by 4% on a reported basis, which represented 
12% when translated on a constant currency basis and after adjusting  
for the IAS19 accounting policy change. The thresholds for operating 
margins, free cash flow and ROATCE have all been comfortably 
exceeded and personal objectives fully achieved. On the basis of this 
performance, the Committee have approved annual bonuses for the 
Chief Executive of 65% of the maximum and 66% of the maximum for  
the other Executive Directors. 
As well as reviewing the Remuneration Policy this year, the Committee 
has also completed a thorough review of the service contracts of each of 
the Executive Directors. These contracts were issued many years ago and 
changes to legislation and governance over the past ten years has meant 
that the existing contracts needed to be substantially updated. However 
in completing this exercise, no substantive changes were made to the 
underlying conditions of employment. 
Turning to next year, the Committee intends to address the new guidance 
on Executive Director remuneration recently set out in the new 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code
I hope that shareholders will be pleased with the progress made by the 
Committee this year and that you will join me in supporting the two 
resolutions in respect of this year’s Remuneration Committee Report, 
together with the resolution that proposes changes to the PSP rules, 
at the Company’s AGM on 21 January 2015.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (”the Committee”) is chaired by 
John Nicholas and comprises independent non‑ Executive Directors.
Bruce Thompson, Chief Executive, attends meetings at the invitation 
of the Committee to provide advice to the Committee to help it make 
informed decisions. The Group Company Secretary attends meetings 
as Secretary to the Committee.
The Report which follows has been prepared in accordance with the 
Large and Medium‑ sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations SI 2013/1981 which came into  
force on 1 October 2013.
The Remuneration Committee Report
The Report is presented in two sections as required under the  
new regulations:
• Directors’ Remuneration Policy – set out on pages 54 to 59.
• Annual Report on Remuneration – set out on pages 60 to 67.
During the year the Committee undertook a detailed review of its 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors to ensure that it remains 
appropriate as the Company develops. This review has now concluded 
and as a result, the Committee proposes to make a number of changes 
to the Remuneration Policy which was approved by the shareholders at 
last year’s AGM. 
These changes are reflected in the revised Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy which will be subject to a binding vote of shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM on 21 January 2015. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration continues to be subject to an advisory vote by 
shareholders at the AGM.
Remuneration principles and structure
The Committee has adopted remuneration principles which are 
designed to ensure that senior executive remuneration:
• is aligned to the business strategy and promotes the long term 
success of the Company;
• supports the creation of sustainable long term shareholder value;
• provides an appropriate balance between remuneration elements 
which include performance related elements which are transparent, 
stretching and rigorously applied; and
• encourages a high‑ performance culture by ensuring performance‑ related remuneration constitutes a substantial proportion of the 
remuneration package and by linking maximum payout opportunity 
to outstanding results.
The Remuneration Policy Table on pages 54 and 55 outlines the 
principles behind each key element of remuneration, the opportunity  
for each Director in the year ahead and a brief summary of how it works. 
A more detailed explanation of how the incentive arrangements work 
can be found on page 56.

On target remuneration assumes an annual performance bonus of 50% of the maximum for the Executive Directors. It has been assumed that a

performance which is equivalent to 50% of the maximum vesting under the PSP. Maximum remuneration assumes maximum annual performance 
bonus and maximum vesting of PSP awards. In all cases, for simplicity no share price growth or dividend accrual is assumed.  56 DIPLOMA PLC Governance
Awards, which are normally granted annually, must generally be made 
within 42 days after the announcement of the Company’s annual results. 
When making the decision on the level of award, the Committee takes 
into consideration a number of factors, including the face value of the 
award and plan dilution limits.
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or shares 
under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. The relevant share 
price will be the mid‑market closing share price on the day before the 
award. A face value limit of 175% of base salary applies to each PSP 
award to Executive Directors, although the Committee, at its discretion, 
may increase the face value of an award to a maximum of 250% in 
exceptional circumstances. 
All awards will normally vest on the date on which the performance 
conditions are determined and confirmed by the Committee, 
following the end of the performance period. The vesting of 
awards is conditional on:
• continued employment;
• the Company’s growth in adjusted EPS over a three year 
performance period; and
• the Company’s TSR performance over a three year 
performance period.
The latter two performance conditions apply to each award so that 
the vesting of 50% of the award is based on growth in adjusted EPS 
and 50% of the award is based on the relative TSR performance. 
Each performance condition is measured over a three year period 
commencing on the first day of the financial year in which the award 
is made. There is no retesting of either performance metric. 25% of 
the PSP awards will vest at the minimum performance threshold.
The Committee will regularly monitor the continuing suitability of 
the performance conditions and may impose different conditions 
on awards granted in subsequent years, having regard to prevailing 
market conditions.
The Committee may decide, on or before the grant of a share incentive 
award, that on exercise of the award, the participant may receive, in 
addition to the shares in which he then becomes entitled, a dividend 
equivalent in respect of the dividends (excluding any tax credit) which 
would have been paid to the participant in respect of shares vesting 
between the date of the award and the time of vesting. These dividend 
equivalent payments may be made in cash or in an equivalent number 
of shares.
Executive Directors
Base salary
In determining the annual base salary increases which apply from 
1 October, the Committee considers comparative salaries in similar 
companies and the range of remuneration increases applying across 
the Group and in particular for the Group’s senior management cadre 
comprising ca.80 senior managers across the Group’s businesses.
Annual Performance Bonus
The Diploma PLC Annual Performance Bonus Plan is a cash based 
scheme designed to reward Executive Directors for meeting stretching 
shorter term performance targets. At the start of the financial year 
(1 October), the Board sets a financial performance target principally 
focused on achievement of a target adjusted EPS, which to pay out at 
the maximum is significantly ahead of both internal annual budgets 
and market consensus. The level of bonus payable for achieving the 
minimum target is 5% of base salary. No bonus is payable if adjusted 
EPS does not meet the minimum target.
The definition of adjusted EPS is consistent with the Group’s 
financial statements, however the Committee has discretion to 
modify the definition in the event of changes in accounting policy and/
or material operational, market, exchange rate or environmental factors 
in order to more appropriately reflect management performance. The 
Committee has discretion to reduce awards if minimum thresholds 
are not achieved for operating margins, free cash flow and return on 
adjusted trading capital employed (“ROATCE”). Where used, the 
rationale for the exercise of this discretion will be disclosed in the 
next Remuneration Committee Report.
Different performance measures and weightings may be used for future 
cycles of the Annual Performance Bonus Plan to those set out in the 
Policy Table to take into account changes in the business strategy.
Individual objectives are also set for the Chief Operating Officer and 
the Group Finance Director relating to factors including operating 
performance, business and management development activities.  
At the end of the financial year, the Committee meets to assess the 
performance of each Executive Director against the financial and 
individual objectives. Bonuses are normally paid in cash in December.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Company operates a long term incentive plan for Executive 
Directors, being the Diploma PLC 2011 Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
The PSP is designed to promote the long term success of the Company, 
while also aligning the Directors’ interests with those of Diploma 
PLC shareholders. 
The PSP provides for a grant of conditional awards of a specified 
number of ordinary shares in the Company, or an option to acquire 
a specified number of shares at an exercise price determined by the 
Committee (which may be nil or a nominal amount). No payment is 
required for the grant of an award.
Remuneration Committee Report continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy 57 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
When calculating termination payments, the Committee will take 
into account a variety of factors, including individual and Company 
performance, the obligation for the Executive Director in appropriate 
circumstances to mitigate loss (for example, by gaining new 
employment) and the Executive Director’s length of service.
Change of control
Change of control provisions provide for compensation equal to 
the value of salary and contractual benefits for the notice period.
In the event of a change in control, vesting of award shares under 
the Company’s LTIP depends on the extent to which performance 
conditions had been met at that time. Time pro rating may be disapplied 
if the Committee considers it appropriate, given the circumstances of 
the change of control.
Malus
Malus provisions apply to awards made since 1 October 2012 under 
the Company’s LTIP and annual bonus plans which give the Committee 
the right to cancel or reduce unvested share awards (or in the case of 
the Annual Performance Bonus Plan, cash payments) in the event of 
material misstatement of the Company’s financial results, miscalculation 
of a participant’s entitlement or individual gross misconduct.
The Committee intends to give further consideration in 2015 to the 
requirements set out in the revised 2014 UK Governance Code, including 
application of clawback provisions to awards made from 2015 onwards.
Remuneration for new appointments
The Committee has determined that new Executive Directors will receive 
a compensation package in accordance with the terms of the Group’s 
approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment. 
The Committee has agreed the following principles that will apply when 
arranging a remuneration package to recruit new Executive Directors:
• The remuneration structure will be kept simple where practicable, 
hence the use of base salary, benefits, pension (or cash allowance 
in lieu), annual performance bonus and long term incentives;
• The emphasis on linking pay with performance shall continue; 
hence the use of variable pay in the form of an annual performance 
bonus and a long term incentive award, which will continue to 
be a significant component of the Executive Directors’ total 
remuneration package;
• Initial base salary will take into account the experience and calibre 
of the individual and their existing remuneration package. Where it 
is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to 
the desired salary positioning may be given over subsequent years 
subject to individual performance.
• The structure of variable pay will be in accordance with Diploma’s 
approved Policy detailed above with an exceptional maximum 
aggregate variable pay opportunity of 375% of salary. Different 
performance measures may be set in the first year for the annual 
bonus, taking account of the responsibilities of the individual, 
and the point in the financial year that the executive joined.
• Benefits will generally be provided in accordance with the approved 
Policy, with relocation expenses/an expatriate allowance paid 
if appropriate.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, including arrangements for 
early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are 
designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required 
to manage the Company and successfully deliver its strategic objectives. 
The Committee considers that a rolling contract with a notice period 
of one year is appropriate for existing and newly appointed directors. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, copies of which are held 
at the Company’s registered office, were updated during the year to 
recognise developments in law and best practice relating to such 
contracts during recent years. These service contracts contain provisions 
for compensation in the event of early termination or change of control, 
equal to the value of salary and contractual benefits for the Directors’ 
notice period. The Company may make a payment in lieu of notice in 
the event of early termination and the Company may make any such 
payment in instalments with the Director being obliged in appropriate 
circumstances to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new employment).
The Committee considers that these provisions assist with recruitment 
and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in the best interests 
of shareholders.
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who served 
during the year are set out below:

Other remuneration policies
Payment for loss of office
The Committee has considered the Company’s policy on remuneration 
for Executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to 
applying a consistent approach to ensure that the Company pays no 
more than is necessary.
The loss of office payment policy is in line with market practice and will 
depend on whether the departing Executive Director is, or is deemed to 
be treated as, a “good leaver” or a “bad leaver”. In the case of a “good 
leaver” the policy includes:
• Notice period of 12 months’ base salary, pension and contractual 
benefits or payment in lieu of notice;
• Bonus payable for the period worked, subject to achievement of the 
relevant performance condition. Different performance measures 
(to the other Executive Directors) may be set for a departing director 
as appropriate, to reflect any change in responsibility.
• Vesting of award shares under the Company’s long term incentive 
plan is not automatic and the Committee would retain discretion to 
allow partial vesting depending on the extent to which performance 
conditions had been met at the date of cessation and the length of 
time the awards have been held. Time pro‑rating may be disapplied 
if the Committee considers it appropriate, given the circumstances.
• The Committee will also provide for the leaver to be reimbursed 
for a reasonable level of legal fees in connection with a 
settlement agreement. 58 DIPLOMA PLC Governance
• In the case of an external recruitment and after having taken into 
account any variable pay awards to be granted to the executive, 
the Committee may also offer additional cash and/or share‑ based 
elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of 
Diploma and shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards 
or arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join the 
Group. This includes the use of awards made under section 9.4.2 
of the UK Listing Rules. Any such payments would take account 
of the details of the remuneration foregone including the nature, 
vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to that 
remuneration and any payments would not exceed the expected 
value being forfeited. 
• In the case of an internal appointment, any outstanding variable pay 
awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to the terms of grant.
• For all new Executive Director appointments, deferral arrangements 
will apply, to be set according to the circumstances of individual 
appointments and will involve a requirement to acquire shares with 
 a proportion of any post tax annual bonus and/or retention of a 
proportion of LTIP shares received (after tax), in either case, any such 
shares to be retained for at least two years after vesting or until the 
mandated shareholding guidelines have been met.
• Fees for a new Chairman or non‑ Executive Director will be set in 
line with the approved Policy.
Committee discretion
The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under which it 
operates. In addition, it complies with rules which have either been 
approved by shareholders (e.g. the LTIP) or by the Board (e.g. the Annual 
Performance Bonus Plan). These rules provide the Committee with 
certain discretions which serve to ensure that the implementation of the 
Policy is fair both to the Executive Director and to shareholders, taking 
overall performance and position of the Company into account. The 
Committee also has discretions to set components of remuneration 
within a range from time to time. The extent of such discretions are set 
out in the relevant rules or in the maximum opportunity for performance 
metrics sections of the Policy Table.
Dilution
In any ten‑year period, the number of shares which are or may be issued 
under option or other share awards under any executive share plan 
established by the Company may not exceed 5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company from time to time. In any ten‑year period, 
the aggregate number of shares which are or may be issued under 
option, or other share awards under all share plans established by the 
Company, may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company, from time to time.
Consultation with shareholders and employees
The Committee will consult with its major shareholders in advance of any 
significant changes to the approved Policy. The Committee also receives 
reports from the Group Company Secretary on correspondence received 
from shareholders relating to remuneration matters when their approval 
of the Remuneration Committee Report is sought at the AGM.
During the year, the Committee consulted with major shareholders  
on proposed changes to the Policy for the Executive Directors.  
This consultation exercise was carried out through a combination  
of correspondence, meetings and telephone conversations.
The Committee carefully considered the views expressed by shareholders 
and made certain amendments to the proposed changes to the Policy. 
A summary of the results of this consultation exercise, setting out the 
final proposed changes to the Policy, were then communicated to the 
shareholders by letter in September 2014. This consultation exercise has 
now been concluded.
The Committee has not consulted with employees on setting the Policy 
for Executive Directors.
Comparison with employee conditions
In determining annual increases in base salary, annual performance 
bonuses and benefits, the Committee takes into account the 
employment conditions applying across the senior management cadre. 
This comparator group comprises ca.80 senior managers across the 
Group’s businesses. This senior management cadre has been chosen as 
a representative group, since comparisons drawn from across the globe 
and by differing roles, skills, experience and qualifications would reduce 
the scope for meaningful comparisons.

Performance conditions
Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the LTIP awards maturing in 2014 and the outstanding LTIP awards, 
including those granted in 2012 and 2013. 
With effect from 1 October 2014 and subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 21 January 2015, new LTIP awards will be granted under the PSP at 
175% of base salary; no further awards will be made under the SMP although existing SMP awards will continue to mature with the final awards maturing 
in November 2016. The performance conditions applying to new awards made under the PSP will be revised from those set out below for existing 
awards granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The first performance condition for the LTIP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Company’s adjusted EPS, over the three 
consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the annual compound growth rate in the UK Retail 
Price Index (“RPI”) by a specified amount over the same period. For the new awards, the adjusted EPS targets will be specified as absolute figures,  
not relative to RPI. The performance conditions are as follows:
Existing awards
% of existing  
awards vesting New awards
% of new 
awards

Adjusted EPS growth (over 3 years) PSP SMP Adjusted EPS growths (over 3 years) PSP
RPI + 15% p.a. or above 100 100

RPI + 3% p.a. 30 15 5% p.a 25
Below RPI + 3% p.a.
Nil Nil Below 5 % p.a Nil 62 DIPLOMA PLC Governance
Where the Company’s adjusted EPS performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight‑line basis. For the 
purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition remains consistent 
with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Company’s TSR over a three year period to that of the companies in the FTSE 250 
Index (excluding Investment Trusts). The performance conditions are as follows:
Existing awards
% of existing  
awards vesting New awards

Median 30 15 Median 25
Below Median Nil Nil Below Median Nil
Where the Company’s TSR performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight‑line basis. The FTSE 250 Index was 
chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.
Awards vesting in 2014
The PSP and SMP awards made to the Executive Directors on 16 and 19 December 2011 respectively, were subject to independently operating 
performance conditions, assessed over a three year period ended 30 September 2014, as set out in the table above. The outcome of each award is

Long Term Incentive Plan – awards granted in the year
The Executive Directors received grants of PSP and SMP awards on 9 December 2013, in the form of nil‑ cost options. These awards were based 
on the mid‑ market price of an ordinary share in the Company at close of business on the day immediately preceding the award. Under the SMP, the 
Executive Directors are required to pledge shares for a minimum period of three years; these shares were pledged on an after tax basis and awards 
were made on a pre‑ tax basis. 
Under normal circumstances, the options will not become exercisable until the performance conditions are determined after the end of the 
three‑ year measurement period which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made, and provided the Director remains 
in employment. The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the end of the three‑ year measurement 
period. The performance conditions for these awards are set out on pages 61 and 62.
Outstanding share‑ based performance awards 
Set out below is a summary of the share‑ based awards outstanding at 30 September 2014, including both share awards which have vested during 
the year based on performance and share awards which have been granted during the year. All of the awards set out below were granted based on  
a face value limit of 100% of base salary. No awards will vest unless the performance conditions set out on pages 61 and 62 are achieved over a three 
year measurement period.

The PSP and SMP awards vest on the date on which the performance conditions are determined and confirmed by the Committee, following  
the end of the performance period.
Both the PSP and SMP awards are granted in the form of nil‑ cost options (there is a notional exercise price of £1 per award). To the extent that 
the awards vest, the options are then exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award date. Details of options exercised during the year and 
outstanding at 30 September 2014 are set out on page 66.

would reduce the scope for meaningful comparisons.

Executive Director’s interest in options over shares
In respect of nil cost options granted under the PSP and SMP, the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated on the date that  
the options first vest. The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay  
to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date (he may exercise the options at any time up to the day 
preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant), any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in  
the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option. This increase or decrease in value reflects an 
investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2014 and the movement during the year are as follows:

Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, to encourage substantial long term share ownership. These specify that, over  
a period of five years from the date of appointment, the Chief Executive Officer should build up and then retain a holding of shares with a value 
equivalent to 200% of base salary. The guideline holding for other Executive Directors is 100% of base salary. The guidelines also require that,  
in relation to LTIP awards, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached. As at  
14 November 2014, all Executive Directors exceeded the applicable shareholding guidelines.

The non‑Executive Directors received a basic annual fee during the year and there were no additional fees paid in 2014 and 2013 for chairing 
a Committee of the Board or for acting as Senior Independent Director. The fees for non‑Executive Directors are reviewed every year by the Board, 
taking into account their responsibilities and required time commitment. Following a review undertaken in November 2014, the Board approved an 
increase of 2% in the Chairman’s fees to £133,000 per annum and in the annual fees paid to non‑Executive Directors to £46,000, both to take effect 
from 1 October 2014.

Senior Executives below the Board
The policies and practices with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Executive Directors are generally treated consistently with 
the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have a significant portion of their reward package linked to performance. Annual bonuses are 
linked to short term financial targets which use similar performance metrics to the targets for the Executive Directors. They also participate in cash 
based long term incentive plans which are focused on the operating profit growth of their businesses over rolling three year periods. The Committee 
reviews and monitors the senior executive remuneration arrangements. 68 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements

This section contains information which the Directors are required by law and regulation to include within the Annual Report & Accounts.
Shareholders
Incorporation and principal activity
Diploma PLC is domiciled in England and registered in England & Wales 
under Company Number 3899848. At the date of this Report there were 
113,239,555 ordinary shares of 5p each in issue, all of which are fully paid 
up and quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Group is the supply of specialised technical 
products and services. A description and review of the activities of the 
Group during the financial year and an indication of future developments 
is set out on pages 4 to 39; the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39 
incorporates the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) will be held at midday on 
Wednesday, 21 January 2015 in the Brewers Hall, Aldermanbury Square, 
London EC2V 7HR. A circular setting out the proposed resolutions, 
including a resolution to re‑ appoint Deloitte LLP as the auditor, will be 
set out in the Notice of the AGM which is a separate document which 
will be sent to all shareholders and published on the Group’s website.
Substantial shareholdings
At 14 November 2014 the Company had been notified of the following 
interests amounting to 3% or more of the voting rights in its ordinary 
share capital:
Percentage 
of ordinary 
share capital

Mawer Investment Management Limited 3.39%

Invesco PLC 3.07%
Schroders PLC 3.05%
As far as the Directors are aware there were no other interests above 3% 
of the issued ordinary share capital.
Share capital
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well as the 
powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from the Group 
Company Secretary and are available on the Company’s website.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the transfers of securities and/or voting 
rights, other than those relating to the Company’s Share Matching Plan 
(“SMP”), described further below. No person holds securities in the 
Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. 
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share that 
is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not prevent dealings in 
shares in the Company from taking place on an open and proper basis, 
or where the Company has lien over that share. The Directors may also 
refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share, unless the instrument 
of transfer is: (i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered 
office of the Company or any other place as the Board may decide 
accompanied by the certificate for the share(s) to be transferred and/or 
such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show 
the right of the transferor to make the transfer: (ii) in respect of only one 
class of shares; (iii) in favour of a person who is not a minor, infant, 
bankrupt or a person of unsound mind; or (iv) in favour of not more than 
four persons jointly.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using CREST and 
the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertified share in 
accordance with the regulations governing the operation of CREST.
Participants in the Company’s SMP pledge investment shares to a 
nominee for a period of three years, during which period these shares 
cannot be transferred. There are no other restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company except certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example 
insider trading laws); or where a shareholder with at least a 0.25% 
interest in the Company’s certified shares has been served with a 
disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares. 
Shares held by the Diploma Employee Benefit Trust
While ordinary shares are held within the Diploma Employee Benefit 
Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are exercisable by the 
Trustees in accordance with their fiduciary duties. The Trustees of the 
Diploma Employee Benefit Trust also waive dividends on all shares held 
for the purposes of the Company’s long term incentive arrangements.
Share allotment
A general allotment power and a limited power to allot shares in specific 
circumstances for cash, otherwise than pro rata to existing shareholders, 
were given to the Directors by resolutions approved at the AGM of the 
Company held on 15 January 2014. In the year ended 30 September 
2014, the Company has not allotted any shares. These powers will 
expire at the conclusion of the 2015 AGM and resolutions to renew 
the Directors’ powers are therefore included within the Notice of the 
AGM in 2015.
Authority to make market purchases of own shares
An authority to make market purchases of shares was given to the 
Directors by a special resolution at the AGM of the Company held on  
15 January 2014. In the year to 30 September 2014 the Company has 
not acquired any of its own shares. This authority will expire at the 
conclusion of the 2015 AGM and a resolution to renew the authority  
is therefore included within the Notice of the AGM in 2015.
Financial 
Results and dividends
The profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders was £35.5m 
(2013: £34.5m). The Directors recommend a final dividend of 11.6p per 
ordinary share (2013: 10.7p), to be paid, if approved, on 28 January 2015. 
This, together with the interim dividend of 5.4p (2013: 5.0p) per ordinary 
share paid on 18 June 2014 amounts to 17.0p for the year (2013: 15.7p).
The results are shown more fully in the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 70 to 97 and summarised in the Finance Review on 
pages 18 to 20.
Details of post balance sheet events are included in note 29 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 69 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
Directors’ assessment of going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39. The financial position of the Group,  
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described  
in the Finance Review on pages 18 to 20. In addition, pages 82 to 84 of 
the Annual Report & Accounts include the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities;  
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources, together with a broad 
spread of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and 
sectors, often secured with longer term agreements. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.
The Group also has a committed multi‑ currency revolving bank facility 
of £25m which expires on 23 June 2017. At 30 September 2014, the 
Group had cash funds of £21.3m and had no borrowings.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual 
Report & Accounts.
Statement of disclosure
Each of the Directors has reviewed this Annual Report & Accounts and 
confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and that he has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report & 
Accounts, including the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulations and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (UK Accounting Standards).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, to present fairly the financial position and the 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation 
to such financial statements, that references in the relevant part of that 
Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view, are references 
to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU;
• For the Parent Company financial statements, state whether

irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.

model and strategy.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 September 2014
1. General information
Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6AX. The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 17 November 2014. 
These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except where otherwise 
indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with “UK GAAP”, and are set out 
in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 98 and 99.
2. Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”)) financial measures which are not 
defined within IFRS. The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and as such, 
these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in 
this Annual Report & Accounts.
2.1 Adjusted operating profit
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted operating profit” is defined as operating profit before amortisation and 
impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to deferred consideration (collectively, “acquisition related 
charges”), the costs of restructuring or rationalisation of operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses or property. 
The Directors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the underlying operational performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted profit before tax” is separately disclosed, being defined as adjusted operating 
profit, after finance expenses (before fair value remeasurements under IAS 39 in respect of future purchases of minority interests) and before 
tax. The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share
“Adjusted earnings per share” (“EPS”) is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but excluding the tax 
impact on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit and the tax effects of goodwill in overseas jurisdictions, less profit 
attributable to minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe 
that adjusted EPS provides an important measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow
At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, “free cash flow” is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating activities, 
after net capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before expenditure on business 
combinations/investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Company’s shareholders. The Directors believe that 
free cash flow gives an important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future investment.
2.5 Trading capital employed and ROATCE
In the segment analysis in note 3, “trading capital employed” is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents and after 
adding back: borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax and acquisition liabilities in respect of future purchases of minority 
interests and deferred consideration. Adjusted trading capital employed is reported as being trading capital employed plus goodwill and 
acquisition related charges previously written off (net of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets). Return on adjusted trading capital 
employed (“ROATCE”) at the Group and Sector level is defined as the adjusted operating profit, divided by adjusted trading capital employed 
and adjusted for the timing effect of major acquisitions and disposals. The Directors believe that ROATCE is an important measure of the 
underlying performance of the Group.
3. Business sector analysis
For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business Sectors: Life Sciences, Seals and Controls. These 
Sectors form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below. The principal activities of each of these Sectors is described in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39. Sector revenue represents revenue from external customers; there is no inter-Sector revenue. Sector 
results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a Sector, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Sector assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis 
to a business Sector. Sector liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities and corporate liabilities that 
cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business Sector. These items are shown collectively in the following analysis as “unallocated 
assets” and “unallocated liabilities”, respectively. 75 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements

5. Group employee costs
The key management of the Group are the Executive and non-Executive Directors who have authority and responsibility for planning 
and controlling all significant activities of the Group. The Directors’ emoluments and their interests in shares of the Company are given 
in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 52 to 67. The amount charged against operating profit in the year in respect of Director 
short term remuneration was in aggregate £2.2m (2013: £1.7m). The charge for share-based payments of £0.7m (2013: £0.5m) relates to 
the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), described in the Remuneration Committee Report. The fair value of services provided as 
consideration for part of the grant of the LTIP awards has been based on a predicted future value model and was £0.2m (2013: £0.2m).
Group staff costs, including Directors’ emoluments, were as follows:

Financial expense, net (0.5) (0.2)
The fair value remeasurement of £Nil (2013: £0.2m) includes £0.1m (2013: £0.3m) which relates to the unwinding of the discount on the 
liability for future purchases of minority interests.
As described further in note 25b, the Group has adopted the amendments set out in IAS19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ which has given rise 
to an interest expense on the defined benefit pension scheme of £0.2m, compared with interest income of £0.2m last year. If this amendment 
had been adopted last year, the interest income of £0.2m on the defined pension scheme would have been an interest expense of £0.2m. 
The comparative however has not been restated as the amount is not material.

7. Tax expense

Current tax
The tax charge is based on the profit for the year and comprises:
 UK corporation tax 2.6 2.7
 Overseas tax 12.1 12.1
14.7 14.8
Adjustments in respect of prior year:
 UK corporation tax (0.1) –
 Overseas tax (0.4) (0.3)
Total current tax 14.2 14.5
Deferred tax
The net deferred tax credit based on the origination and reversal of timing differences comprises:
 United Kingdom – 0.1
 Overseas (0.5) (0.9)
Total deferred tax (0.5) (0.8)
Total tax on profit for the year 13.7 13.7
In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the Consolidated Income Statement, deferred tax relating to the retirement 
benefit scheme and cash flow hedges of £0.1m was charged (2013: £0.1m credit) directly to the Consolidated Statement of Income and 
Other Comprehensive Income. A further £0.5m (2013: £0.6m) was credited to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which 
relates to share-based payments made during the year, comprising a current tax credit of £1.0m (2013: £1.3m credit) less a deferred tax 
charge of £0.5m (2013: £0.7m charge).
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year:
The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 22.0% to the profit before tax 
of £49.8m and the amounts set out above is as follows:
2014
£m
2013
£m
Profit before tax 49.8 48.5
T ax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 22.0% (2013: 23.5%) 11.0 11.4
Effects of:
  – change in UK tax rates – 0.2
  – higher tax rates on overseas earnings 3.2 2.5
  – adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years (0.5) (0.3)
  – other permanent differences – (0.1)
T otal tax on profit for the year 13.7 13.7
The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas. The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 23.0% to 21.0% on 31 March 2014; however 
as the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation tax in respect 
of the year ended 30 September 2014 was 22.0% (2013: 23.5%) and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the above reconciliation. The 
Group’s net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in the US are taxed at rates of up to ca.38%. 
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21.0% to 20.0% (effective from 1 April 2015) was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
This reduction in the UK corporation tax rate is likely to lead to a further reduction in the future UK current tax charge. The UK deferred tax 
assets and liabilities at 30 September 2014 have been calculated based on the rate of 20.0% substantively enacted at 30 September 2014.

The Group tests goodwill for impairment generally twice a year. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of  
the Group’s three operating Sectors. This represents a change from the prior year and reflects the lowest level within the Group at which 
goodwill is monitored by management and better reflects the Group’s strategy of acquiring businesses to drive synergies across a Sector, 
rather than in an individual business. The impairment test requires a “value in use” valuation to be prepared for each Sector using discounted 
cash flow forecasts. The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of annual budgets prepared by each business and the Group’s five 
year strategic plan. Beyond five years cash flow projections utilise a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margins, growth rates and discount rates. The gross margins are 
assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience; growth rates generally approximate to the long term average 
rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a business, such as start-ups. The annual 
growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts for the next five years represent the budgeted amounts for 2015 and thereafter, average growth 
rates for each Sector; these annual growth rates then trend down to 2% over the longer term. 
The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a single market derived pre-tax discount rate of ca.13% (2013: 
13%). This single rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses operating generally in well 
developed markets and geographies and with robust capital structures. As these features are consistent between each of the Group’s 
Sectors the Board considers that it is more appropriate to use a single discount rate applied to each Sector’s cash flow forecasts.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill in any of the Sectors was identified.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions noted above to determine whether a “reasonably possible 
change” in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. The analysis indicates that a “reasonably possible change” 
would be not give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the three Sectors. Given the significant headroom in the Group’s 
impairment calculations, an impairment would not have arisen had goodwill continued to have been assessed on a business unit basis.

19. Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than a small number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and short term 
deposits, investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities. Trade and other 
receivables and trade and other payables arise directly from the Group’s day-to-day operations. 
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital management.  
An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below and on page 37 
within Principal Risks and Uncertainties, all of which have been audited. 
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations; this arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances (including deposits) 
held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small privately 
owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world. Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in 
the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for each customer. 
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and other 
receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the provision is 
written off against the underlying receivable. The Group has not had any material irrecoverable trade receivables in the past five years. 
Exposure to counterparty credit risk with financial institutions is controlled by the Group treasury team which establishes and monitors 
counterparty limits. Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is “AA” or better.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows:

There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date. An analysis of the 
ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16. An analysis of cash and cash 
equivalents is set out in note 18.

19. Financial instruments continued
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group continually monitors net 
cash and forecasts cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s requirements in the short, medium and long 
term. Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2014 all covenants were complied with fully. 
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on 
deposits. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group also  
has a committed £25m revolving bank facility (with an option to increase its facility to £50m, subject to market pricing) which expires on  
23 June 2017. Interest on this facility is payable at between 120 and 170bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.  
At 30 September 2014 none of the facility had been drawn down (2013: £Nil). 
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows:

Less: Discount (0.9) (0.2)
31.3 27.7
There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date. 
c) Currency risk
The Group’s currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, Canadian dollars, 
Euros and Australian dollars. The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents and these 
balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively. Net foreign exchange gains of £0.1m (2013: £0.1m losses) were 
recognised in operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Group’s businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure to 
movements in the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow 
hedges and are stated at fair value. The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2014 was £31.0m (2013: £15.4m). The net fair 
value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2014 was £0.3m (2013: negligible). The amount removed from 
Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was negligible (2013: £0.2m 
debit). The change in the fair value of cash flow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the year was £0.4m (2013: negligible).
The currency risk arising from both translational and transactional risks are described further on page 37 within Principal Risks and Uncertainties.
d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Group’s results. The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its 
cash funds and borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates. All cash deposits, held in the UK and overseas, are held on a short term basis at 
floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rate. 
Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between one to six 
months at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rate. An increase of 1% in interest rates 
would not have a significant impact on the Group’s adjusted profit before tax.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents at the reporting dates is set out in note 18.  84 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements
19. Financial instruments continued
e) Fair values
There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value. The basis for determining  
fair values are as follows:
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates, adjusted for the forward points to the contract’s value date and gains and losses  
taken to equity. No contract’s value date is greater than 18 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
Other liabilities
The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
f) Capital management risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide strong 
returns to shareholders which will support the future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group comprises cash and 
cash equivalents, short term debt (which includes bank borrowings) and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital 
management during the year. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or increase bank borrowings.

At 30 September 2014, the Group retained put options to acquire minority interests in Kentek and M Seals which are exercisable between 
2015 and 2022. As described in note 22, put/call options were recognised during the year at a value of £2.3m (€2.7m) in respect of the  
20% minority interest in Kentek, acquired on 13 January 2014. On 13 January 2014 and 31 July 2014, the Group acquired the outstanding 
minority interests in DSL for an aggregate of £0.9m (A$1.6m). On 31 July 2014 the Group acquired the outstanding minority interest in  
HPS for £0.7m (US$1.2m), including deferred consideration of £0.1m (US$0.1m).
At 30 September 2014 the estimate of the financial liability to acquire the outstanding minority shareholdings was reassessed by the Directors, 
based on their current estimate of the future performance of these businesses and to reflect foreign exchange rates at 30 September 2014. 
This led to a remeasurement of the fair value of these put options and the liability was reduced by £0.1m (2013: reduced by £0.1m). This 
reduction was offset by the charge from unwinding the discount on the liability and in aggregate £Nil (2013: £0.2m) has been charged to  
the Consolidated Income Statement.

On 13 January 2014 and 31 July 2014 the Group acquired 6% and 14% respectively of the outstanding 20% share capital in DSL from the 
previous owners for cash consideration of £0.9m (A$1.6m). On 31 July 2014, the Group acquired the outstanding 49% shareholding in HPS 
for a maximum consideration of £0.7m (US$1.1m). On completion, the initial consideration was £0.6m (US$1.0m) with a further payment of 
up to £0.1m (US$0.1m) dependent on the achievement of certain performance criteria in the 12 months ending on 30 September 2015.
22. Acquisition of businesses
On 13 January 2014, the Group acquired 80% of Kentek Oy (“Kentek”) for maximum consideration of £11.0m (€13.3m). The initial cash paid on 
acquisition was £8.9m (€10.7m), with a further £0.8m (€1.0m) paid on 14 May 2014 relating to net assets at acquisition. Deferred consideration 
of up to £1.3m (€1.6m) is also payable depending on the operating profit of Kentek in the 12 months ending 31 December 2014. The fair value 
of the 20% minority interest in Kentek of £2.3m has been calculated based on the net present value of the projected performance of the 
business between 2015 and 2018, when the put options become exercisable. 
On 3 June 2014, the Group acquired SFC for a maximum consideration of £2.8m. The initial cash on acquisition was £2.7m and up to a 
further £0.1m is payable based on the operating profit of the business in the 12 months ended 31 December 2014. 
In addition, during the year the Group made a number of smaller acquisitions, all of which were paid for in cash, which were as follows:
17 October 2013 Sacee £0.3m (€0.3m)
19 December 2013 Ramsay Services Limited (“Ramsay”) £1.3m
28 February 2014 AB Seals Limited (“AB Seals”) £0.5m
10 July 2014 Chemzyme Australia £0.6m (A$1.2m)
31 July 2014 Maxwell Seals £0.2m
Acquisition expenses of £0.8m were incurred on these acquisitions, of which £0.6m related to the acquisition of Kentek, including local 
stamp duty taxation.
From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2014, the newly acquired Kentek business contributed £12.4m to revenue and £1.7m to adjusted 
operating profit and the other newly acquired businesses contributed £3.0m to revenue and £0.6m to adjusted operating profit. If all of these 
businesses had been acquired at the beginning of the financial year, they would have contributed £20.6m to revenue and £2.7m to adjusted 
operating profit, in aggregate; however these amounts should not be viewed as indicative of the results of these businesses that would have 
occurred, if these acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of the year. 86 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements

the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
25. Retirement benefit obligations
Diploma Holdings PLC (“the Company”) operates a defined benefit pension arrangement called the Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension 
Scheme (“the Scheme”). The Scheme provides benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, leaving service or death. 
Defined contribution schemes operated by the Group’s businesses are not included in these disclosures.
The Scheme is subject to a Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004 which requires that a valuation of the Scheme is carried 
out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met. As part of the process the Company must 
agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective. The most 
recent triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013 reported that the Scheme had a funding deficit of £2.7m and held 
assets which covered 90% of its liabilities at that date. There were no Scheme amendments, curtailments or settlements during the year.
The Scheme is managed by a set of Trustees appointed in part by the Company and in part from elections by members of the Scheme. 
The Trustees have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Scheme’s assets. 
The Trustees delegate some of these functions to their professional advisors where appropriate. 
The Scheme exposes the Company and therefore the Group, to a number of risks:
• Investment risk. The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these 
assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, volatility over the short term can cause additional funding to be required  
if a deficit emerges.
• Interest rate risk. The Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities. 
As the Scheme’s assets include equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
• Inflation risk. A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. The Scheme’s assets are expected to provide 
a good hedge against inflation over the long term, however movements over the short term could lead to funding deficits emerging.
• Mortality risk. In the event that members live longer than assumed, a funding deficit may emerge in the Scheme.

In the year ended 30 September 2014 the Group has adopted the amendments set out in IAS19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’. This revised 
Standard has required the Group’s accounting policy on interest expense on the defined benefit obligation and expected return on Scheme 
assets to be replaced with a single net interest cost, calculated by applying the Scheme’s discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. 
This amendment, the impact of which is not material to the Group, has been reflected in the 2014 consolidated financial statements, but 
no restatement has been made to the comparative year.

Risk mitigation strategies
When setting the investment strategy for the Scheme, the Trustees, in conjunction with the employer, take into account the liability profile 
of the Scheme. The current strategy is designed to broadly match assets and liabilities in respect of pensioner members, but to invest in 
growth assets in respect of non-pensioners. Annuity policies have been taken out in respect of some historic pensioners, but the Scheme 
has not purchased annuities for new retirements since 2005.
Effect of the Scheme on the Group’s future cash flows
The Company is required to agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees of the Scheme following each triennial actuarial valuation. 
Following the triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013, the Company agreed to contribute £0.3m in cash annually  
to the Scheme. The next valuation of the Scheme is due at 30 September 2016. 90 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements

established supplier of products to the Biotechnology, Clinical Laboratory and Medical markets in Ireland and in the UK.
A review to determine fair values of the net assets acquired will be completed during the next financial year.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 30 September 2014 91 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
Group Accounting Policies
For the year ended 30 September 2014
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied 
in 2014 and the comparative year with the exception of accounting for interest on the assets in the defined benefit pension scheme. 
For the year ended 30 September 2014 the Group adopted amendments to IAS 19 (revised) “Employee Benefits” for the first time. In 
accordance with the revised Standard, the Group’s accounting policy has been changed to replace interest on the defined benefit obligation 
and expected return on scheme assets with a single net interest cost, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability. This amendment, which is not material to the Group, has been reflected in the 2014 consolidated financial statements, but not in 
the comparative year. IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” became effective during the year, however this Standard does not materially impact 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements. There were no other new Standards, amendments or interpretations to existing Standards 
which have been published and endorsed by the EU and which have a significant impact on the results, financial position or presentation of 
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2014.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments 
which are held at fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed on page 69.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those 
detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Non-controlling interests, defined as minority interests, in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the 
Group’s equity therein. Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the 
minority’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
1.3 Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to 
the Group. Goodwill at the acquisition date represents the cost of the business combination (excluding acquisition related costs, which are 
expensed as incurred) plus the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment. Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Minority interests may be initially measured at fair value or, alternatively, at the minority interest’s proportionate share of the recognised 
amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made for each business combination separately.
1.4 Divestments
The results and cash flows of major lines of businesses that have been divested have been classified as discontinued businesses.
1.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services supplied to customers, after deducting 
sales allowances and value added taxes; revenue receivable for services supplied to customers, as opposed to goods, is less than 3% of Group 
revenue. Revenue is recognised when the risk and rewards of ownership transfers to the customer, which depending on individual customer 
terms, is at the time of despatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. Provision is made for returns where appropriate. Service revenue 
received in advance is deferred and recognised on a pro rata basis over the period of the contract.
1.6 Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type. The defined benefit scheme is 
closed to the accrual of further benefits.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans: Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution schemes are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense when they fall due. 92 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements
1.6 Employee benefits continued
(b) Defined benefit pension plan: The deficit recognised in the balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
by independent actuaries using the projected unit cost method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on 
high quality corporate bonds. The pension expense for the Group’s defined benefit plan is recognised as follows:
(i) Within the Consolidated Income Statement:
 – Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments – where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is 
recognised in operating profit;
 – Interest cost on the net deficit in the scheme – calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability at the start 
of the annual reporting period.
(ii) Within the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income:
 – Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the scheme arising from actual experience and any changes in 
assumptions at the end of the year.
 The Group has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit scheme in the period in which they 
occur, outside the Consolidated Income Statement, but in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.
(c) Share-based payments
 The Executive Directors of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby the 
Directors render services in exchange for shares in the Company, or rights over shares (“equity-settled” transactions).
 Equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the 
effect of market based measures, such as the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) targets upon which vesting of part of the award is conditional, 
and is expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity. 
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted to take account of shares forfeited by Executives who leave during the performance or vesting 
period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely that shares will vest. For the market based 
measure, the Directors have used a predicted future value model to determine fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
 The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust for the granting of shares to Executives. The cost of shares in the Company purchased by 
the Employee Benefit Trust are shown as a deduction from equity.
1.7 Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each entity are translated into UK sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency:
 Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the 
settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement;
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated; and
(iii) Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are retranslated using the exchange rates at the date the fair value 
was determined. Where a gain or loss on non-monetary items is recognised directly in equity, any exchange component of that gain 
or loss is also recognised directly in equity and conversely, where a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement.
(b) Translation from functional currency to presentational currency:
 When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency, its results and financial position are 
translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such an average rate does 
not approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used; and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income; these 
cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the foreign operation is 
disposed of.
(c) Net investment in foreign operations:
 Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation are 
recognised in the Income Statement in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the foreign operation as appropriate. 
In the consolidated financial statements such exchange differences are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and 
Other Comprehensive Income as a separate component of equity and subsequently recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 
on disposal of the net investment.
Group Accounting Policies continued
For the year ended 30 September 2014 93 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
1.8 Taxation
The tax expense relates to the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, which differs from profit before taxation as reported in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Taxable profit excludes items of income and expense that are taxable (or deductible) in other years and also excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is calculated using rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Temporary differences 
arise primarily from the recognition of the deficit on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the difference between accelerated 
capital allowances and depreciation and for short term timing differences where a provision held against receivables or stock is not 
deductible for taxation purposes. However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the tax profit, nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are also recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is possible that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group controls the dividend policies of 
its subsidiaries.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when the item on which the tax or charged is credited or charged 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of 
the assets to be recovered. Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to enforce current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax relates to the same fiscal authority.
1.9 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing 
the asset into use, but excluding interest. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in 
the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the 
asset is available for use and is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost, less 
residual value of the asset, over its estimated useful life as follows:
Freehold property  – between 20 and 50 years 
Leasehold property  – term of the lease
Plant and equipment  – plant and machinery between 3 and 7 years
  – IT hardware between 3 and 5 years
  – fixtures and fittings between 5 and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial 
year end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where 
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales 
proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 94 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements
1.10 Intangible assets
All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at their amortised cost or fair value less any provision 
for impairment.
(a) Research and development costs
 Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development costs are written off as incurred until it can be demonstrated that the conditions 
for capitalisation as described in IAS38 “Intangible Assets” are met. At which point further costs are capitalised as intangible assets up until the 
intangible asset is readily available for production and amortised on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life.
 Costs are capitalised as intangible assets unless physical assets, such as tooling, exist when they are classified as property, plant 
and equipment.
(b) Computer software costs
 Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised as other intangible assets. 
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life of between three and seven years.
(c) Acquired intangible assets – business combinations
 Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, including, but not limited to, customer lists, supplier lists, 
databases, technology and software and patents and that can be separately measured at fair value, on a reliable basis, are separately 
recognised on acquisition at the fair value, together with the associated deferred tax liability. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line 
basis to the Consolidated Income Statement over the expected useful economic lives.
 Fair values on larger acquisitions are assessed as follows; customer relationships are valued using a discounted cash flow model; 
databases are valued using a replacement cost model; the amount in respect of supplier relationships and trade names are valued on a 
relief from royalty method. For smaller acquisitions, intangible assets are assessed using historical experience of similar transactions.
(d) Goodwill – business combinations
 Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration over the 
aggregate fair value of the identifiable intangible, tangible and current assets and net of the aggregate fair value of the liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition). Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Impairment testing is carried out annually or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions is not amortised.
1.11 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value in use; its value 
in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit, discounted using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or 
cash-generating unit. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(a) Impairment of goodwill
 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to a cash-generating unit; cash-generating units for this purpose are 
the Group’s three Sectors which represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored by the Group’s Board 
of Directors for internal and management purposes. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
 If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the goodwill attributable to the cash-generating unit.
 An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
(b) Impairment of other tangible and intangible assets
 At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
 Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss for 
tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

For the year ended 30 September 2014 95 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
1.12 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, (generally calculated on a weighted average cost basis) and net realisable value, after making due 
allowance for any obsolete or slow moving inventory. Cost comprises direct materials, duty and freight-in costs.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make 
the sale.
1.13 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
(a) Trade receivables
 Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, do not carry any interest and are reduced by a charge for impairment for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such impairment charges are recognised in the Income Statement.
(b) Trade payables
 Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are initially measured at their fair value.
(c)  Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, interest bearing deposits, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and can form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
(d) Put options held by minority interests
 The purchase price of shares to be acquired under options held by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries, are calculated by 
reference to the estimated profitability of the relevant subsidiary at the time of exercise, using a multiple based formula. The net present value 
of the estimated future payments under these put options is shown as a financial liability. The corresponding entry is recognised in equity as  
a deduction against retained earnings. At the end of each year, the estimate of the financial liability is reassessed and any change in value is 
recognised in the Income Statement, as part of finance income or expense. Where the liability is in a foreign currency, any change in the value 
of the liability resulting from changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(e)  Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
 The Group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the effects of its exposures 
to fluctuations in foreign exchange arising from operational and financial activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does 
not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is their 
market price at the balance sheet date.
 Under IAS39, hedging relationships are categorised by type and must meet strict criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. At the inception of 
the transaction the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The Group uses cash flow hedges (e.g. forward foreign 
exchange currency contracts) to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction.
 In relation to cash flow hedges, to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain 
or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income and Other Comprehensive Income and the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. For cash 
flow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred 
to the Consolidated Income Statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for 
example when the future sale actually occurs.
 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income is kept in equity until the hedged transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. If a hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Consolidated 
Income Statement for the year.
 The Group does not use financial instruments to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities that 
are attributable to a particular risk and could affect the Consolidated Income Statement (fair value hedges). No financial instruments are 
used to hedge net investments in a foreign operation (net investment hedges). 96 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements
1.14 Investments (available for sale financial assets)
The investment held by the Group comprises equity shares which are not held for the purposes of equity trading and in accordance with IAS39  
is classified as available for sale. They are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and 
changes therein are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.
1.15 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. Leases include hire purchase contracts which have characteristics similar to finance or operating leases. All other leases are classified 
as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a 
straight-line basis over the expected lease term.
1.16 Other liabilities
Other liabilities are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is possible that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Other liabilities are measured at the Director’s best estimate of the expenditure required to 
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
1.17 Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the AGM; interim dividends are charged in the period they are paid.
1.18 Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, 
net of tax, from the proceeds. The Group also maintains the following reserves:
(a) Translation reserve – The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign businesses.
(b) Hedging reserve – The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow 
hedging instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge. 
(c) Retained earnings reserve – The retained earnings reserve comprises total cumulative recognised income and expense attributable to 
shareholders. Bonus issues of share capital and dividends to shareholders are also charged directly to this reserve. In addition the cost  
of acquiring shares in the Company and the liability to provide those shares to employees, is accounted for in this reserve. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury shares or indirectly 
within an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold 
or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is 
included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. These shares are used to satisfy share awards granted to Directors under the 
Group’s share schemes. The trustee purchases the Company’s shares on the open market using loans made by the Company or a subsidiary 
of the Company.
1.19 Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective
The IASB has published a number of new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards which are not yet effective, but 
will be mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014. Set out below are those which are considered 
most relevant to the Group:
• IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”: comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is 
recognised. IFRS 15 is effective for the Group for the year ended 30 September 2018. The Group is assessing the potential impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
The following new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements:
• IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
• IFRS 10/11/12 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, “Joint Arrangements” and “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”
• Annual Improvements to IFRS’s 2010–2012 Cycle
• Annual Improvements to IFRS’s 2011–2013 Cycle

1.20 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In order to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 1.1 to 1.19 above, 
management has used estimates and judgements to establish the amounts at which certain items are recorded. Critical accounting 
estimates and judgements are those which have the greatest impact on the financial statements and require the most difficult and subjective 
judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of 
future events that management believe to be reasonable. However given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be 
different from the assumptions used. The critical accounting estimates and judgements are set out below:
1.20.1 Goodwill impairment
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over 
future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment of the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised 
goodwill, using discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the “value in use” to the Group of the capitalised goodwill. This calculation is usually 
based on projecting future cash flows over a five year period and using a perpetuity to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter. A 
discount factor is applied to obtain a current value (“value in use”). The “fair value less costs to sell” of an asset is used  
if this results in an amount in excess of “value in use”.
Estimated future cash flows for impairment calculations are based on management’s expectations of future volumes and margins based  
on plans and best estimates of the productivity of the assets in their current condition. Future cash flows therefore exclude benefits from 
major expansion projects requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure has not been approved at the balance sheet date.
Future cash flows are discounted using discount rates based on a market derived weighted average cost of capital, adjusted if appropriate 
for circumstances specific to the asset being tested. The weighted average cost of capital is impacted by estimates of interest rates and 
equity returns and is reviewed on an annual basis.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s 
businesses for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the 
Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill.
1.20.2 Taxation
The Group operates in a number of tax jurisdictions around the world. Tax regulations generally are complex and in some jurisdictions 
agreeing tax liabilities with local tax authorities can take several years. Consequently, at the balance sheet date tax liabilities and assets are 
based on management’s best estimate of the future amounts that will be settled. While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates 
recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected.
Deferred tax assets mainly represent timing differences that the Group expects to recover at some time in the future and by their nature,  
the amounts recorded are therefore dependent on management’s judgement about future events. Account has also been taken of future 
forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these deferred tax assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise 
or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the timing difference might be recognised, then the value of the 
deferred tax asset will need to be revised in a future period.
1.20.3 Inventory and trade receivable provisions
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working capital, principally 
inventory and trade receivables. Impairment charges are made against obsolete or slow-moving inventories, bad or doubtful receivables.
The decision to make an impairment charge is based on the facts available at the time the consolidated financial statements are approved 
and are also determined by using profiles, based on past practice, applied to certain aged inventory and trade receivables categories.  
In estimating the collectability of trade receivables, judgement is required in assessing their likely realisation, including the current 
creditworthiness of each customer and related ageing of the past due balances. Specific accounts are assessed in situations where a 
customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy.
1.20.4 Future purchases of minority interests
The Group’s financial statements include a financial liability for the net present value of the expected amount that it will pay in future years 
to acquire the outstanding shares held by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries. This amount is based on the Directors’ estimate 
of the future profitability of the relevant subsidiary and the assumption that year end exchange rates will remain consistent until the exercise 
of the option. Any changes to the estimated profitability of the relevant business and/or changes to the assumption of the relevant exchange 
rate, will change the estimate of this financial liability. 98 DIPLOMA PLC Financial Statements

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 September 2014
a) Accounting policies
a.1 Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed on page 69, under the historical cost convention in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK Accounting Standards. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 
2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company. The Company’s profit after tax for the year was £20.3m 
(2013: £22.7m).
a.2 Investments and dividends
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Dividend income is recognised when received. Final dividend distributions are 
recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.
a.3 Employment Benefit Trust and employee share schemes
Shares held by the Diploma Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) are stated at cost and accounted for as a deduction from shareholders’ 
funds in accordance with UITF 38. Shares that are held by the Trust are not eligible for dividends until such time as the awards have vested 
and options have been exercised by the participants.
a.4 Cash flow statement
The Company is exempt from the requirements of FRS1 (revised) to include a cash flow statement as part of its Company financial 
statements because it prepares a Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, as part of the consolidated financial statements.
a.5 Related parties
The Company has taken advantage of paragraph 3(c) of FRS8 (“Related Party Disclosures”) not to disclose transactions with Group entities 
or interests of the Group qualifying as related parties.
a.6. Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to the auditor for the audit of the Company’s accounts of £3,500 (2013: £3,500) were borne by a fellow Group undertaking.
b) Directors’ and employees’ remuneration
No emoluments are paid directly by the Company; information on the Directors’ remuneration and their interests in the share capital of the 
Company are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 52 to 67. The Company had no employees (2013: none).

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of  
Diploma PLC
Opinion on financial statements of Diploma PLC
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2014 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Other 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement, the related notes 1 to 29 and the Group Accounting

statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement 
on page 69 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; 
and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below remain the 
same as the prior year end are those that had the greatest effect on our 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an 
opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial 
statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described below, 
and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Carrying value of Goodwill, tangible and  
intangible assets 
The key assumptions used in the assessment of the 
carrying value of goodwill, tangible and intangible 
assets are determined with reference to judgemental 
factors such as forecast cash flows and the appropriate 
discount rate.
We assessed the assumptions used in the impairment model, specifically including the cash flow 
projections, cash-generating unit allocation, discount rates, perpetuity growth rates and the sensitivities 
applied. Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with reference to historical trading 
performance, consulting with our valuation specialists who benchmarked assumptions such as the 
perpetual growth rate and discount rate to external macro-economic and market data.
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively 
would be required for the assets to be impaired by performing sensitivity analysis on the key 
assumptions, we considered the likelihood of such a movement in those assumptions arising and the 
adequacy of the disclosures within the financial statements.
Valuation of inventory including appropriateness of 
judgements applied within the obsolescence provision
Management judgement is required in determining the 
completeness of the inventory provisions and making 
an assessment of its adequacy, considering the age and 
volumes relative to expected usage.
We have considered the provision at each business unit level. We evaluated the recorded provision, 
specifically checking the discontinued dates of those relevant stock lines to assess whether they have 
been aged correctly and the appropriate provision percentage has been applied. We have assessed 
the net realisable value of inventory and challenged management’s assumptions with regards to the 
completeness of the inventory provisions and made an assessment of its adequacy, considering the 
age and volumes relative to expected usage. We also compared the actual sales value of a sample of 
inventory items to their book value to ascertain that the carrying value of inventories does not exceed 
their net realisable value.
The recoverability of trade debtors and 
appropriateness of the bad debt provision 
Management judgement is required in determining the 
completeness of the trade receivables provision and 
making an assessment of its adequacy, considering the 
expected recoverability of the year end receivables
We have challenged Management’s assumptions in calculating the bad debt provision, including 
reviewing the ageing of receivables in comparison to previous years, reviewing the level of bad debt 
write-offs in the current year and against the prior year and checking the recoverability of outstanding 
debtors through examination of subsequent cash receipts.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 49.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. We determined materiality for the Group 
to be £2.5 million (2013: £2.5 million), which is approximately 5% of profit 
before tax (2013: 5%).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £50,000 (2013: £50,000), as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  101 DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group 
and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, 
we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 7 (2013: 
7) locations. Each of these 7 locations was subject to a full scope audit. An 
additional 4 (2013: 5) locations were subject to specified audit procedures 
which address each of the significant balances and significant risks within these 
entities. Together the work at these locations represents the principal business 
units of the Group and accounts for 71% (2013: 79%) of the Group’s revenues 
and 78% (2013: 86%) of the Group’s operating profit.
The Group audit team has designed and implemented a rotational country 
visit programme to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior 
member of the Group audit team visits these locations and attends close out 
meetings. Each year this programme of visits includes the three most significant 
territories (being the US, Canada and UK).
Where no visits are carried out the Senior Statutory Auditor or another 
senior member of the team has held discussions with the lead partner in the 
current year. In years when we do not visit a significant component we have 
discussed with the component audit team their risk assessment, and reviewed 
documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial 
information of the remaining components not subject to audit or specified 
audit procedures.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made 
or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to 
report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance 
with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have 
nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if,
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ Statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). 
Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and 
systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner review.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are either required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

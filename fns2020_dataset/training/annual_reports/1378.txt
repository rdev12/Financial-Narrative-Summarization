In 2008 we joined the

introduced ASOS Life, which 
allows customers to talk to

The Online Fashion Store
The website received a complete overhaul in March 2009 
and we introduced a number of new navigation features to 
enable quick and easy browsing of the extended product 
ranges. We also introduced a 360 degree view of all shoes 
and accessories and we introduced catwalk for menswear 
and for ASOS Outlet.
Our 20 biggest brands are now represented
by a ‘shop in shop’ providing a rich brand
experience for our customers and a
unique distribution platform for our
brand partners.

and beauty retailer offering around 25,000 branded and 
own label fashion lines across womenswear, menswear, 
footwear, accessories, jewellery and beauty.
Who are your customers?
We target fashion conscious 16-34 year olds and attract 
over 5.4 million unique visitors a month. As at 31 May 
2009, we had 2.4 million registered users and 1.2 million 
active customers which we define as people who shopped 
with us in the last 6 months.
Last year revenue was up 104% but in the 
first 13 weeks of the current year your sales 
were only up 52%. Have you gone
ex-growth?
Not at all! You have to realise that to deliver last year’s 
results, we had to buy 100% more stock than in the 
previous year. In planning for the current year, we were 
more conservative and this was reflected in the analysts’ 
forecasts at the start of the year when they were looking for 
sales growth of 35% to 40% for the year ending 31 March 
2010. It is still early in the financial year but, if we achieve 
this level of growth, we think it will be an outstanding 
achievement and we hope it will please our shareholders.
You appear to be adopting a high risk 
strategy by expanding overseas. Given the 
current economic environment is this wise?
This past year our international sales amounted to
£32.2m or just under 19.5% of total revenues. This was 
achieved with very little marketing effort on our part but,
as you can see from last year’s numbers, international 
expansion is a major opportunity which we plan to take 
advantage of through a low risk approach. As you are 
probably aware, Nick Beighton recently joined us as 
Finance Director and following his arrival Jon Kamaluddin, 
his predecessor, who joined us in 2004, will be 
spearheading our overseas expansion.
We are not planning a major international launch. What 
you will see is a roll out of the ASOS brand with additional 
emphasis on particular countries. As of today, our 
customers have a choice of six currencies to choose from 
when they shop with us and we export to 58 countries 
worldwide. This will increase to over 100 during the course 
of the current year.
At the forefront of our thinking is customer service. With 
distribution services available today, we can now deliver to 
many places in Europe and North America within two days, 
which is probably as quick, if not quicker, than retailers in 
those countries. This enables us to fulfil international
orders from our distribution centre in Hemel Hempstead 
without the major cost of having to build centres in 
overseas territories.

As shareholders are aware, we have very sophisticated 
technology and during the past year we invested over 
£15.5m in our warehouse operation to meet growing 
demand. We are continuing to benefit from the efficiencies 
that this ongoing investment in logistics is producing and 
this has given us confidence that we have the resources in 
place to expand overseas. 
In due course, probably within the next 18 months, we will 
start to introduce country specific websites but this aspect 
of our plans is still at the development stage.
With over £13.5m on your Balance Sheet
and no borrowings, why are you failing to 
pay a dividend?
The Board looks at this issue very carefully but, given what 
we believe to be the very exciting growth opportunities that 
still exist, we feel that it is in the interest of our shareholders 
that we continue to invest in the business.

ASOS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 Stock Exchange Code: ASC
It gives me great pleasure to present another outstanding 
set of results for ASOS PLC. Against the worst economic 
climate for retailers in recent memory, the Company 
has produced top line growth of over 100%, has again 
increased its market share and has delivered outstanding 
profit growth. 
It highlights the strength of the Internet as a retail channel 
and its potential position in the retail landscape of 
the future.
The outlook for 2009/10 remains uncertain. Whilst 
some indicators are showing positive signs, the effect of 
unemployment, job security and consumer debt has yet to 
be fully felt. Therefore, we have been more conservative in 
our planning for the 2009/10 financial year. 
That said, the future of online clothing retail remains bright, 
with the Internet set to take an ever increasing share of the 
clothing market. ASOS is ideally positioned to continue to 
exploit this, both in the UK and increasingly internationally, 
and we remain confident that this will be another year of 
strong growth.
MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN
During the 2009/10 financial year, the Remuneration 
Committee of ASOS will be implementing a new 
management incentive plan for executive directors and 
selected other key employees of the Company. 
The purpose of the plan is to incentivise and reward the 
management of ASOS for superior performance through 
the achievement of challenging Earnings per Share (“EPS”) 
growth targets and to align the interests of management 
with those of shareholders through a demanding Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) condition. Both the EPS and 
TSR conditions will have to be met for awards to vest. 
DIVIDEND
Sustaining the levels of growth delivered to date has 
required and will continue to require significant capital 
investment in the Company. The Board believes it is in the 
best interests of shareholders to continue to exploit the 
significant growth opportunities available to the business 
and consequently, does not propose paying a dividend this 
year. This policy remains under constant review.
PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board I would like to welcome our new 
employees who joined us during the year and to thank
the team for their outstanding contribution to the
ongoing success of ASOS. During the year ASOS
won 17 industry and consumer awards, an
achievement of which they can all be very proud.

THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCED TOP
LINE GROWTH OF OVER 100%” ASOS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 Stock Exchange Code: ASC ASOS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 Stock Exchange Code: ASC
BUSINESS REVIEW
I am pleased to report another exceptional year for ASOS. 
Despite the challenging economic conditions, sales grew 
by 104% to £165.4m and profit before tax increased by 
93% to £14.1m. 
We continued our programme of investment throughout 
the year, delivering a number of product initiatives whilst 
building our team and infrastructure to support these 
superior levels of growth. The continued popularity of 
Internet shopping provided a strong backdrop and, with 
the weakness in sterling, our international sales took a 
significant step-up. 
This year has started positively, with sales for the 13 weeks 
to 26 June 52% ahead of the same period last year. This 
compares to an increase of 95% for the same period last 
year. Clearly we are facing much tougher comparables, 
and there is now some evidence to suggest that the rate of 
growth in online sales has begun to moderate. In May 2009, 
the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) reported an 8% 
year on year growth in clothing sales, the lowest year on 
year increase since the index was launched nine years ago. 
That said, according to a report by Verdict the percentage 
of clothing bought online is expected to double in the next 
3 to 4 years, from 5.7% at the end of 2008 to over 11% by 
2013. At ASOS, we remain committed to winning the online 
fashion race. According to Hitwise, ASOS remains the 
second most visited apparel and accessories site on the 
Internet in the UK and in May 2009, we became a top 10 
UK e-commerce site for the first time, coming in 10th 
place, a rise of eight places on the year. We will continue 
our programme of investment, albeit at more conservative 
levels in the short-term, in order to exploit the opportunities 
that exist both in the UK and internationally.

“WE CONTINUED OUR PROGRAMME OF 
INVESTMENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, 
DELIVERING A NUMBER OF PRODUCT
INITIATIVES WHILST BUILDING OUR TEAM
AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THESE
SUPERIOR LEVELS OF GROWTH”
INTERNATIONAL
Our international business has grown strongly over the 
year and now represents 19% of our sales, up from 10% in 
2007/08. Sterling’s weakness, particularly against the US 
dollar and the euro, has assisted with this growth as has an 
increase in marketing activity in Northern Europe and the 
US. During the year we increased the number of countries 
that we ship to from 34 to 58. Our top five performing 
countries outside the UK were Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, 
France and the US.
The Board believes that international expansion represents 
the largest growth opportunity open to ASOS. Accordingly, 
Jon Kamaluddin was appointed International Director 
in April 2009. Jon is responsible for developing and 
implementing our international strategy.
We will continue to add to the number of countries that we 
ship to, we will introduce flat rate shipping charges and we 
will increase our digital marketing activity. Ultimately we will 
introduce stand-alone, country specific, ASOS sites.
During the first phase of our international expansion all 
orders will be fulfilled from our UK warehouse. This will 
enable us to offer the full ASOS range of over 20,000 lines 
without introducing significant additional stock risk. This 
approach allows us to build scale in each local market 
ahead of significant infrastructure investment. 
DELIVERING INCREDIBLE CHOICE
During the year, our product ranges grew by 157%, 
resulting in 21,300 options on site at the end of March 
2009 (up from 8,300 at the end of March 2008). As at 
20 June 2009, there were 24,700 options on the ASOS 
website, up from 12,260 a year prior. We anticipate that 
we will extend this to approximately 30,000 options for the 
Autumn/Winter season. 
In September 2008 we launched ASOS Outlet, a dedicated 
shop within ASOS selling separately sourced, last season’s 
brands at up to 70% off. In February 2009, we launched 
Designer Brands at ASOS and Little ASOS (childrenswear). 
Our own-label ranges were also extended with the 
introduction of Maternity and ASOS Black, a premium 
range. We plan to launch an own-label childrenswear range 
and an own-label plus size range later in the year. 
We welcomed a number of new brands to the site 
including G-Star, Reiss, Warehouse and Polo Ralph Lauren 
and we look forward to introducing both Gap and Mango 
in August 2009. This takes the total number of brands now 
represented on ASOS to 820 compared to 600 twelve 
months ago.
DELIVERING UNCOMPROMISING PRESENTATION
The website received a complete overhaul in March 2009 
and we introduced a number of new navigation features to 
enable quick and easy browsing of the extended product 
ranges. We also introduced a 360 degree view of all shoes 
and accessories and we introduced catwalk for menswear 
and for ASOS Outlet.  www.asos.com

CASE STUDY
Our 20 biggest brands are now represented by a “shop in 
shop” providing a rich brand experience for our customers 
and a unique distribution platform for our brand partners. 
DELIVERING IMPECCABLE SERVICE
Following considerable investment in new warehouse and 
carrier management systems, we will shortly be introducing 
a number of new service propositions. Our next day delivery 
service will be extended allowing customers to place orders 
up to 6.00 pm. This includes a Saturday delivery for orders 
placed on a Friday. We will also be introducing a super saver 
option and premium “same day” service within London. 
Today, approximately 85% of our orders are trackable.
COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA
In 2008 we joined the conversation with customers through 
various social media, starting official ASOS pages on 
Facebook, MySpace and Bebo. On Twitter, our approach 
was slightly different: in addition to officially providing real 
time News & Offers, Customer Care and Service Updates 
there are 55 members of the ASOS team across various 
departments actively talking to customers. This more 
immediate and personal approach is resonating with our 
customers and we now have the largest Twitter following of 
all UK retailers. We have also introduced ASOS Life, which 
allows customers to talk to each other and key people 
within ASOS. 
INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE
Over the past year, we have invested in systems to support 
our back office operations of buying, merchandising and 
fulfilment, recently installing a new warehouse management 
system at our Hemel Hempstead warehouse. This system 
will support our increasing range size, international 
expansion, as well as our demands for advanced delivery 
and returns options. 
During the next twelve months we plan to continue 
our investment in systems (focusing on merchandise 
management and stock planning) and will further develop 
our website systems in preparation for our international 
expansion.  AWARDS

Subject to further investment in storage and handling

THIRD PARTY REVENUES
We have strengthened the team responsible for deriving 
revenue from advertising banners, inserts, list sales and 
display advertising in our magazine. Consequently, after 
what was a somewhat disappointing year in this area, we 
expect third party revenues to grow in the coming year. 
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
We are firmly established as the UK’s premier online fashion 
business and I remain positive about the outlook for ASOS. 
First quarter sales are growing at 52%, an exceptional 
performance, given the current economic climate. It is clear 
that the structural shift to online continues and I believe that 
ASOS is ideally placed to exploit it. Moreover, international 
expansion is a key opportunity for ASOS and I expect our 
international business to grow substantially in the years 
to come.
With three-quarters of the financial year to go, including the 
key Christmas period, it is too early to assess whether our 
current performance will continue for the full year. That said, 
I believe ASOS can look forward to another year of strong 
progress and development.

The year ended March 2009 was another excellent year 
for ASOS with sales more than doubling and pre-tax profit 
increasing to £14.1m, up 93% from £7.3m in the financial 
year 2007/08.
Strong retail sales, up 108%, were driven by a combination 
of higher customer traffic, enhanced product choice and 
compelling customer promotions. The sales growth rates 
were evenly split over the year. Delivery receipts increased 
less strongly than retail sales, as we offered a range of 
delivery incentives over the Christmas trading period.
We saw a disappointing performance in third party 
revenues, which declined 22% over the year. This area of 
our business has now been strengthened significantly to 
address this performance going forward.

GROSS PROFIT
Our gross profit increased 92% on the prior year, and the 
Group gross margin achieved was 43.3% (2007/8: 46.0%). 
The enhanced branded mix and promotional investment 
drove a 130 basis point dilution in the retail margin. 
Additionally, we offered our customers several free delivery 
periods over the Christmas trading period, which, although 
offering better value for our customers and incremental 
cash, diluted our percentage gross margin. This movement 
accounted for most of the decline in the Group gross margin.
During 2009/10 we expect a further easing of the Group 
gross margin as a result of a continued increase in the mix
of branded versus own label products and increased 
sourcing costs resulting from adverse foreign currency 
movements. 
During the year, we invested again in recruiting people across 
the Group (including a significant strengthening of senior 
management), resulting in a 117% increase in payroll and staff 
costs. Our headcount at the end of the year (excluding the 
logistics team which is outsourced) amounted to 441 people, 
up from 222 at the end of the last financial year. 
Warehouse costs rose by 56% to £15.6m, but delivered 
greater productivity year on year. This operating cost ratio 
reduced from 11.1% last year (excluding the warehouse 
provision) to 9.4% in 2008/09.
Marketing costs increased by 52% to £6.4m. These 
costs include the ASOS magazine production, direct 
marketing, creative and PR costs. The largest element of 
this expenditure relates to the production of the magazine. 
Cost growth in this area was substantially lower than sales 
growth due to the timing of the Easter edition and a more 
targeted mailing approach during the financial year.
Production costs were previously included in marketing 
costs and have been split out separately for this financial 
year. The costs relate to preparing, photographing, editing 
OPERATING COSTS
Operating costs increased by 91% to £57.8m:

Finance Director’s Review continued
and placing product images on the website. As a result of 
the significant increase in the number of lines introduced to 
our website, production costs increased 98% to £1.8m. 
Other costs include the head office running costs, IT 
infrastructure and legal and professional fees. During the 
course of the year there were a number of investment 
step changes that have precipitated a higher running 
cost particularly in improving the system infrastructure 
and software. The high growth rates experienced in the 
overseas territories have led to a number of one-off costs 
relating to managing the legal and fiscal environment.
A key element of our financial strategy for the 2009/10 
financial year will be to maximise the efficiency from our 
operational resources invested in the business while 
continuing to invest in supporting growth where necessary.
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit for the financial year 2008/09 increased by 
100% to £13.9m. The operating margin weakened slightly 
from 8.6% in 2007/08 to 8.4% in 2008/09. The 270 basis 
points gross margin decline was therefore largely offset by 
an improvement in operating cost ratios. 
FINANCE INCOME
While our cash balance increased during the financial 
year by £3.2m, the financial income derived from these 
balances declined from £0.35m in 2007/08 to £0.27m in 
2008/09 as a result of lower interest rates.
INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE
In September 2009, we acquired a 50% stake in a 
business called Crooked Tongues Ltd. for a nominal 
sum. Our share of losses for the first six months of this 
start-up entity was £78,000. The business website, 
www.crookedtongues.com, is a leading authority in trainers 
and sneakers. This investment allows us to participate in 
sales from an additional customer segment.
TAXATION
The effective tax rate for the Group was 29.1%, 110 
basis points above the UK corporation tax rate of 28.0%. 
Going forward, we expect the effective rate of tax to be 
maintained around 1% ahead of the statutory rate. The Online Fashion Store
25
www.asos.com
During the year we commenced our IT strategy of 
migrating to tier 1 system and software solutions. Our 
capital expenditure was directed towards delivering an 
improved warehouse management system, more robust 
data centre and better management information systems.
We anticipate that our capital expenditure in the 2009/10 
financial year will be approximately £11.0m and will be 
deployed in a similar profile to the 2008/09 financial 
year spend. 
CASH FLOW AND NET CASH
The Group ended the financial year with a net cash position 
of £13.6m, up from £10.4m at the end of March 2008. 
Major sources of cash inflow consisted of £15.8m of 
EBITDA, trade payables of £10.6m and other creditors 
of £4.2m. 
During the year, the Company spent £1.9m funding the 
employee benefit trust (EBT). Share options under the 
Group’s share option schemes were exercised during the 
period, raising £0.3m.
All of the Group’s investments continue to be funded from 
operating cash flow. Surplus funds are invested in short-
term deposits with the objective of maximising fixed interest 
rate returns whilst providing the flexibility to fund ongoing 
operations. It is not the Group’s policy to engage in 
speculative activity or to use complex financial instruments.

POLICY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES
Although not formally required to do so, the directors 
have sought to embrace the principles contained in the 
Combined Code 2003 as revised in June 2006 (“the 
Code”) applicable to fully listed companies, in formulating 
and applying the Company’s corporate governance 
policies. These policies are monitored to ensure that they 
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and 
comply as far as possible with the provisions of the Code 
given the size of the Company.
DIRECTORS
The Company is managed by a Board of directors and 
they have the necessary skills and experience to effectively 
operate and control the business. There are six directors 
in total, of whom two are non-executive directors. Lord 
Waheed Alli and Peter Williams, the non-executive 
directors, comprise both the audit and remuneration 
committees. The Board meets once a month and the 
directors make every effort to attend all Board meetings.
The Board is responsible for taking all major strategic 
decisions and also addressing any significant operational 
matters. In addition, the Board reviews the risk profile of the 
Company and ensures that an adequate system of internal 
control is in place. Management information systems are in 
place to enable the directors to make informed decisions to 
properly discharge their duties.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are 
separate. The Chairman is responsible for the running of 
the Board and he meets regularly and separately with the 
Chief Executive to discuss matters for the Board. As the 
business has developed, the composition of the Board 
has been under constant review to ensure that it remains 
appropriate to the managerial requirements of the 
Company. One-third of the directors retire annually in 
rotation in accordance with the Company’s articles of 
association. This enables the shareholders to decide on 
the election of their Company’s Board.
The Board takes decisions regarding the appointment of 
new directors as a whole and this is only done following 
a thorough assessment of potential candidates’ skills and 
suitability for the role. 
All directors are offered appropriate training to develop their 
knowledge and ensure they remain up to date in relevant 
matters for which they have responsibility as a member of 
the Board.
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Statement 
included in this annual report give the Board’s current 
assessment of the Company’s prospects. The directors 
are responsible for preparing the financial statements as 
set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The 
responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Details concerning the composition and meetings of the 
remuneration committee are contained in the directors’ 
remuneration report on page 32.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
During the period the audit committee, which is chaired by 
Peter Williams, a non-executive director, has met twice with 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 31
www.asos.com
The Online Fashion Store
the external auditors being in attendance. The committee 
has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements 
provided to shareholders. In addition, the committee 
reviews the business and financial risks and internal 
controls as described below.
The duties of the committee also include ensuring that the 
auditors provide a cost-effective service to the Company 
and remain objective and independent and to consider 
from time to time the need for an internal audit function.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company has institutional shareholders and is, where 
practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. The 
Chief Executive and the Finance Director meet regularly 
with institutional investors within the confines of relevant 
legislation and guidance.
The Board invites communication from its private investors 
and encourages participation by them at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM). All Board members present at the 
AGM are available to answer questions from shareholders. 
Notice of the AGM in excess of 21 clear days is given and 
the business of the meeting is conducted with separate 
resolutions, voted on initially by a show of hands and with 
the result of the voting being clearly indicated.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system is designed to mitigate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the Company’s 
significant risks and that it has been in place for the period 
ended 31 March 2009 and up to the date of approval of 
the annual report and financial statements, and that it is 
regularly reviewed by the Board.
The internal control procedures are delegated to executive 
directors and senior management in the Company 
operating within a clearly defined departmental structure. 
The Board regularly reviews the internal control procedures 
in the light of the ongoing assessment of the Company’s 
significant risks. On a monthly basis management 
accounts, including a comprehensive forecast, are 
reviewed by the Board in order to provide effective 
monitoring of financial performance. At the same time the 
Board considers other significant strategic, organisational 
and compliance issues to ensure that the Company’s 
assets are safeguarded and financial information and 
accounting records can be relied upon. The Board formally 
monitors monthly progress on each development.
GOING CONCERN
The directors consider that the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources to remain in operation for 
the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The Group has a strong Balance Sheet with 
no external financing and highly experienced management 
to help grow the business in future years. The Group will 
also benefit from a significant migration to online shopping 
enabling it to benefit from increased sales in the future.  www.asos.com

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Peter 
Williams (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee) 
and Lord Waheed Alli. The Chief Executive Officer of 
the Company is also invited to attend the meetings of 
the Remuneration Committee but is absent when his 
remuneration is under discussion.
ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee reviews and determines on 
behalf of the Board and shareholders of the Company the 
pay, benefits and other terms of service of the executive 
directors of the Company and the broad pay strategy with 
respect to senior Company employees. During the year, 
the Remuneration Committee received advice on executive 
remuneration from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
BEST PRACTICE
As the Company is AIM-listed it is not legally required to set 
out its remuneration policy but is doing so on a voluntary 
basis. To the extent that such principles are relevant to the 
current circumstances of the Company, the provisions of 
inter alia the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 
2002 and the Combined Code are taken into account.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The objective of the Company’s remuneration policy is 
to attract and retain the directors and senior executives 
needed to run the Company in a cost-effective manner.
The remuneration policy of the Company has six principal 
components:
1. Basic salaries — Basic salaries are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee bearing in mind the salaries 
paid in AIM-listed and other small market capitalisation 
retail companies. Within that frame of reference, it is 
intended that pay should be at or near the median level.
2. Pensions — defined contribution pension provision of 
15% of salary is offered to the executive Directors.
3. Bonuses — Bonuses are payable according to 
the achievement by the Company of certain pre-
determined profit before tax targets. The level of 
bonuses payable on achievement of the targets is set 
at the level perceived correct to provide the necessary 
incentives for executive directors. 
4. Performance Share Plan — The Company established 
a performance share plan in 2006 for the executive 
directors and senior employees. The scheme is 
overseen by the Remuneration Committee which shall 
determine the terms under which eligible individuals 
may be invited to participate.
5. Share option scheme — The Company has in place 
a share option scheme covering senior employees, 
under which share options are normally granted once 
a year. The exercise price of the options granted 
under the scheme is set equal to the market value of 
the Company’s shares at the time of grant. The share 
option scheme is overseen by the Remuneration 
Committee. There is currently no intention to make any 
new share option grants under this scheme. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 33
www.asos.com
The Online Fashion Store
6. Management Incentive Plan — The Company will 
establish a new management incentive plan during 
2009 which the Remuneration Committee will 
oversee and determine the terms under which eligible 
individuals may be invited to participate. Participants 
in this scheme will not be granted an award of shares 
under the Performance Share Plan in the year in which 
they have received an award under the Management 
Incentive Plan. Members will be required to invest their 
own money, based on a multiple of gross salary, to buy 
shares in the Company (investment shares). Options 
will then be granted over shares (incentive shares). The 
number of incentive shares will be defined as a multiple 
of investment shares, dependent on performance 
against stretching Earnings per Share (“EPS”) and 
Total Shareholders Return (“TSR”) performance criteria 
and subject to a maximum. For the 2009 awards, the 
TSR performance condition relates to the Company’s 
performance measured against a notional investment 
in all of the companies in the FTSE All Share General 
Retailers index over the three year period commencing 
1 April 2009.

The directors submit their report and audited financial 
statements of the Group and the Company for the year 
ended 31 March 2009.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activity of the Company is that of a 
holding company. The principal activity of its subsidiary 
undertakings is that of Internet retailing.
BUSINESS REVIEW AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The results for the year and the financial position of the 
Group are shown in the financial statements. Review of the 
business and future developments of the Group is within 
the Chief Executive’s statement and Finance Director’s 
review (pages 18 to 25).
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
There are a number of risks that face the Group in the 
course of conducting its business operations. Although not 
exhaustive, the following list highlights the principal issues:
Economic and market risks
The Group’s performance is directly impacted by the 
economic environment and competitor pricing. Consumer 
spending is integral to achieve sales growth. The Group 
strives to deliver value to all customers via investment in 
quality and price, alongside the development of extensive 
product ranges.
Competitive activity
Internet retailing is global and highly competitive. 
Competitive pressures are increasing in the United 
Kingdom, as high street retailers continue to extend their 
product offering not only in stores but to also incorporate 
online shopping. In order for the Company to remain 
competitive in the marketplace, a proactive approach is 
adopted to remain up to date with competitor activity and 
consumer trends.
Employee engagement and retention
At year end, the Group consists of 441 employees who 
are central to the Group’s success. In order for effective 
and efficient operations within the workplace, the Group 
relies on professional relationships amongst colleagues, 
and invests in staff training and development. The Group 
ensures employees are provided with conditions for fulfilling 
careers, through the employment policies, competitive 
remuneration and benefits packages it offers staff.
Health and safety 
The Group has programmes and policies in operation 
to supply team members and those with access to the 
Group’s facilities with orientation and training on safe 
workplace expectations and practices. There is no 
guarantee, however, that these practices are effectively 
performed in all circumstances.
Supply chain 
The Group exists within a complex supply chain. Much 
effort is placed on working with suppliers and the 
warehouse to manage potential risk of interruptions and 
delays in supply or distribution that may adversely impact 
on trade.
The Group has adopted the Ethical Trading Initiative (“ETI”) 
code of conduct which is extremely stringent on child 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 37

The Online Fashion Store
labour. We ensure that all new and existing suppliers meet 
our ethical policies and do not use any child labour.
Fraud 
The Group has to be constantly vigilant against fraudulent 
transactions which are a common occurrence within 
Internet retailing. Investment is placed in systems that 
monitor and control the impact of fraud, which if not 
managed correctly could be significant.
Compliance
The Group must comply with regulatory requirements 
especially in relation to employment, competition and 
environmental issues, planning, pensions and taxation 
legislation over the Company’s products and services. The 
Group adheres to strict compliance practices with regular 
audits and reviews, in addition to monitoring of regulatory 
developments.
IT systems and infrastructure 
To trade, the Group is dependent on its IT infrastructure. 
Significant impact on the business could result from a 
failure in these systems. Regular testing and updates are 
undertaken by the Group to ensure the continued integrity 
and efficiency of its systems.
Environmental, social and community issues 
In the next few months, we will take the responsibility 
of making a change in our work on climate and the 
environment. We are ambitious to reduce emissions in 
our distribution networks and are working on a plan to 
implement these changes. To provide best quality, choice 
and value for money for our customers, we need strong 
and constructive relationships with our suppliers. We 
will continue to monitor these relationships with existing 
suppliers and ensure that new suppliers meet our policies 
of fair trading. 
Research and development
The Group does not carry out research and development 
activities. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The audited financial statements for the 12 months to 31 
March 2009 are set out on pages 42 to 78. The Group 
profit after tax for the financial year was £10.0m (2008: 
£5.1m), which will be transferred to reserves. The directors 
do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2008: £nil). 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
No matter, which is material to the operations of the Group, 
has occurred between the Balance Sheet date and the 
date of approval of the financial statements.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have elected to prepare the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial statements 
are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
●  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
●  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
●  state that the financial statements comply with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; 
●  prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group will continue in business, in which case there 
should be supporting assumptions or qualifications 
as necessary. 
The directors confirm that they have complied with the 
above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website and legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
PAYMENT OF CREDITORS
It is the policy of the Group in respect of all its creditors, 
where reasonably practicable, to settle the payment with 
those creditors according to the terms formally agreed 
with them.
The creditor payment period for the Group throughout the 
financial year under review is 73 days (2008: 68 days).
The creditor payment period for the Company throughout 
the financial year under review is nil (2008: nil).

DONATIONS
During the year charitable donations totalling £26,560 
(2008: £3,950) were made by the Group. The majority of 
this donation was made to the Retail Trust. Retail Trust 
is the principal charity of the retail sector. They operate 
helplines to support advice and provide counselling to 
everyone working in or retired from the retail industry.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s policies on Market risk, Credit risk, Liquidity 
risk and Capital risk management have been considered in 
note 23. 
TREASURY SHARES
The ASOS.com Limited Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
was set up to satisfy awards granted under the ASOS 
Performance Share Plan and incentive scheme (PSP) 2006 
and the SAYE scheme 2008. The trustees of the plan are 
Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited and are resident 
in Jersey. Details of treasury shares held by the Group are 
shown in note 18 of the financial statements. 
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
The Company maintains liability insurance for its directors 
and officers, which is a qualifying third party indemnity 
provision for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006.
GOING CONCERN
The directors consider that the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources to remain in operation for 
the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The Group has a strong Balance Sheet with no 
external financing and a highly experienced management 
to help grow the business in future years. The Group will 
continue to benefit from a significant migration to online 
shopping enabling it to benefit from increased sales in the 
future. 
STATEMENT ON DISCLOSURE OF 
INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
The directors who held office at the date of the approval 
of this Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company auditors are unaware, and each director has 
taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a 
director to ensure the Board is aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company auditors are 
aware of that information. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution 
proposing their reappointment will be submitted to the

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared 
for and only for the Company’s members as a body in

to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by 
our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the financial statements. The information given in 
the Directors’ Report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chief Executive’s Statement and the 
Finance Director’s Review that is cross-referred from the 
Business Review section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not

BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements 
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we 
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
●  the Group financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 March 2009
1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ASOS PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in 
the United Kingdom.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated and Parent Company financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years 
presented unless otherwise stated.
A) BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern and 
historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
set out below.
The financial statements for both the Parent Company and the 
Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting 
Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as adopted by the 
European Union and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 and 
2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The directors 
have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 230 
of the Companies Act 1985 and have not presented an Income 
Statement for the Company alone.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in 
sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 
except where otherwise indicated.
RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective for 
2008/9 or issued and early adopted:
In preparing the Group financial statements for the current year, the 
Group has adopted the following new IFRS, amendments to IFRS 
and IFRIC Interpretations which have not had a significant impact on 
the results or net assets of the Group:
Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, 
effective from 1 July 2008. These amendments permit the 
reclassification of financial assets in particular circumstances. 
The adoption of the amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 has had 
no impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008. This interpretation 
applies to public sector service concession operators and explains 
how to account for the obligations undertaken and rights received 
in service concession arrangements. No member of the Group is an 
operator and hence the adoption of IFRIC 12 has had no impact on 
the results or net assets of the Group. 
Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective, 
but not expected to have a significant impact on the Group:
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009. This new standard replaces IAS 14 
‘Segment Reporting’ and requires segmental information to be 
presented on the same basis that management uses to evaluate 
performance of its reporting segments in its management reporting.
Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard has been revised 
to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to 
a qualifying asset. 
IFRIC 14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding 
Requirements and their Interaction’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009 as endorsed by the EU. 
This interpretation provides guidance on how to assess the limit 
on the amount of surplus in a defined benefit scheme that can be 
recognised as an asset under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.  49

The Online Fashion Store
1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008. This interpretation requires 
customer loyalty award credits to be accounted for as a separate 
component of the sales transaction in which they are granted 
and therefore part of the fair value of the consideration received is 
allocated to the award credits and deferred over the period that the 
award credits are fulfilled.
IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008.
IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners’, effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’, effective for transfers 
of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.
Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective 
and under review as to their impact on the Group:
Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Amendment to IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 July 2009.
Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and IAS 
1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ — Puttable Instruments 
and Instruments with Obligations Arising on Liquidation, effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’— Eligible hedged items, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRSs’ and IAS 27 
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ — Cost of an 
Investment of a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate, 
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009.
Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’ — Vesting Conditions 
and Cancellations, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009.
Amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, effective for 
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after 
the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 
1 July 2009.
B) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The financial statements consolidate the financial statements of 
ASOS PLC, all its subsidiaries, its joint venture and the Employee 
Benefit Trust made up to 31 March 2009. All intra-Group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation. 
Subsidiary companies are consolidated using the acquisition 
method of accounting and where a Company is accounted for as a 
subsidiary, uniform accounting policies are applied and the year ends 
are coterminous.
The Employee Benefit Trust is considered to be a Special Purpose 
Entity (SPE) where the substance of the relationship between the 
Group and the SPE indicates that the SPE is controlled by the Group 
— in substance, the activities of the Trust are being conducted on 
behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs in order 
to obtain benefits from its operation. On this basis, the assets held by 
the trust are consolidated into the Group’s financial statements.  www.asos.com

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 March 2009
1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
C) GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s share of net fair 
value of the acquired entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities at the 
date of acquisition.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually; any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
D) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable 
in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant 
and equipment to their estimated residual values, based on current 
prices at the Balance Sheet date, over their remaining useful lives by 
equal annual instalments. Assets in the course of construction are not 
depreciated. Residual values and useful lives are assessed at each 
Balance Sheet date.
The depreciation rates applicable are summarised as follows:
Plant and machinery 33% on cost 
Fixtures and fittings 20% on cost/over the lease term
Computer and telecoms equipment 33% on cost
Website maintenance costs are written off as they are incurred.
E) INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost, subject to 
review for impairment.
F) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. Employees of the Group receive part of their 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or 
rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) or in exchange for 
entitlements to cash payments based on the value of the shares (cash-
settled transactions). 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to 
be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the 
fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-
market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth 
targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each 
Balance Sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number 
of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the 
revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
The fair value of employee share option plan is calculated at the grant 
date using the Black–Scholes model. In accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share based payment’, the resulting cost is charged to the Group 
Income Statement over the vesting period. The value of the charge is 
adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. 
In accordance with IFRIC 11, ASOS.com is required to recognise 
share-based payment arrangements involving equity instruments 
for ASOS PLC where ASOS.com have remunerated those providing 
services to the entity in this way. In ASOS.com, the entity has 
recognised in equity a contribution from its parent equal to the amount 
at which the services provided are measured. 51

The Online Fashion Store
1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
G)  INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, 
on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis. Cost of purchase comprises the 
purchase price including import duties and other taxes, transport and 
handling costs and any other directly attributable costs less trade 
discounts. 
A provision is made for any slow-moving or obsolete stock. 
H) TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially 
at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment. A 
provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or 
delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. 
I) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Company and Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and 
short-term deposits.
J) TAXATION 
The tax expense included in the Group Income Statement consists of 
current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance 
Sheet date. Tax is recognised in the Group Income Statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in Equity, in 
which case it is recognised in the Statements of Changes in Equity.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, 
providing for all timing differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited to the Group Income Statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to Equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also recognised in Equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when 
there is a legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets 
against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these 
on a net basis. www.asos.com

1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
K) PENSION COSTS 
For certain employees, the Group contributes to their personal 
pension plans. The costs of these contributions are charged to the 
Income Statement in the year in which they become payable.
L) LEASED ASSETS
Rentals applicable to operating leases, where substantially all the 
benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor, are charged to 
the Income Statement over the period of the lease.
M) REVENUE
Revenue consists primarily of Internet and advertising sales as well as 
postage and packaging receipts. 
Internet sales are recorded net of returns, relevant vouchers, and 
value added tax and recognised when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. 
Advertising revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, net of value added tax. Revenue from 
advertising is recognised when the service is completed and the 
magazine is delivered to customers. 
The amount of revenue arising from sale of goods and provision of 
services has been disclosed in note 2 of the financial statements.
N) TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially 
at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
O) SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regard 
to the calculation of fair value of employee share options using the 
Black–Scholes model. The inputs and assumptions of the model are 
detailed in note 18.
Critical estimates and assumptions have also been made with regard 
to the stock provision to reflect the net realisable value of the stock 
held at the year end.
The criteria for recognition of the deferred tax assets are detailed in 
note 6.
P) SEGMENTAL REPORTING
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged 
in providing products or services that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of other business segments. 
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services 
within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of segments operating in other 
economic environments. 53

1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Q) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which 
is the Group’s functional and presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities 
are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. 
R) IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are 
not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually for 
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at 
the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill 
that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the 
impairment at each reporting date.
S) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following category: 
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for 
which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines 
the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 
12 months after the Balance Sheet date. These are classified as non-
current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade 
and other receivables” and cash and cash equivalents in the Balance 
Sheet. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that gives a residue interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
T) DIVIDEND INCOME
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment 
is established.
U) SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
V) SHARE PREMIUM 
The share premium account is used to record amounts received in 
excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of new shares.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 March 2009
1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
X) PROVISIONS
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group 
believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations 
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the 
lease. Where material, these obligations are discounted to their 
present value.
Other provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised 
for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an 
outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the 
class of obligations as a whole.
Y) JOINT VENTURE
An entity is treated as a joint venture where the Group holds a long-
term interest and shares control under a contractual agreement.
In the Group accounts the joint venture is accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting. The consolidated profit and loss 
account includes the Group’s share of the operating results, interest, 
pre-tax results and attributable taxation of such undertakings. In the 
Balance Sheet, the interest in joint ventures is shown as the Group’s 
share of net assets.
Z) TREASURY SHARES
The Group purchases shares on the market as part of the 
Performance Share Plan for directors (note 18). The investment held 
at year-end is reflected as a reduction of equity within the Group’s 
financial statements. The right to the shares is deemed to be an 
employee benefit and therefore is charged to the Income Statement 
over the vesting period. 55

b) Factors affecting the tax charge for the year  
The tax assessed for the year is higher (2008: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 28% (2008: 30%). The differences are 
explained below:
    2009  2008
    £’000 £’000
Profit before tax    14,125 7,311
Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the

Effects of:  
Expenses not deductible for taxation purposes    179 65
Over provision made in prior year    (18) —
    4,116 2,258
  
With effect from 1 April 2008, the statutory rate of corporation tax in the UK changed to 28% from 30%. Current taxation for the year ended 
31 March 2009 has therefore been calculated at a rate of 28%.

d) Deferred tax assets recognised
A deferred tax asset of £3,562,000 (2008: £2,876,000) has been recognised as the directors believe this amount is likely to be recovered in the 
foreseeable future. This asset arises from deferred tax on share-based payments less accelerated capital allowances. This asset will be recovered as 
share options are exercised. 
The Company has losses of £246,000 (2008: £246,000) which are available for offset against future taxable profits. These have not been recognised 
at the year end. 61

7) EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive share options.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the 
Group considers to have been earned.
The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following:
 2009 2008
  Potentially   Potentially
  dilutive share   dilutive share
 Basic options Diluted Basic options Diluted
Profit attributable to shareholders 
(continuing operations) (£’000) 10,009 — 10,009 5,053 — 5,053

Earnings per share 13.6p — 12.8p 6.9p — 6.6p
There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of the approval of these financial statements 
which would significantly change the earnings per share calculations shown above. www.asos.com

Carrying value at 31 March     1,060 1,060
 
Goodwill relates to the acquisition of ASOS.com Limited, a 100% subsidiary of ASOS PLC.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are any 
indications that the goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according 
to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
 Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated from 
cash flow projections for five years using data from the Group’s latest results and internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculation include growth rates, expected changes in margins and future changes in the market.
In March 2009 and 2008 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. Management determined that there has been no impairment in the current year.  63

Exercisable at the end of the year  4,344 46.1 3,928 32.5
Options were exercised on ten (2008: twelve) occasions throughout the year and the weighted average share price upon exercise was 248 pence 
(2008: 186 pence).
Options outstanding at 31 March 2009 are exercisable at prices ranging between 4.5 pence and 290 pence (2008: 4.5 pence and 232.50 pence) and 
have an average remaining contract life of 5.3 years (2008: 6.4 years) and a weighted average fair value of 33 pence (2008: 31.5 pence).
The fair value of share options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black–Scholes option pricing model. The inputs into the model are 
the risk-free interest rate at the date of grant which during the year ranged from 4.25% to 5.28% (2008: 4.25% to 5.28%); expected volatility of 35% 
(2008: 35%), the share price at the date of grant, the option life, and an expected exercise date of 50% of the life of the option.
Expected volatility was found using a historical volatility calculator and with reference to that of comparable companies.
Share options granted prior to 7 November 2002 fall outside the scope of IFRS 2 and therefore no charge has been recognised within the 
Income Statement. www.asos.com

ASOS Performance Share Plan
Under the rules of the ASOS Performance Share Plan (PSP) and subject to performance conditions, the PSP allows the directors to be awarded 
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.
Vesting of awards
Awards will normally vest on or following the third anniversary of grant once the committee has determined the extent to which the applicable 
performance conditions (see below) have been satisfied and provided that the participant is still employed in the Company’s Group.
The performance conditions will be structured such that the vesting of an award will be determined by the Company’s annual compound growth in 
normalised earnings per share (“EPS”) in excess of inflation (“RPI”) over a three year performance period commencing on the first day of the financial 
year in which the award is granted. 
For the initial awards the annual growth targets will be as set out in the table below:
Annual compound EPS growth of the Vesting percentage of the shares subject
Company over the performance period to an award
Less than RPI + 10% 0%
Equal to RPI + 10% 25%
Greater than or equal to RPI + 30% 100%
Between RPI + 10% and RPI + 30% Between 25% and 100% pro rata on a straight-line basis
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance conditions applying to existing awards at any given time if an event occurs which causes 
the Committee to consider it appropriate to amend them, provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the amended conditions are not materially 
less challenging to achieve in the changed circumstances than those originally set.
The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions each time awards are granted and may impose different performance conditions 
for subsequent awards, provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the different performance conditions are not materially less challenging in light 
of the Company’s circumstances than those set for the initial awards. www.asos.com

The SAYE scheme commenced on 1 July 2008. Options were granted on two occasions. The first issue was on 19 July 2008 at 283.2p and the 
second issue was made on 7 January 2009 at 207.4p.
The scheme will run for three years and eligible employees can contribute between £50 and £250 a month. On maturity, the employee has the option 
to buy the shares in the Company at a discount of 20% on the share price as at the commencement of the scheme.
The accounting for the SAYE scheme is in accordance with IFRS2 Share-based payments. The fair value of the employees services received in 
exchange for the grant of the option is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. The vesting period is three years, the length of the scheme.
The fair value of share options granted is calculated at a discount of 20% on the market value at the date of grant using a Black–Scholes option 
pricing model. The inputs into the model are the risk-free interest rate at the date of grant which during the year ranged from 2.81% to 4.9%; 
expected volatility of 35%.

22) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash, trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from operations. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is the funding of the Group’s trading activities. It has been the Group’s policy throughout the year under 
review that no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The only financial asset of the Group is cash at bank and in hand which is denominated in sterling. The US dollar and euro bank accounts 
have been retranslated to sterling at the closing spot rate on the 31 March 2009. The balance at 31 March 2009 was £13,586,727 
(31 March 2008: £10,369,000).

Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. www.asos.com

23) FINANCIAL RISKS
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of the financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group does not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge 
all risk exposures. The Group has future plans to use derivative financial instruments to hedge against foreign exchange volatility.
(a) Market risk 
(i) Foreign exchange
The Group operates internationally and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the euro and US dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.
(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in 
market interest rates.
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing borrowings, the Group is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk arises through credit exposure to customers and Group companies and also with banks with which cash is held.
Management have a credit control process. As the majority of the Group’s advertising customers are large companies with which the Group has a 
long-standing relationship, the risk of default is considered to be low and write-offs due to bad debts are extremely low.
Management consider the risk of default of Group debtors to be negligible.
The Group ensures that deposits are only placed with banks which have a minimum credit rating of AA (Standard and Poor’s rating).
(c) Liquidity risk
Management are responsible for managing the Group’s liquidity. Sufficient funds need to be available to meet business needs as and when they arise. 
Once all business needs have been met, any surplus cash will be invested in daily deposit accounts with the Group’s bank.
(d) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to provide returns for their shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining strong credit rating and headroom while 
optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. The Group manages its capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Company. 79

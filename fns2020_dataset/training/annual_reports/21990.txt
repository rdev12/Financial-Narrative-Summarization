Brooks Macdonald Group plc
I am pleased to report another 
successful year for Brooks 
Macdonald, achieved despite 
turbulent market conditions.
On a turnover 30 per cent higher at £21.8 
million, we report a pre-tax profit of £3.18 
million compared with £2.03 million in the 
previous financial year, an increase of 57 per 
cent. Earnings per share were 22.56p, an 
increase of 82 per cent. 
Funds under management at 30 June 2009 
stood at £1,386 million, compared with 
£1,181 million a year earlier, an increase of 
17 per cent. We are particularly pleased to 
have grown our funds under management 
during a period when markets globally have 
been so challenged.
The Board has decided to recommend a 
dividend of 5.5p per share, compared with 
3.5p for the previous financial year.
In April we opened an office in Tunbridge 
Wells which has got off to a good start and 
which will be expanded by the acquisition 
of Lawrence House, the Kent fund manager 
which we recently announced. We have also 
announced the opening of an office in 
Edinburgh which together with the 
recruitment of a senior team further 
expands our regional presence.
Staff retention has always been a hallmark of 
Brooks Macdonald. With the increase in the 
number of our staff, the board believes that 
it is appropriate to increase the amount of 
share capital over which options can be 
granted from 10 to 15 per cent. 
Shareholders will be asked to approve this 
increase at the AGM on 16 October.
The continued expansion of our business in 
a period of economic uncertainty and 
market volatility reflects a robust investment 
process, our emphasis on client service and 
the strength of our relationships with 
intermediaries and other introducers. It also 
reflects the professionalism and dedication 
of our staff to whom I record my thanks.

Chairman

Chief Executive’s Review
This has been a strong year of 
growth for the group in spite of 
poor market conditions. In the first 
half of the financial year equity 
markets in particular faced sharp 
declines and whilst the economic 
position has improved (from a 
very low base) in the second half, 
sentiment still remains fragile. 
Against this backdrop it is 
therefore particularly pleasing to 
be able to report robust growth in 
the business.
Funds under management rose from £1,181 
million in June 2008 to £1,386 million, a rise 
of 17.4 per cent. It is a measure of 
investment performance, service levels and 
marketing success that this increase 
compares favourably to the APCIMS 
Balanced Index that fell 13.84 per cent over 
the year and the FTSE100 that was down 
22.5 per cent. Our strategy is based on 
multiple avenues of growth and I believe 
this puts the group in a strong position 
going forward. We have since the year-end 
announced the purchase of Lawrence House 
Fund Managers, the first acquisition 
undertaken by the group. Clearly the price 
has to be right for both sides but equally 
important are synergies and ‘fit’ and I am 
confident that Lawrence House will add to 
the group in all regards. 
Our regional presence has also increased 
over the year. Our offices in Winchester and 
Manchester have both had strong inflows of 
funds and clients and our most recent office 
outside London, in Tunbridge Wells, has got 
off to a very solid start. In addition we have 
opened an office in Edinburgh this month, 
which is another very exciting opportunity 
for the group. 
In London, our main office, growth remains 
strong and the five fund management 
teams have all shown growth in funds under 
management and the number of clients. In 
addition Financial Consulting and our 
central services have all recruited over the 
financial year. This is imperative as a key 
component of our growth is ensuring that 
we deliver service and performance in equal 
measure to our clients. Financial Consulting 
continues to be an important part of our 
wealth management proposition for private 
clients as well as our employee benefit 
service to corporate clients.
We continue to invest in improving our 
service delivery to clients. We have a highly 
skilled development team, who are 
constantly challenged with improving 
processes and systems. Over the last year 
they have established several third party 
data feeds and technological improvements 
to information systems. In addition we have 
recruited a Service Development Manager 
to head all project work. 
“Our strategy is based on 
multiple avenues for growth 
and I believe this has held us 
in good stead historically and 
puts the group in a strong 
position going forward.“

Chief Executive’s Review
Investment performance in relative terms 
has been strong. Credit needs to be paid to 
our asset allocation committee and indeed 
the individual fund management teams who 
have avoided the major financial ‘landmines’ 
that have been exposed over the last year.
Our two principal services in Asset 
Management are discretionary fund 
management for high net worth clients and 
our discretionary Managed Portfolio Service, 
a fund of funds service for smaller clients. The 
latter is still a relatively new service but has 
grown considerably and has been a 
significant factor, together with our four 
Strategic Alliances, towards our strong profits 
and funds under management growth.
We continue to work closely with the top 
end of the IFA market and professional 
introducers. We have expanded our new 
business development team in all our offices 
as this is a sector to which we remain firmly 
committed. The recently announced Retail 
Distribution Review is encouraging and 
indeed supportive of this strategy as well as 
our own Financial Consultancy company.
In spite of recent, in our opinion poor, 
changes to pension legislation, our growth 
in SIPPs continues unabated. Indeed since 
the changes announced by the Chancellor 
in April, over 50 per cent of our new 
business has continued to be the 
management of SIPPs.
None of the above would have been 
possible without the energy, commitment 
and drive of all members of staff. We are in 
a privileged position of having a very strong 
team at all levels, to whom I extend my 
thanks. Staff numbers have grown to 140 
and I am pleased to state that in spite of 
considerable growth the firm remains a 
vibrant, open and fun place to work. 
The group has had a strong year in both 
absolute and relative terms. We have a strong 
balance sheet, team, client bank, distribution 
and investment model and thus we can 
continue to look forward with confidence.

Risks and uncertainties 
The principal risks and uncertainties that face the group are:
Financial risks
The group’s principal financial risks and the measures and policies 
for the management of those risks are set out in note 24 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Non– financial risks
The significant non-financial risks faced by group are as follows:
Reputational risk
The group has a growing reputation as provider of high quality 
investment and wealth management services. There is a risk that 
significant damage to reputation could lead to the loss of existing 
clients as well as impacting on the ability to gain new clients which 
would lead to a fall in financial income. 
Such risk could lead to negative publicity arising from reasons such 
as poor investment performance or client service or regulatory 
censure. This risk is minimised by ensuring the group maintains a 
culture of high ethical and professional standards whilst focussing 
on delivering a first class service to all of our clients. The group 
maintains an independent compliance department which ensures 
conformity with the regulations of the Financial Services Authority 
as well as relevant statute in all of our dealings with our clients. This 
compliance function is monitored by the compliance committee of 
the group board.
Regulatory risk
The sector in which the group operates is heavily regulated and any 
breach of regulations could lead to fines or disciplinary action 
against the group or its staff. The group monitors actual and 
impending changes in regulations in order to assess the impact on 
the business and to ensure that the group has sufficient resources to 
implement any necessary changes. 
Competition risk
Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss of existing 
clients due to poor performance, failure to respond to changes in 
the market place, or the loss of key investment professionals. To 
minimise this risk, the group continues to invest in its employees 
and monitors developments in the marketplace in which it operates 
to ensure that the group continues to offer a wide range of services. 
Recruitment policies are designed to attract high quality staff and 
the group regularly reviews and benchmarks its remuneration 
packages and contractual arrangements in order to retain and 
motivate staff. A dedicated training manager provides structured 
training plans in order to ensure all staff continue to develop their 
careers within the group.
Technology risk
A key part of the high quality service delivered to clients is facilitated 
by a flexible and robust IT infrastructure.
New IT projects are regularly reviewed and appraised at board 
meetings in order to ensure that the group continues to develop  
its IT capabilities. As well as our offices in Winchester, Manchester, 
Tunbridge Wells and most recently Edinburgh providing back up 
facilities we have a disaster recovery site based at Heathrow. 
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk that the group suffers a loss resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or 
from external events. The group’s policy to minimise these risks is to 
continuously monitor and review the controls in place to ensure 
these are adequate for the risks involved.

The directors are responsible for preparing the directors’ report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements for the group in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union and for the company in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (UK GAAP). In accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union the group financial statements must present fairly 
the financial position and performance of the group. In accordance 
with UK GAAP, the company financial statements must present fairly 
the financial position and performance of the company. Under 
company law directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	
consistently;
•	 	 make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	are	reasonable	
and prudent;
•	 	 state	whether	the	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	in	
accordance with an applicable accounting framework;
•	 	 prepare	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concern	basis	
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and 
group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of the financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities Annual Report & Accounts 2009
11
Brooks Macdonald Group plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 which 
comprise the consolidated income statement, consolidated balance 
sheet, consolidated cash flow statement, consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Sections 495-496 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 10, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the 
group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
	•	 	 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	group’ s	affairs	 
as at 30 June 2009 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•	 	 have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	IFRSs	as	
adopted by the European Union; and
•	 	 have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
•	 	 certain	disclosures	of	directors’	remuneration	specified	by	law	
are not made; or
•	 	 we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Brooks Macdonald Group plc for the year ended  
30 June 2009.

General information
Brooks Macdonald Group plc is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied 
consistently to all the years presented unless otherwise stated. 
1. Principal accounting policies
(a) Accounting conventions
  The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.  
The group has adopted all new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee that are relevant to the group’s operations and effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning 1 July 2008. There have been no new standards adopted in the year that have had an effect on the entity. 
 (b) Standards and interpretations which become effective in future periods 
  The group has not decided to early adopt the following standards and interpretations, and revisions to existing standards and interpretations. 
Although relevant, they are not expected to have a material impact on the group’s results, financial position and disclosures unless otherwise noted:
  IAS 1 – “Presentation of Financial Statements” (Revised) effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amendment 
to the standard requires the preparation of a statement of comprehensive income either to replace or to complement the current income 
statement. In addition, restatements or reclassifications of comparative balance sheet information will include a restatement of the opening 
balance sheet of the comparative period. There are also terminology changes.
  IFRS 2 – “Share-based payments” effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amendments clarify that vesting conditions 
comprise only service conditions and performance conditions, and specifies the accounting treatment for a failure to meet a non-vesting condition.
   IFRS 3 – “Business Combinations” (Revised) effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The revised standard introduces a 
number of changes in the accounting for business combinations that impact on the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the 
period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results. The effect on the financial statements will depend on the incidence and timing of 
future changes in the group.
  IAS27 – “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” (Amendments) effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.  
The amendments provide new guidance on accounting changes in the interests in subsidiaries. The effect on the financial statements will depend 
on the incidence and timing of future changes in the group.
  IFRS 7 – “Financial Instruments Disclosures” effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Amendments relating to the 
reclassification of financial assets. This will require greater detail about certain types of financial instruments which if applicable to the group will 
require additional disclosure.
   IFRS 8 – “Operating Segments” effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. This standard replaces IAS 14 “Segment 
Reporting” and will require a change in the disclosure of segmental information.
  There are a number of other standards and interpretations, and revisions to existing standards and interpretations, including the improvements 
project, in issue but not in force at 30 June 2009. These are not considered likely to have a material impact on the group’s financial statements. 
(c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
  The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of 
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions which, are 
based on management’s best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original 
estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. The areas where a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity arise, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements in particular are 
revenue and share based payments and are discussed below.
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Report & Accounts 2009

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
1. Principal accounting policies – continued
(d) Business combinations
  The group’s financial statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of the parent company (Brooks Macdonald Group plc) and its 
subsidiaries. The underlying financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using 
consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company and control exists when the company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of the subsidiaries 
are included from the date on which control is transferred to the group to the date that control ceases.
 All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
  The group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 and has decided not to apply IFRS 3 to business combinations prior to the date  
of transition to IFRS.
(e) Revenue
 Revenue recognition
  Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable from clients for services provided by the group, net of discounts  
and VAT, after eliminating sales within the group. Revenue is recognised as follows:
 Provision of services
  Fees and commissions receivable and payable are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are provided. Provision is made 
for all foreseeable future losses.
 Interest 
  Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through  
the expected life of the financial instrument) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
(f) Cash and cash equivalents 
  Cash comprises cash in hand and cash on demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty. Cash equivalents comprise short term 
highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
(g) Share based payments
  The group provides equity and cash settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees.  
The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the 
grant. The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over 
the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity or accruals depending on the nature of the scheme.
  The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option,  
the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the company’s share price over the life of the option/award and 
other relevant factors.
  The group also operates a phantom cash settled share based scheme. On the grant date, the liability incurred is measured at fair value.  
The liability is re-measured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised  
in the profit and loss account. 
(h) Segmental reporting 
  A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different 
from those of other business segments. Direct costs are allocated to the segment that generated the cost. Indirect costs are allocated to 
reporting segments so as to reflect the proportion of the cost that each segment has generated, on a pro-rata basis.

1. Principal accounting policies – continued
(i) Fiduciary activities 
  The group commonly acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, 
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as 
they are not assets of the group.
  The group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority. Such monies 
and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the balance sheet as the group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
(j) Property, plant and equipment
  Property, plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
  Provision is made for depreciation on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated 
residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows:
 Fixtures and fittings   15% per annum
 Equipment   20% per annum
  The assets’ residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included in the income statement.
(k) Intangible assets
  Intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged 
to profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset. The estimated useful life is five years.
(l) Financial assets 
  The group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables which are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted on an active market. 
(m) Provisions
  Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of 
economic benefits that can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle 
the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
(n) Foreign currency translation
  The group’s functional and presentation currency is sterling. Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at 
the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the translation of period end 
monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
(o) Retirement benefit costs
 Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution retirement scheme are charged to the income statement as they fall due.

1. Principal accounting policies – continued
(p) Taxation 
  Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
  Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the group financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on its tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
(q) Trade receivables 
  Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. Doubtful debts are 
provided for when the collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written off when identified.
(r) Operating lease payments 
  Rents due under operating leases are charged to income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The group benefited from 
a rent-free period under the terms of the current property lease. The benefit is being allocated over the shorter of the lease term and the date of 
the market review specified in the lease. During the rent-free period a rental charge has been recognised in the income statement and accrued 
as a liability in the balance sheet.

2. Segmental information
For the purposes of reporting under IAS14 (Segment Reporting), the group’s activities are split into two operating divisions, investment management 
and financial planning. The group’s other activity, offering nominee and custody services to clients, has been included within investment 
management. These divisions are the basis on which the group reports its primary segmental information.
Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction. Revenues and expenses that are not directly originated 
by a business segment are reported as unallocated. Centrally incurred expenses are allocated to business segments on an appropriate pro-rata basis. 
Segmental assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and liabilities, being the majority of the balance sheet.

(d) Share option schemes
Following its admission to AiM the company set up two share option schemes, a Sharesave Scheme 2005 and an Enterprise Management Incentive 
(EMI) Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme enables all eligible employees to participate in a scheme whereby they enter into a savings contract for a period of three 
years. At the end of the three years they receive a bonus payment and the right to subscribe for a number of ordinary shares at the option price up 
to the maximum value of their savings contract. 
The EMI scheme is an incentive scheme used by the company to offer share options to key employees and directors of the group as a part of their 
remuneration package in addition to their basic pay, performance bonus and other benefits. The share options granted under the EMI scheme are 
subject to performance conditions being met by the company.
Grants of EMI share options to employees and directors of the group which when in total exceed the limits of the scheme form unapproved share 
options which are subject to the same rules and performance conditions of the EMI scheme (note 18).
During the financial year, group started a phantom share option scheme, which is a cash settled scheme, details of which are given in note 14.

Included in accruals and deferred income is an accrual of £188,978 (2008: £nil) in respect of a phantom share option scheme, which was approved 
by the group’s directors in October 2008. The scheme is a cash settled plan and the payments made to participants in respect of awards are in the 
form of cash. The phantom scheme is awarded at no cost to the participants. The amount that is ultimately paid to the participants of the scheme is 
equal to the increase in market value of the ordinary shares determined after a three year vesting period. The awards will be vested after three years 
only to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.

(b) Share options - equity based
The company operates an Employee Sharesave Scheme open to all employees and an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme. Under the schemes 
certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the company at prices ranging from 140p to 291p. Options are conditional on the employee 
completing three years’ service and are exercisable three years from grant date. The options have a contractual term of between three and ten years 
depending on the scheme. The company has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.

The options granted under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme and the phantom scheme (note 14) were 
valued on the basis of market prices at the time the options were granted and were calculated using the Black Scholes method with a 15% volatility, on an 
historic price, covering the period to exercise cessation date. The expected volatility was estimated on the basis of the share price history subsequent to 
flotation. The risk free interest rate was assessed as the yield on gilt edged security with a maturity term of 10 years. The options were valued at prices up 
to £2.91 per share, the charge for the year being £189,622 (2008: £237,969).The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at the end 
of the year was 4.39 years (2008: 4.93 years). The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for options exercised during the period was £2.70.

24. Financial risk management 
The group offers a range of services to private clients, family and charitable trusts and corporate clients. The group uses non-retail funding 
instruments to invest in liquid asset balances and to manage the risks arising from its operations. The group classifies its financial assets as loans and 
receivables which are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
The group has a formal structure for managing risk, including established risk lines, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures. The 
structure is reviewed regularly. The group does not use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
(a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due.
The primary objective of the group’s treasury policy is to manage short–term liquidity requirements and to ensure that the group maintains a surplus 
of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met. 
The table below presents the cash flows receivable by the group under non-derivative financial assets.

Cash and balances at bank   8,347,287
   On demand 
At 30 June 2008   £
Cash and balances at bank   5,923,712
(b) Market risk
Interest rate risk 
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Cash 
and cash equivalents are invested in short term cash deposits with maturities of no greater than three months. The effect of a 100 basis points 
increase/decrease in interest rates would, have £83,000 (2008: £59,000) impact on the pre-tax profits and equity.
Foreign exchange risk
The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and, therefore, no foreign exchange risk analysis is provided.
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than 
those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk). The group is not exposed to price risk.
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

24. Financial risk management – continued
Credit risk
The group invests some of its surplus funds in highly liquid market instruments. Such investments have a maturity no greater than three months. The 
difference between the book and the fair value of these instruments is not significant. To reduce the risk of a counterparty default the group deposits 
the rest of its funds in approved high quality banks. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.

Neither past due nor impaired  701,945 769,624
No external credit ratings are acquired with regard to the trade receivables as collateral is held by the group in excess of the total value of the receivables.
25. Capital management 
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves. Total capital at 30 June 2009 was £8,079,000 
(2008: £5,844,923). Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK.
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the FSA, to safe guard the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a strong 
capital base to support the development of the business.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the group’s management. 
26. Guarantees 
During the year the company undertook a guarantee to the Royal Bank of Scotland to guarantee settlement for trading with CREST stock on behalf 
of clients. The company holds client assets to fund such trading activity.

100% of the issued share capital of Lawrence House Fund Managers Limited for an initial cash consideration of £1.07 million with a subsequent 
amount payable in 24 months subject to various conditions.
Lawrence House manages around £65 million of funds including an OEIC with three sub funds and the operation of the business will be transferred 
to our Tunbridge Wells office from its current base in Canterbury.
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

We have audited the parent company financial statements of Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 which comprise 
the parent company balance sheet, and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Sections 495-496 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors‘ responsibilities 
on page 10, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
•	 	 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	company’ s	affairs	at	 
30 June 2009
•	 	 have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	United	Kingdom	
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 	 have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 	 the	information	given	in	the	directors’	report	for	the	financial	year	
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 	 adequate	accounting	records	have	not	been	kept	by	the	parent	
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•	 	 the	parent	company	financial	statements	are	not	in	agreement	with	
the accounting records and returns; or
•	 	 certain	disclosures	of	directors’	remuneration	specified	by	law	are	
not made; or
•	 	 we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	
require for our audit.

29. Principal accounting policies
(a) Basis of accounting
  The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. They have been drawn up to comply with applicable 
accounting standards within the United Kingdom. 
  The company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by FRS 29 not to present the disclosures required by that standard relating to 
the financial risks in the company’s solus accounts.
  The principal accounting policies of the company are set out below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year and preceding year.
(b) Investments in subsidiary companies 
 Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions for impairment.
(c) Deferred taxation
  Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date, at rates that are expected to 
apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. 
  Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in 
which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
(d) Share based payments
  The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 “Share-Based Payments” and has adopted the requirements of UITF 44. Equity settled 
share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the equity settled share based instrument is expensed on a straight line basis 
over the vesting period based on the number of shares that will eventually vest.
(e) Operating lease payments
  Rents due under operating leases are charged to income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The group benefited from 
a rent-free period under the terms of the current property lease. In accordance with UITF 28 Operating Leases Incentives, the benefit is being 
allocated over the shorter of the lease term and the date of the market review specified in the lease. During the rent-free period a rental charge 
has been recognised in the income statement and accrued as a liability in the balance sheet.
(f) Retirement benefit costs
 Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution retirement scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
30. Loss/(2008 profit) for the year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc reported loss after tax for the financial year ended 30 June 2009 of £591,438 (2008: profit £1,686,957)
Auditors’ remuneration for audit and other services to the company are set out in note four.
The average number of employees during the year was seven (2008: seven).
Directors’ emoluments are set out in note five.

Notes to the Company accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2009

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Enclosed with this document is a notice convening the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company for 16 October 2009. This explanatory note 
gives further information on resolutions numbered 2 to 10 set out in the 
notice of AGM.
Resolution 2 – To declare a final dividend
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 5.5 pence per Ordinary Share. 
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 23 
October 2009 to shareholders on the register on 25 September 2009.
Resolutions 3 and 4 – To re-elect Richard Spencer and  
Nicholas Lawes
The Company’s Articles of Association state that one third of the Directors 
shall retire from office at each Annual General Meeting and offer 
themselves for re-election. In addition, any Director who has been in office 
for more than three years since their last appointment or re-appointment 
should also retire and may offer themselves for re-election.
Information on each of the Directors standing for re-election is set out 
below. The Chairman confirms that Richard Spencer and Nicholas Lawes 
have extensive relevant experience of the Group and its business. The 
Board is therefore of the opinion that Richard Spencer and Nicholas 
Lawes should be re-elected to the Board.
Richard Spencer (46), Investment Director, was one of the founding 
directors of the Company and in addition to his role as Investment Director 
he is responsible for the investment management process and research as 
well as managing one of the London asset management teams.
Nicholas Lawes (46), Executive Director, has management responsibility 
for financial consulting on the Group board and has board responsibility 
for compliance. Nicholas joined Brooks Macdonald in 2003 and he has 
over twenty years experience developing strategies for high net worth 
individuals and families to manage their wealth. 
Resolution 5 – To re-appoint Moore Stephens LLP as auditors
This Resolution proposes that Moore Stephens LLP should be re-
appointed as the Company’s auditors and authorises the Directors to 
determine their remuneration.
Resolution 6 – Authority to allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 prevents directors from allotting unissued 
shares without the authority of shareholders in general meeting. In 
certain circumstances this could be unduly restrictive. The Directors’ 
existing authority to allot shares, which was granted at the Annual 
General Meeting held in 2008, will expire at the end of this year’s 
Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 6 in the notice of Annual General Meeting will be proposed, as 
an ordinary resolution, to authorise the directors to allot Ordinary Shares 
of 1 pence each in the capital of the Company up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £33,300 (ie. up to 3,330,000 Ordinary Shares) representing 
approximately 33% of the Ordinary Shares in issue on 23 September 
2009. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury.
The authority conferred by this Resolution will expire on the date which 
is fifteen months after the passing of this Resolution or, if sooner, at the 
end of next year’s Annual General Meeting.
The Directors have no present plans to allot unissued shares other than 
on the exercise of share options under the Company’s employee share 
option schemes. However, the Directors believe it to be in the best 
interests of the Company that they should continue to have this 
authority so that such allotments can take place to finance appropriate 
business opportunities that may arise.
Resolution 7 – To disapply pre-emption rights
Unless they are given an appropriate authority by shareholders, if the 
Directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares for cash or grant rights 
over shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than pursuant to an 
employee share scheme) they must first offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This is known as 
pre-emption rights.
The existing disapplication of these statutory pre-emption rights, which 
was granted at the Annual General Meeting held in 2008, will expire at 
the end of this year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Resolution 7 
in the notice of annual general meeting will be proposed, as a special 
resolution, to give the directors power to allot shares without the 
application of these statutory pre-emption rights: first, in relation to offers 
of equity securities by way of rights issue, open offer or similar 
arrangements; and second, in relation to the allotment of equity securities 
for cash up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of £5,000 (i.e. up 
to 500,000 Ordinary Shares) (representing approximately 5% of the 
Ordinary Shares in issue on 23 September 2009).
The authority sought and limits set by this Resolution will also apply to a 
sale by the Company of any shares it holds as treasury shares. The 
Treasury Share Regulations allow shares purchased by the Company out 
of distributable profits to be held as treasury shares, which may then be 
cancelled, sold for cash or used to meet the Company’s obligations 
under its employee share based incentive schemes. Any subsequent 
transfers of treasury shares by the Company to satisfy the requirements 
of employee share-based incentive schemes will be counted towards the 
anti-dilution limits for such share issues to the extent required by the 
Association of British Insurers guidelines.

The power conferred by this Resolution will expire on the date which 
falls fifteen months after the passing of this Resolution or, if sooner, at 
the end of next year’s Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 8 – Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
Resolution 8 in the notice of Annual General Meeting, which will be 
proposed as a special resolution, will authorise the Company to make 
market purchases of up to 1,000,000 Ordinary Shares. The existing 
authority to make market purchases of Ordinary Shares, which was 
granted at the Annual General Meeting held in 2008, will expire at the 
end of this year’s Annual General Meeting.
The number of Ordinary Shares stated in this Resolution equals 
approximately 10% of the Company’s Ordinary Shares in issue on 23 
September 2009. The minimum price that may be paid is the nominal 
value of an Ordinary Share (i.e. 1 pence), and the maximum price shall 
not exceed 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for 
an Ordinary Share for the five business days before each purchase is 
made (exclusive of expenses).
The authority conferred by this Resolution will expire on the date which 
falls fifteen months after the passing of this Resolution or, if sooner, at 
the end of next year’s Annual General Meeting.
The Directors are committed to managing the Company’s capital 
effectively. Although the Directors have no plans to make such purchases, 
buying back the Company’s Ordinary Shares is one of the options they 
keep under review. Purchases would only be made after considering the 
effect on earnings per share, and the benefits for shareholders generally.
The Company may hold in treasury any of its own shares that it purchases 
pursuant to the Treasury Share Regulations and the authority conferred by 
this Resolution. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue 
treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the 
Company with greater flexibility in the management of its capital base.
Resolution 9 – Adoption of new articles of association
Resolution 9 in the notice of Annual General Meeting, which will be 
proposed as a special resolution, is to adopt new articles of association 
(the “New Articles”) in order to update the Company’s current articles of 
association (the “Current Articles”) primarily to take account of changes in 
English company law brought about by the Companies Act 2006. 
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised in 
the Appendix. Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying 
nature and also some more minor changes which merely reflect changes 
made by the Companies Act 2006 have not been noted in the Appendix. 
A clean copy of the New Articles, together with a copy of the New Articles 
marked up to show all the proposed changes to the Current Articles, are 
available for inspection at the Company’s Registered Office.
Resolution 10 – Amendments to share option schemes
Resolution 10 in the notice of Annual General Meeting, which will be 
proposed as an ordinary resolution, is to increase the maximum dilution 
limits for options granted under the Company’s employee share schemes.
The Company has operated an Enterprise Management Incentive 
Scheme (“EMI Scheme”) and a Save As You Earn Scheme (“SAYE 
Scheme”) since its admission to AiM in March 2005. The maximum 
dilution limit for all employee share schemes operated in relation to the 
Company’s shares will be increased from 10% to 15% (in any ten year 
period). The maximum dilution limit for discretionary schemes shall be 
increased from 5% to 10%.
This authority is being sought because there is currently insufficient 
headroom remaining under the EMI Scheme and the SAYE Scheme to 
grant enough options to fulfil the Company’s remuneration and 
incentive strategy over the next 24 months.

APPENDIX
Explanatory notes of the principal changes to the Company’s articles of 
association
1 Articles which duplicate statutory provisions
  Provisions in the Current Articles which replicate provisions 
contained in the Companies Act 2006 are in the main to be 
removed in the New Articles to bring them into line with the 
Companies Act 2006. This is in line with the approach advocated 
by the Government that statutory provisions should not be 
duplicated in a company’s constitution. Certain examples of such 
provisions include provisions as to the form of resolutions, the 
variation of class rights, the requirement to keep accounting 
records and provisions regarding the period of notice required to 
convene general meetings. The main changes made to reflect this 
approach are detailed below.
2 Form of resolution
  The Current Articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose 
an ordinary resolution is required, a special or extraordinary 
resolution is also effective and that, where an extraordinary 
resolution is required, a special resolution is also effective. This 
provision is being amended as the concept of extraordinary 
resolutions has not been retained under the Companies Act 2006. 
3 Variation of class rights
  The Current Articles contain provisions regarding the variation of 
class rights. The proceedings and specific quorum requirements for a 
meeting convened to vary class rights are contained in the 
Companies Act 2006. The relevant provisions have therefore been 
amended in the New Articles.
4 Convening extraordinary and annual general meetings
  The provisions in the Current Articles dealing with the convening of 
general meetings and the length of notice required to convene 
general meetings are being amended to conform to new provisions 
in the Companies Act 2006. In particular a general meeting to 
consider a special resolution, other than an annual general meeting, 
can be convened on 14 days’ notice whereas previously 21 days’ 
notice was required.
5 Votes of members
  Under the Companies Act 2006 proxies are entitled to vote on a 
show of hands whereas under the Current Articles proxies are only 
entitled to vote on a poll. The time limits for the appointment or 
termination of a proxy appointment have been altered by the 
Companies Act 2006 so that the articles cannot provide that they 
should be received more than 48 hours before the meeting or in 
the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after the meeting, 
more than 24 hours before the time for the taking of a poll, with 
weekends and bank holidays being permitted to be excluded for 
this purpose. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that 
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a 
different share held by the shareholder. Multiple corporate 
representatives may be appointed (but if they purport to exercise 
their rights in different ways, then the power is treated as not being 
exercised). The New Articles reflect all of these new provisions.
6 Conflicts of interest
  The Companies Act 2006 sets out directors’ general duties which 
largely codify the existing law but with some changes. Under the 
Companies Act, a director must avoid a situation where he has, or 
can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may 
conflict, with the company’s interests. The requirement is very 
broad and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a 
director of another company or a trustee of another organisation. 
The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where 
the articles of association contain a provision to this effect. The 
Companies Act 2006 also allows the articles of association to 
contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of 
interest to avoid a breach of duty. The New Articles give the 
directors authority to approve such situations and to include other 
provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar 
way to the current position.
  There are safeguards which will apply when directors decide 
whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, only 
directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will 
be able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the 
decision the directors must act in a way they consider, in good 
faith, will be most likely to promote the company’s success. The 
directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving 
authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
  The New Articles also contain provisions relating to confidential 
information, attendance at board meetings and availability of board 
papers to protect a director being in breach of duty if a conflict of 
interest or potential conflict of interest arises. These provisions will 
only apply where the position giving rise to the potential conflict 
has previously been authorised by the directors. It is the Board’s 
intention to report annually on the Company’s procedures for 
ensuring that the Board’s powers of authorisation of conflicts are 
operated effectively and that the procedures have been followed.

Appendix Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

7 Notice of board meetings
  Under the Current Articles, when a director is abroad he can 
request that notice of directors’ meetings are sent to him at a 
specified address and if he does not do so he is not entitled to 
receive notice while he is away. This provision has been removed, as 
modern communications mean that there may be no particular 
obstacle to giving notice to a director who is abroad. It has been 
replaced with a more general provision that a director is treated as 
having waived his entitlement to notice, unless he supplies the 
Company with the information necessary to ensure that he receives 
notice of a meeting before it takes place.
8 Records to be kept
  The provision in the Current Articles requiring the Board to keep 
accounting records has been removed as this requirement is 
contained in the Companies Act 2006.
9 Distribution of assets 
  The Current Articles contain provisions dealing with the distribution 
of assets in kind in the event of the Company going into liquidation. 
These provisions have been removed in the New Articles on the 
grounds that a provision about the powers of liquidators is a matter 
for insolvency law rather than the articles and that the Insolvency Act 
1986 confers powers on the liquidator which would enable it to do 
what is envisaged by the Current Articles.
10 Electronic and web communications
  Provisions of the Companies Act 2006 which came into force in 
January 2007 enable companies to communicate with members by 
electronic and/or website communications. The New Articles 
continue to allow communications to members in electronic form 
and, in addition, they also permit the Company to take advantage 
of the new provisions relating to website communications. Before 
the Company can communicate with a member by means of 
website communication, the relevant member must be asked 
individually by the Company to agree that the Company may send 
or supply documents or information to him by means of a website, 
and the Company must either have received a positive response or 
have received no response within the period of 28 days beginning 
with the date on which the request was sent. The Company will 
notify the member (either in writing, or by other permitted means) 
when a relevant document or information is placed on the website 
and a member can always request a hard copy version of the 
document or information.
11 Directors’ indemnities and loans to fund expenditure
  The Companies Act 2006 has in some areas widened the scope of 
the powers of a company to indemnify directors and to fund 
expenditure incurred in connection with certain actions against 
directors. In particular, a company that is a trustee of an 
occupational pension scheme can now indemnify a director against 
liability incurred in connection with the company’s activities as 
trustee of the scheme. In addition, the existing exemption allowing 
a company to provide money for the purpose of funding a director’s 
defence in court proceedings now expressly covers regulatory 
proceedings and applies to associated companies.
12 The Company’s objects
  The provisions regulating the operations of the Company are currently 
set out in the Company’s memorandum and articles of association. 
The Company’s memorandum contains, among other things, the 
objects clause which sets out the scope of the activities the Company is 
authorised to undertake. This is drafted to give a wide scope.
  The Companies Act 2006 significantly reduces the constitutional 
significance of a company’s memorandum. The Companies Act 2006 
provides that a memorandum will record only the names of 
subscribers and the number of shares each subscriber has agreed to 
take in the company. Under the Companies Act 2006 the objects 
clause and all other provisions which are currently contained in a 
company’s memorandum, for existing companies at 1 October 2009, 
will be deemed to be contained in a company’s articles of association 
but the company can remove these provisions by special resolution. 
  Further the Companies Act 2006 states that unless a company’s 
articles provide otherwise, a company’s objects are unrestricted. 
This abolishes the need for companies to have objects clauses. For 
this reason the Company is proposing to remove its objects clause 
together with all other provisions of its memorandum which, by 
virtue of the Companies Act 2006, are to be treated as forming part 
of the Company’s articles of association as of 1 October 2009. 
Resolution 9.1 confirms the removal of these provisions for the 
Company. As the effect of this resolution will be to remove the 
statement currently in the Company’s memorandum of association 
regarding limited liability, the New Articles also contain an express 
statement regarding the limited liability of the shareholders.
13 Change of name
  Currently, a company can only change its name by special 
resolution. Under the Companies Act 2006 a company will be able 
to change its name by other means provided for by its articles. To 
take advantage of this provision, the New Articles enable the 
directors to pass a resolution to change the Company’s name.
Explanation of AGM Business  Annual Report & Accounts 2009

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
14 Authorised share capital and unissued shares
  The Companies Act 2006 abolishes the requirement for a company to 
have an authorised share capital and the New Articles reflect this. 
Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any 
time allot because allotment authority continues to be required under 
the Companies Act 2006, save in respect of employee share schemes.
15 Redeemable shares
  At present if a company wishes to issue redeemable shares, it must 
include in its articles the terms and manner of redemption. The 
Companies Act 2006 enables directors to determine such matters 
instead provided they are so authorised by the articles. The New 
Articles contain such an authorisation. The Company has no current 
plans to issue redeemable shares but if it did so the directors would 
need shareholders’ authority to issue new shares in the usual way.
16 Borrowing powers
  The New Articles have been updated so that the accounting 
concepts used in limiting the borrowing powers of the Group are 
appropriate for the business carried out by the Group. For instance, 
the New Articles provide that any client money held by any 
member of the Group in trust for clients shall be excluded from any 
definition of money borrowed by the Group.
17  Authority to purchase own shares, consolidate and sub-divide 
shares, and reduce share capital
  Under the law currently in force a company requires specific 
enabling provisions in its articles to purchase its own shares, to 
consolidate or sub-divide its shares and to reduce its share capital or 
other undistributable reserves as well as shareholder authority to 
undertake the relevant action. The Current Articles include these 
enabling provisions. Under the Companies Act 2006 a company 
will only require shareholder authority to do any of these things 
and it will no longer be necessary for articles to contain enabling 
provisions. Accordingly the relevant enabling provisions have been 
removed in the New Articles.
18 Provision for employees on cessation of business
  The Companies Act 2006 provides that the powers of the directors 
of a company to make provision for a person employed or formerly 
employed by the company or any of its subsidiaries in connection 
with the cessation or transfer to any person of the whole or part of 
the undertaking of the company or that subsidiary, may only be 
exercised by the directors if they are so authorised by the 
company’s articles or by the company in general meeting. The New 
Articles provide that the directors may exercise this power.
19 Use of seals
  A company currently requires authority in its articles to have an 
official seal for use abroad. After 1 October 2009 such authority will 
no longer be required. Accordingly the relevant authorisation has 
been removed in the New Articles.
  The New Articles provide an alternative option for execution of 
documents (other than share certificates). Under the New Articles, 
when the seal is affixed to a document it may be signed by one 
authorised person in the presence of a witness, whereas previously 
the requirement was for signature by either a director and the 
secretary or two directors or such other person or persons as the 
directors may approve.
20 Chairman’s casting vote
  The New Articles remove the provision giving the chairman a casting 
vote in the event of an equality of votes in a general meeting as this 
is no longer permitted under the Companies Act 2006.
21 President
  The New Articles remove the provision giving the directors of the 
Company the ability to appoint a President of the Company. The 
Company has not, nor does it have a current intention to appoint  
a President.
22 Postponement of General Meetings
  The New Articles remove the provisions that require the directors of 
the Company to advertise the date, time and place of any postponed 
general meeting of the Company in at least two national daily 
newspapers. The New Articles provide instead that the directors of 
the Company are required to make arrangements for notices of the 
change of place and/or postponement of a general meeting to 
appear at the original place of the general meeting. 
23 General
  Generally the opportunity has been taken to bring clearer language 
into the New Articles and in some areas to conform the language of 
the New Articles with that used in the model articles for public 
companies produced by the Department for Business, Innovation 
and Skills.

Special Business 
Directors’ authority to allot shares
To resolve as an ordinary resolution: 
6  That, in place of all existing authorities, the directors be generally 
and unconditionally authorised pursuant to section 551 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) to exercise all the powers of the 
Company to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to 
subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares in the 
Company (“Relevant Securities”), up to a maximum aggregate 
nominal amount of £33,300, for a period expiring (unless 
previously revoked, varied or renewed) on the date which is fifteen 
months after the passing of this Resolution or, if sooner, the end of 
the next annual general meeting of the Company, but in each case 
the Company may make an offer or agreement which would or 
might require Relevant Securities to be allotted after this authority 
expires and the directors may allot Relevant Securities in pursuance 
of such offer or agreement as if this authority had not expired.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
To resolve as a special resolution:
7  That, subject to the passing of Resolution 6 above and in place of all 
existing powers, the directors be generally empowered pursuant to 
section 570 and 573 of the Act to allot equity securities (within the 
meaning of section 560(1) of the Act) for cash, pursuant to the 
authority conferred by Resolution 6 as if section 561(1) of the Act did 
not apply to such allotment, provided that this power shall expire on 
the date which is fifteen months after the passing of this Resolution or, 
if sooner, the end of the next annual general meeting of the Company. 
This power shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities:
7.1  in connection with an offer of equity securities (including, without 
limitation, under a rights issue, open offer or similar arrangement) 
in favour of holders of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the 
Company in proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to their 
existing holdings of Ordinary Shares but subject to such exclusions 
or other arrangements as the directors deem necessary or 
expedient in relation to fractional entitlements or any legal, 
regulatory or practical problems under the laws of any territory, or 
the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange; and 
7.2  otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 7.1 up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £5,000;
  but the Company may make an offer or agreement which would 
or might require equity securities to be allotted after this power 
expires and the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of 
such offer or agreement as if this power had not expired.
  This power applies in relation to a sale of shares which is an 
allotment of equity securities by virtue of section 560(2)(b) of the 
Act as if in the first paragraph of this resolution the words “pursuant 
to the authority conferred by Resolution 6” were omitted. 
Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
To resolve as a special resolution:
8  That the Company be generally authorised pursuant to section 
701 of the Companies Act 2006 to make market purchases (within 
the meaning of section 693(4) of the Companies Act 2006) of its 
Ordinary Shares on such terms and in such manner as the directors 
shall determine, provided that:
8.1  the maximum number of Ordinary Shares hereby authorised to be 
purchased is 1,000,000;
8.2  the maximum price which may be paid for each Ordinary Share 
shall be 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for 
an Ordinary Share (as derived from The Stock Exchange Daily

NOTES:
Rights to appoint a proxy
1  Members of the Company are entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote at 
a meeting of the Company. A proxy does not need to be a member 
of the Company. A member may appoint more than one proxy in 
relation to a meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by 
that member.
2  A proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and 
give proxy directions accompanies this notice. If you do not 
receive a proxy form and believe that you should have one, or if 
you require additional proxy forms in order to appoint more than 
one proxy, please contact Capita Registrars Limited, The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Kent BR3 4TU
Procedure for appointing a proxy
3  To be valid, the proxy form must be received by post or (during 
normal business hours only) by hand at Capita Registrars Limited, 
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Kent BR3 4TU no later than 
10:00 a.m. on 14 October 2009. It should be accompanied by the 
power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is 
signed or a notarially certified (or certified by a solicitor with a 
current practising certificate) copy of such power or authority.
4  The return of a completed proxy form will not preclude a member 
from attending the annual general meeting and voting in person if 
he or she wishes to do so.
Record date
5  To be entitled to attend and vote at the annual general meeting 
(and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the 
votes they may cast), members must be registered in the register of 
members of the Company at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday 14 October 
2009 (or, in the event of any adjournment, 48 hours before the 
time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to the register of 
members after the relevant deadline will be disregarded in 
determining the right of any person to attend and vote at the 
meeting.
Corporate representatives
6  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to 
the same shares.

7  Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. 
The Company must cause to be answered any such question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no 
such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly 
with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of 
confidential information, (b) the answer has already been given on 
a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is 
undesirable in the interests of the company or the good order of 
the meeting that the question be answered.
Documents available for inspection
8  There will be available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours on any weekday (excluding 
Saturdays and public holidays) and at the place of the meeting for

proposed new articles of association marked to show the 
proposed changes to the existing articles of association; 
	 •	 	 the	amended	rules	of	the	Brooks	Macdonald	Group	Enterprise

chosen proxy in block capitals in the box provided and initial alterations.

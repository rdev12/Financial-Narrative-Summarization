our market
the market is set to grow strongly over the next three 
years. the majority of our business falls into the overall 
category of industrial materials processing. w ithin this 
market, the fibre laser is set to continue as the fastest 
growing sub-segment. 
our tecHnology and current products 
The fibre laser requires the same basic elements as any other laser system.
In the case of the fibre laser, all of the elements are contained within the optical 
fibre, thus leading to an integrated solution which avoids the need for complex 
precision assemblies found in conventional lasers. The flexible nature of the optical 
fibre allows for a compact format which is significantly smaller than its industrial 
counterparts. The properties of the optical fibre lead to superior performance in 
many parameters. 
the entire laser unit is contained in a standard 19 inch rack or compact oem 
unit. One product serves many markets and they are software configurable. 
spi l asers enjoys a wide range of intellectual property and know-how, most notably 
our gtw ave™ technology, which allows robust and simple assembly without the 
use of complex or expensive sub-components. this is deployed as a standard 
technology platform throughout the product set. 
during 2007 we consolidated our build standards into two new platforms yielding 
dramatically lower costs, improved relativity and enhanced features. 03

SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 
OvERvIEw
i am pleased to report that the group has made 
considerable strides in its development during 
2007 and i believe is now well placed to meet 
the challenges of the rapidly changing 
market environment.
Fibre laser revenue is growing at a rate several 
times greater than the general laser market by 
both an increasing range of applications which 
exploit the inherent capability of the technology 
and also by the replacement of more 
mature technologies.
the attractiveness of the market has led to several 
companies declaring an intention to join the existing 
industrial scale players where spi is now established 
as the clear number two. the companies seeking 
to join the market are, however, potentially a long 
way from achieving the delivery of an effective 
product based on sound innovative technology 
that does not infringe the intellectual property 
of the more established players. 
In contrast, SPI has made significant technological 
progress during the year culminating in the successful 
launch of its g3 and r4 product ranges ahead 
of schedule. these platforms have addressed the 
previously reported quality issues that slowed our 
progress in the middle of the year, and are beginning 
to deliver a marked improvement in gross margin 
which should allow the group to make continued 
progress in 2008.
SPI’S PERFORMANCE duRING 2007
In spite of the difficulties encountered in the 
middle of 2007, revenue continued to almost 
double again this year and perhaps more 
importantly we continued to expand our share 
of each of our three main market areas, namely 
micro , medical and marking . the rate 
of new account wins and repeat business from 
established customers was encouraging, particularly 
at the end of the year based on acceptance 
of the new platforms. the market dynamics led 
to significant and deliberate competitive pricing 
pressure during the first half of the year. Whilst this 
has had the positive effect of reducing the price 
premium hurdle of fibre lasers compared with 
more traditional technologies, so increasing the 
accessible market, the effect in the short term on 
SPI’s profitability was sufficient spur to accelerate 
our planned investment to develop and deliver 
our new lower cost product platform, which in 
turn led to the Group’s refinancing in October 2007.
i am pleased to report that the new product 
platforms are being delivered ahead of schedule 
and also at cost and performance levels which 
are consistent with the plan to transform the 
profitability of the business during 2008.
FINANCING
as referred to in last year’s annual r eport, during 
February 2007 SPI completed a £10 million net 
equity fundraising from existing shareholders and 
a number of new supporters.

during october 2007, however, the changes 
in the competitive market environment, the cost 
of developing a lower cost platform and resolving 
the quality issues necessitated the Group raising 
a further £10.5 million (net) in equity. The fundraising 
comprised not only the placing of new shares with 
institutional investors, but also a strategic investment 
by The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd of £2.0 million. 
ThE bOARd
t he composition of spi’s Board has changed 
during the year. david c heesman, on his retirement 
from advent Venture partners, is reducing his 
commitments and has retired from the Board. 
david had served spi since 2003, when advent 
became one of the group’s leading investors 
prior to flotation. We thank him for his wise 
counsel over the past five years.
after the interim results, steve Berg, our 
Chief Financial Officer, also left the Group in 
order to concentrate on his family interests in 
Nottinghamshire. Steve was appointed CFO 
in February 2003 and in over five years made 
a considerable contribution to the development 
of spi.
in o ctober 2007, we welcomed d avid Holloway 
as our new Chief Financial Officer. He has already 
made a significant impact both to the Board and 
to the financial and operational efficiency of 
the business.
EMPLOYEES
The design and production of fibre lasers is not 
a trivial engineering challenge, as new entrants 
to this market may now be discovering. 
the combined and successful achievements of 
our workforce in 2007 should be seen against 
that demanding background. the Board wishes 
to extend its thanks for the immense effort and 
dedication shown by the worldwide team.
PROSPECTS
as well as prospective new entrants into the market, 
last year also saw new alliances being forged 
in the fibre laser technology world. For example, 
t rumpf and Jenoptik announced a joint venture 
in mid-year; Rofin acquired a leading merchant 
supplier of specialist optical fibre (Nufern) in 
December, while Furukawa became a small, but 
strategic, shareholder in spi in october. the pace 
of change in the market place is increasing. it seems 
unlikely that the manoeuvring for advantage 
amongst the players is yet complete.
spi has begun the current year with renewed 
confidence in our ability to produce competitive 
products. o ur new product platforms are 
transforming margins and are attracting increasing 
customer interest. Field reliability and functional 
performance have been most encouraging. 
activity in the area of development contracts 
tends to be cyclical and driven by investment 
programmes. after a low ebb in 2007, the 
outlook for 2008 looks more promising with at 
least one major award close to final adjudication.
The worldwide fibre laser market continues to grow 
rapidly, despite the well-publicised softness in the 
us economy, which has had an effect on our micro 
business in the first quarter. Nevertheless our overall 
order pipeline remains strong. our new platforms 
are demonstrating good performance and high 
reliability with a widening group of repeat customers. 
margins have begun to improve with further gains 
expected through 2008. action is being taken 
to control overheads. t he Board expects strong 
revenue growth in 2008 and remains committed 
to achieving profitability in Q4 this year.

cutting
with a strong ethos of product innovation, technology leadership 
and customer focus, SPI Lasers is enabling the resolution of 
some of today’s most challenging and commercially sensitive 
manufacturing issues. 
where existing technology has previously limited the precision 
cutting of miniature parts, the fibre laser has enabled manufacturers 
to produce ground breaking microscopic cut detail in some of the 
world’s smallest coronary stents.
The highly competitive electronics sector continues to leverage the 
enormous benefits of SPI’s technology, for example, superior cut 
quality of solder mask stencils for circuit boards. 
welding
Most people, when they think lasers, think welding. And this is true of 
the fibre laser from SPI. However, due to SPI’s innovative approach, 
it is now possible to weld various materials, including ones that are 
dissimilar to one another, at incredibly small dimensions.
Previous welding tools, including traditional lasers simply could 
not achieve the diminutive yet robust bond that the fibre laser 
produces. Not only is the fibre laser playing an integral part in the 
miniaturisation of consumer products, the technology is making a 
massive contribution to the quest for sustainable energy sources. 06
SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 
OvERvIEw
2007 was a year of considerable challenge for 
the business and i am pleased to report that the 
organisation in surmounting these challenges is, 
i believe, in a much stronger position than last 
year to exploit the current opportunities in the 
market place.
Revenue of £13 million was broadly in line with 
latest market expectations, almost continuing the 
historic pattern we have established of doubling 
year on year, which we believe is an indicator that 
we have now reached critical market share in our 
selected sectors such that future growth can be 
directed to those areas producing the best return. 
the ability to make these choices, predicated on 
the new product platforms introduced towards the 
end of 2007, will be crucial if we are to navigate 
through the uncertain global market environment 
of 2008, and secure our primary objective of 
transforming the group from an investment 
phase company to a profitable enterprise.
Having secured a number of significant contract 
wins in d ecember 2007 with a combined revenue 
potential of over us$10 million, and a rapid 
acquisition of new customers based on our new 
product platforms, we finished the year with cash 
resources at £11.3 million, ahead of expectation. 
continued focus on cash management remains 
a fundamental objective of the business.
The first half of the year experienced strong 
volume growth in line with market expectations. 
the industry market leader, however, introduced 
a radical, competitive pricing strategy in mid-year. 
This had the benefit of widening the accessible 
market through the removal of the fibre laser price 
premium compared with the more established 
technology alternatives. However, it also had the 
downside of eroding the economic return of our 
then product offering. this was compounded by 
the previously reported quality issues. This resulted 
in spi’s management team focusing on accelerating 
the development of new product platforms, which 
could not only offer enhanced performance and 
reliability, but should also positively transform 
margin performance.
the new product platforms have been launched 
ahead of schedule, have been well received by 
customers and should lead to strong growth again 
in 2008. the ‘once-off’ competitive pricing action 
in the first half of the year has created a new price 
reference level in the market which has remained 
relatively stable and it appears to have achieved 
its objective of widening the accessible market. 
the price of surmounting the above challenges 
was a further equity fundraising in October 2007 
which raised £10.5 million (net), including 
a £2.0 million strategic investment by Furukawa. 
Furukawa’s investment was particularly significant 
for spi, both in terms of spi’s technological 
credentials and also its commercial standing 
within the fast developing Far Eastern markets.
PROduCTS ANd MARKETS
in previous years, spi’s business was dominated 
by one area: micro . as we have grown this is 
no longer the case and therefore we will treat 
each sector in turn.
medical : our revenue has been historically 
dominated by oem module supply to leading 
machine integrators operating in the aesthetic 
and cosmetic arena. w e expect to build on this 
success but also to add more diversification in the 
future. the spi product is a module operating at 
a wavelength of 1550nm and leverages our core 
competencies in special fibre design and production. 
w e began the year with two customers who had 
high initial demand which then reached a plateau. 
w e ended the year with increased demand, 
potential for significant contract wins, a new 
higher-power product, business spread across 
four key accounts and the ability to migrate this 
product to our new lower cost standard platform.
micro : this market is a diverse set of cutting 
and welding applications in industries such as 
medical component manufacture, automotive, 
consumer electronics and semiconductors. 
this has been the longest-standing market sector 
for spi. during the year the product line continued 
to grow steadily but suffered the most price erosion 
in 2007. w e responded with dramatic improvements 
in our costs, which were achieved by completely 
redesigning the product with much improved 
active fibre. Not only do these new platforms have 
lower material costs but they allow significant 
consolidation of historic platforms which yields 
a paradigm shift in business simplification and 
therefore fixed costs.

marking : spi has developed a leading 
pulsed laser product based on a different 
architecture to its leading competitor. whilst the 
issues encountered during 2007 delayed its general 
availability in the market, i am pleased to report 
a successful new platform introduction took place 
towards the end of the year, again ahead of schedule. 
this new platform introduction not only addressed 
the quality issues but significantly lowered the cost 
of production. in d ecember we announced 
several large contract wins for this product family. 
success in marking has been allied with the 
penetration of new and diverse markets, such 
as solar cell production, utilising the advanced 
performance attributes of the standard product. 
some of these sectors will take time to develop 
into volume, and may require some modest product 
customisation to secure significant design wins for 
the second half of 2008.
A NOTE ON TEChNOLOGY
at the heart of our products, and indeed our 
business, lie our core competencies of optical 
fibre production and laser engineering. A highlight 
of 2007 was the improvement in the raw efficiency 
of our fibre and associated optical sub-assemblies. 
t his has enabled novel architectures and 
end product designs to be deployed. it is these 
improvements, along with the support of our 
strategic suppliers, which have enabled such 
dramatic shifts in the production costs of our 
whole portfolio. in developing the new building 
blocks, we have also kept an eye to the future, 
ensuring that the new platforms are fully scalable 
to higher powers which will enable future entry 
into new markets.
LOOKING AhEAd
w e see opportunities for improved top line 
performance across our sectors and geographic 
markets. the rate of new customer wins 
in marking is particularly pleasing with over 
50 new customers added in the last six months 
and we have already announced the continued 
expansion of existing verticals for example 
securing a further contract win in the medical 
sector. like many other companies in our sector, 
however, the uncertain capital equipment market, 
notably in the us , could disproportionately affect 
our micro business. 
t he fundamental objective for the g roup 
in the year ahead is to achieve profitability before 
we exit the year and to maintain a positive cash 
position. in order to underpin this we will 
concentrate on three fundamentals:
  prioritising new business consistent with 
our margin objectives;
  continued variable cost reductions enabled 
by our new platforms; and
  reducing our infrastructure costs consistent 
with the demands of the business.
spi achieved many of its goals in 2007 and 
particularly at the end of the year further contract 
wins successfully created positive business momentum 
on which we continue to build. the whole group 
has developed considerably and i am looking 
forward, with renewed confidence, to dealing 
with the future challenges of growth and business 
maturity and to achieving our objective of profitability 
in the last quarter.

medical aestHetics
Fibre laser technology from SPI has more to offer than just  
industrial applications. 
There has been significant growth in the use of lasers in the area 
of medical aesthetics: techniques such as thermal skin rejuvenation 
and wrinkle removal are becoming widely available, enabled in 
part by fibre lasers.
where previous technologies were limited by cost, unpleasant side 
effects and long recovery times, the SPI laser when incorporated 
into our customers’ systems, revolutionises the way we think about, 
and deal with, scarring and facial skin ageing.
marking
SPI Lasers’ technology leadership is helping to transform the way 
companies identify and track their products. Previously, placing 
unique marks on products or components was greatly limited by 
the type of marks and a potential for a lack of permanence. In a 
world where counterfeit products could endanger the commercial 
viability of an organisation, the ability to cost-effectively make 
unique, complex, permanent and inert identification marks is, 
quite literally, changing the face of products.
The fibre laser from SPI is also playing a key role in the development 
of many consumer products. w here complex layer combinations such 
as metal and plastic require material removal in order, for example, 
to produced keypads – the unique properties of SPI’s technology 
enables increased processing accuracy, precision and speed.  08
SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 
OvERvIEw
2007 saw the continued rapid and significant 
development of the g roup, fuelled by the expansion 
of the fibre laser market, bringing the year to 
a close broadly in line with market expectations. 
the year’s highlights included: 
  the continued trend of almost double year 
on year revenue growth, including the rise 
of our asian business to overtake the usa 
as our lead market; 
  competitive pricing pressure from the market 
leader causing the re-alignment of sales price 
reference levels;
  the resolution of a number of technical issues;
  a year of unfavourable exchange rate 
movements; and
  the rapid development and launch ahead 
of schedule of new product platforms, with 
enhanced performance and reliability and 
with improved cost profile which should 
increase product margins in 2008.
The year closed with an additional equity fundraising 
(£10.5 million net) and the announcement of 
significant new customer and vertical wins which 
will account for approximately us$10 million 
of fibre laser product revenue in 2008.
REvENuE
total revenue grew by 84% compared with last 
year, from £7.1 million to £13.1 million, of which 
product revenue were £11.8 million, having 
grown by 150% from £4.7 million last year.
c ontract revenue, which relate to us and uk 
defence and aerospace projects, were down 45% 
to £1.3 million, reflecting the cyclical nature 
of the development contracting market.
Asian revenue was £6.3 million, having grown 
very strongly in the year (390%) and overtaking 
the us to become spi’s lead market. asia now 
accounts for approximately half of spi’s worldwide 
product revenue, more than double last 
year’s proportion.
c onversely, our product sales performance in the 
uS market (£2.5 million) has remained at almost 
the same level and the proportion of sales has 
slipped from first place to third, with sales to 
Europe increasing to £2.8 million.
Sales in the u K market (£1.5 million) during 
the year were 11% of the total worldwide sales. 
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
GROSS LOSS
The gross loss during the year was £1.9 million, 
which was a significant improvement on last 
year’s performance (£3.1 million loss) and 
particularly after taking into account the major 
volume increase and the dislocation inherent 
in the development of new product platforms. 
the business has demonstrated that its 
pre-dominantly fixed cost manufacturing base 
can leverage significant increased volume 
throughput with beneficial effect on margin 
performance for the future and particularly with 
the improved cost profile of the new product 
platforms leading into 2008.
AdMINISTRATIvE ExPENSES
Administrative expenses were £10.7 million in 
the year, some £2.3 million higher than last year, 
an increase of 27% due to both increased R&D 
costs, associated with developing the new product 
platforms, and also due to the expansion in sales.
Administrative expenses include £3.0 million 
(2006: £2.4 million) of Group funded product 
R&D costs, of which £2.8 million was charged 
against the profit and loss account and the balance 
capitalised. in addition, and charged against 
cost of sales, the Group invested £1.1 million 
on customer funded R&D (2006: £2.1 million).
administrative expenses also include sales and 
marketing costs, provisions for royalties, warranty 
and also general administration costs. these costs 
increased by some 14% during the year consistent 
with increasing the worldwide sales presence and 
scale of the business.
TAxATION
spi has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 
£14.9 million (2006: £12.8 million), which has 
primarily arisen from losses incurred to date.
In 2007 an R&D tax credit of £0.4 million 
(£0.4 million in 2006) was recognised: the 
associated cash receipt from HM Revenue & Customs 
& Excise is expected to be received in the second 
half of 2008. (The 2006 related tax credit was 
received in February 2008).

assets, the latter associated with the capitalisation 
of Development costs for the first time consistent 
with ias 38.
Depreciation for 2007 was £0.7 million (2006: 
£0.6 million). Accumulated depreciation as at 
31 December 2007 stands at £11.4 million some 
81% of the gross cost of the assets.
wORKING CAPITAL
w orking capital, namely, net current assets 
excluding cash and loans, decreased from 
£3.1 million to £2.7 million compared with 
the previous year, which was a creditable 
performance in the light of the significant increase 
in the scale of the business. increased inventories 
(£0.9 million) were more than offset by increased 
creditors (£1.2 million), whilst debtors remained 
flat, having benefited from focused collections 
management during the fourth quarter.
LOANS 
The total of Loans (both long and short term) 
outstanding as at 31 d ecember 2007 was 
£2.5 million, a decrease of £0.3 million compared 
with the previous year. n o new loans were taken 
out during the year.
EQuITY FuNdRAISING
The Group raised a total of £21.4 million gross, 
£20.6 million net after expenses, during the year, 
in order to fund the expansion of the business and 
the development of new products and working 
capital demands of expansion and resolution of 
the technical and market challenges encountered 
during the year.
The placing during February 2007 raised 
£10.5 million gross, £10.1 million net after 
transaction costs of £0.4 million. The costs were 
the direct costs of the share issue and have been 
set off against the share premium account.
t he placing during o ctober 2007 raised 
£10.9 million gross, £10.5 million net after 
transaction costs of £0.4 million. The costs were 
the direct costs of the share issue and have 
been set off against the share premium account. 
t he cash balance as at 31 d ecember 2007 was 
£11.3 million, considerably ahead of market 
expectations, due primarily to more efficient 
resource management.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING 
STANdARdS
The International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) came into effect for AIM listed companies

SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007  The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and auditors’ report, for the year ended 
31 December 2007.
PRIncIPAL A ctIvItIeS
The Group is a leader in the design, development, engineering and manufacture of optical fibre-based laser sources for a range of markets and applications. 
The Group’s products are based on the innovative and proprietary fibre technology platform which enables high performance together with a substantial 
reduction in the size of the product and the total cost to the end-user compared to more traditional lasers.
BuSIneSS RevIew
The Company is required by the Companies Act to set out in this report a fair review of the business of the Group during the financial year ended 
31 December 2007 and of the position of the Group at the end of the year and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. 
The Directors report should be read in conjunction with the Chairman and Chief Executive Statements and the Financial Review which give details of the 
Group’s performance during the year and expected future developments. 
Key PeRfoRmAnce IndIcA toRS (KPI s )
Financial KPI’s are addressed in the Financial review and include: sales growth, sales by region, sales by product and contract development, R&D spend, 
gross profit, operating profit and profit after tax.
The Group uses a number of non-financial KPIs to monitor its performance in a number of areas on a regular basis. These areas include; order success, 
order acknowledgement, on time delivery, field failures, warranty returns, milestones achievement on development programmes, days holding and age 
of inventory, debtor days, creditor days, health and safety related incidents and lost days and staff turnover days. These KPIs are reviewed by management 
and the Board, as a minimum, on a monthly basis.
The Directors have in place a process of regularly reviewing risks to the business and monitoring associated controls, actions and contingency plans. 
The Group’s financial risk management policies are set out in note 39 together with details of financial instruments.
oPeRA tIng And fInAncIAL RevIew
The Board regularly monitor the business’ progress on meeting its strategic objectives by reference to performance indicators which include the income 
statement, balance sheet, cash flow statements and the above key performance indicators as set out in the financial statements.
dIvIdendS
The loss for the financial year of £12,300,000 (2006: loss £10,985,000) has been taken to reserves. The Directors do not recommend the payment of 
a dividend (2006: £nil). The Company’s current policy, which is kept under regular review is to retain future earnings that may occur for the development 
and expansion of the business.

IntRoductIon
SPI Lasers plc was listed on AIM on 26 October 2005. Although the AIM rules do not require the Group to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (‘the Code’) that was issued in 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council, the Group attempts to support the principles set out in the Code and 
complies in some areas where it considers appropriate to do so, given both the size and resources available to the Group. Details are provided below of 
how the Group applies the principles of the Code but we do not state where we do not apply the principles of the code.
the Bo ARd
The Board comprises three executive Directors (one of whom is part-time), and two non-executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman. On 9 November 2007, 
David Cheesman resigned as a non-executive Director. During the year, he had served on the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee. On 30 September 2007, 
Steve Berg resigned as an executive Director.
The Board meets each month and receives a Board pack comprising reports from each of the executive Directors together with any other material deemed 
necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Board’s responsibility for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, major 
items of expenditure and acquisitions.
Bo ARd commItteeS
The Board has established three committees: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee, each of which has written terms 
of delegated responsibilities. The identities of each of the chairmen of the committees referred to below will be reviewed on an annual basis. The membership 
of these committees and their terms of reference is kept under review.
AudIt commIttee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Graham Meek and its other member is Peter Schultz. Only non-executive Directors may serve on the Audit Committee. 
It will normally meet not less than three times in each financial year and will meet the auditors at least twice a year. The Audit Committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the external auditors and their remuneration. The Audit Committee will consider the nature, 
scope and results of the auditors’ work and will review (and reserves the right to approve) any non-audit services that are to be provided by the external 
auditors. It receives and reviews reports from management and the Group’s auditors relating to the Group’s Annual Report and accounts. The Audit Committee 
focuses particularly on compliance with legal requirements and accounting standards, ensuring that an effective system of internal financial and non-financial 
controls is maintained. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and accounts remains with the Board.
RemuneRA tIon commIttee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Peter Schultz and its other member is Graham Meek. Only non-executive Directors may serve on this committee. 
The Remuneration Committee, which will normally meet at least twice in each financial year, is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on 
the Company’s policy on the remuneration of executive Directors and senior management, for reviewing the performance of executive Directors and senior 
management and for determining, within agreed terms of reference, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive Directors and members of 
senior management, including pension rights, any compensation payments and the implementation of executive incentive schemes. In accordance with the 
Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference, no Director may participate in discussions relating to their own terms and conditions of service or remuneration.

nomInA tIonS commIttee
The Nominations Committee, chaired by Graham Meek, and its other members are Peter Schultz and David Parker. A majority of the members of this committee 
are non-executive Directors and the chairman of the Nominations Committee is a non-executive Director. The Nominations Committee, which will normally 
meet not less than twice in each financial year, has responsibility for considering the size, structure and composition of the Board, retirements and appointments 
of additional and replacement Directors and will make appropriate recommendations to the Board.
InteRnAL contRoL And RISK mAnA gement
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Group maintains a system of internal control consistent with 
a Group at its stage of development and as it grows, the Board intends to continue to enhance its processes to identify risks facing the business and implement 
procedures to eliminate, mitigate and monitor those risks.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function and the high level of Director review and 
authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared against budget, 
are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors as well as against material loss or claims against the 
Group and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
Rot AtIon of dIRectoRS
At the Annual General Meeting, two Directors, one executive (David Parker) and one non-executive (Peter Schultz), will retire and will then be eligible to stand 
for re-election. In subsequent years, one third of the Directors who are subject to retirement by rotation shall retire from office, and will be then similarly eligible 
to stand for re-election. Each Director is thereby subject to stand for re-election at least once every three years.
David Holloway was appointed to the Board as an executive Director on 1 October 2007 and will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, 
being eligible, will offer himself for election.
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 18.
ReSeARch And deveL oPment (‘R&d ’)
During the year the Group spent £3.0 million (2006: £2.4 million) on R&D, representing 22% of turnover (2006: 34%). Of this figure, £2.7 million was 
charged to the profit and loss. In addition, and charged against cost of sales, the Group spent £1.1 million on customer funded R&D (2006: £2.1 million). 
In the year, the Group adopted IAS 38, Intangible assets, and under the rules of the standard the Group capitalised £250,000 of product development costs in 
the year, of which £42,000 was amortised in the profit and loss account. A schedule of the intangible assets is included in note 15 to the financial statements. 
o veRSeAS PReSence
The Group has offices in the US and China for sales representation and product application activities. The primary management, control and finance 
functions for the overseas activities are carried out in the UK.
RISKS And unceRt AIntIeS
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties, which could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term performance and could cause actual 
results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Further information on these risks can be found in note 38 and 39 to the financial statements.
fInAncIAL RISK
The Group’s sales are predominantly US Dollar (USD) denominated or, if in other currencies, are generally based upon the equivalent USD price. This leaves 
the Group exposed to adverse movements in the USD to GB Pound (GBP) exchange rate. However, the Group’s purchases of components and its US operational 
costs are similarly USD based and so there is a degree of internal hedging of the exchange rate exposure. It is for this reason that the Group does not enter 
into currency hedging contracts. This policy will be under regular review as the Group’s sales and geographic presence expand in the coming years. 
There is a potential funding risk if trading does not achieve the expected levels of performance. The management of this potential risk is a prime business 
objective; which is covered in detail in the Chief Executive’s review.
deveL oPment RISK
A key focus for the Group in 2008 will be continuing the product cost reduction programmes which commenced in 2007. There is a potential risk of not 
achieving expected gross profit levels, if such programmes were to fall behind schedule and the Directors have contingency plans to ensure that the impact 
of such potential risk is mitigated.
comPetItIve RISK
In 2006, there were only two industrial scale fibre laser manufactures; ourselves and IPG Photonics. There are significant barriers to entry into the fibre laser 
market, namely: intellectual property rights; manufacturing know-how and investment in physical infrastructure. However, 2008 may see new entrants into the 
market, attracted by the growth opportunities therein. Such a widening of the competitive landscape could threaten the growth ambitions of the Group but the 
Directors consider that such risk is mitigated by the considerable technical barrier which such potential newcomers to the market would have to overcome in 
order to become a significant threat. Additionally, the Directors’ consider that continuous investment in R&D in its core technology will preserve its technical 
strength against the potential threat posed by such newcomers.
Directors’ report 15
SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 
commeRcIAL RISK
As the Group enters new market sectors or new market verticals, the customer buying cycle may adversely differ from that experienced to date. This could 
lead to a lower than expected rate of growth. The Directors consider that the breadth of the Company’s portfolio is sufficiently broad to mitigate the potential 
impact from such a development.
fInAncIAL RevIew 
Details of the financial review can be found on pages 8 to 9.

Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event of members 
of staff becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the 
policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
emPL oyee conSuL tAtIon
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed on matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved through formal and informal meetings. Employee representatives are 
consulted regularly on a wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests. The employee share scheme has been running successfully since 
its inception in September 2002. The Group has six share option schemes for all employees of the Group. The vesting period ranges from one to four years.

Directors’ remuneration report 18
SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS Regulation to prepare the 
Group financial statements under IFRS (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and have also elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
IFRS. However, Directors are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and 
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
statement of Directors’ responsibilities
in respect of the financial statements 19
SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of SPI Lasers plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 
which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and individual Company balance sheets, the consolidated and individual Company’s 
cash flow statements, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the individual Company statement of changes in equity and the related 
notes 1 to 44. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
ReSPectIve ReSPonSIBILItIeS of dIRectoRS And A udItoRS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether, 
in our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other information 
comprises only the Directors’ Report and the five year summary. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS of A udIt oPInIon
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient 
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the financial statements. 
oPInIon
In our opinion:
  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2007 and of its loss for the year then ended; 
  the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

notes to the financial statements
AT 31 DECEMBER 2007
1. geneRAL InfoRmA tIon
SPI Lasers plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office is shown on the inside 
back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
2. AdoPtIon of new And RevISed St And ARdS
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to  
IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Group’s financial instruments and management of capital 
(see note 24 and note 39).
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial 
statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions 
IFRIC 12  Service Concession Arrangements 
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes 
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction 
IAS 23 Borrowing costs 
IFRS 8 Operating segments
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group. Because SPI Lasers plc has adopted all the latest UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’) standards in prior period accounts, 
there are minimal changes in the IFRS conversion process (see note 43).
3. SIgnIfIcAnt A ccountIng PoLIcIeS
BASIS of PRePARA tIon
This is the first time the Group has prepared full year financial statements under IFRS. An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported 
financial results is provided in notes 42 and 43. The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the current year’s results and the prior year’s results.
BASIS of A ccountIng
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements have been prepared on amortised cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
BASIS of conSoLId AtIon
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of SPI Lasers plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
InveStmentS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the parent Company’s accounts at cost, less provisions for any impairment.
Revenue RecognItIon
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Revenue from goods is recognised when title passes, or the right to 
consideration in exchange for performance, has been completed. 
Revenue is recognised on long-term contracts by including in the income statement revenue calculated by reference to the value of work performed to date 
as a proportion of the total contract value. On cost plus contracts, this is by reference to the costs incurred to date, whereas on fixed price contracts, this is 
by reference to the achieved contract milestones.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Long-teRm contRA ctS
Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total 
contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are 
included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable 
they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
LeASIng
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 28
SPI Lasers plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
3. SIgnIfIcAnt A ccountIng PoLIcIeS (contInued)
foReIgn cuRRencIeS 
The individual financial statements of each Group Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group Company are expressed 
in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Group, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies: Company
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and 
on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period.
Foreign currencies: Group
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, 
are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.
BoRRowIng coStS
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
oPeRA tIng L oSS
Operating loss is stated before investment revenue and finance costs.
RetIRement BenefIt coStS 
The Group makes defined contributions to employee personal pension plans. The pension cost charged as an expense represents the contributions payable 
to the pension plans in respect of the accounting year.
tAxA tIon
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events 
that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences 
are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in 
tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded 
as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based 
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
goveRnment gRAntS
Government grants towards staff re-training costs are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are 
deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the expected useful lives 
of the assets concerned.
PRoPeRty, PLAnt And equIPment
Tangible fixed assets are included at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Assets in the course 
of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation on assets in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets other than assets under construction, down to their residual value, over their estimated useful lives, 
using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
Leasehold improvements – the shorter of ten years or remainder of lease 
Fixtures and equipment – five years 
Computer equipment – three years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. Any impairment in the value is charged to income. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
ReSeARch And deveL oPment exPendItuRe
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development projects is recognised only if the following conditions are met: 
 an asset is created that can be identified;
 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and 
 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can 
be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

3. SIgnIfIcAnt A ccountIng PoLIcIeS (contInued)
ImPAIRment of t AngIBLe And Int AngIBLe ASSetS excL udIng goodwILL
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, 
in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried 
at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
InventoRIeS
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items. Cost includes materials and an 
attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads that have been incurred to bring inventories to their present locations and condition. Net realisable value 
is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. Inventories held for demonstration purposes are 
held at original cost and amortised over a period of twelve months.
fInAncIAL InStRumentS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
tRAde ReceIv ABLeS
Trade receivables in the normal course of trade do not carry any interest and are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowance for 
irrecoverable amounts.
cASh And cASh equIv ALentS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
fInAncIAL LIABILItIeS And equIty
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any 
contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded 
at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
BoRRowIngS
Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and 
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
conveRtIBLe Lo An noteS
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instrument, consisting of a liability component and an equity component. At the date of issue the fair value 
of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the 
convertible loan and the fair value assigned to the liability element, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is 
included in equity.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that 
obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted 
to present value where the effect is material.
ShARe-BASed PA ymentS
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants 
of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2006. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled 
share-based payments. 30

4. cRItIcAL A ccountIng judgementS And Key SouRceS of eStImA tIon unceRt AInty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
cRItIcAL judgementS In APPL yIng the gRouP ’S AccountIng PoLIcIeS
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, management has made the following judgements that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
Revenue RecognItIon
In making its judgment, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods set out in IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and 
in particular, whether the Group had transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods in accordance with the terms and 
conditions agreed with customers. On ex-works orders, ownership of the product passes to the customer when notification is made that the product is ready 
for collection by the customer’s carrier. Management have controls in place to ensure that revenue is only recognised on these products collected within five 
working days of the end of the financial year. Following the detailed quantification of the Group’s liability in respect of rectification work and the agreed 
limitation on the customer’s ability to require further work or to require replacement of goods, the Directors are satisfied that the significant risks and rewards 
have been transferred and that recognition of the revenue in the current year is appropriate, in conjunction with recognition of an appropriate provision for 
the rectification costs. An estimate of the rectification costs is included with the warranty provision. See provisions for royalty and product warranty below.
Key SouRceS of eStImA tIon unceRt AInty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
RecoveRABILIty of InteRnALL y-geneRA ted Int AngIBLe ASSet
During the year, management reconsidered the recoverability of its internally-generated intangible asset which is included in its balance sheet at £208,400. 
The project continues to progress in a very satisfactory manner and customer reaction has reconfirmed management’s previous estimates of anticipated revenues 
from the project. However, increased competitor activity has caused management to reconsider its assumptions regarding future market shares and anticipated 
margins on these products. Detailed sensitivity analysis has been carried out and management is confident that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered 
in full, even if returns are reduced. This situation will be closely monitored, and adjustments made in future periods if future market activity indicates that such 
adjustments are appropriate.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 60 days. Trade receivables which are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable 
amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits 
by customer. Of the trade receivables balance at the year end, £685,000 is due from a significant customer, 31% (2006: 3%) of the total trade receivables 
balance. This balance has not been impaired. There is one other customer representing more than 5% (2006: 5) of the total balance of trade receivables.

The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
The Group has two principal loans provided by ETV Capital SA (Luxembourg) (‘ETV’).
l oan 1
This loan was provided in June 2005. The loan amount was £2,000,000, repayable by 36 equal monthly instalments at an interest rate of 12.65%. It is 
secured on the fixed assets of the Group. In December 2006 the loan was restructured to be interest only for the period December 2006 to August 2007 
inclusive and thereafter repayable in twelve equal monthly instalments. ETV was granted a warrant to purchase, at its discretion, 201,388 ordinary shares 
at the IPO price of 144p per share. The warrant is exercisable until June 2015. The warrant may be exchanged without the payment of any additional 
consideration for the Group’s shares based upon the value of the warrant and the shares at the time of the exchange.
Loan 2
This convertible loan was provided in December 2006. The loan amount was £1,750,000, on an interest only basis for the period December 2006 to 
December 2007 inclusive and thereafter repayable in 27 equal monthly instalments at an interest rate of 13.2%. It is secured on all tangible and intangible 
assets of the Group. ETV may convert part or the entire outstanding principal of the loan, at its discretion, at a price calculated by reference to the market 
price over the preceding two weeks prior to conversion, subject to a maximum price of 244.79p. There is also a minimum price, determined by a restriction 
on the post conversion shareholding of ETV not exceeding 5.0% of the issued shares of the Group.

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders 
through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 
24, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed 
in notes 27 to 32.

The Group’s treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages 
financial risk relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyses exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. 
These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
mARKet RISK
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risk changes in foreign exchange rates and interest risk. The foreign exchange risks are not material, 
predominantly due to natural hedge between foreign currency assets and foreign currency liabilities. The Group’s financial exposure to changes in interest 
rates is noted under credit risk management below. 
foReIgn cuRRency RISK mAnA gement
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and, as a result, is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. The Group’s sales 
are predominantly US dollar (‘USD’) denominated or, if in other currencies, based upon the equivalent USD price. This leaves the Group exposed to adverse 
movements in the USD to GB Pound (‘GBP’) exchange rate. However, the Company purchases of components and its US operational costs are similarly 
USD-based and so there is a degree of internal hedging of the exchange rate exposure. It is for this reason that the Group does not enter into currency 
hedging contracts. This policy will be under review as the Group’s sales and geographic presence expand in the coming years. 
Gains and losses from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.  43

cRedIt RISK mAnA gement 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The business has expanded its revenues rapidly and especially in the Far East via 
appointed distributors with whom it has formal trading agreements. A logical consequence of this situation is that at any point in time, trade receivables may 
include significant amounts due from distributors. The Group manages the inherent potential credit risk by careful monitoring of the credit exposure and also 
operates a policy of title retention with such customers. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance 
for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. 44

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for 
the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining 
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity

The Group has prepared full annual financial statements under IFRS, the Group has applied IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards as a starting point for reporting under IFRS. The Group’s date of transition to IFRS is 1 January 2006 and comparative information has been restated 
to reflect the Group’s adoption of IFRS except where otherwise required or permitted by IFRS 1.
IFRS 1 requires an entity to comply with each IFRS and IAS effective at the reporting date for its first financial statements prepared under IFRS. As a general 
rule IFRS 1 requires such standards to be applied retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at the date of transition, 1 January 2006. IFRS 1 
provides a number of optional exemptions to this general principle. The ones applicable to the Group are set out below, together with a description of the 
exemption adopted by the Group.
In accordance with IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards the Group is required to present reconciliations of its equity at 
the date of transition 1 January 2006 and at the date of the in the last UK GAAP financial statements (31 December 2006), together with its profit and loss 
for the same periods.
The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemption available to reset the cumulative exchange differences on net investment in foreign operations to 
zero at the date of transition. Accordingly the Group has not separately disclosed the amount of cumulative translation differences for its overseas operation 
included within retained earnings at 1 January 2006.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity 
instruments after 7 November that has not vested as of 1 January 2006.

The transition to IFRS has not impacted on the net assets of the Group at 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2006. It has increased the net assets of the

Recently, tax changes were enacted which will affect the future tax position of the Company. Most significantly, from 1 April 2008, the Company’s rate of 
corporation tax on profits will be reduced from 30% to 28%, the rate of allowances for expenditure on plant and equipment will be reduced from 25% to 20% 
per annum on a reducing balance basis and balancing adjustments on the sale of industrial buildings has been abolished with effect from 21 March 2007.
These changes will both affect the amount of future cash tax payments to be made by the Company and the size of the Company’s balance sheet deferred tax asset.
As these changes were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the deferred tax asset is based on a corporation tax rate of 28%. 48

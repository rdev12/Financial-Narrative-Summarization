The Vadinar reﬁnery had a throughput 
capacity of 17 . 1 mmtpa in the 15 months 
ended 31 March 2012. Having completed 
its phase 1 expansion (March 2012) and 
optimisation (June 2012) projects, it is now 
India’s second largest single-location 
reﬁnery, with an annual capacity of  
20 mmtpa, or 405,000 bpd, up from 
14.7 mmtpa/300,000 bpd previously, 
and a complexity of 1 1.8, up from 6. 1 
previously. This puts the Vadinar reﬁnery 
amongst the most complex reﬁneries in 
the world. The Vadinar reﬁnery can now 
process a heavier crude diet and produce 
higher value, high-quality products, which 
will lead to increased reﬁning margins.

on 31 July 201 1. The acquisition price  
was US$350 million payable in two 
instalments. The Stanlow reﬁnery is a 
100% subsidiary of Essar Energy and is 
the second largest reﬁnery in the UK 
supplying around 15% of transport fuels 
in the UK. Stanlow is strategically located 
in the industrial heartland of north west 
England with excellent infrastructure links 
through port, pipeline and road.

Chairman’s statement
“If India is to meet its 12th 
Five Year Plan target of 
9% GDP growth each 
year from 2012 to 201 7 , 
then this will require 
energy supplies to grow at 
a rate of between 6.5% 
and 7% per year, which is 
above the rates of the last 
ﬁve years.”
Introduction
Welcome to Essar Energy’s annual 
report for 2011–12. Following on from  
a positive ﬁrst year as a listed company 
in 2010, the 2011–12 period has been 
more mixed. In some areas we have 
made excellent progress, notably in  
our oil business with the completion  
in March this year of the phase 1 
expansion of our ﬂagship Vadinar 
reﬁnery, which is now a world class 
plant producing high value fuels to 
international and Indian speciﬁcations. 
However, there have also been a 
number of challenges, particularly 
in the Indian power sector.
Essar Energy and other power 
companies across India have been 
impacted by delays in obtaining 
regulatory approvals, particularly in 
relation to approvals for coal blocks. 
Furthermore, near the end of the 
ﬁnancial period, Essar Oil was also 
affected by the loss of the Gujarat 
deferred sales tax case in the Indian 
Supreme Court. These factors coupled 
with a highly volatile market led to a 
sharp fall of the share price in the 
March 2012 ﬁnancial period.  Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

FINANCIA L
STATEMENT S
05
Despite this, including the ongoing 
challenges surrounding sales tax we 
are looking forward with a positive 
outlook and are ready to deliver the 
full potential of your company. 
One of the reasons for optimism is 
the outlook for the Indian economy. 
Notwithstanding the recent policy 
impasse and adverse macro economic 
factors, over the last Five Year Plan, the 
Indian economy has grown around 
35%, pulling many people out of poverty 
and increasing the wealth of the middle 
classes. As more and more people in 
India see pathways opening up to a 
better way of life, they want to improve 
their living conditions and fundamental 
to this is the provision of energy; be that 
petroleum products for cars and other 
transportation or electricity for lighting 
and household goods. Demand is rising 
rapidly and the provision of petroleum 
products and electricity to the Indian 
market is central to what we do and 
why I am so conﬁdent in our business 
model (see pages 10 and 1 1).
If India is to meet its 12th Five Year Plan 
target of 9% GDP growth each year from 
2012 to 201 7 , then according to India’s 
Planning Commission, this will require 
energy supplies to grow at a rate of 
between 6.5% and 7% per year, which 
is above the rates of the last ﬁve years.
Longer term, India is very well placed 
in having a young population, not 
only in comparison to advanced 
economies, but also in relation to the 
large developing countries of China 
and Brazil. As a result, the labour force 
is expected to increase by around 30% 
and the urban population is expected 
to increase from around 31% today to 
over 40%, both over the next 20 years. 
Strategy
As a result, our strategy remains 
unchanged; to create a world-class, 
low-cost, integrated energy company 
focused on India and positioned to 
capitalise on India’s growing energy 
demand. We will only look outside of 
India for two reasons; ﬁrst to secure 
upstream resources, which is mainly 
applicable to the coal required for our 
Indian power stations, and second, to 
secure market access, which applies 
to our reﬁneries in Kenya and the UK. 
In pursuit of this strategy, in July 201 1 
we completed the acquisition of the 
Stanlow reﬁnery in the UK. This high 
quality reﬁnery, which has a capacity of 
296,000 bpd and supplies around 15% 
of transport fuels in the UK, gives us 
options to bring high quality product 
from India to the UK and European 
markets. In addition, the acquisition 
cost of just US$350 million was very 
competitive when compared to other 
similar transactions in Europe over the 
last three years. In recent years, Stanlow 
has suffered from a lack of investment, 
but we see tremendous scope to 
improve the performance and 
proﬁtability of this asset and we 
are implementing a plan developed 
during our ﬁrst 100 days of ownership 
to deliver this.
Given the issues we have been facing 
in the power business recently, together 
with the loss of the sales tax case, we 
have decided to focus in the near term 
on managing risk more effectively and 
look to ensure the delivery of our current 
suite of growth projects before we start 
to reinvest in the portfolio. This does not 
signal a lack of conﬁdence in the India 
growth story, but rather a short-term 
adjustment to the current 
market realities.
Board governance
The Company has adopted the 
principles of the new UK Corporate 
Governance Code and has only 
departed from such principles in a small 
number of instances where the Board 
has considered that good governance 
can be achieved by other means which 
are preferable for the Essar Energy 
business. Our Nomination and 
Governance Committee keeps key 
governance matters under review 
on a regular basis. 
Following a telecom investigation in 
India relating to the equity holding of the 
Essar Group in Loop Telecom, Mr Ravi 
Ruia decided to step aside from the 
Chairmanship of Essar Energy. While 
these charges do not relate to Essar 
Energy and are not expected to have 
any impact on Essar Energy’s business 
operations, Mr. Ravi Ruia decided to 
step down from the Chairmanship as 
a good governance measure and to 
ensure that the Board and management 
of Essar Energy continue to be fully 
focussed on successfully delivering 
against their laid out strategy. The 
Essar Group has always been open, 
transparent and law abiding, and I am 
conﬁdent that these charges will be 
dismissed by the courts in India.
On 29 March 2012 we appointed 
Steve Lucas as a ﬁfth Independent 
Non-Executive Director to the Board of 
Essar Energy. Steve brings a wealth of 
experience to the Board, particularly in 
the areas of power and ﬁnance given his 
background as the Finance Director of 
National Grid from 2002 to 2010. This 
move further strengthens the experience 
and independence of our Board. 
People
Our strategy is based on building 
world-class assets, but this cannot 
be achieved without the people to 
construct, operate and manage these 
assets. As I visit the different parts of 
our business, I am always impressed by 
the quality of the people that we have 
within Essar. Last year, we welcomed 
1,007 new colleagues into the Essar 
family through the acquisition of the 
Stanlow reﬁnery. Despite having very 
different backgrounds, I have been very 
impressed with how quickly Stanlow 
has been integrated into Essar Energy 
and we are already seeing the beneﬁts 
of some real knowledge sharing 
between our UK and Indian operations.
Much of the credit for this must  
go to Naresh Nayyar and his Senior 
Management team. He continues to 
develop and grow the talent within the 
organisation and on your behalf, the 
Board would like to thank him and  
the entire Essar Energy team for the 
contribution they have made this year.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review
On 31 July 201 1, we completed the 
acquisition of the Stanlow reﬁnery which 
supplies approximately 15% of transport 
fuels in the UK. This is a good quality 
asset with a mid complexity of 8.2 and 
is strategically located near Manchester 
to supply north west and central 
England. The acquisition cost, at 
US$350 million, is very competitive 
when compared to similar transactions 
completed over the last three years. 
Since the acquisition, the operating 
performance has been in line with 
expectations processing 51 million 
barrels of oil in the ﬁrst eight months 
of ownership. More importantly, we 
completed our 100 day plan post 
acquisition and have identiﬁed a number 
of opportunities to improve the reﬁnery 
which should deliver a minimum US$2/
barrel to the GRMs, or US$150 million of 
additional EBITDA, by the end of 2013. 
Delivery of these improvements will 
ensure that Stanlow is positioned to 
be cash ﬂow positive in even the worst 
market conditions, such as those that 
we saw in Europe in the last quarter 
of 201 1.
In Power, we saw strong availability 
across our portfolio with each plant 
being available more than 93% of the 
time. Actual power generation was 
slightly lower than last year (adjusted for 
the 15 month period) mainly due to high 
gas prices leading to reduced demand 
from our customers offset by the 
commissioning of the Vadinar Phase 1 
380 MW co-generation plant in 
Gujarat, India. 
Financial results: Impacted by 
external factors
Earlier this year, we decided to move 
our ﬁnancial reporting to a March year 
end to bring our reporting into line with 
the Indian tax year. As a result, we are 
reporting a 15 month period for this 
set of annual results. Despite our solid 
operating performance, we are reporting 
a loss before tax of US$1, 147 .7 million, 
mainly as a result of three critical factors.
First, as a result of us losing the sales 
tax beneﬁt case in the Supreme Court 
of India which resulted in the reversal of 
the entire sales tax beneﬁt revenue 
previously recognised of US$1,053.7 
million together with other related 
adjustments (see Note 8a for further 
details). Second, as a result of the lapse 
of a prepayment option on Essar Oil’s 
MRA loans, which has resulted in a 
non-cash charge of US$321.5 million 
The ﬁnancial year 2011–12 provided 
a number of challenges for your 
company. Increased inﬂation fed 
through to higher interest rates, we saw 
a slowdown in the receipt of regulatory 
approvals and in January of this year 
we lost our sales tax case in the Indian 
Supreme Court which removed a 
signiﬁcant ﬁscal beneﬁt. Despite these 
challenges, our operations performed 
well and we made good progress on 
our growth projects.
Solid operating performance
During the year, we saw a strong 
operating performance across our 
reﬁning and power portfolios.
The Vadinar reﬁnery in India continues to 
perform well with production broadly ﬂat 
on last year, after adjusting for the 35 
day outage in September and October 
for routine maintenance and to tie in the 
new expansion units for the phase 1 
expansion. In total we processed 125 
million barrels of oil through Vadinar in 
the 15 month period. Operating costs 
remain very competitive at just US$3/
barrel, including marketing and 
distribution costs. 
“The completion of our 
Vadinar reﬁnery now puts 
this asset amongst the 
best in the world in terms 
of scale and complexity.” Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

(see Note 8b for further details). And 
third, during the ﬁnancial year, the Indian 
Rupee depreciated sharply by 14% 
resulting in foreign exchange losses of 
US$316.9 million (see Note 7 for further 
details). Excluding the impact of these 
factors, proﬁt before tax for the year 
was US$445.9 million. 
The loss of the sales tax beneﬁt case 
in particular has led us to place more 
focus on debt and funding in the 
event that we receive a demand for 
immediate repayment and interest 
thereon on the deferred sales tax 
liability or we are unable to reach 
an acceptable deferred repayment 
schedule. We are currently in the 
advanced stages of establishing a 
new c.US$1 billion debt facility with 
our Indian lenders to potentially fund 
the sales tax liability, as well as 
pursuing funding options with other 
lenders to improve liquidity. As our 
projects commission, our focus will 
move to delivering the promised cash 
ﬂows and reducing debt levels.
Growth projects: Capex cycle 
coming to an end
We continued to execute our signiﬁcant 
pipeline of growth projects during the 
15 months to March 2012, investing a 
total of US$2.8 billion across our oil and 
gas and power projects.
In Reﬁning, I am pleased to report the 
completion of the phase 1 expansion 
of our Vadinar reﬁnery and, post year 
end, the completion of the reﬁnery 
optimisation project, which now puts 
this asset amongst the best in the world 
in terms of scale and complexity. The 
expanded reﬁnery now has a capacity 
of 20 mmtpa or 405,000 bpd and a 
complexity of 1 1.8. The increased 
complexity in particular will allow us 
to signiﬁcantly enhance our reﬁnery 
margins as we can process a much 
heavier, and hence cheaper, crude 
diet and produce a higher proportion 
of more valuable middle and light 
distillates. I expect to see a signiﬁcant 
uplift in the cash ﬂow and proﬁtability 
of this asset during this current year.
In Power, we commissioned the 380 
MW Vadinar P1 gas ﬁred co-generation 
project and post year end have 
commissioned the 1,200 MW Salaya I 
coal ﬁred power project. Salaya I is the 
ﬁrst coal ﬁred plant that the Company 
has built and commissioned and 
triggers a string of coal projects that 
will complete over the next two years 
to take our total generation capacity to 
6,700 MW by the end of March 2014 
from 2,800 MW today. We are conﬁdent 
of delivering on this target. 
One of the disappointments this year 
however, has been the continued 
delays to regulatory approvals in India 
and elsewhere. In particular, this has 
impacted our ability to develop our 
captive coal blocks and current coal 
shortages in India increase the risks of 
us having to run the plant that we are 
commissioning at lower load factors 
than planned. We were encouraged in 
January by the Prime Minister of India’s 
intervention in the power sector to 
resolve all major issues, and that we 
received in June provisional forest 
clearance for our Mahan coal block. 
However, delays to approvals will still 
impact the Mahan (1,200 MW) and Tori 
(1,800 MW) power projects which are 
due to commission in the near term. 
As a result, we are putting in place 
contingency plans to ensure that we 
have sufﬁcient coal at these power 
stations to cover, as a minimum, all 
of our cash costs until our own mines 
are operating.
Given ongoing regulatory delays, 
we have also decided to defer three 
of our construction projects; Salaya II 
(1,320 MW), Salaya III (600 MW) and 
Navabharat I (1,050 MW). This is very 
disappointing given the unquestionable 
demand for power in India, but we 
believe this to be a prudent decision to 
allow us to manage risk and focus on 
those power projects which will provide 
more certain cash ﬂows and proﬁtability. 
The deferred projects will now only 
proceed against speciﬁc milestones 
related to land and environmental 
approvals and us securing the 
necessary fuel supplies.
Completion of the Vadinar reﬁnery 
optimisation project brings to an end 
the current capital expenditure cycle in 
the reﬁning business and we expect 
the capital expenditure cycle in power 
to ramp down over the next two years. 
The focus will then move to ensuring 
that all assets operate to expectations, 
that we secure the necessary feed 
stock and start to deliver the promised 
cash ﬂow and proﬁtability.
Health and safety
The number one priority for our business 
remains to enable our employees to 
operate in a healthy and safe working 
environment. Our employees have 
embraced our values in this area and 
we continue to be recognised externally 
for our health and safety practices. As 
at 31 March 2012, our Vadinar reﬁnery 
operations crossed 1,460 LTI free days 
and our Power operations at Hazira 
crossed 3,584 LTI free days. I am 
pleased to report that Stanlow also has 
an excellent safety record having now 
passed 794 LTI free days as at 31 March 
2012, which is particularly pleasing 
as this covers the handover and 
integration period.
I was particularly impressed this year 
by the safety performance during the 
Vadinar reﬁnery’s 35 day shut-down for 
routine maintenance and to tie-in all of 
the new units and revamp other units 
for the expansion project. In total, 2,492 
maintenance and inspection jobs and 
over 1,600 tie-in jobs for the new and 
revamped units were completed 
involving some 15,000 employees 
and contractors on site. All of these 
jobs were completed without any 
accidents or injuries and the overall 
project was delivered to the original 
35 day schedule. This was a signiﬁcant 
achievement in itself, but the overriding 
commitment to complete the work 
safely was excellent.
While maintaining an excellent safety 
record at our operations, our focus for 
improvement continues to be at our 
under construction projects where 
there is clear room for improvement. 
The health and safety of our employees 
and the communities where we operate 
is a priority for our Company and is 
important to me personally as well as 
the entire Senior Management team.
The Company has a clear strategy 
in place to capitalise on India’s rapidly 
growing energy demand. While we are 
making clear progress in certain areas, 
head winds remain in others, particularly 
in relation to regulatory approvals and 
the development of our coal mines. As 
a result, we are adjusting our focus to 
complete our current growth projects 
and then focus on our operations to 
deliver to expectations.

Economic outlook
Despite a recent slowdown in GDP 
growth rates, India is expected to 
deliver high growth rates in the future.
The Reserve Bank of India’s quarterly 
survey of professional forecasters in 
March 2012 showed a downwards 
revision of expectations for real GDP 
growth for the current ﬁscal year 2012–13 
to 7 .2% from 7 .3% in their previous 
survey. Forecasts for agriculture and 
services remained unchanged at 3.0% 
and 8.8% respectively, whereas industry 
growth is expected to be in the range of 
5.5% to 5.8%.
Over the ﬁscal year to March 2012, 
Indian GDP growth slowed to 6.5%, 
including 5.3% in the ﬁnal quarter, 
compared with 8.4% in the previous 
year 2010–11. Most of this fall was due 
to the industrial sector, with the index 
of industrial production growing by just 
2.8% at the end of the ﬁscal year to 
March, against 8.2% the previous year 
while mining fell to a negative (1.9%) 
against 5.2% growth the previous year. 
Inﬂation and the Rupee/US dollar 
exchange rate are among the factors 
constraining growth rates. At the end of 
the ﬁscal year to March 2012, wholesale 
price inﬂation stood at 6.9%, relative to a 
year earlier. Consumer price inﬂation 
was still higher at 9.5%, driven to a 
signiﬁcant degree by food prices. 
The crude oil and petroleum product 
price index jumped by 44% during 
the ﬁscal year, against 11.8% in the 
previous year. This inﬂationary trend 
has continued over the past three 
months, with wholesale price inﬂation 
in April running at 7 .2% and in May 
7 .55%. Over the 15 month period 
to March 2012, the exchange rate 
weakened from Rs. 45.39 to Rs. 51.16 
against the US dollar and has recently 
been around Rs. 55.5, representing  
a 22% depreciation over the last 
18 months.
Meanwhile, India’s large trade deﬁcit 
continues to increase, with an excess 
of imports over exports of about 
US$185 billion during 2011–12. Foreign 
investment into Indian equities totalled 
only US$9.2 billion compared with 
US$21 billion a year earlier, according 
to the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India, helping to keep the Rupee 
under constant pressure.

The ﬁscal deﬁcit has also increased. 
In the ﬁscal year to March 2012, the 
difference between government revenue 
and total expenditure was over US$100 
billion, or an expected 5.9% of GDP , 
higher than the Government’s target of 
4.6%. One major reason for this was the 
continued high level of fuel subsidies.
However, the Government has set a 
target of cutting the ﬁscal deﬁcit to 
5.1% in 2012–13, and subsequently, 
despite the high inﬂation rate, the RBI 
decided in April to cut its repo interest 
rate by 0.5% to 8.0%. This was a 
welcome move for industry given that 
the cost of borrowing in India is one of 
the highest globally. 
Business outlook
There remains a major shortage of 
power generation in India relative to 
demand, with peak deﬁcits in 2011 still 
running at around 10.6% of demand, 
according to India’s Economic Survey, 
published in March 2012. Around one 
third of the Indian population still has no 
access to electricity, according to the 
2011 national census. India has laid out 
ambitious objectives for its 12th Five 
Year Plan running from 2012–17 , with 
a target of US$1 trillion of investment 
in infrastructure, including 75–100 GW 
of new power generation. This is 
designed to deliver GDP growth rates 
of around 9% p.a. over the plan period.
The Indian Government is forecasting 
that the total energy requirement (in 
terms of million tonnes of oil equivalent) 
is projected to grow at 6.5% per year 
between 2010–11 and 2016–17 . Hence 
the rationale for investment in the 
energy sector in India remains strong. 
However, it is clear that if the 
Government is to facilitate delivery of the 
targeted investment in infrastructure and 
energy, the regulatory issues described 
earlier will need to be tackled rapidly. In 
the 1 1th Five Year Plan, 2007–12, only 
50 GW of new generation was built, 
against a target of 78.7 GW.
There remain distortions in the energy 
sector in India, not least due to the 
continued heavy Government subsidy 
of energy and fuel prices for consumers. 
This is an issue across all sectors, 
particularly electricity where the rising 
cost of generating power from imported 
coal and gas is not reﬂected in the 
prices set by state regulators for the 
customers of state electricity utilities. 
If the Indian economy is to grow in a 
world of high energy prices it is clear 
that in the medium to long-term, the 
Government will need to remove these 
distortions, replacing them with far more 
targeted subsidies for the poor. This 
would require not just reforms of tariffs 
but also reductions in transmission and 
distribution losses and the opening up 
of domestic coal resources. These 
changes would be positive for 
Essar Energy.
In the fuel retail sector, the Government 
acknowledges that it needs to remove 
the general subsidies on petroleum 
products, given the cost to the Indian 
exchequer and the distortions to the 
economy and, as in electricity, instead 
focus speciﬁc subsidies on those who 
have a real need. However, there is 
strong political and popular pressure 
to resist fuel price increases. Although 
petrol prices are deregulated, state-
owned reﬁners and fuel retailers 
nonetheless kept petrol prices on hold 
for around six months, through to May 
2012, despite sharp increases in crude 
prices. This meant that private sector 
retailers such as Essar could not 
compete on price without incurring 
losses, with the result that a number 
of Essar’s franchised retail outlets 
were forced to temporarily close. The 
state-owned retailers ﬁnally increased 
petrol prices by around 1 1% in May 
2012, allowing some outlets to reopen. 
Very heavy subsidies remain in 
diesel, where there has so far been 
no deregulation and indeed, there 
have been no increases in diesel prices 
since July 201 1. Once the Government 
tackles this issue, it will beneﬁt Essar 
Energy’s strategy to further roll out its 
retail business. In the reﬁning sector, 
demand for crude oil in India is forecast 
to rise from 164 mmt in 2010–1 1 to 
205 mmt in 2016–17 , according to the 
Planning Commission’s Approach to the 
12th Five Year Plan document, with the 
proportion of crude oil coming from 
imports rising from 76% to 80% over 
that period. Vehicle ownership is 
forecast to rise from 15 per 1,000  
of population currently, compared  
with China’s 55, according to the 
International Energy Agency. The rate 
of growth in vehicle sales in India is 
increasing sharply each year.
Although India will remain the principal 
market for Essar Energy’s expanded 
reﬁnery capacity, there is expected to 
be an increase in exports from Vadinar 
in the short-term to around 45% of 
sales due to new capacity being built 
by public sector reﬁners. Essar Energy 
expects demand to outstrip this new 
capacity within the next ﬁve years, and 
potentially earlier for products such as 
gasoil. Essar Energy welcomes the 
move to increase the quality of fuels in 
major urban areas to BS IV standard as 
this should increase domestic demand 
for higher quality products from the 
Vadinar reﬁnery. 
Increased global demand, the 
earthquake in Japan and events in the 
Middle East and North Africa pushed 
up reﬁning margins in the ﬁrst half of 
2011. The fourth quarter of 2011 saw 
weakening reﬁning margins driven by a 
number of factors including weakening 
demand for gasoline and naphtha, 
lower light/heavy crude spreads and 
the reintroduction of Libyan crude to 
the market. Following on from this, a 
recovery in margins during January 
and February 2012 was followed by 
weakness in March and April. It is 
likely that margins will remain volatile 
throughout 2012, with ongoing weak 
growth in the Western world but robust 
demand in Asia.
In our upstream Exploration and 
Production business, we continue 
to see slow progress in receiving 
approvals for our oil and gas blocks, 
including our Raniganj CBM block in 
West Bengal, where we are still awaiting 
ﬁnal environmental approval and gas 
sales price approval from the Indian 
Government. This is despite the high 
level of imports of oil and gas needed  
to meet demand in India which in turn  
is putting upward pressure on prices. 
This situation is expected to continue 
despite signiﬁcant discoveries of both 
oil and gas in India in recent years. 
Essar Energy has 10 of its 15 oil and 
gas blocks located in India and given 
the forecast increases in domestic 
demand, commercialisation of these 
assets continues to represent a 
signiﬁcant opportunity for Essar Energy.

Our strategy in action
Power
Solar plant at Bhuj
Essar Energy has commissioned its  
ﬁrst renewable energy project, a solar 
photovoltaic plant at Bhuj in Gujarat state. 
Power from the 1 MW project is being 
sold to the Gujarat state electricity utility, 
GUVNL, under a long-term PPA. The 
plant was built in less than two months 
at a cost of approximately US$2.2 million. 
It is clear that there will be an increasing 
longer term need for clean, renewable 
energy in India and this ﬁrst step in that 
sector will give the Company valuable 
experience. Then, as low carbon 
generation becomes more important in 
India, we will be better placed to play our 
part in that change.

Essar Oil’s non-fuel retail offering
Essar Oil has built a portfolio of 
approximately 1,400 retail fuel outlets 
in India, with another 200 under 
construction, which have beneﬁted 
from petrol price deregulation by the 
Government and will further beneﬁt if 
diesel prices are deregulated. To attract 
customers and provide additional income 
for its franchisees, Essar Oil has been 
increasing non-fuel retailing activities.  
The products on offer include engine 
lubricants, batteries, food and cold 
drinks, agricultural products such as 
pesticides, mobile phone recharge 
facilities, money transfer and other 
banking facilities. These offerings have 
proved very popular with customers.

Tori – promoting entrepreneurship
At Essar Energy’s Tori power project in 
Jharkhand state, an initiative is running 
in nearby villages to help people launch 
their own businesses by providing skills 
training, creating business opportunities 
and nurturing entrepreneurs. One 
example is Saro Kumari, pictured, a girl in 
the village of Angada, who was 15 years 
old when she joined an Essar training 
centre for women, covering stitching, 
cutting and tailoring. Today, Saro has her 
own tailoring centre and is able to support 
and help fund education for her siblings. 
Essar’s training center at Chatro village 
has now produced four entrepreneurs 
and Essar provides cloth from which they 
make school uniforms. The plan is to 
further develop this initiative.

Stanlow natural gas installation
As part of a drive to increase proﬁt 
margins and improve environmental 
performance at the Stanlow reﬁnery 
following its acquisition in 201 1, Essar 
Energy is bringing in a natural gas supply 
for the ﬁrst time to provide fuel for the 
six boilers on site and replace the fuel oil 
previously used. By June 2012, Essar 
was well advanced with installation of  
the new 3 kilometre, 12 inch diameter 
pipeline, through which natural gas 
will ﬂow. Overall the project involves 
a US$30 million investment. The 
introduction of natural gas will reduce 
sulphur and carbon emissions as well 
as cutting odour, nitrogen oxide and 
particulate emissions within the 
local community.
Exploration and Production
Raniganj community investment
The development of Essar’s CBM gas 
operations at Raniganj, West Bengal, 
brings its own challenges because of the 
large geographical spread of the gas 
wells being drilled – the area covers 500 
square kilometres and 25 villages. Essar 
is working hard to engage with these 
communities and invest in vital facilities. 
In healthcare, a mobile medical van 
caters for 2,200 patients per month. 
Health awareness workshops have 
been set up, helping over 1,500 women 
and adolescent girls, while tanker water 
is being provided to 600 households in 
four villages, helping combat summer 
drinking water shortages. On the 
environmental front, over 7 ,000 saplings 
have been planted at various locations 
around Raniganj.

Vadinar reﬁnery expansion
As part of the Vadinar reﬁnery expansion, 
the whole plant was shut down during 
September and October 2011 so the 
original base reﬁnery units could be tied 
into the new units and extensive routine 
maintenance also completed. This 
required precision delivery of a hugely 
complex plan which would normally 
take around 45–60 days but thanks to 
exceptionally well coordinated team 
work, it was completed in a record 35 
days, allowing production to be ramped 
up again. To deliver this turnaround,  
a team of about 15,000 worked 24 hours 
a day in shifts to complete 1,618 revamp 
tasks and 2,492 maintenance and 
inspection jobs involving about 190 
pieces of heavy machinery, cranes,

Key performance indicators
Strong Group revenue growth 
(including sales tax beneﬁt but 
before its subsequent reversal) up 
to US$22.0 billion (2010 12 months: 
US$10.0 billion), primarily due to 
higher reﬁning and marketing 
revenues in India from higher 
selling prices and volumes and 
the Stanlow reﬁnery acquisition.
The decrease in Operational EBITDA 
was driven by foreign exchange 
impact offset by additional three 
months of higher GRMs.
The increase in the Group’s CP 
EBITDA before exceptional items 
(see page 43) and other foreign 
exchange impact (see page 42) 
was caused by the additional three 
months trading in the 15 month 
period (compared with the 12 month 
period in 2010) and the inclusion of 
the Stanlow reﬁnery partially offset 
by the 35 day shut down of the 
Vadinar reﬁnery in September/
October 201 1. 
(Loss)/proﬁt before tax was primarily 
impacted by exceptional items of 
US$(1,276.7) million (See page 43) 
and the 14% depreciation of the 
Indian Rupee against the US dollar 
resulting in an operational foreign 
exchange loss of US$316.9 million. 
Excluding the impact of these 
factors, proﬁt before tax for the 
year was US$445.9 million. 
Capex increased by 1% to 
US$2.8 billion due to US$310 
million reduction in power capex 
which was largely offset by a 
US$204 million increase in Reﬁning 
and Marketing – India capex and 
US$61 million spent at the Stanlow 
reﬁnery post acquisition. 
Exploration and Production capex 
increased by US$72 million. Capex 
is expected to reduce sharply in the 
current ﬁnancial year as we reach 
the end of the current capex cycle.
The increase in borrowings is in 
line with funding requirements in 
respect of expansion projects in 
Power, Exploration and Production 
and Reﬁning and Marketing – India 
segment. The 14% depreciation 
of the Rupee from December 2010 
caused a reduction in loans of 
US$570.1 million compared with 
the exchange rate at 31 December 
2010 plus a US$321.5 million 
balance sheet impact from 
exceptional items.

The Vadinar reﬁnery had a throughput 
capacity of 17 . 1 mmtpa in 15 months 
ended 31 March 2012. Having 
completed its phase 1 expansion (March 
2012) and optimisation (June 2012) 
projects, it is now India’s second largest 
single-location reﬁnery, with an annual 
capacity of 20 mmtpa, or 405,000 bpd, 
up from 14.7 mmtpa/300,000 bpd 
previously, and a complexity of 1 1.8, 
up from 6. 1 previously. This puts the 
Vadinar reﬁnery amongst the world’s 
most complex reﬁneries. The Vadinar 
reﬁnery can now process a heavier 
crude diet and produce higher value, 
high-quality products, which will lead 
to increased reﬁning margins. 
Essar Energy has, through a franchise 
model, approximately 1,600 operating 
and under construction retail fuel outlets 
across India, selling petrol and diesel 
under the Essar brand. Additionally, 
the Company is increasing non-fuel

Operating review
In the Reﬁning and Marketing – 
India business, operational and 
project progress was excellent during 
the 15 month period. The Vadinar 
reﬁnery phase 1 expansion project was 
completed towards the end of March 
2012, increasing capacity to 18 mmtpa, 
or 375,000 bpd, and complexity to 
1 1.8 from 6. 1 previously. This will 
signiﬁcantly improve gross reﬁnery 
margins by allowing the percentage 
of lower cost heavy and ultra heavy 
crudes processed to rise to around 
80% of the total throughput, while at the 
same time permitting production of a 
greater proportion of high value middle 
and light distillate products, with middle 
distillates, diesel and jet fuel, becoming 
the principal products. 
It is expected that throughput 
from Vadinar will be approximately 
19 mmt/135 mmbbl of crude oil in the 
current ﬁnancial year from April 2012 
to March 2013.
The further optimisation project at 
Vadinar, to lift capacity to 20 mmtpa, or 
405,000 bpd, was completed in June 
2012, four months ahead of schedule. 
This project included the conversion of 
one original reﬁnery unit, a Visbreaker, 
into a crude distillation unit speciﬁcally 
designed to process ultra heavy crude, 
from the Mangala ﬁeld in Rajasthan. 
Completion of this project brings to an 
end the current capital expenditure

“Reﬁning growth  
projects 
completed.” 
In its fuel retail business, Essar Oil 
retails gasoline and gasoil/diesel 
in India under the Essar brand. 
At 31 March 2012, Essar Oil had 
approximately 1,400 operational retail 
outlets with approximately 200 more 
under construction. The operational 
sites include 17 Auto LPG and 
CNG stations.
During the 15 month period, Vadinar 
continued to operate at well above 
its previous nameplate capacity 
of 10.5 mmtpa. Despite a 35 day 
shutdown to allow the new phase 1 
expansion units to be tied in during 
September/October 201 1, the reﬁnery 
achieved a throughput during the 15 
month period of 17 . 1 mmt/125 mmbbl 
compared to 14.7 mmt/107 .2 mmbbl, 
in the 12 months of 2010. 
During the 15 month period, CP GRM 
improved to US$4.45 per barrel 
(excluding sales tax incentive) 
compared with a CP GRM of 
US$3.98 per barrel in 2010. 
The Vadinar reﬁnery processed 27 
varieties of crude during the period, 
including ultra-heavy and tough 
crudes. Around 11.7% of the crude 
slate comprised Mangala crude from 
the Barmer oilﬁeld in Rajasthan. 
Essar Oil continues to focus on the 
domestic market for the sale of its 
products because of the superior price 
realisation. However, export quantities 
from the Vadinar reﬁnery in the 15 
month period to March 2012 were 39% 
of the total sales quantity as compared 
to 31% in 2010. The majority of exports 
in 201 1–12 were fuel oil, but in 2012 post 
the upgrade in complexity, exports will 
consist primarily of higher value middle 
and light distillates, such as diesel 
and gasoline.
One of the key focus areas of the 
Vadinar reﬁnery team is to maximise 
the use of resources at the minimum 
cost, thereby improving proﬁtability. 
The Vadinar reﬁnery expansion  
meant that one major original unit, a 
Visbreaker, became redundant due to 
installation of a new delayed coker unit. 
Essar Oil therefore implemented 
an optimisation project to turn the 
Visbreaker into an additional Crude 
Distillation Unit dedicated to the 
exclusive processing of heavy and ultra 
heavy crudes. This has added another 
2 mmtpa of processing capacity while 
helping increase proﬁt margins.

Stanlow has a nameplate capacity of 
296,000 bpd but is currently operating 
at about 70% of this level. The Stanlow 
reﬁnery lies near to Liverpool, north 
west England, on the south bank of the 
Manchester ship canal and is the UK’s 
second largest oil reﬁnery. It supplies 
approximately 15% of the country’s 
transport fuel requirements. Reﬁned 
fuels from Stanlow are distributed 
across the UK, mainly by road 
and pipeline.
Essar Energy completed the acquisition 
of the Stanlow reﬁnery on 31 July 201 1. 
The Company then immediately began 
a 100 day evaluation, resulting in a clear 
plan to integrate the reﬁnery into Essar 
Energy and to identify opportunities to 
improve margins. These opportunities 
include a signiﬁcant broadening of the 
number of crude oils processed, 
including lower cost options, together 
with improvements to the product mix, 
energy efﬁciencies and some 
operational cost savings.

Operating review
During the ﬁrst eight months of 
ownership, to March 2012, Stanlow 
processed eight ‘opportunity’ injection 
crudes and completed a project to 
further improve its crude blending 
capability. The aim is to further expand 
the crude basket and, by being more 
ﬂexible in terms of the crude diet, 
to provide signiﬁcant economic 
advantages through the reduction of 
crude purchasing costs and enhanced 
utilisation of the reﬁnery’s capacity. 
In the ﬁrst eight months of ownership, 
Stanlow had a throughput of 
6.8 mmt/51.3 mmbbl of crude oil. 
CP GRMs were US$3.06 per barrel, 
representing a signiﬁcant premium to 
the International Energy Agency North 
West European benchmark margin of 
US$1.19 per barrel. 
On the product side, gasoline 
continues to be oversupplied in the 
Atlantic basin and as a result, Stanlow 
is seeking to diversify its customers 
and markets and to produce alternative 
products such as petrochemicals. 
Diesel and gasoil continue to be in high 
demand in Europe and the UK and the 
aim is to enhance the production of 
these products and place them in our 
domestic market. 
Work continues to install a natural 
gas supply into Stanlow to fuel the six 
boilers on site, which are currently run 
on fuel oil. This initiative is expected  
to be completed by the end of 2012,  
to deliver signiﬁcant environmental 
beneﬁts and improve margins. The 
task of installing a 3 kilometre, 12 inch 
diameter pipeline to transport the 
natural gas is now well advanced. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

“Stanlow reﬁnery 
fully integrated

It is expected that these, and other 
initiatives, will deliver approximately 
US$1 per barrel of margin beneﬁts  
in 2012–13 and a further US$1 per 
barrel in 2013–14, with the potential 
of a further US$1 per barrel thereafter. 
These 100 day plan improvements are 
to ensure that Stanlow will be net cash 
positive even when market conditions 
are at the bottom of the cycle and will 
provide attractive returns through the 
market cycle. 
The Stanlow reﬁnery, which is the 
second largest reﬁnery in the UK, is 
currently processing around 220,000 
bpd, which is approximately 70% of its 
296,000 bpd nameplate capacity. 
The consideration for the reﬁnery 
was US$350 million. The consideration 
is payable in cash and in two stages, 
with US$175 million, less adjustments 
reﬂecting certain costs associated 
with the Stanlow reﬁnery, paid on 
completion of the acquisition and 
US$175 million plus interest at the rate 
of LIBOR plus 4% payable on the date 
of the ﬁrst anniversary of completion. 
A separate payment of US$878 million 
was made for the crude and reﬁned 
product stock at the Stanlow reﬁnery 
site, based on market prices at the time 
of completion.
On 1 July 2011, Essar Oil UK entered 
into a US$1.5 billion three year secured 
revolving credit working capital facility. 
This facility was used to purchase the 
crude and reﬁned product stock at the 
Stanlow reﬁnery site at completion and 
may also be used to meet operational 
working capital requirements. 
Following the acquisition of the 
Stanlow reﬁnery, the second largest 
in the UK, Essar Energy embarked 
on a 100 day exercise to identify the 
key investments and improvements 
needed to deliver sustainably higher 
proﬁts in the future. The resulting 
‘100 Day Plan’ is now being 
implemented with the aim of 
delivering a sustainably proﬁtable 
reﬁnery lifecycle even during the 
lowest margin market environment. 
Around US$2–3 per barrel margin 
improvements within a three year 
time frame are being targeted. 
The focus of the plan includes 
reﬁnery capacity and utilisation 
improvements, reliability, cost 
reduction and inventory 
optimisation, with each aspect 
screened for feasibility and tested 
for value creation. The plan, created 
through a combination of strong 
operational excellence at Stanlow 
and Essar’s entrepreneurial spirit 
and business acumen, is already 
seeing the development of a reliable, 
proﬁtable and growing business 
underpinned by a strong 
safety culture.

Production focus is moving towards 
CBM where Essar Energy is the 
leading player in India with 2,733 
square kilometres of acreage and more 
than 10 tcf of reserves and resources 
across ﬁve CBM blocks.
In the Exploration and Production 
business, Essar Energy continues 
to evaluate ways of managing risk 
across the portfolio of oil and gas 
blocks it currently owns, with a view to 
maintaining a stronger focus on India. 
Essar Energy’s Exploration and 
Production business currently has 
approximately 2. 1 billion barrels of oil 
equivalent of reserves and resources, 
spread across a portfolio of 15 offshore 
and onshore oil and gas blocks. Within 
this, during the 15 month period there 
was a sharp uplift in the total of 2P and 
2C resources to 209 mmboe from 
150 mmboe previously following a fresh 
independent evaluation of the Raniganj 
CBM block in West Bengal, by 
international consultants Netherland, 
Sewell & Associates, Inc. (‘NSAI’).
Within the overall portfolio, there 
are also 929 mmboe of best estimate 
prospective resources and just 
under 1,000 mmboe of unrisked, 
in-place resources.
At Raniganj, Essar Energy’s ﬁrst CBM 
project to be brought into development, 
total 2P proven and probable reserves, 
as evaluated by NSAI in September 
201 1, are 1 13 bcf gross, or 18.8 mmboe, 
while best estimate 2C contingent 
resources are 445 bcf gross, or 
7 4. 1 mmboe. This compares with the 
previous evaluation in December 2009, 
also by NSAI, which showed only 
201 bcf gross, or 34 mmboe, of 2C 
resources. The latest evaluation also 
shows that there also remains 297 bcf 
gross, or 49 mmboe, of best estimate 
prospective resources of gas at 
Raniganj. In addition, NSAI also 
upgraded the caloriﬁc value of the gas 
from 8,500 kcal/scm to 9,660 kcal/scm. 
Current production at Raniganj is 
around 25,000 scm/d, reduced to 
minimise ﬂaring while test sales through 
a pipeline to the Durgapur industrial 
estate are continuing. Once all 
clearances have been received peak 
production is expected to be around 
3 million scm/d. A provisional gas price 
for test sales of US$5.25/mmbtu plus 
US$1.00/mmbtu for transportation 
charges has been approved by the 
Government of India for incidental 
gas produced during phase II. The 
Government is now in the process 
of making a decision on the full 
commercial sales price for Raniganj and 
other CBM developers in India. As part 
of this process, Essar Energy completed 
a gas price discovery exercise in 
accordance with Government policy. 
To date, Essar Energy has consents for 
73 wells, which have been drilled, and is 
in the process of getting environmental 
approval to extend this to 500 wells, 
which will be required to achieve full 
production. The full ﬁeld development 
plan has already been approved by

A key task at Essar Energy’s CBM

gas ﬂows. Here, the Company has 
introduced an innovative ﬂow 
measurement solution – so-called ‘V’ 
Cone type ﬂow meters, rather than 
the conventional oriﬁce type of meter, 
marking a new development for coal 
bed methane production in India. 
This type of meter works better in 
wells which have higher volumes of 
water and where pressures are lower, 
such as Raniganj. The V Cone also 
has a far lower maintenance 
requirement and delivers more 
accurate measurements over its likely 
lifespan of 25–30 years than the 
conventional meters, resulting in 
lower operating costs.

2012, a solar photovoltaic plant at Bhuj 
in Gujarat state. Power from the 1 MW 
project is being sold to GUVNL, under 
a long-term PPA. The plant was built at 
a cost of approximately US$2.2 million. 
This will give Essar Energy valuable 
experience of running renewable 
energy generation, given that there will 
be an increasing longer term need for 
clean, renewable energy in India.

commissioning coal (which was not 
included in the original budget).
Coal for Salaya I is due to come 
from the Aries coal mine in Indonesia, 
which was acquired in April 2010. The 
company received ‘in principle’ Pinjam 
Pakai (forest) approval for the Aries mine 
during October 201 1 and received ﬁnal 
approval on 8 June 2012, with ﬁrst coal 
now expected within 9–12 months. 
Construction of supporting road and 
port infrastructure in Indonesia is 
continuing. Until coal can be supplied 
from the Aries mine, Salaya I will be 
supplied with fuel under a contract 
with Essar Shipping and Logistics 
Limited, Cyprus. 
Essar Energy continues to await certain 
regulatory approvals from the Indian 
Government for the dedicated Salaya 
coal import jetty, near to the power 
project. Alternative temporary 
arrangements have been made to 
import coal from other nearby ports 
and for onward delivery by road to the 
Salaya site. The delay in obtaining the 
regulatory approvals has also impacted 
construction of the sea water pipeline 
to meet the plant’s water requirements 
and temporary arrangements have 
been made to source water from the 
nearby Narmada River instead. To 
mitigate these issues, and also to 
mitigate the adverse impact of the new 
Indonesian coal pricing law on its PPA 
with the Gujarat state electricity utility, 
GUVNL, Essar Power is planning to 
operate Salaya I at a lower load factor 
of around 65%. 
Domestic coal projects 
Mahan 1 – 1,200 MW
Unit 1 of 600 MW is expected to 
begin commercial operations in July. 
As disclosed in the 31 December 201 1 
interim ﬁnancial statements, the 
commissioning of Unit 2, also 600 MW, 
will be linked to the availability of coal 
(see below). Also as disclosed in the 
31 December 201 1 interim ﬁnancial 
statements, costs at Mahan I have 
increased by US$153 million, or 14.7%, 
over the previously announced capital 
costs. This was due to increases in 
interest costs during construction and 
pre-operative expenses, acquisition of 
commissioning coal and development 
of logistics and road infrastructure and 
the transmission line of around 45 
kilometres which were not envisaged 
in the original budget.
Captive power projects
Essar Energy has ﬁve captive power 
projects operational, with a further 
three in construction. 
Operational, total 1,600 MW
Hazira (515 MW) and Bhander 
(500 MW) are primarily captive to 
the Essar Steel plant at Hazira, while 
Vadinar (120 MW) and Vadinar P1 
(380 MW) are captive to the Essar Oil 
reﬁnery at Vadinar. Algoma (85 MW), 
is captive to the Essar Steel plant at 
Algoma, Canada.
Under construction, total 900 MW
Vadinar P2 (510 MW) is primarily 
captive to the Essar Oil reﬁnery at 
Vadinar; Hazira II (270 MW), is captive 
to the Essar Steel plant at Hazira; and 
Paradip (120 MW), is captive to Essar 
Steel’s facility at Paradip, Orissa state.
All the operational captive plants 
performed well in the 15 month 
period, with the key measure of plant 
availability between 93% and 99%. 
Generation in the 15 month period 
from Essar’s portfolio was 7 ,907 
MU/7 .91 GWh, compared with 6,624 
MU/6.62 GWh, in the 12 months for 
2010. The pro-rata reduction in 
generation was primarily due to lower 
demand for power from the Bhander 
and Hazira I gas-ﬁred stations in 
Gujarat due to higher gas prices 
and import through UI, against 
export in the previous period.
The smaller 85 MW gas-ﬁred plant at 
Algoma, Canada, providing power for 
Essar Steel, again performed well with 
generation for the 15 month period at 
671 MWh, a similar level to 2010.
Of the power and steam produced from 
the Vadinar P2 plant, the fuel cost can 
be passed through to customers in 
respect of 391 MW, comprising Essar 
Oil (301 MW) and Essar Steel (90 MW). 
Essar Oil will beneﬁt from power and 
steam generated from the Vadinar P2 
power plant as it provides the lowest 
cost option for the Vadinar reﬁnery, 
thereby contributing positively to the 
reﬁnery’s GRMs. The balance of the 
power (1 19 MW) will be sold as 
merchant power. 
These captive projects deliver 
stable revenues with payments 
based on availability, rather than 
on power generated, and the fuel 
price and delivery risk lies with the 
power purchaser.
Imported coal projects
Salaya I – 1,200 MW
Unit 1 of 600 MW was fully 
commissioned in early April 2012. Unit 
2, also of 600 MW, was commissioned 
in June 2012. As disclosed in the 
31 December 2011 interim ﬁnancial 
statements, costs at Salaya I increased 
by US$84 million, or 8%, over the 
previously announced ﬁgure due  
to increases in interest during  Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

According to reports, Essar Energy 
was given provisional approval at the 
end of May 2012 for stage 1 forest 
clearance for its Mahan coal block, 
which was previously assigned to the 
power project by the Government to 
provide captive fuel for the Mahan I 
power station. However, no ofﬁcial 
notiﬁcation has yet been received from 
the Government of India, and our 
understanding is that the ﬁnal decision 
will be taken by the Indian Cabinet. 
Delays in granting such clearances 
have delayed the development of a 
number of coal blocks and power 
projects in India. 
Once we receive conﬁrmation of stage 
1 forest clearance, it will still take 15–18 
months to produce ﬁrst coal from the 
Mahan block. In the meantime, fuel for 
the Mahan I plant will be supplied from 
alternative sources. We currently have 
186,000 tonnes of domestic e-auction 
coal at the site and we are also in the 
process of ordering imported coal.
In addition to e-auction and imported 
coal, Essar Energy has applied for 
medium term allocations of coal under 
Coal India’s tapering coal linkage 
system to provide us with sufﬁcient 
coal to cover the period until our own 
mining activities are operational. We are 
continuing to pursue this application. 
To ensure that we can transport 
sufﬁcient coal to the Mahan site 
until the captive coal mine is fully 
operational, we continue with work 
on infrastructure investments, primarily 
road strengthening, to facilitate 
movement of coal to Mahan from 
the railway terminal delivery points at 
Singrauli and Mahdeiya, a distance of 
around 50–60 kilometres. This work 
will allow the plant to operate on an 
economic basis until the Mahan coal 
block can be brought into production.
For the ﬁrst year post-commissioning, 
it is expected that approximately 2.25 
mmt of imported and domestic coal will 
be delivered to Mahan I. Given these 
coal constraints, Unit 1 of the plant will 
be run at a high plant load factor to 
optimise operating efﬁciencies and Unit 
2 will be commissioned and operated 
after the monsoon has ﬁnished, by 
which time we expect the logistics 
constraints to ease. As the infrastructure 
constraints are removed, coal volumes 
and load factors will be increased. 
Tori I – 1,200 MW and Tori II – 
600 MW
The Tori I and Tori II projects in 
Jharkhand state are due to be 
completed by March 2014. As at the 
end of May 2012, Tori I was 38.8% 
complete and Tori II 15.7% complete. 
Coal for these projects will be supplied 
from the nearby captive coal blocks at 
Chakla and Ashok Karkata. Essar 
Energy is currently awaiting forest 
clearance and environmental consents 
from the Indian Government in order 
that mining operations can begin. 
These delays in securing approvals 
will require alternative sources of coal 
to be obtained in the ﬁrst year. 
As required, e-auction coal will be 
purchased to provide fuel for this 
project and an application has also 
been made for coal under the 
tapering coal linkage system.
Later stages power projects
As disclosed in the 31 December 
201 1 interim ﬁnancial statements, 
due to regulatory delays in the 
Indian power sector, and to ensure 
efﬁcient deployment of capital, Essar 
Energy has decided to progress the 
construction of three of its later stage 
power projects at Salaya II, Salaya III and 
Navabharat I, totalling 2,970 MW, which 
were due to be commissioned in 2014, 
only against certain milestones. There 
have been continued delays in securing 
regulatory approvals, particularly relating 
to the environment and coal sourcing, 
and also delays in land acquisition 
approvals at Navabharat I. The total 
investment cost of the three projects  
is c.US$3. 1 billion. 
Salaya I unit 1 
commissioning 
challenges
The power team showed great 
innovative skill in overcoming a series 
of challenges as they prepared for 
commissioning of the 1,200 MW 
Salaya I project in Gujarat, which is 
Essar Energy’s ﬁrst thermal coal 
power plant in India. These included 
major voltage problems with the 
transmission line, solved by building  
a temporary 33,000 volt line from 
Essar’s nearby Vadinar reﬁnery, 
which allowed various key units to  
be commissioned and saved four 
months potential delay. Similar 
ingenuity was shown in the way 
the Salaya team secured temporary 
supplies of river water for cooling, 
due to delays with sourcing sea 
water, and also in the deployment  
of temporary coal handling 
systems. As a result, the time from 
commencement of construction of 
the structure to synchronisation of 
the ﬁrst 600 MW unit with the grid 
was only 29 months.

Essar Energy is the ﬁrst to recognise 
the degree of challenge associated 
with building and operating a major 
portfolio of oil and gas, exploration and 
production and power assets in India. 
Such large-scale activities, more than 
most, inevitably impact the people and 
communities in the areas where they 
take place.
We are equally clear that the Company 
and its employees must meet these 
challenges, and ensure that our 
strategy, business and operations are 
founded on a culture of responsible 
behaviour towards all our stakeholders. 
We know that without this, we cannot 
create sustainable value.
As we make clear in our accompanying 
ﬁrst annual sustainability report, 
published in tandem with this main 
annual report, there has been 
signiﬁcant progress in seeking to 
meet these objectives. Our 2011–12 
sustainability report can be accessed 
at www.essarenergy.com.
Our aim is to ensure we have a 
positive impact – whether on 
individuals, communities or the 
environment – and that by careful 
management, we minimise risks.
How can we do this? One way is to 
continually benchmark ourselves 
against best practices in our industries 
and in our communities, whether in 
India or overseas. Another way is to 
keep challenging ourselves to do 
better, to ask how performance can 
be improved and to encourage 
positive change.
Our ﬁrst sustainability report carries a 
great deal more detail on all of our CSR 
activities. While this is a positive step 
forward, we recognise that we have a 
great deal more to improve on what we 
do and the quality of reporting in the 
vital areas of our business. This section 
of the main annual report is intended to 
summarise our approach, policies and 
performance across the principal areas 
of health and safety, the environment 
and our communities, including our ‘3E 
framework’ spanning entrepreneurship, 
environment and education.
Health and safety
Health and safety continues to be one 
of our critical sustainability priorities. 
The objective is an injury-free and 
healthy workplace, promoted by 
institutionalising a culture of safety. 
Health and safety is an integral part of 
the management of business and is 
given equal importance alongside 
proﬁts, costs, production and quality. 
During the 15 month period to 
March 2012, there was a particular 
focus on managing safety issues 
among contractors. Here, there is an 
ongoing push to ensure competency 
assessments are carried out for those 
involved in safety critical jobs and these 
were made mandatory for certain trades 
such as riggers, crane operators, 
welders and electricians. 
More broadly, health and safety training 
is carried out through a variety of 
means, including online, classroom-
based and on site. During the 15 
month period to March 2012, there 
were 5,146 health and safety training 
sessions given to employees, against 
3,703 the previous year, and 5,504 
sessions given to contractors, against 
4,961 the previous year.
The result has been a very low level  
of incidents. There were only six LTI 
incidents across the entire business  
in the ﬁnancial year 2011–12.

education is one of our  
main sustainability priorities. ”

Given the need for businesses of 
all kinds to make a real contribution 
to tackling climate change and the 
importance of this to business 
performance and growth in future, 
Essar Energy has taken action and will 
continue to take action to ensure it is 
well positioned.
After a detailed structured GHG 
accounting process and disclosure 
at the CDP , following international 
protocols, Essar Oil, Essar Power 
and Essar Oil UK are working towards 
a robust GHG management system. 
This is aimed at delivering results on 
a year on year basis and to show 
their positioning in relation to industry 
standards. CDP ranked Essar Oil the 
best in carbon management in India in 
the energy sector during the year 201 1. 
Essar Oil gradually intends to build GHG 
reduction targets to operational levels, 
requiring each operation to assess their 
respective GHG performance and to 
look for best practices to monitor, 
inventories, report and own the GHG 
emissions due to its operations.

resources and biodiversity.
Community
There are several strands to our 
drive to increase our support for the 
communities in which we operate. 
Among these, we see encouraging 
entrepreneurship as highly important. 
This is something that can enable 
entire communities especially when 
combined with improvements in 
education, infrastructure, increasing 
women’s empowerment and 
better healthcare. 
Essar Energy is active in developing 
initiatives in all of these areas, with a 
particular focus on communities or 
individuals in India from whom land has 
been acquired to facilitate development 
of the Company’s operations and in 
neighbouring communities. Projects 
include provision of water supplies to 
villages in times of drought, strong 
support of various kinds for schools 
and establishment or support for 
institutions which can help develop 
entrepreneurial and business skills.
Again, more detail on these initiatives is

Essar Energy’s Stanlow reﬁnery has 
been lauded by the leader of a top 
UK health and safety organisation – 
and has broken new records for its 
safety track record.
Stanlow, acquired by Essar Energy 
on 31 July 201 1, has registered no LTI 
incidents since the acquisition, and 
overall has recently passed 10 million 
man hours without an LTI incident. As 
reﬁnery general manager Jon Mason 
told a town hall meeting of all workers, 
this represents more than two years 
without an LTI incident and shatters 
the record for the site.
Stanlow was visited recently by the 
chair of the UK’s Health and Safety 
Executive, Judith Hackitt, who 
praised the work taking place at the 
reﬁnery to train young apprentices, 
whose work will engage them in 
some tasks where health and safety 
really can be a matter of life or death. 
Ms Hackitt, who herself worked in  
the chemical industry for more than 
30 years, said that it was crucial that 
the risks involved in working on 
hazardous processes were properly 
understood and praised Stanlow’s 
approach to this. She stressed that 
health and safety should not be seen 
as an add-on but as a fundamental 
part of doing a job and went on to 
say that this was a key element of 
apprenticeship training, to ensure  
that young apprentices learned  
how to carry out their roles safely  
and efﬁciently.

appetite to undertake activities subject 
to risk and uncertainty, resides with the

Repayment of sales tax incentive collected amounting to US$1.19 billion and 
potential interest thereon
Implication
The eligibility of Essar Oil to participate in the Sales Tax 
Incentive Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) was challenged by the 
Government of Gujarat in the Supreme Court of India, 
following a judgment by the High Court of Gujarat which 
conﬁrmed that Essar Oil was eligible to participate in the 
Scheme. The case was heard at the end of 2011 and, on  
17 January 2012, the Supreme Court of India set aside the 
previous judgment of the High Court of Gujarat and ruled 
that the Group could no longer participate in the Scheme. 
Essar Oil was served notice by the Government of Gujarat  
on 24 January 2012 requiring it to pay the outstanding sales 
tax liability of US$1,188.2 million plus associated interest of 
US$396.0 million. 
Mitigation
On 8 May 2012, Essar Oil ﬁled a writ petition before the High 
Court of Gujarat seeking directions on repaying the sales tax by 
instalments and for remission of interest. This writ petition was 
admitted by the Gujarat High Court on 1 1 May 2012. Pending 
the outcome of the petition, the signiﬁcant uncertainties around 
the ﬁnal outcome and the legal advice received by Essar Oil, the 
interest demanded by the sales tax authorities which amounts 
to US$396.0 million (Rs. 20.25 billion) up to 31 March 2012 has 
been treated as a contingent liability and we do not believe that 
material interest will be payable.
Essar Oil is in the advanced stages of arranging a new 
c.US$1 billion (Rs. 50 billion) bank term loan facility. This 
facility is being put in place as a contingency measure for

Compliance with regulation and obtaining licences and permits 
Implication
All of the Group’s operations are extensively regulated and 
the delivery of our strategy is largely dependent on obtaining 
the appropriate permits, approvals and licenses to complete 
our expansion projects, complying with their conditions and 
the exploration and development of oil, gas and coal blocks.
The failure to obtain or comply with the terms of such 
permits and approvals would prevent the Group from 
achieving its growth targets and could ultimately lead to 
the impairment of existing assets.
Mitigation
The Group closely monitors compliance with regulatory 
requirements across its business and heads of each 
business division and operations conﬁrm compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations on a quarterly basis.
The need for permits, approvals and licenses for expansion 
projects and the exploration and development of oil, gas and 
coal blocks is assessed prior to undertaking any works or 
investments. The ability to obtain the necessary regulatory 
approvals to successfully deliver our strategic goals on time 
is largely out of the control of our senior management. 
However, Essar Energy continues to have a successful
working relationship with national, state and local authorities 
and expects to obtain all necessary approvals.
To further strengthen the framework for regulatory 
compliance, the oil and power businesses have recently 
embarked upon the implementation of compliance systems 
which would enable the key stakeholders to jointly review the 
status of key compliance requirements and clearances 
required for timely project execution. The critical activities 
and action plans including matters requiring management 
attention and decision making are reviewed at the PRMs.
Our ability to complete major projects on time and within budget
Implication
The Group is reliant on the completion of major projects to 
maintain its projected growth levels. In particular, there is a 
need to ensure projects are managed on time, including the 
delivery by contractors and suppliers, and within budget
using efﬁcient technologies to achieve the required 
speciﬁcations. If projects are not executed on time and to 
budget, the planned growth and proﬁtability of the Group will 
not be achieved.
Mitigation
Progress on all major projects is monitored on a monthly 
basis by the relevant project managers at the PRMs. Critical 
issues are also discussed at the Monthly Review Committee 
which is attended by all members of the Essar Energy Senior 
Management team.
The Group has contracted the management and 
construction of major projects to specialist expert project 
management and EPC contractors who are related parties. 
The risk of overruns is further mitigated through entering 
turnkey contracts with these contractors and suppliers.
Reﬁnery expansion project – Oil and Gas business:
The Vadinar reﬁnery optimisation project to enhance the 
reﬁnery processing capacity to 20 mmtpa was completed 
four months ahead of the scheduled completion date of 
30 September 2012.
Exploration and Production – Oil and Gas business:
Within the Exploration and Production business, the 
Company is actively pursuing efforts to obtain environmental 
clearances required to ensure timely completion of the 
project for production of gas from CBM in Raniganj, West 
Bengal. In the event of any signiﬁcant delays in obtaining  
the required environmental clearance and government 
approval for the gas price, the Company has the option 
under the Gas Supply and Purchase Agreement to  
renegotiate contractual terms.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Funding requirements for future operations and growth
Implication
The Group operates in a capital intensive industry and has 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancing requirements. This requires continued 
access to commercial banking facilities, capital markets and 
maintenance of short-term working capital funding. 
Oil:
Financial closure is pending on certain key projects (Raniganj 
CBM project and HMU).
Power:
The current Power sector environment and signiﬁcant 
lender’s exposure to the Power sector makes fund raising 
challenging. The Company requires funding to cover the cost 
of overruns on power projects.
Mitigation
The Group has historically successfully rolled over facilities  
in line with market practice and retains good banking 
relationships. Banking covenants are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis to monitor compliance.
Recently the Group has reﬁnanced a US$450 million bridge 
loan which was due in December 2012 with a new US$300 
million three year secured loan facility and US$150 million of 
internal cash resources. Separately, the Group has also 
signed a US$250 million 3.5 year subordinated unsecured 
loan facility with Essar Global for general corporate purposes. 
The facility is currently undrawn, but can be drawn in full or in 
part at any time during the 3.5 year life of the facility to meet 
any shortfall in project and working capital ﬁnancing.
Oil:
The successful commissioning of the Vadinar reﬁnery marks 
an inﬂexion point in the Group’s capital expenditure cycle and 
is expected to augment the cash ﬂows over the foreseeable 
future. While ﬁnancial closure is achieved on most projects, 
there are a few projects (Raniganj, HMU) where the Group is 
pursuing efforts to achieve ﬁnancial closure. Essar Oil’s efforts 
to achieve CDR exit is at an advanced stage and this is 
expected to further boost fund raising ability. The Company 
also maintains working capital and cash ﬂow projections to 
identify funding requirements and ensure facilities are 
available to meet short-term funding needs.
Power:
For projects with cost overruns, the Company is engaged in 
discussions with lenders for ﬁnancing of cost overruns. Cost 
overrun funding has been largely secured for one project 
(Mahan) and discussions are at an advanced stage for 
another project (Salaya). Efforts are also underway to secure 
a facility for development of the Aries coal mine in Indonesia.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
Implication
The price of feedstock, natural gas, and imported coal 
needed to run the Group’s power operations and crude oil 
required for the production of reﬁned petroleum products are 
generally denominated in or tied to the US dollar.
Additionally, the Group’s functional and presentational 
currency is the US dollar. Therefore, it also faces translation
risk to the extent assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of 
its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the 
US dollar.
Depreciation in the Indian Rupee against the US dollar 
has resulted in an increase in project costs of ongoing 
power projects.
Mitigation
Each business division enters into forward foreign exchange 
contracts to cover foreign currency payments and receipts 
as well as to manage foreign exchange risks associated 
with anticipated sales, purchase and borrowings in 
foreign currencies.
The Monthly Review Committee monitors the level of exposure 
to foreign exchange rate ﬂuctuations across the business and 
makes recommendations in respect of future hedging.
Post the recent sudden depreciation in the Indian Rupee, the 
Company has re-evaluated its foreign currency exposures at 
a project level and hedging levels have been identiﬁed based 
on project IRRs to be maintained/protected. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Challenging business environment
Implication
The general business environment in which the Group and 
its businesses operate is challenging thereby putting a strain 
on the Group’s cash ﬂows and operating margins. Within the 
Company’s oil business, product reﬁning margins are
under severe pressure and exposed to market volatility. 
Availability of fuel for power plants is challenging the Group’s 
ability to operate its power plants proﬁtably.
Mitigation
Improve operating efﬁciencies aimed at margin enhancements 
(e.g. diversifying the crude basket and cross functional 
integration of businesses). 
Constantly evaluate the macroeconomic scenario through 
sensitivity analysis and re-align the strategy to meet business
priorities (e.g. decision to defer certain power projects until 
certain milestones are achieved).
Secure alternative channels for fuel supplies. 
Reliance on Essar Global and afﬁliated Essar Group companies as major suppliers 
and customers and managing conﬂicts of interest
Implication
The Power business, in particular, is dependent on Essar 
Group companies as major suppliers and customers. The 
loss of this relationship could have a signiﬁcant impact on the 
Group’s continued success. In addition, as the controlling 
shareholder, Essar Global may have conﬂicting interests 
with the Company. 
Mitigation
The Group has a close working relationship with 
Essar Global with representation of senior Essar Global 
members on the Board. There are also long-term contractual 
arrangements with Essar Global and other Essar companies 
to ensure the Company’s interests remain protected. 
The Group has robust processes for entering into transactions 
with afﬁliated companies on an arm’s length basis. 
Commercial and reputational damage as a result of Health, Safety or 
Environmental incident or conﬂicts with local communities
Implication
The Group is at risk of commercial and reputational damage 
as a result of Health, Safety or Environmental incident given 
the nature of its operations. Further, relationships built with 
local communities in locations where the Company operates 
need to be maintained to avoid any operational disruptions. 
The loss of conﬁdence any incident might create could have 
an adverse effect on the overall valuation of the Group and
its ability to work effectively with local and national 
authorities.
As a UK listed entity, the Company is required to comply with 
cross border regulatory requirements (e.g. the UK Bribery Act). 
The Company needs to ensure that these are adhered to.
Mitigation
The Group has a formal HSE policy with related HSEMS in 
place. These are communicated to the relevant businesses 
and employees with training provided on regular basis. 
Regular reviews are carried out of compliance with the HSE 
policy and related HSEMS as well as adherence to regulatory 
requirements. The HSE Committee reports directly to the 
Board, which ultimately monitors the effectiveness of various 
policies and systems.
The results of safety and other inspections of the Company’s 
power plants and reﬁneries are frequently reviewed by the 
Group’s senior management to assess the actions taken to 
close the gaps.
Tools are in place to monitor emissions from plants and 
reﬁneries. Medical expertise and support is available at 
all locations.
The Group works closely with local communities to maintain 
relationships and to ensure that concerns are heard and 
acted upon on a timely basis. 
The Group has recently drawn up a detailed anti-corruption 
policy and code of conduct which has been rolled out across all 
areas of operations including the key decision making personnel 
at various sites. Additionally, all senior management personnel 
are subject to ongoing communications and training to build 
awareness of the Company’s anti-corruption and bribery 
policies and procedures. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Principal risks and uncertainties
Oil and Gas business risks
Inability to achieve the planned GRMs/cracks
Implication
The Oil and Gas business is dependent on the margin 
between crude oil prices and reﬁned petroleum product prices 
to maintain proﬁtability. Operating efﬁciency and access to 
crude oil of the required quantity, quality and prices has a 
signiﬁcant impact on the Company’s performance. 
Whilst reﬁned product normally tracks changes in feedstock 
prices, there is normally a lag which could seriously impact 
short-term working capital and proﬁtability. 
Mitigation
The Oil and Gas business uses long-term contracts as 
well as open international markets to source crude oil at 
competitive prices. Management prepare four month rolling 
plans on a weekly basis to identify any changes in risk proﬁle 
and take appropriate action on a timely basis. 
Essar Oil and Essar Oil UK each have a risk management 
committee which meets weekly to take decisions on 
commodity hedging.
Breach of sanctions on Iranian crude
Implication
The Group has met 33% of its overall crude requirements 
from Iranian suppliers. Recent sanctions on Iranian crude
could impact continuity of crude supplies and consequently 
the achievement of planned GRMs.
Mitigation
The Group has re-evaluated its crude procurement strategy 
in the light of recent international sanctions on imports of 
Iranian crude. Overall, a 15% reduction has been made in the 
quantum of term crude imports from Iran. To compensate for
the shortfall in Iranian crude, Essar Oil is looking at alternative 
options including increasing the proportion of tough and 
heavy crudes which are considered suitable for processing 
by the Vadinar reﬁnery post expansion.  Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Power business risks
Coal availability and logistical challenges associated with coal transportation
Implication
The Group’s Power business is on track to commission 
6,700 MW of power by the end of March 2014. Delays in the 
start of mining activities within the allocated coal blocks due 
to regulatory clearances in both India and overseas has 
resulted in the Group having to seek alternative coal sourcing 
arrangements with a potential impact on proﬁtability.
Changes in regulatory requirements relating to coal  
access/pricing (e.g. Indonesia) have resulted in higher  
overall fuel costs.
Mitigation
Essar Power is in constant discussions with the Committee 
nominated by the Empowered Group of Ministers on 
securing tapering coal linkages.
Essar Power has also started work on developing the road 
infrastructure to overcome the logistical challenges 
associated with transportation of coal procured through 
e-auction and imports.
Further, Essar Power has set up a coal trading desk to 
manage both domestic and imported coal procurement 
across projects.
The Group is proactively taking steps to seek enhancements 
in tariffs under PPAs.
Reliance on a few major customers
Implication
The Power business supplies to a small number of large 
customers under PPAs. In particular, there is a signiﬁcant 
relationship with GUVNL in respect of the provision of power. 
The Company has in the past experienced payment 
difﬁculties for services provided to GUVNL, which if 
continued could have a signiﬁcant impact on the Company’s 
results. There is also an ongoing litigation case with GUVNL, 
which may result in ﬁnancial losses.
Mitigation
The litigation with GUVNL continues to be ongoing at the date 
of this report. To date the court rulings have been largely in 
favour of the Company and the Board consider the need for 
appropriate provisions at ﬁnancial reporting period end.
The Group has tight monitoring controls over receipt of 
overdue amounts from customers and litigation is 
undertaken where necessary.  Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Revenues (including sales tax beneﬁt but before its subsequent reversal) – Group
Essar Energy increased revenue (before reversal of sales tax beneﬁt) by US$11.9 billion in the 15 month period ended 
31 March 2012, compared to the 12 month period to December 2010. Of this amount, US$6.4 billion reﬂected the acquisition 
of the Stanlow reﬁnery and US$5.5 billion was the increase in revenue attributable to the Vadinar reﬁnery (before the reversal 
of the sales tax beneﬁt).
Revenues – Power
Power revenues increased in 2011–12 by US$34.7 million to US$356.5 million from US$321.8 million in 2010 (after eliminating 
inter-segmental revenues for the current period of US$60.4 million (2010: US$27 .8 million). On a 12 month pro rata basis 
revenue has decreased, due to lower UI in Bhander Power (US$23.5 million) compared to 2010 and adverse foreign exchange 
differences (US$12.9 million). Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

4 In VPCL Base Plant and Ph1, method of computing equivalent units of Power and PLF have been revised. Previous period ﬁgures CY2010 have been revised accordingly.
5 Salaya I generation under trial run.
Operationally, all plants performed well in 2011–12, with the key measure of plant availability between 93% and 99%. Given  
the issues of high gas prices and low gas availability from India’s KG-D6 ﬁeld, overall generation from Essar’s portfolio in the  
15 month period was 7 ,907 MU. This compares with 6,624 MU generated in the 12 months of 2010. The pro rata reduction in 
generation was primarily due to lower demand for power from the Bhander and Hazira I gas-ﬁred stations in Gujarat due to 
higher gas prices and import through UI, against export in the previous period. 
The smaller 85 MW gas-ﬁred plant at Algoma, Canada, providing power for Essar Steel’s plant, again performed well with 
generation for the 15 month period at 671 MWh.
Revenues – Exploration and Production
Revenues were primarily impacted by lower production from the CB-ON/3 ﬁeld in Gujarat which led to decreased sales of 8,696 
barrels in the 15 months of 201 1–12 from 9,616 barrels in 2010, due to delays in receiving replacement sub-surface pumps. 
Revenues (including sales tax beneﬁt but before its subsequent reversal) – Reﬁning and Marketing – India
Reﬁning and Marketing – India revenues (including sales tax beneﬁt but before its subsequent reversal) increased by 
US$5,564 million from US$9,681 million in 2010 to US$15,245 million in the 15 months to March 2012. This was primarily as a 
result of an increase in the quantity of the products sold and higher product prices partly offset by decreased sales of traded 
products. In more detail: 
 US$3,936 million increase due to increases in the selling price of reﬁnery products. The average selling price of reﬁnery 
products was US$891/MT during the 15 month to March 2012 as against US$647/MT in 2010
 US$1,483 million increase in sales quantity of reﬁnery products. During the 15 month period ended March 2012 (including 
the 35 day scheduled shutdown), 16,113 KT of petroleum product was sold, again 13,819 KT in 2010 
 US$46 million increase in sales tax beneﬁt mainly due to an increase in selling prices and the higher quantity of products 
sold as compared to the comparative period
 Increase of US$143 million in traded crude oil sales
 US$151 million decrease in traded products sales
 Increase in Duty Draw Back Income of US$8 million

EBITDA
Operational EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and any non-operational items. 
Non-operational items include the reversal of the sales tax beneﬁt, the bargain purchase on acquiring the Stanlow reﬁnery, the 
gain on settlement liabilities and in addition, in 2010, the foreign exchange gain on conversion of the IPO proceeds in to US 
dollars and the proﬁt on available for sale investments.
Adjusted EBITDA removes the other foreign exchange impact (see page 42) and the deferred sales tax beneﬁt recognised in

The Group’s Operational EBITDA before adjustment for loss of sales tax beneﬁt decreased by US$22.7 million, or 3.17%, 
in the 15 months ended March 2012 compared to the 12 months ended December 2010.
Operational EBITDA – Power
Power’s operational EBITDA in the 15 months to March 2012 was higher by US$9.0 million at US$222.5 million than the 
US$213.5 million in the 12 months of 2010. Pro rata, this represented a decrease of 17%. This reduction in pro rata operational 
EBITDA was largely driven by the signiﬁcant Rupee depreciation during the period which created foreign exchange losses of 
US$43.8 million (2010: gain US$16.7 million) on borrowings and trade payable in foreign currencies.
Operational EBITDA – Reﬁning and Marketing – India
R&M India operational EBITDA increased to US$522.1 million during the 15 month period ended March 2012 from US$514.7 
million in the 12 months to December 2010. Operational EBITDA increased due to increase in GRMs of US$299.5 million, 
increased sales tax incentive of US$46.8 million which were offset by higher operating costs of US$36.8 million and foreign 
exchange losses of US$259.9 million (2010: gain U$33.6 million). 
Operational EBITDA – Reﬁning and Marketing – UK
The reﬁnery’s performance in its ﬁrst period end of operation was an operational EBITDA loss of US$30.2 million. The results 
were primarily impacted by a reduced Northern European reﬁning margin index which limited the Stanlow GRM to US$3.06/
bbl. This downward revision on the index has impacted the region as a whole. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

The total ﬁnance cost has increased by US$417 .5 million primarily due to increases in loans taken for power projects, 
expansion of the Vadinar reﬁnery, convertible bonds and the bridge loan.
Net ﬁnance costs increased due to the increased interest cost of loans mentioned above offset by an increase in interest 
income from the short-term deployment of surplus funds of US$82.5 million together with an increase in interest capitalised of 
US$245.2 million in respect of costs directly attributed to assets under construction. 
The adjustment within ﬁnance costs for the loss of sales tax beneﬁt amounts to US$58.6 million and reﬂects the unwinding of 
the discount on the liability to the State of Gujarat and the additional interest provided of US$321.5 million on the lapse of a 
prepayment option relating to a facility that was part of the MRA loan.
Foreign exchange impact
The total foreign exchange impact for the 15 months to 31 March 2012 was US$316.9 million, excluding a non-operational 
gain of US$1.7 million (2010: US$41.3 million), due to the depreciation of the Rupee against the US dollar. A certain portion of 
the foreign exchange impact amounting to US$73.7 million is offset in the pricing of products in our Reﬁnery and Marketing 
businesses. The other foreign exchange impact items amounting to US$243.2 million relate to the revaluation of assets and 
liabilities at the end of the period, the foreign exchange impact on project ﬁnance transactions and the cost of foreign 
exchange hedging.

Taxation
The Group’s March 2012 effective tax rate was 33.4% compared with December 2010 rate of 32.1%. The tax income of 
US$383.4 million in March 2012 (December 2010: tax charge of US$117 .2 million) comprises current tax of US$38.1 million 
(December 2010: US$30.6 million) and a deferred tax income of US$421.5 million (December 2010: deferred tax expense of 
US$86.6 million). The current tax charge has increased due to an increase in proﬁts which are subject to corporate income 
tax or MAT as appropriate. The majority of proﬁts derived from operations in India are subject to MAT. MAT is charged on 
book proﬁts in India at a rate of 20.01%, but is available as a credit against corporate income tax in the following 10 years. 
In addition a deferred tax asset was created at 24% on the losses incurred by Essar Oil UK. 
The adjustment within taxation for the loss of sales tax beneﬁt reﬂects a deferred tax asset amounting to US$309.9 million 
based on the India Corporate tax rate has been recognised on the consequential losses of the sales tax beneﬁt to be set off 
against future proﬁts and US$104.3 million of additional interest recognised due to the expiry of a prepayment option in April 
2012 of a facility that was part of the MRA loan. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Other non-operational gains and losses
Other gains and losses include non-operational gains that have decreased by US$40.1 million to US$20.9 million for the 
15 month period to 31 March 2012 compared to US$61.0 million in 2010. The decrease is largely due to the one-off gain in 
2010 of US$41.0 million from conversion of the IPO proceeds into US dollars partially offset by a gain on the acquisition of the 
Stanlow reﬁnery in the 15 month period to 31 March 2012 of US$18.9 million.
Exceptional items
During the 15 month period there were two non-recurring items of such signiﬁcance that they have been disclosed separately 
on the face of the proﬁt and loss account. 
The ﬁrst item concerns the eligibility of the Group’s subsidiary Essar Oil to participate in the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme (the 
‘Scheme’) where on 17 January 2012, the Honourable Supreme Court of India set aside the previous judgment of the High 
Court of Gujarat and ruled that the Group could not participate in the Scheme. The Group continued to apply the accounting 
policy in respect of the Sales Tax beneﬁt up to 31 December 2011 as the revenue was earned. The result of the Honourable 
Supreme Court judgment on 17 January meant the entire amount previously recognised to 17 January 2012 was adjusted in 
the current period.
The second item is an additional non-cash interest charge due to the lapse of a prepayment option relating to a facility that is 
part of Essar Oil’s MRA loans. Essar Oil is in the process of replacing the current MRA loans with a new loan facility (the CDR 
exit). The new facility is in the ﬁnal stages of documentation and we expect ﬁnal approval for the CDR exit shortly. As a result of 
the current stage of replacing the MRA loans, Essar Oil did not exercise a prepayment option on one of the MRA facilities which 
was available up until 24 April 2012. Previously, the assumption had been that Essar Oil would exercise this pre-payment option. 
However, as the new facility has not yet been signed, under IFRS the accounting treatment reﬂects the current MRA terms, 
which means a revaluation of the loans excluding the prepayment option. The impact, net of deferred tax, is US$217 million 
which is an accounting provision and has no immediate cash ﬂow impact. We expect this provision to be partially reversed 
once the new facility is ﬁnalised.
The impact of both these exceptional items on the 15 months to 31 March 2012 is as follows:

Loss after tax is US$764.3 million compared to proﬁt after tax of US$248.3 million in 2010 resulted in a decrease of 
US$1,012.6 million. This is after providing for exceptional items of US$862.5 million as explained in exceptional items above 
and the balance of US$150.1 million was as a result of the operations as discussed above. 
Operational earnings per share of 3.2 US cents in 2011–12 is down from 17 .1 US cents per share in 2010 as a result of the 
reduced proﬁt after tax. Basic earnings per share shows a loss of 53.0 US cents reﬂecting the impact of the exceptional items 
discussed above and in further detail in Note 11. Further information on earning per share is included in Note 11. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

The Group acquired assets of US$408.9 million as part of the acquisition of the Stanlow reﬁnery and a further US$61.2 million 
was spent post acquisition. 
In the Power segment, operational assets increased mainly due to the commissioning of Vadinar P1 with the transfer of the 
related assets from assets under construction to operational offset by exchange rate variations.
The operational assets in R&M India increased mainly due to commissioning of the Vadinar reﬁnery phase 1 project.
The 14% depreciation of the Rupee from December 2010 caused a reduction in property, plant and equipment of US$505.4 
million, US$26.9 million and US$623.0 million in the Power, Exploration and Production and Reﬁnery and Marketing – India

depreciation of the Rupee from December 2010 caused a reduction in loans of US$641.9 million compared with the exchange 
rate at 31 December 2010.
Other non-current assets
Other non-current assets have decreased by US$25.8 million over December 2010 primarily as a result of reclassiﬁcation 
of receivable of sales tax assignment liability paid to current assets and reduction in prepayment of arrangement fees on 
unutilised debt facilities partly offset by deferred tax assets created on business losses. 
Current assets
Current assets have increased by US$3,168.9 million to US$6,532.5 million over December 2010 primarily as a result of 
the following:
 Current assets of the Stanlow reﬁnery US$2,321 million
 US$405 million reclassiﬁcation from non-current assets to current assets of the sales tax assignment liability which is 
partly set off by a reduction of US$46 million in the sales tax liability already paid included within non-current assets 
 An increase in export debtors of US$164 million made over the period end which was partly offset by a decrease in 
domestic debtors of US$11 million
 An increase of US$35 million in inventory as result of coal inventory for power plant
Current liabilities
Current liabilities increased by 174% to US$7 ,603.5 million from 31 December 2010, primarily due to:
 Current liabilities of the Stanlow reﬁnery of US$2,221.3 million including deferred consideration for the Stanlow reﬁnery
 Deferred sales tax liability of US$1,206 million
 An increase in crude oil liabilities up by US$900 million
 A loan of US$450 million to acquire Stanlow reﬁnery
 Increase in short-term working capital loan US$235.8 million
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities have increased by US$1,097 .5 million, representing a 22% increase, from 31 December 2010 primarily 
due to the following:
 US$224.0 million decrease on the discounted sales tax liability following reclassiﬁcation to current liability 
 US$2,064 million increase in long-term borrowings which include a convertible bond of US$550 million and a US$450 
million secured and guaranteed term loan as noted in the capital and liquidity section
 Decrease by US$160 million in deferred tax liabilities driven primarily by the impact of property, plant and equipment as well

due to investment of US$1,024.0 million in the Stanlow reﬁnery and the lower expenditure is as a result of certain projects 
nearing completion. 
At the 31 March 2012 there was net cash, cash equivalents and bank deposits amounting to US$436.6 million  
(2010 US$474.5 million) which will be used by the business in funding future growth.
Capital and liquidity
During 2011, the Company issued a convertible bond which raised US$550 million (before transaction costs) to pursue current 
and further investments. 
On 1 July 2011, Essar Energy entered into a US$450 million secured and guaranteed term loan. Essar Energy utilised this 
loan to enable Essar Oil UK to ﬁnance the Stanlow acquisition and may also utilise the loan, amongst other things, for general 
corporate purposes. This loan was reﬁnanced on 14 May 2012 with a new US$300 million three year secured loan facility and 
US$150 million of internal cash resources. Separately, Essar Energy also signed on the same date a US$250 million 3.5 year 
subordinated unsecured loan facility with Essar Global for general corporate purposes. 
A US$1.5 billion working capital revolving credit facility was executed on 1 July 2011 to ﬁnance the inventory and operating 
requirements of the Stanlow reﬁnery. Despite volatile market conditions, syndication of US$750 million was completed with 
seven new lenders added to the original six underwriting banks.
Essar Oil has submitted a proposal to exit the current MRA loan facility of US$1.7 billion by a fresh loan facility with standard 
terms and conditions. Essar Oil is currently at the ﬁnal stages of negotiation to exit the existing MRA loan facility, ﬁnal approval 
for which is expected shortly. 
Essar Oil is also in the advanced stages of arranging a new c.US$1 billion (Rs. 50 billion) bank term loan facility. This facility is 
being put in place as a contingency measure for in the event that Essar Oil is required to pay its deferred sales tax liability to 
the Government of Gujarat. 
Essar Energy had underlying gross debt of US$6,710 million, net debt (underlying) of US$6,273 million and gearing of 63.2% as 
of 31 March 2012. At 31 December 2010, Essar Energy had gross debt of US$4,040 million, net debt (underlying) of US$3,565 
million and gearing of 43.4%. The gross and net debt increased largely as a result of the Company’s continued capital 
expenditure programme in the Power, Exploration and Production and Reﬁning and Marketing – India businesses and following 
the acquisition of the Stanlow reﬁnery. It is anticipated that the Group’s debt will continue to increase as projects are funded with 
peak debt forecast to occur in FY 2013. Any surplus funds are invested in highly rated liquid securities, bank deposits, a trade 
advance and short-term recoverable advance in line with the Group’s ﬁnancial and risk policy.

Going concern
The Group has prepared detailed annual business plans for the year to June 2013 based on the annual business plans for the 
2013 ﬁnancial year. These business plans were used as the basis for assessing the Group’s cash headroom and compliance 
with banking covenants. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible charges in trading 
performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within its current available funding and anticipated roll-over of 
facilities which mature in the ordinary course of business together with other facilities which have been agreed with the 
relevant banks but await ﬁnal documentation.
As set out in Note 8, on 17 January 2012, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Group was not entitled to participate in 
the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), and on 24 January the Government of Gujarat served notice on the Group 
requiring it to pay the outstanding sales tax liability of US$1,186.9 million plus associated interest. The Group has now ﬁled a 
writ petition with the High Court of Gujarat to waive or reduce the interest owed, and to defer the payment of sales tax over a 
number of years as may be permitted under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003. The High Court of Gujarat has admitted 
the writ petition and asked the Government of Gujarat to consider this application. In view of the matter being sub judice, the 
timing of payment of the sales tax liability and related interest, if any, is not deﬁnitive and will not be known until determined by 
the current legal process. In view of this and based on legal advice, the interest on the Sales Tax liability has been treated as a 
contingency as set out in Note 29. 
The Group plans to fund any repayment of the sales tax liability through a combination of internal funding and through 
obtaining a new loan facility. The Group is currently in advanced stages of establishing credit facilities of c.US$1 billion with its 
lenders to ensure that the Group has adequate funds available to meet any liabilities due to the State of Gujarat as and when 
the decision of the Government of Gujarat/the High Court is established. Although the facility is expected to be committed 
shortly, the process is ongoing.
For this reason the Directors are required to conclude that these circumstances represents a material uncertainty that may 
cast signiﬁcant doubt upon the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Although there is no deﬁnitive sales tax liability payment schedule at this time, the Board is conﬁdent of arranging the facility 
well ahead of any payments falling due, resulting from the pending legal process. In addition, if the Government of Gujarat 
permits payment of the liability in instalments as requested then the facility may not be fully drawn down with the liability partly 
met through the Group’s internal resources. The Directors have examined all available evidence and have concluded that 
although there is a risk that they will not be able to secure agreement with the lenders outlined above, in light of the supportive 
nature of the relationship held with the lenders and the advanced stage the Group is in establishing the facility, the Directors 
are satisﬁed that adequate ﬁnancial resources will continue to be made available to the Group and the Company so as to 
enable it to continue to trade on a going concern basis. As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Group and Company’s ﬁnancial statements. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

these forward looking statements is set out inside the back 
cover of this annual report.
Corporate governance
The Company is required to comply with the Governance 
Code throughout the period or explain its reasons for 
non-compliance. A report on corporate governance and 
compliance with the provisions of the Governance Code is 
set out on pages 57 to 64.
Dividends

for the 12 month period ended 31 December 2010.
No interim dividend was declared for the six month period to 
30 June 2011 or the 12 month period to 31 December 2011.
Relationship agreement
Prior to Listing in May 2010, Essar Energy was a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Essar Global. On 30 April 2010 Essar Energy and 
Essar Global entered into a relationship agreement to regulate 
the ongoing relationship between the Company and Essar 
Global. The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is 
to ensure that the Group is capable of carrying on its business 
independently of Essar Global and its associates (for the 
purpose of this summary, as deﬁned in the Relationship 
Agreement) and that transactions and relationships are at 
arm’s length and on normal commercial terms (other than 
certain de minimis transactions).
The Relationship Agreement will continue for so long as the 
ordinary shares are listed on the premium listing segment of the 
Ofﬁcial List and traded on the LSE and Essar Global, together 
with its associates, has an aggregate interest of at least 30% 
in the issued shares of Essar Energy. The key terms of the 
Relationship Agreement are set out in Appendix 2 of this Report 
on pages 143 and 144. The Directors believe that the terms of 
the Relationship Agreement enable the Company to carry on its 
business independently from the Essar Group and its associates.
Directors and Directors’ authority
The names and biographies of each Director as at the date 
of this report appear on pages 48 and 49. 
On 21 December 201 1, Mr Ravi Ruia stepped down as 
Chairman of the Board although he remains a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company, and Mr Prashant Ruia was 
appointed as Chairman in his place. On 29 March 2012, 
following the recommendation of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, Mr Steve Lucas was appointed 
as an Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Directors may from time to time appoint one or more 
Director(s). Any such Director shall hold ofﬁce only until the 
next AGM and shall then offer themselves for election by the 
Company’s shareholders. In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association, which require the Directors to retire 
and offer themselves for election by shareholders at the ﬁrst 
AGM after their appointment, Mr Steve Lucas will offer himself 
for election at the forthcoming AGM. Notwithstanding that the 
Articles of Association provide that one third of the Directors 
(or the number nearest to one third) are to retire by rotation  
at each AGM and offer themselves for re-election by the 
shareholders, all of the Directors will seek re-election at  
the forthcoming AGM and intend to do so thereafter on an 
annual basis at each future AGM, in compliance with the 
Governance Code.
At the Company’s 201 1 AGM the Directors were given 
authority to allot up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£21,723,954.88, being an amount equal to one third of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The Company was 
also authorised by a shareholders’ resolution to make market 
purchases of its ordinary shares up to 130,343,729 ordinary 
shares representing 10% of its issued ordinary share capital. 
These authorities will expire on 18 August 2012 and similar 
authorities will be proposed at the 2012 AGM to be held  
on 4 September 2012. In addition, the Company may not 
generally allot shares for cash without ﬁrst making an offer to 
existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. 
This is known as rights of pre-emption. A resolution to allow a 
limited waiver of these rights was passed at last year’s AGM. 
This authority expires on 18 August 2012 and it is proposed 
that a similar waiver be approved at the forthcoming AGM.  
Full details of the proposed waiver and of the other authorities 
to be renewed are set out in the Notice of the AGM. No shares 
were allotted by the Directors or purchased by the Company 
during the 15 month period to 31 March 2012. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

further 16,973,961 ordinary shares of the Company on 18 January 2011 pursuant to an 
Equity Swap Transaction as part of the convertible bond arrangements. As part of the equity 
swap transaction, Essar Global has the option to settle the swap by acquiring these further 
16,973,961 shares (and therefore the beneﬁcial interest in such shares).
2 Outstanding executive share option awards held by Mr Naresh Nayyar, further details 
of which are set out in the Remuneration report. 
During the 201 1–12 ﬁnancial year, Mr Naresh Nayyar was

addition to the 204,444 share options he was granted during 
the previous 12 month period. There were no other changes to 
the Directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the Company 
throughout the 15 month period ended 31 March 2012.
No Director had any dealings in the shares of the Company 
between 31 March 2012 and a date not more than one 
month prior to the date of the notice convening the AGM, 
other than as disclosed in Appendix 3 on page 144.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital are set out in Note 24 
to the ﬁnancial statements. The issued share capital of the 
Company at 31 March 2012 was 1,303,437 ,293 ordinary 
shares of 5 pence each. The Company’s shares are listed 
on the LSE. The rights and obligations attached to these 
shares are governed by English law and the Company’s 
Articles of Association.
On 6 December 2011 the Company launched a Sponsored 
Level 1 ADR programme. Each ADR represents two of 
the Company’s ordinary shares and is traded on the US 
over-the-counter market under the symbol ‘ERERY’. This 
ADR programme has no impact on the overall share capital 
of the Company.
Voting rights
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to 
attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 
On a show of hands every shareholder present in person or 
by proxy (or being a corporation present by a duly authorised 
representative) shall have one vote, and on a poll every 
shareholder who is present in person or by proxy or (in 
the case of a corporate member) by a duly authorised 
representative) shall have one vote for every share of which 
he is the holder.
A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at a general 
meeting may appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote 
instead of him. If a member appoints more than one proxy 
he must specify the number of shares which each proxy is 
entitled to exercise rights over. A proxy need not be a 
shareholder of the Company.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act 2006, whenever the share 
capital of the Company is divided into different classes of 
shares, the rights attaching to any class of shares may be 
varied with the consent in writing of the holders of three-
quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or 
with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate 
general meeting of the shareholders. 
Transfer of shares
Essar Global and the Directors were subject to a lock-up 
arrangement in accordance with an underwriting agreement 
dated 30 April 2010 and related arrangements under which 
they were not permitted to sell their shares for a period of 
365 days following the Listing. 
The Company itself was also subject to a lock-up 
arrangement pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The 
Company agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, during 
the period of 365 days from Listing, it would not, without the 
prior written consent of the joint global coordinators and the 
Sponsor, issue, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise 
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares (or any interest 
therein) or enter into any transaction with the same economic 
effect as any of the foregoing.
On 18 January 2011, the Company entered into an additional 
lock-up arrangement in relation to the convertible bond issue 
under which it agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, it 
would not, during the period of 60 days from the date of the 
agreement, issue, offer, sell or contract to sell or otherwise 
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any ordinary shares (or any 
interest therein) or enter into any transaction with a similar 
economic effect as any of the foregoing.
All lock-up arrangements as detailed above have now lapsed 
and therefore all restrictions relating to the shares under such 
arrangements no longer apply. 
As at 31 March 2012, there were no restrictions on the transfer 
of the ordinary shares other than as set out in the Articles of 
Association and certain restrictions that may from time to time 
be imposed by laws and regulations and pursuant to the Listing

Directors, ofﬁcers and employees of the Company require the 
approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary shares. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Essential contracts
Essar Oil Limited has entered into long-term reﬁned 
petroleum product off-take agreements, which together 
accounted for 39% of the Group’s net sales, with the 
following Indian national oil companies: a four year agreement 
with Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited effective from 
April 2012, a four year agreement with Hindustan Petroleum 
Corporation Limited effective from January 2008 (extendable 
by one year) which is currently being ﬁnalised, and a three 
year agreement with Indian Oil Corporation Limited effective 
from November 201 1. Under the terms of these agreements, 
the Company is not guaranteed any binding minimum 
off-take quantity from the Indian national oil companies, 
however, due to the pricing terms for sales to the Indian 
national oil companies, the Company is able to generate 
higher margins on sales to these customers than on export 
sales and the Company considers these arrangements are 
essential to the business of the Group within the meaning of 
Section 417(5)(c) of the Companies Act 2006.
Amendments to the Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles of Association of the 
Company may be made by special resolution of the 
shareholders. The Company’s Articles of Association are 
available on the Company’s website, www.essarenergy.com. 
Signiﬁcant agreements
The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of signiﬁcant 
agreements that take effect, alter or terminate on a change 
of control of the Company. These are as set out below:
Convertible bond issue
On 18 January 2011, Essar Energy launched an offering 
of US$500 million 4.25% guaranteed senior unsecured 
convertible bonds due 2016. The bonds were successfully 
priced with a coupon of 4.25% payable semi-annually in 
arrears and a conversion price set at a premium of 30% to 
the reference price of US$8.5277 (c. £5.37) per share. The 
offering size was subsequently increased to US$550 million 
due to the exercise of an over-allotment option of US$50 
million. The convertible bonds were issued on 1 February 
2011. Pursuant to the ﬁnal terms attaching to the bonds, the 
bondholders have the right to require the Group to redeem 
the bonds at a price equal to the principal amount, together 
with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
if there is a change of control of the Company in which any 
person or persons, acting together (other than Essar Global 
or any person(s) controlled by or acting together with Essar 
Global) acquires or becomes entitled to control more than 
50% of the voting rights of the Company.
Essar Global, the majority shareholder of Essar Energy, did 
not participate in the convertible bond transaction, but it did 
enter into an equity swap transaction with Standard Chartered 
Bank whereby Essar Global acquired an additional economic 
interest in 16,973,961 of Essar Energy’s ordinary shares. The 
swap will last for the life of the convertible bonds and may be 
settled by Essar Global receiving cash or, at Essar Global’s 
option, shares. The result of the equity swap transaction is to 
increase Essar Global’s economic interest in Essar Energy to 
78.02% from 76.72%.
Relationship Agreement
The Relationship Agreement between Essar Global and the 
Company (described in detail on page 52) will terminate should 
Essar Global, together with its associates (as deﬁned in the 
Relationship Agreement), cease to have an aggregate interest 
in 30% or more of the issued share capital of the Company. 
US$300 million secured term loan facility
On 1 July 201 1, Essar Energy entered into a US$450 
million secured bridge loan facility due December 2012. 
Essar Energy utilised this loan to enable Essar Oil UK to 
ﬁnance the acquisition of the Stanlow reﬁnery and, amongst 
other things, for general corporate purposes. On 15 May 2012 
Essar Energy reﬁnanced this loan with a new US$300 million 
three year secured loan facility and US$150 million of internal 
cash resources. The new facility is being provided by a 
consortium of banks who were the lenders under the original 
US$450 million bridge loan. Pursuant to the terms of the new 
facility, each lender has the right to terminate its respective 
participation in the facility should Essar Global cease to have 
the power to direct the management and policies of the 
Company, or cease to own (legally and beneﬁcially) directly 
or indirectly more than 50% of the total issued share capital 
of the Company.
Other

certain provisions for compensation to be paid in the event of 
a change of control of the Company or a loss of ofﬁce. Further 
details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 70.

consultation are managed via established employee bodies 
and consultation forums. Essar Oil UK operates performance 
management systems to align business and individual goals 
and has introduced share schemes whereby employees can

STATEMENT S
Corporate governance report
Introduction
The Company is committed to maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance both in respect of its management 
of the Group and its businesses and its accountability to 
its shareholders as a whole. This section of the annual 
report sets out the corporate governance framework for 
the Company. 
The principal governance rules applying to UK companies 
listed on the London Stock Exchange are now contained in 
the Governance Code, which can be found on the FRC’s 
website at http://www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm.
During the 15 month period to 31 March 2012, the Company 
has complied with the Governance Code in all respects, 
save for the following:
(i) Code Provision A.3.1. Neither Mr Prashant Ruia, the 
current Chairman nor Mr Ravi Ruia, the previous 
Chairman met the independence criteria set out in the 
Governance Code on their appointment as Chairman, 
due to their interests in the Company and their 
involvement with Essar Group; and
(ii) Code Provision B.2.4. The Governance Code stipulates 
that open advertising or an external search consultancy 
should be used within the appointments process for 
a Non-Executive Director. Neither were considered 
necessary for Steve Lucas’ appointment to the Board 
in March 2012 because it was felt that the Nomination 
and Governance Committee could identify between 
themselves a broad range of potential candidates; see 
‘Nomination and Governance Committee’ below. 
The previous Chairman was not independent at the time of 
his appointment as he was, and still is, also Vice Chairman  
of the Essar Group and is indirectly a majority shareholder  
in the Company. In view of the previous Chairman’s position 
as one of the founders of the Essar Group and his extensive 
involvement with Essar Oil and Essar Power over a period  
of many years, the Board considered that his knowledge  
of Essar and role in building it into one of India’s premier 
business groups provided signiﬁcant beneﬁts to Essar 
Energy, outweighing any potential conﬂicts. The previous 
Chairman made a major contribution to the Group’s growth 
and success and the Board was unanimously of the opinion 
that his continued involvement was crucially important to the 
ongoing success of the Company. The current Chairman 
was previously the Vice Chairman of the Company and a 
Non-Executive Director of the Company. The Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
considered Mr Prashant Ruia to be best placed to take  
over the role of Chairman when the previous Chairman 
stepped down on 21 December 2011, due to the depth and 
breadth of his knowledge of the Company and its strategy, 
business activities and operations.
The role and structure of the Board
The Board consists of eight Directors, made up of the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and six Non-Executive 
Directors, of whom ﬁve are independent. Biographies of all 
the Board members appear on pages 48 and 49 of this 
annual report.
Mr Steve Lucas was appointed as the ﬁfth Independent 
Non-Executive Director of the Company on 29 March 2012.
There were a number of changes to both Board structure 
and Committee membership in June 2012, which will take 
effect as of 1 July 2012. Please see ‘The Board’ and ‘The 
Board Committees’ below for further details.
The Board is the decision making body for all matters 
material to the Company’s ﬁnances, strategy and reputation. 
It is collectively responsible for the long-term success 
of the Company and has ultimate responsibility for the 
management, direction and performance of the Group and 
its businesses. The Board is required to exercise objective 
judgement on all corporate matters and is accountable to 
shareholders for the proper conduct of the business.
The matters which are reserved for the Board are set out in a 
formal schedule, approved by the Board and include:
 the overall Group strategy and long range plans;
 stewardship of business performance;
 devising and reviewing the corporate governance 
structure of the Group;
 approval of all new capital projects and any acquisitions 
including joint ventures or divestments;
 approval of the annual budget, including maintenance and 
project capital expenditure, and the operating plan;
 delegated levels of authority and the annual and half-year 
ﬁnancial results and shareholder communications;
 the system of internal control and risk management;
 the Group management structure;
 recommending dividend policy for shareholder approval;
 appointment of external auditors;
 entering into related party transactions;
 entering into new committed ﬁnancial facilities;
 approving the Financial and Treasury Risks Policy; and
 appointments to the Board.
Otherwise, the day to day management of the Company is 
delegated to and run by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and his 
Senior Management, the role of which is described below. 
The Board has also delegated speciﬁc responsibility to 
the four Board Committees, being the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the 
Audit Committee and the Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee. Further information on each of these committees 
is set out on pages 60 to 62 of this report.
Subsidiary Board structure
Essar Energy operates its Oil and Gas business in India 
through Essar Oil. Essar Oil has a free ﬂoat of 10.04% of its 
shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National 
Stock Exchange of India. Essar Oil has its own board of 
Directors along with an audit and governance committee 
that undertakes all the subsidiary’s corporate governance 
requirements and ensures and monitors compliance with the 
Indian listing requirements. The Exploration and Production 
business operates within Essar Oil and is subject to the 
same corporate governance requirements. Similarly, Essar 
Power, which operates Essar Energy’s power business in 
India, also has its own board of Directors along with an 
executive committee and audit committee. Essar Oil UK 
has its own board of Directors along with an executive 
committee. The Chief Executives of each of these 
businesses are members of the Essar Energy 
Senior Management. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Corporate governance report continued
The Senior Management
The Senior Management focuses on monitoring implementation of the Company’s strategy, progress against agreed plans 
and operational matters to ensure the Board’s strategic directions are implemented and to make recommendations to the 
Board. The Senior Management membership comprises the Chairman, Mr Prashant Ruia, as Chairman of the Committee, 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of the Company, Mr Naresh Nayyar, the Chief Executives of the business groups, the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer, Mr P Sampath and the Director of Investor Relations and Communications, Mr Mark Lidiard.
The Senior Management meets on a monthly basis. Senior Management members generally receive papers a week 
in advance of the meeting. Agenda items for each meeting include ﬁnancial and operational highlights, project updates, 
business development, statutory compliance updates, investor relations updates and updates on use of funds. The agenda 
also includes, at least twice a year, an item to monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management policy.  
The agenda is currently under review to ensure the appropriate topics are being discussed at each meeting.
The Board
Mr Prashant Ruia is the current Chairman of the Company and is the Chief Executive of the Essar Group. Mr Ravi Ruia, who 
was the previous Chairman until 21 December 2011, remains a Non-Executive Director of the Company and is Vice Chairman 
of the Essar Group. Mr Naresh Nayyar is the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of the Company. The majority (ﬁve out of seven) of the 
Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board to be independent in character and judgement in compliance with the 
Governance Code. Their independence provides a strong foundation for good corporate governance. The Directors who 
served during the year are set out in the table below:
Independent Non Independent
Mr Philip Aiken Mr Ravi Ruia (Chairman until December 2011)
Mr Sattar Hajee Abdoula Mr Prashant Ruia (Chairman since December 2011)
Mr Simon Murray (Senior Independent Non-Executive Director) Mr Naresh Nayyar (Chief Executive Ofﬁcer)
Mr Subhas Lallah
Mr Steve Lucas (appointed March 2012)
Mr Simon Murray is, and was throughout the period, the Board appointed Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (‘SID’) and 
is available to address shareholders’ concerns that have not been resolved through the normal channels of communication with 
the Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer or Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, or in cases when such communications would be inappropriate.
In June 2012, the Board appointed Mr Simon Murray to the role of Vice Chairman of the Company, and also appointed  
Mr Philip Aiken to the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. Both appointments will take effect on 1 July 2012.
There is a clear division between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and a written statement of their 
responsibilities has been approved by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for the operation, leadership and governance 
of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is responsible for guiding 
the implementation of Board strategy and policy with respect to the Group’s business, with the assistance of the 
Senior Management.
Since his appointment as Chairman in December 2011, Mr Prashant Ruia undertakes the duties of both Chairman and Vice 
Chairman until 1 July 2012. The appointment of Simon Murray to the role of Vice Chairman of the Company comes into effect 
on 1 July 2012.  Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

1 Board meetings convened at relatively short notice to deal with ad hoc commercial matters. Representation at such meetings reﬂects the short notice period given. Board members who were 
unable to attend received the brieﬁng papers in advance and had the opportunity to provide their input prior to the meeting. Any such comments received were duly noted at the relevant meeting.
2 No Board Meetings were held during the period since the appointment of Mr Lucas as an Independent Non-Executive Director on 29 March 2012.
3 No Committee Meetings were held during the period since Mr Hajee Abdoula was appointed as a Committee member on 23 February 2012.
The Directors receive appropriate brieﬁng papers on substantive items, which are, in general, circulated at least a week 
before the relevant Board meeting to give the Directors adequate time to prepare for the meeting and to enable any Director 
who is unable to attend the meeting to have an opportunity to review the matters to be discussed and, if necessary, to provide 
comments to the Chairman in advance of the meeting. The Directors also receive monthly updates on key matters relating 
to the business operations, project updates, ﬁnancial information, legal and corporate governance, tax and investor relations. 
The Directors also receive other ad hoc updates between Board meetings. All Directors have the right to have their concerns 
about the running of the Company, or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, recorded in the minutes.
During the period, the Non-Executive Directors have met without the Executive Directors being present. The Non-Executive 
Directors met in November 2011 without the Chairman to appraise the Chairman’s performance. The SID was to discuss 
the outcome of the review with the Chairman, Mr Ravi Ruia, however, due to the subsequent interim change in Chairman in 
December 2011, it was felt to be inappropriate to continue with this review. The Non-Executive Directors considered it too 
early in the appointment of Mr Prashant Ruia as Chairman to conduct a meaningful evaluation of his performance.
The Board has undertaken an evaluation of its performance and the performance of its committees. The evaluation process 
included each Director completing an evaluation questionnaire and the subsequent outcome was considered and reviewed 
by the Nomination and Governance Committee in detail, the results of which were reported to the Board. The evaluation of 
the Board did not identify any material issues. Certain areas for improvement were identiﬁed and these were addressed 
during the period. 
The Company intends to engage an external facilitator to undertake an evaluation of the Board at least every three years, 
in compliance with the Governance Code. The ﬁrst such externally facilitated evaluation will likely be undertaken during the 
ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2013.
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction upon appointment to the Board. Programmes of continuing professional 
development are arranged, as required, taking into account the individual qualiﬁcations and experience of the Director. The 
Chairman is responsible for ensuring induction and training programmes are provided and the Company Secretary is tasked 
with organising such programmes. Individual Directors, with the support of the Company Secretary, are also expected to take 
responsibility for identifying their own training needs and to ensure that they are adequately informed about the Group and their 
responsibilities as a Director. All of the Directors have received a comprehensive brieﬁng on their duties and responsibilities as 
Directors of a UK Listed company by the Company or its advisors. Further brieﬁngs and updates on key regulation, industry 
practices and other matters relating to the business were provided at Board meetings during the period to ensure that the 
Directors were kept informed of relevant developments. A number of the Directors attended site visits during the period and 
further visits are planned during 2012.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring 
that Board procedures are complied with. Both appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are a matter for the 
Board as a whole. All Directors also have access to other members of the Senior Management and to the Group’s 
professional advisors whom they can consult at the Company’s expense should they consider this necessary in order 
to better discharge their responsibilities. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Governance
Corporate governance report continued
The Board is required to disclose any actual or potential 
conﬂicts of interest and the Directors are aware of the need 
to notify the Company of any potential conﬂicts of interest. 
Directors’ declaration of interests forms a standard item on 
the agenda for each Board meeting. Potential conﬂicts are 
considered and, if appropriate, approved and noted with any 
conﬂicted Director not voting on the matter. During the period 
a number of potential conﬂict situations were considered 
by the Board and since no actual conﬂict of interest was 
identiﬁed in each case, they were authorised by the Board. 
A record of conﬂicts or potential conﬂicts for each Director is 
maintained and reviewed on a regular basis by the Company.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the 
Company, Mr Steve Lucas will submit himself for election by 
shareholders at the Company’s forthcoming AGM, being the 
ﬁrst AGM following his appointment. In addition, in compliance 
with the Governance Code, all of the other Directors will offer 
themselves for annual re-election by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM and intend to do so thereafter on an 
annual basis at each future AGM.
The Board remains satisﬁed that following formal performance 
evaluation, each individual Board member’s performance 
continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to their 
respective roles, and therefore following the recommendation  
of the Nomination and Governance Committee, that each 
Director proposed for election continues to be fully competent  
to carry out his responsibilities as a member of the Board.
The Board Committees
Terms of reference for each of the following committees are 
available on the Company’s website, www.essarenergy.com.
Audit Committee
Chairman: Mr Sattar Hajee Abdoula
Members: Mr Subhas Lallah and Mr Simon Murray  
(until 1 July 2012)
As of 1 July 2012, Mr Simon Murray and Mr Steve Lucas will 
be members of the Audit Committee. Mr Sattar Hajee 
Abdoula will remain as Chairman of the Committee.
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee is required 
to meet at least three times a year or more frequently as 
circumstances require. During the period, the Audit Committee 
has met ﬁve times. The Audit Committee reports on its 
activities to the Board, immediately following its meetings.
During the period the Audit Committee has carried out various 
activities in accordance with the responsibilities set out in its 
terms of reference including the activities described below.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the 2012 Annual Report 
including the Preliminary Results before recommending them 
to the Board. In doing so the Committee reviewed and 
discussed the preliminary results and annual ﬁnancial 
statements with management and the external auditor 
focusing particularly on:
 the quality and acceptability of the accounting policies 
and practices and ﬁnancial reporting disclosures and 
changes thereto;
 areas involving signiﬁcant judgement, estimation 
or uncertainty;
 the detecting of material misstatements by the auditor that 
individually or in aggregate have not been corrected and 
management’s explanations as to why adjustments have 
not been made;
 the basis for the going concern assumption; and
 compliance with ﬁnancial reporting standards and 
relevant ﬁnancial and governance requirements.
The Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the 
external auditor, Deloitte LLP . Auditor objectivity and 
independence is safeguarded through a variety of 
mechanisms. To ensure the Auditor’s independence, the 
Committee annually reviews the Company’s relationship with 
Deloitte. The Company has various policies in place which 
aim to safeguard the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor. This includes policies in respect of the 
potential employment of former auditors, the types of 
non-audit services which the external auditors may and 
may not provide to the Group, and the approval process in 
respect of permitted non-audit services. In addition to the 
approval process for speciﬁc non-audit services, the Audit 
Committee monitors the total level of non-audit services to 
ensure that neither the objectivity nor independence of the 
Auditor is at risk. Following the review in 2012, the Company 
concluded that it continues to have an objective and 
professional relationship with Deloitte and that there are 
sufﬁcient controls and processes in place to ensure the 
required level of independence. In addition, the Auditor is 
required to review and conﬁrm its independence to the 
Committee on a regular basis. When considering the 
reappointment of the Company’s external auditor before 
making a recommendation to the Board to be put to 
shareholders, the Committee reviewed and monitored 
the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and 
the effectiveness of the audit process. Accordingly, the 
Committee recommends the reappointment of Deloitte LLP 
at the forthcoming AGM.
During 2010, the Committee appointed the remuneration 
consultancy practice of Deloitte LLP to provide independent 
advice to the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration 
Committee advisors’ terms of reference are in accordance 
with APB Ethical Standard 5 and restrict the provision of 
certain services in order to maintain auditor independence. 
During the 15 month period ended 31 March 2012, the 
scope and value of services provided by the remuneration 
consultancy practice of Deloitte LLP was reviewed and the 
Remuneration Committee took steps to consider alternative 
advisors to advise the Remuneration Committee.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function. 
Since 2010, the Group internal audit function was provided 
through an outsourced service by Ernst & Young Pvt. 
Limited. In September 2011, a Head of Internal Audit was 
appointed to take over responsibility for this function with 
Ernst & Young Pvt. Limited being retained as a service 
provider to the Head of Internal Audit.
Internal audit is an independent review and support function 
whose primary role is to provide an objective evaluation 
of operations, information and control systems that the 
Company has put in place, primarily to the Audit Committee  Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

but also as a service to management. It provides analysis, 
recommendations, counsel, and information concerning  
the activities examined and provides assurance as well as 
guidance on the development of effective and efﬁcient 
controls with respect to process integrity, accuracy in 
reporting and compliance with policies and regulation.  
As part of this service to management the Head of Internal 
Audit meets quarterly with the management of each of 
the respective business groups, as well as the senior 
management of the Company, as part of a Management 
Audit Committee to appraise senior management about 
important audit issues and the steps taken by management 
to address control gaps. The Management Audit Committee 
meetings are chaired by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcers of the 
respective business groups and are held every quarter. 
At these meetings functional/departmental heads are also 
invited to provide clariﬁcations and explanations on the audit 
ﬁndings and action plans. The meetings also provide an 
opportunity for the internal audit team to report on their 
activities directly to management to ensure actions are 
taking place and highlight any remedial actions necessary. 
Additionally, the Head of Internal Audit also meets separately 
with the Chairman of the Audit Committee at least once 
every quarter either in person or through a teleconference.
Remuneration Committee
Chairman: Mr Subhas Lallah
Members: Mr Philip Aiken and Simon Murray 
(until 1 July 2012)
As of 1 July 2012, Mr Philip Aiken and Mr Steve Lucas will 
be members of the Remuneration Committee. Mr Subhas 
Lallah will remain as Chairman of the Committee.
The role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine 
the levels of remuneration for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
and the Chairman, and recommends and monitors the 
level and structure of remuneration for members of the 
Senior Management and key management personnel. 
Under its terms of reference, the Remuneration Committee 
is required to meet at least twice a year or more frequently as 
circumstances require. During the period, the Remuneration 
Committee met three times. The Remuneration Committee 
reports on its activities to the Board, immediately following 
its meetings.
The main areas of focus of the Remuneration Committee 
during the period has been on the performance parameters 
for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and other Senior Management, 
post 201 1 AGM feedback from investor institutional bodies, 
and the establishment of two UK All Employee Share 
Schemes in respect of Essar Oil UK.
The Directors’ Remuneration report is set out on pages 66

Nomination and Governance Committee
Chairman: Mr Simon Murray
Members: Mr Prashant Ruia and Mr Subhas Lallah 
(until 1 July 2012)
As of 1 July 2012, Mr Prashant Ruia, Mr Subhas Lallah 
and Mr Philip Aiken will be members of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee. Mr Simon Murray will remain as 
Chairman of the Committee.
The role of the Nomination and Governance Committee 
is to identify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, 
candidates to ﬁll Board vacancies as and when they arise 
as well as putting in place plans for succession for Directors 
and senior executives within the Group, in particular with 
respect to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer of the Company. Such plans are reviewed at least 
every six months.
Under its terms of reference, the Nomination and Governance 
Committee is also responsible for reviewing the structure,  
size and composition, including the skills, knowledge and 
experience, of the Board and making recommendations to the 
Board about adjustments. When making an appointment, the 
Committee is required by its terms of reference to evaluate the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and 
consider candidates on merit and against objective criteria, 
taking care that appointees have enough time available to 
devote to the position.
During the period the Committee met ﬁve times and details 
of members’ attendance is set out in the table on page 59.
The main focus of the Committee during the period has been 
management reorganisation, succession planning, review of 
Board structure, size, composition and diversity (including 
gender diversity), evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness, 
appraisal of the Chairman and the appointment of a ﬁfth 
Independent Non-Executive Director.

Non-Executive Director to the Board of the Company 
followed the process as set out in the Nomination and 
Governance Committee’s terms of reference, save as set 
out below with regard to external advertising.
The Committee developed a list of potential candidates 
based upon the agreed criteria from which they created a 
short list, taking into account the beneﬁts of diversity on the 
Board, including gender diversity. 
On this occasion, the Committee did not make use of open 
advertising or the services of an external search consultancy 
as recommended in the Governance Code, because it was 
felt that the Committee could identify between themselves a 
broad and diverse range of good potential candidates that 
could be included in the short list for further consideration. 
The Committee did resolve, however, that should it have 
been unable to identify a short list of suitable candidates, 
it would have engaged an external search consultancy to 
assist with the process.

Governance
Corporate governance report continued
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee assists the 
Board and the Senior Management in obtaining assurance 
that appropriate systems are in place to deal with the 
management of health, safety and environmental risks. 
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee meets at 
least twice a year and in general the Health, Safety and 
Environment Committee meetings are held in India with 
each meeting including a site visit, or on site at the Stanlow 
reﬁnery in the UK. During the period the Committee met 
three times. The focus of those meetings has been on 
process safety management (also known as ‘PSM’) and the 
development of the Group’s health, safety and environment 
culture within all operations and at all sites.
For further information on health, safety and environment, 
please refer to the Company’s separate 2011–12 
sustainability report, which can be accessed at

Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management and has delegated 
to the Audit Committee its responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of these controls. The system of internal control 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure  
to achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Group maintains a register of key controls and procedures 
which is reviewed and updated annually. As part of its risk 
based internal audit plan, the Group Internal Audit function 
continually assesses the control environment to provide 
assurance on the design and operating effectiveness of 
the controls.
Control structure
The Board sets the policy on internal control that is 
implemented by management. This is achieved through a 
clearly deﬁned operating structure with lines of responsibility 
and delegated authority. 
The policy set by the Board is formally documented in the 
Group Governance and Administration Manual (the ‘Manual’) 
which clearly deﬁnes the limits of delegated authority and 
provides a framework for management to deal with areas 
of signiﬁcant business risk.
The Manual conﬁrms a Code of Conduct that applies to 
all areas of the business and covers a requirement for all 
employees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in 
the territories in which the Group operates. At operational level 
this Code of Conduct is covered through the detailed human 
resource policies that are available on the Group’s intranet.
The Board also approves individual policies covering 
areas that are identiﬁed as key for the Board to monitor. 
For example, a policy on the process for entering into and 
reporting related party transactions has been approved and 
circulated throughout the Group with individual brieﬁngs to 
the key individuals responsible for managing the process. 
These policies and procedures are reviewed and, where 
necessary, updated at Senior Management meetings.
Control environment
The Group’s operating procedures include appropriate 
systems for reporting information to the Directors. These 
procedures are business dependent but all signiﬁcant 
operational businesses use SAP general ledger computer 
systems with automated controls and reconciliation processes.
Budgets are prepared by the management of the respective 
business groups and subject to review by the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer and then the Directors. The approved budgets are 
then used as the basis for controlling expenditure, with 
approval levels varying based on whether an item is within 
or exceeds budget.
The Senior Management and the Board review monthly 
management reports on the ﬁnancial results and key operating 
statistics, together with a brief written explanation of signiﬁcant 
variances or operational matters. The management reports 
are presented by the respective accountable individuals who 
provide further explanations as required.
The individual businesses monitor the progress of the 
expansion projects through regular project management 
review meetings to review progress and escalate issues to 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, with any major issues reported 
to the Board.
Emphasis is placed on the quality and abilities of the Group’s 
employees, with structured evaluation processes and access 
to a variety of online, internally and externally provided learning 
and development tools. This is provided through a shared 
service agreement with the Essar Global Human Resources 
function that was agreed as part of the Listing process and 
enabled the seamless transition of employee development. 
The President Human Resources of Essar Global is invited 
to attend Remuneration Committee meetings.
The acquisition of any business requires a rigorous 
analysis of the ﬁnancial implications of the acquisition and 
key performance ﬁgures. A sensitivity analysis takes place 
of the key assumptions made in the analysis with formal 
presentations to the Board.
The Senior Management and the Board have been provided 
with a report detailing any signiﬁcant legal actions involving 
Group companies, which provides a background to the case 
and its current status within the appropriate legal system.
Monitoring and review activities
A number of processes are in place for monitoring the system 
of internal control and reporting any signiﬁcant control failings 
or weaknesses together with details of corrective action, and 
the Directors of each business division are required to certify 
on an annual basis the operation of their control systems and 
to highlight any weaknesses.
Since 2010 the Group internal audit function was provided 
through an outsourced service provided by Ernst & Young 
Pvt. Limited. In September 201 1, a Head of Internal Audit was 
appointed to take over responsibility for this function with Ernst 
& Young Pvt. Limited being retained as a service provider to 
the Head of Internal Audit. The internal audit function reports 
directly to the Audit Committee and has prepared a risk-based 
audit plan agreed with the Audit Committee and undertaken a  Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

number of audits based on that plan. The Group has  
also formed a Management Audit Committee within each 
signiﬁcant business area of operation that meets on a 
quarterly basis. These meetings, chaired by the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcers of the respective businesses, review the 
results of internal audit reports and follow up actions to assess 
the overall robustness of the control environment.
Within each business area, detailed risk registers are maintained 
which provide information regarding the various risks within the 
business. Within each business area, there is a designated Risk 
Ofﬁcer who works closely with the Head of Internal Audit to 
compile the half yearly and annual risk update report that is 
presented to and reviewed by the Audit Committee. Material 
changes are reported to the Audit Committee. Signiﬁcant risks 
and their mitigating actions along with any remedial actions are 
monitored by the Senior Management and subsequently 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board.
Reports from the external auditor, Deloitte LLP , on certain 
internal controls and relevant ﬁnancial reporting matters, 
are presented to the Audit Committee and management.
A Whistleblowing hotline provides arrangements by which  
staff may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters. 
Staff may raise concerns in either English or the local language 
using a hotline phone number or by sending an email or letter 
to addresses especially created for the purpose. Regular 
updates on the Whistleblowing hotline are provided to the 
Audit Committee by respective Management Audit 
Committees. The Company’s Whistleblowing policy is 
available on the Company’s website, http://www.essarenergy.
com/about-us/contact-us/whistleblower-policy.aspx.
Anti-Corruption and Bribery
Essar Energy is committed to ensuring that its strategy, 
business and operations are built around a culture of ethical 
business practice at all levels within the Company. Since 
the UK Bribery Act 2010 came into force, the Company has 
carried out comprehensive risk assessment and developed 
and strengthened our policies and systems/procedures 
relating to anti-corruption and bribery in line with the Act. 
Our Anti-Corruption Policy is fundamental to this.
The Group has implemented extensive measures to ensure 
that the Group, all its subsidiaries, branches, divisions and 
controlled afﬁliated companies and all of its employees 
comply with the Company’s anti-corruption policies and 
procedures. All employees of the Company, including senior 
management, are subject to ongoing communications and 
training to build awareness of its anti-corruption and bribery 
policies and procedures. The policies and procedures 
contain requirements in relation to i) the conduct of 
employees; ii) arrangements pertaining to political 
contributions, charitable donations, gifts, hospitality, 
entertainment and sponsored travel and retaining third 
parties; and iii) prohibition of facilitation payments.
To create enterprise-wide awareness and improve 
understanding of the anti-corruption policies and procedures 
across all levels of employment, the Group utilises various 
channels of information and communication technologies, 
including an online competency evaluation tool on 
awareness, face to face training sessions such as leadership 
programmes, train the trainers programmes, awareness 
programmes, e-news alerts and road shows. In addition, the 
Group ensures that all third parties are engaged following 
proper due diligence and that all contracts signed by the 
Group incorporate appropriate anti-corruption clauses, 
according to the relevant risk, in order to safeguard the 
interests of the Group.
Compliance reporting systems have also been implemented 
to regularly monitor and track compliance with these policies 
and procedures at all levels of the Group. The Group 
undertakes continuous review of its policies and procedures 
and continues to improve these to ensure that they are 
adequate and meet the requirements of applicable anti-
corruption and bribery laws. The Company’s internal audit 
programme also monitors implementation of the policies, 
procedures and systems in relation to anti-corruption and 
bribery to ensure that strategies are effectively implemented 
across the Group.
Review of effectiveness
The Directors, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer consider that any controls and procedures,  
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired 
control objectives. The Group’s management is required to 
apply judgement in evaluating the risks facing the Group in 
achieving its objectives, in determining the risks that are 
considered acceptable to bear, in assessing the likelihood of the 
risks concerned materialising, in identifying the Company’s 
ability to reduce the incidence and impact on the business of 
risks that do materialise and in ensuring the costs of operating 
particular controls are proportionate to the beneﬁt. 
In reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls, during the period the Board has, through 
the Management Audit Committee and the Audit Committee, 
taken account of the matters summarised above. The Board 
considers that these matters provide the key building blocks 
for an assessment of the control environment and that the 
measures that have been implemented are appropriate to 
the Group. The Board is committed to building on these 
measures through the execution of the internal audit 
programme and the continued review by the Management 
Audit Committee and Audit Committee.
The control environment is assessed on an annual basis and 
the results are reported to the Audit Committee through the 
Internal Audit department. This review covers the control 
structure, control environment and the monitoring and review 
activities and is approved by the Audit Committee and 
reported to the Board.
Relations with investors
The Company is committed to the promotion of investor 
conﬁdence by ensuring that trade in its securities takes place 
in an efﬁcient, competitive and informed market. The Board is 
keenly aware of the importance of forthright communication 
as key to building shareholder value and of the importance of 
developing a dialogue with shareholders to ensure that the 
Board keeps abreast of and understands the views and 
opinions of shareholders. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Governance
It has achieved this during the period in a number of 
ways including:
 ensuring that all material information on the Company is 
broadly disseminated to investors, analysts and the media 
and that this information is available on the Company’s 
website at www.essarenergy.com. Distribution of 
information is via the UK’s regulatory news service, via 
email to the Company’s extensive contact database and 
through an email alert system on the Company’s website;
 the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and 
Director of Investor Relations and Communications 
regularly meet institutional shareholders, potential 
investors and analysts either individually or as part of 
group meetings;
 holding presentations to or conference calls with investors 
and analysts at the time of announcements of quarterly 
Interim Management Statements and ﬁnancial results or 
other major news. Historical web-casts of half and full year 
ﬁnancial results announcements are held on the 
Company’s website for a minimum of 12 months;
 regularly providing investor relations update reports 
describing investor and analyst opinions to the Board;
 arranging site visits for investors and analysts in order to 
provide more detailed knowledge of the Essar Energy 
Group. During 2011, two site visits were organised in India 
for investors and analysts which included presentations by 
the business teams, copies of which are available on the 
Company’s website; and
 ensuring that relevant and up-to-date information on 
the Company and its operations, together with press 
releases, ﬁnancial results and Annual Reports, are 
available on the Company’s website.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 which allow the Company’s website to 
be used as the primary means of communicating with those 
shareholders who have not speciﬁcally requested hard copy 
documentation. The Shareholder Information section of this 
report contains further details on electronic communications 
with shareholders.
The Board regards the Company’s AGM as a valuable 
opportunity to communicate with the Company’s investors 
and to address shareholders’ questions. In addition, the 
Directors generally make themselves available before and after 
the formal meeting to talk informally to shareholders.
The Company’s Director of Investor Relations and 
Communications, Mr Mark Lidiard, is based in the London 
ofﬁce and is contactable on +44 (0)20 7408 7660 or

The Company’s AGM will be held on Tuesday, 4 September 
2012. Separate resolutions on substantially separate issues will 
be put to the AGM and proxy forms will allow shareholders to 
vote for, against or withhold a vote on a resolution. Details of 
the proxy votes counted will be announced at the meeting and 
on the Company’s website after the meeting. The Chairman of 
the Board and the Chairmen of each of the Board Committees 
will be available to answer questions put forward to them by

Remuneration report
I am pleased to present the Remuneration report of Essar 
Energy for the 15 month period ended 31 March 2012. The 
Remuneration Committee’s key role is to advise the Board 
on the remuneration policies for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, 
members of the Senior Management and key management 
personnel. It advises on the determination of a remuneration 
framework that reﬂects our performance driven culture and 
rewards our people appropriately. It takes into account the 
global imperatives and local perspective while devising the 
rewards framework and the need to attract, motivate and 
retain our people.
During the 15 month period 1 January 2011 to 31 March 
2012, the Remuneration Committee discussed the following 
key topics and agenda items:
 Review of the Committee’s Terms of Reference
 Feedback from Institutional Bodies and proxy voting 
agencies on the 2010 Remuneration Report and 201 1 AGM
 Review of the suitability of performance measurement 
criteria for members of the Senior Management for the 
Annual Performance Linked Incentive (‘APLI’) scheme
 Grant of options under the Essar Energy Employee Stock 
Option Plan
 Remuneration related issues and Employee Share Plans 
resulting from the acquisition of the Stanlow reﬁnery by 
Essar Oil UK
 Review and restructuring of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s 
compensation
 Review of remuneration advisors
Going forward, the Committee intends to keep remuneration 
arrangements under review to ensure that they drive and 
enhance performance in a fair and responsible manner and 
reward contributions to the continuing success of the Group.
I hope that you will ﬁnd this report clear and informative, and 
I welcome all of your feedback on this report should you 
have any.
Subhas Lallah
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
22 June 2012
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 to the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008. The report also meets the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority. The Committee has adopted the 
Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ 
remuneration as set out in the Governance Code. As required 
by the Companies Act 2006, a resolution to approve the 
Directors’ Remuneration report will be proposed at the AGM. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the 
policy Essar Energy should adopt on the Executive Director’s 
remuneration. It determines the levels of remuneration for the 
Executive Director and the Chairman and recommends and 
monitors the level and structure of remuneration for members 
of the Senior Management and key management personnel. 
The Committee also reviews and approves the operation of 
share and share option schemes and the granting of such 
options, as well as preparing an annual remuneration report 
to be approved by the shareholders of Essar Energy plc at 
the AGM. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Subhas Lallah, 
and until 1 July 2012 its other members are Mr Simon Murray 
and Mr Philip Aiken. As of 1 July 2012, Mr Simon Murray will 
relinquish his role on the Committee and will be replaced by 
Mr Steve Lucas. Mr Subhas Lallah will remain the Chairman 
of the Committee and Mr Philip Aiken will remain a member. 
All current and future members of the Committee are 
considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive 
Directors in accordance with the recommendation of the 
Governance Code. The Committee’s Terms of Reference are 
reviewed periodically and are available on the Company’s 
website, www.essarenergy.com. During the period the 
Committee met three times. The attendance of members 
is set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 59. 
Deloitte LLP was independently retained by the Committee 
as advisors and have provided information on relevant 
current market practice and developments in best practice 
guidance. Deloitte LLP are signatories to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct.
Deloitte LLP also provided audit and other services 
compatible with their roles as auditors to the Group, as set 
out in Note 9 to the ﬁnancial statements and described more 
fully in the Corporate Governance report.
The Committee also received advice from Adil Malia 
(President Human Resources of Essar Global) and Rahul 
Taneja (SVP & Head of Corporate Human Resources of 
Essar Global) during the 2011–12 ﬁnancial year.
Further, during the 15 month period a review of the scope 
and value of the services provided to the Committee by 
Deloitte LLP was undertaken, and the Committee took steps 
to consider alternative advisors to advise the Committee. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Governance
Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy is to ensure that the Board and key 
management personnel are fairly rewarded with regard to 
responsibilities undertaken, taking into account appropriate 
market practice.
Corporate and individual performance is taken into account  
in setting the pay level for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, and is 
reviewed on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate. 
The Committee does not intend to increase the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer’s salary over the 2012–13 ﬁnancial year.
The Group’s policy is that Executive Directors should be 
employed on a rolling term, with a notice period not 
exceeding six months and that in the event of early 
termination, they should be treated fairly but paid no more 
than is necessary. It is the Company’s policy that there 
should be no element of reward for failure.
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee takes 
into account pay and employment conditions in place across 
the wider workforce of the Group.
Total rewards guiding principles:
The pay framework is designed to support the Company’s 
strategy and to be:
 Simple and understandable
 Transparent and easily communicated
 Competitive with the relevant external market
 Attractive to participants
 Strategically and culturally aligned
Pay for performance
There is a clear link between Company performance and the 
pay that can be earned by Executive Directors:
 Plans allow for differentiation based on performance
 Plans are linked to overall Group performance 
 The expected performance measures are communicated 
at the beginning of the performance period and are linked 
to both the Company’s Annual Business Plan and the 
longer term strategic objectives of the Group. The 
measures are also evaluated by the Remuneration 
Committee at the end of the period
 Annual bonus measures include proﬁts and cost 
management targets as well as broader measures of 
performance to support the Company’s culture including 
compliance and stakeholder relations
 Share options can only be exercised if earnings grow 
above the three year target and only have value if the 
share price rises above the exercise price
Proportion of total pay that is ﬁxed/variable
Fixed compensation (base salary and pension) for the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer represents approximately 70% of 
total compensation and variable pay of approximately 30% 
(for achieving target performance).
Summary of remuneration philosophy for the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and other members of the Senior 
Management:
The Committee aims to maintain an appropriate balance 
between ﬁxed and performance-related remuneration and 
between elements linked to ﬁnancial performance and 
long-term shareholder value creation. The APLI and ESOP 
are considered performance-related elements, while base 
salary is essentially ‘ﬁxed’, although performance is 
considered when determining annual increases. In addition 
to the APLI and ESOP , the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer also 
receives healthcare insurance for himself and his family 
through InterGlobal Ltd.

Components of remuneration
What Main Features
Base Salary Base salary of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is reviewed on an annual basis
Review takes into account the individual’s skills and experience in the context 
of the relevant market, his performance, and the scope, size and complexity of 
his role 
Targeted at or around the median of the market and may be positioned below 
or above the median depending on individual performance
Annual Performance Linked Incentive Annual incentive. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the members of the Senior 
Management participate in an annual incentive scheme, which is based on 
achievement of pre-deﬁned, Committee-approved corporate objectives and 
the individual’s contributions toward achieving those objectives
Based on a range of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial, corporate and individual 
performance criteria
Target 33.3% of base salary up to a maximum of 45% for stretch performance
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s performance contract has goals with clear linkage 
to the Annual Business Plan
Progress against the performance contract is monitored throughout the year
Employee Stock Option Plan Annual grants
Market value options
Subject to three year growth in EPS performance condition
Grant values up to 100% of Base Salary for Executive Directors (with a 
maximum of 300% in exceptional circumstances)
Pension Benchmarked against the market in which the Company operates
Cash supplement in lieu of pension
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is entitled to receive a pension contribution equivalent to 
10% of his base salary under his service contract
The Performance Graph
The Remuneration Committee has elected to compare the total shareholder return on the Company’s ordinary shares against 
the FTSE 100 index, principally because this is the index of which the Company was a constituent member for the majority of 
the 15 month period. The values indicated in the graph show the share price performance from a £100 hypothetical holding of 
ordinary shares in the Company and in the index, from the IPO date to 31 March 2012 and have been calculated using daily 
closing values. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

Governance
Employee Stock Option Plan
The Essar Energy Employee Stock Option Plan is intended to reward the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and selected members of the 
Senior Management who contribute signiﬁcantly to the Company’s business/proﬁts and the growth of shareholder value as 
well as to encourage improvement in employee performance and retention of talent.
The Scheme entitles the holder to acquire up to a maximum number of ordinary shares of the Company at a market value 
exercise price, provided certain performance criteria are met. The ESOP has a performance period of three years where the 
following percentage of options will vest depending on the growth in Earnings per Share (‘EPS’):
EPS Growth
Percentage 
of option that 
vests
Below 5% per annum None
5% per annum 30%
10% per annum and above 100%
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis between 30% and 100% where EPS growth is between 5% and 10% per annum. 
None of the options vest below 5% per annum EPS growth. EPS growth is seen as a straightforward way to assess the 
Group’s performance over the period of the ESOP scheme.
The Committee may make such adjustments to the growth in EPS targets as it considers appropriate to take account of any 
factors which are relevant in the opinion of the Committee, as per the ESOP scheme rules. 
The performance conditions will be retained in their current form for the 2012–13 ﬁnancial year. The performance measures 
and targets are reviewed annually to ensure they remain appropriate. 
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests are set out in the Directors’ report.
Directors’ remuneration and service contract
The following table summarises amounts paid during the 15 month period to 31 March 2012 or from date of appointment, 
if shorter. Please note that the Company’s 2011–12 ﬁnancial year covers a 15 month period, and therefore elements of 
compensation in the table below are larger than for a 12 month ﬁnancial year and as a result cannot be directly compared 
with the 2010 remuneration ﬁgures set out below. All amounts are in pound sterling. Information regarding the various 
elements of the Directors’ annual remuneration package, service contract and terms is further discussed below.

Changes to the structure of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s remuneration
Until 3 December 2011 Mr Nayyar was paid a combined annual salary, including bonus payments, of £976,808 under two 
service contracts with each of (i) Essar Energy Services (Mauritius) Limited dated 6 April 2010 and (ii) Essar Oil dated 24 July 
2007 . Amounts paid in India have been converted at a rate of £1 = INR 85.15. On 3 December 2011, these service contracts 
were consolidated within a single service contract with Essar Energy Services (Mauritius) Limited. There was no base salary 
increase as a result of this consolidation. The ﬁgure of £1,537 ,366 in the ﬁrst above table represents amounts paid to 
Mr Nayyar over the 15 month period of 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2012. 
Mr Nayyar is eligible to participate in an Annual Performance Linked Incentive scheme which provides a payment of up 
to 45% of base salary (at stretch level) subject to the achievement of certain performance targets relating to corporate and 
personal performance (with 33.3% of base salary for achieving target performance). In determining Mr Nayyar’s APLI amount, 
the Committee has taken into account a range of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial, corporate and individual performance criteria 
including asset operating performance, business ﬁnancial performance, health and safety performance, and the skills needed 
to run such a complex organisation including the execution of a major capital expenditure programme across the Company’s 
Reﬁning and Marketing and Power businesses.
In accordance with employment laws in Mauritius, Mr Nayyar also received a bonus of £56,906 equivalent to one month of 
his base salary from Essar Energy Services (Mauritius) Limited during the 15 month period ended 31 March 2012.
The options issued under the current ESOP scheme will not begin to vest until 2013 at the earliest.
Mr Nayyar is also eligible to participate in the ESOP awards granted since Listing, as set out in the table below.

During the 15 month period, the Company’s share price reached a high of 590.5 pence, and a low of 99.8 pence. 
The closing price of the shares as at 31 March 2012 was 155.3 pence. There were no movements in the options held 
other than as noted above.
As indicated on IPO, it was the Committee’s intention to grant options to certain members of Senior Management under 
the ESOP scheme shortly following IPO at around the Listing price of 420 pence. The Committee was unable to make these 
option grants until 15 November 2010, but the market price of the Company’s shares rose strongly in the intervening period. 
In order to ensure the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and certain members of Senior Management were not disadvantaged by the 
delay in granting options to them, the Committee awarded each individual concerned an additional cash right. This right is 
exercisable in conjunction with or in place of the share option, depending on the share price at exercise. The salary multiple 
used in determining the number of shares under these options was calculated by reference to the 420 pence Listing price, 
not the share price shortly before the grant date. Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012

£10,000 per annum for serving on a Board Committee and an additional £5,000 per annum for chairing a Board Committee. 
Such amounts were revised by the Board in June, and with effect from 1 July 2012, the Non-Executive Directors will each be

STATEMENT S
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
also chosen to prepare the Company ﬁnancial statements 
under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the 
Company for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial 
position and ﬁnancial performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company 
and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position 
and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 the management report (entitled ‘Business Review’), 
which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Essar Energy plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Essar Energy plc

the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Group and parent company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and parent company Cash Flow 
Statements, the Group and parent company Statements of 
Changes in Equity and the related Notes 1 to 45. The ﬁnancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read 
all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
 the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2012 and of the Group’s loss for the 
period then ended;
 the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements,

STATEMENT S GOVERNAN C E
Emphasis of matter – Going concern 
In forming our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, which is not 
modiﬁed, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure 
made in Note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements concerning the 
Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
As discussed in Note 1, following a ruling of the Supreme 
Court of India, the Group has a liability to pay sales tax, 
although the timing of such payment is uncertain and is 
dependent on a separate legal process. The Group is in 
advanced stages of establishing a new loan facility with its 
lenders to fund the sales tax repayment as and when required 
but the facility is not yet committed. 
Accordingly in these circumstances, the Directors have had to 
conclude that this represents a material uncertainty which may 
cast signiﬁcant doubt about the Group and Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. The ﬁnancial statements do 
not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and 
Company were unable to continue as a going concern.
Emphasis of matter – Interest on sales tax liability
In forming our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, which 
is not modiﬁed, we have considered the adequacy of the 
disclosures made in Note 29 to the ﬁnancial statements 
concerning the uncertain outcome of a lawsuit relating to 
the Group’s liability to pay interest on sales tax owed to the 
State of Gujarat. The Group has ﬁled a writ petition seeking 
remission of interest and is awaiting the outcome of such 
action. The ultimate outcome of the matter cannot presently 
be determined, and no provision for any interest liability that 
may result has been made in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Directors’ report for the 
ﬁnancial period for which the ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by 
law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ 
report and Financial review sections of the Annual Report, 
in relation to going concern; 
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our 
review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board on Directors’ remuneration.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
1. Presentation of ﬁnancial statements
1.1 Corporate information
Essar Energy plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. 
The address of the registered ofﬁce is 3rd Floor, Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, W1J 6ER and its head ofﬁce is 
10, Frere Felix Valois Street, Port Louis, Mauritius.
The Company was incorporated in the UK on 18 December 2009 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Essar Global Limited 
(‘EGL ’ or ‘parent company’).
Between 18 December 2009 and 7 May 2010, the Company was party to a series of transactions with other EGL group 
companies whereby it acquired control of the Reﬁnery and Marketing, Exploration and Production, and Power businesses 
of EGL prior to IPO.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates.
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 31.
Change in accounting year
The Indian Income Tax Act requires Indian companies to ﬁle their annual accounts and returns based on the year ended  
31 March. All Indian companies within the Group prepare their accounts on this basis. To ensure that all accounting periods 
are aligned within the Group, the Company announced in August 2011 that it had decided to also change its year end to  
31 March. This change in year end means that Essar Energy plc is publishing ﬁnancial statements for the 15 months ended 
31 March 2012. Comparative ﬁgures are for the 12 months ended 31 December 2010 and hence are not directly comparable.
1.2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
regulations. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by 
the revaluation of available-for-sale assets, and ﬁnancial assets and liabilities.
The Group was formed under a series of transactions with entities under the same control as the Company, referred to 
as common control transactions between 18 December 2009 and 7 May 2010. The Company was party to a series of 
transactions with other Essar Global Limited group companies whereby it acquired control of the Reﬁnery and Marketing, 
Exploration and Production, and Power businesses of Essar Global Limited prior to IPO on 7 May 2010. The Group 
accordingly prepared its ﬁrst set of IFRS consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 using 
merger accounting principles, as if the transactions giving rise to the formation of the Group took place prior to 
1 January 2009.
Once control was obtained, further acquisitions of non-controlling interests have been dealt with through reserves. 
Businesses which were transferred out of the ownership of the Group’s subsidiaries to entities held under common control 
were excluded from the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The assets, liabilities and the proﬁt or loss of the entities comprising the Group have been consolidated and all transactions 
and balances between entities included within the Group have been eliminated on consolidation.
Invested capital reﬂected the aggregated equity of the Reﬁnery and Marketing, Exploration and Production, and Power 
businesses, prior to the formation of the Group. At the point at which the Company became the parent company of the 
Group, the Group’s equity reﬂected the share capital and share premium of the Company, together with other reserves arising 
on consolidation as shown in the statement of changes in equity and Note 23.
Note 11 sets out how the Group has applied these principles in establishing its earnings per share for 2010.
EGL remains the ultimate parent company of the Group and its controlling party.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business Review. The Business Review also includes a summary of the Group’s ﬁnancial position, its cash ﬂows 
and borrowing facilities.

1.3 Going concern
The Group has prepared detailed annual business plans for the year to June 2013 based on the annual business plans for the 
2013 ﬁnancial year. These business plans were used as the basis for assessing the Group’s cash headroom and compliance 
with banking covenants. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within its current available funding and anticipated roll-over of 
facilities which mature in the ordinary course of business together with other facilities which have been agreed with the 
relevant banks but await ﬁnal documentation.
As set out in Note 8, on 17 January 2012, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Group was not entitled to participate in 
the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), and on 24 January the Government of Gujarat served notice on the Group 
requiring it to pay the outstanding sales tax liability of US$1,186.9 million plus associated interest. The Group has now ﬁled a 
writ petition with the High Court of Gujarat to waive or reduce the interest owed, and to defer the payment of sales tax over a 
number of years as may be permitted under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003. The High Court of Gujarat has admitted 
the writ petition and asked the Government of Gujarat to consider this application. In view of the matter being sub judice, the 
timing of payment of the sales tax liability and related interest, if any, is not deﬁnitive, and will not be known until determined by 
the current legal process. In view of this and based on legal advice, the interest on the sales tax liability has been treated as a 
contingency as set out in Note 29. 
The Group plans to fund any repayment of the sales tax liability through a combination of internal funding and through 
obtaining a new loan facility. The Group is currently in advanced stages of establishing credit facilities of US$1 billion with its 
lenders to ensure that the Group has adequate funds available to meet any liabilities due to the State of Gujarat as and when 
the decision of the Government of Gujarat/the High Court is established. Although the facility is expected to be committed 
shortly, the process is ongoing. 
For this reason the Directors are required to conclude that these circumstances represents a material uncertainty that may 
cast signiﬁcant doubt upon the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Although there is no deﬁnitive sales tax liability payment schedule at this time, the Board is conﬁdent of arranging the facility 
well ahead of any payments falling due, resulting from the pending legal process. In addition, if the Government of Gujarat 
permits payment of the liability in instalments as requested then the facility may not be fully drawn down with the liability partly 
met through the Group’s internal resources. The Directors have examined all available evidence and have concluded that 
although there is a risk that they will not be able to secure agreement with the lender outlined above, in light of the supportive 
nature of the relationship held with the lender and the advanced stage the Group is in establishing the facility, the Directors are 
satisﬁed that adequate ﬁnancial resources will continue to be made available to the Group and the Company so as to enable it 
to continue to trade on a going concern basis. As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Group’s and Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group, none of 
which had a material impact on the current or prior year reported results and the ﬁnancial position: 
 Amendment to IFRS 1 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters;
 IAS 19 (revised) will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. It is likely that following the replacement 
of expected returns on plan assets with a net ﬁnance cost in the income statement, the proﬁt for the period will be reduced 
and accordingly other comprehensive income increased;
 IAS 24 (2009) Related Party Disclosures;
 Amendment to IAS 32 Classiﬁcation of Rights Issues;
 Amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement;
 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments;
 IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers; and
 Improvements to IFRSs 2010.

1.5 Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by 
the EU):
 IFRS 1 (amended) Severe Hyperinﬂation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters;
 IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets;
 IFRS 9  Financial Instruments;
 IFRS 10  Consolidated Financial Statements;
 IFRS 11  Joint Arrangements;
 IFRS 12  Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities;
 IFRS 13  Fair Value Measurement;
 IAS 1 (amended) Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income;
 IAS 12 (amended) Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets;
 IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements;
 IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures; and
 IFRIC 20  Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the ﬁnancial 
statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows:
 IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and classiﬁcations of Financial Instruments;
 IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests that the Group has in other entities; and
 IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed.
2. Accounting policies and estimates
2.1 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
2.1.1 Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses from third parties are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments 
issued by the Group on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition in exchange for control of the acquiree, except for a 
business combination under common control which is described below. The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations are recognised 
at their fair value at the date of acquisition, except for non-current assets that are classiﬁed as held for sale in accordance with 
IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets held for sale and discontinued operations which are recognised at fair value less costs to sell.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the ﬁrst post-acquisition ﬁnancial 
statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional 
fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are ﬁnalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the purchase consideration over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If, however, the fair values of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost 
of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill that is recognised as an asset 
and is initially measured at cost, is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in 
proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed. Internally generated goodwill is not recognised.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders’ proportion of 
the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised and subsequently also includes the non-controlling 
shareholders’ proportion of changes in equity since the date of combination.
The Group follows the entity concept method of accounting for changes in ownership interest in subsidiaries. In the event of 
a purchase of a minority shareholders’ interest where the Group holds the majority of shares of a subsidiary, any excess over 
the Group’s share of net assets is recorded in retained earnings without change in goodwill.

REVIEW GOVERNAN C E
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
Common control acquisitions
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries acquired from entities under common control are recorded at the carrying value 
recognised by the transferor. Any differences between the carrying value of the net assets of subsidiaries acquired, and 
the consideration paid by the Group is accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings. When the transferor contributes 
the subsidiaries to the Group, the original cost paid by the transferor is recorded as capital investment with the differences 
recorded as an increase in retained earnings. The net assets of the subsidiaries and their results are recognised from the 
date on which control of the subsidiaries was obtained by the transferor.
2.1.2 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of 
the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is 
initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to beneﬁt 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
2.1.3 Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of petroleum products is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of trade 
discounts, volume rebates, value added tax, sales taxes and duties. A sale is recognised when economic beneﬁts associated 
with the sale are expected to ﬂow to the Group and the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed 
and it can be reliably measured. This is usually when title and insurance risk has passed to the customer.
Revenue from power supply is accounted for on the basis of billings to consumers or unbilled supply of power. Generally all 
consumers are billed on the basis of recording of consumption of electricity by installed meters. Sales of electricity are 
accounted for based on relevant tariff rates applicable under the contract with the customer.
Revenue associated with sales tax deferral is recognised in accordance with the Group’s policy for accounting for government 
grants set out in 2.1.4.
2.1.4 Sales tax incentives
The Group believed it was entitled to the beneﬁt of certain sales tax incentives under the Capital Investment Incentive Premier/
Prestigious Units Scheme 1995–2000 (the ‘Sales Tax Incentive Scheme’). The beneﬁts under the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme 
were recognised when it was reasonable to expect that the beneﬁt would be received and that all related conditions would be 
met. The beneﬁt of a sales tax deferral with no associated interest outﬂow was recognised as a liability in accordance with the 
imputation rule under IAS 20 Accounting for Government grants and disclosure of Government assistance. This deferred 
liability was measured in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The beneﬁt of the 
below market rate of interest (or no interest) was measured as the difference between initial carrying value of the ﬁnancial 
liability as determined in accordance with IAS 39 and the sales tax collected.
The beneﬁts under the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme were available when eligible domestic sales were made from the Gujarat 
State and the sale was therefore treated as the key condition giving rise to the recognition of the beneﬁt. It was expected that all 
other conditions related to the deferral of sales tax would be met and therefore the beneﬁt was recognised as eligible domestic 
sales were made. The deferred liability to the State was recognised at its net present value, and therefore a ﬁnance charge was 
recorded as the discount on this liability.
Note 8a sets out details of the adjustments made following the ruling of the Honourable Supreme Court of India that the 
Group could not participate in the Scheme.

2.1.5 Foreign currency transactions and translation
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each entity 
are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into 
functional currency at the exchange rates at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other 
currencies are translated into functional currency at exchange rates at the reporting date and exchange differences are 
recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in US dollars. For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement 
items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates 
of exchange during the year. The related balance sheets are translated at the rates at the balance sheet date. Goodwill arising 
on consolidation which is attributed to an entity for which the US dollar is not the functional currency is translated into US 
dollars at the rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation are reported in the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity.

2.1.6 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
In order to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate risk, the Group enters into forward, option 
and swap contracts. The Group also enters into ﬁnancial instruments to acquire non-controlling stakes of its subsidiaries to 
increase its stake. Additionally the Group provides warrants over stakes held in certain subsidiaries. The Group does not use 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and 
it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
The Group’s derivative arrangements are not designated hedges under the deﬁnitions of IAS 39. Consequently, all fair value 
movements in respect of derivative ﬁnancial instruments are taken to the income statement. Further details of derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments including fair value measurements are disclosed in Note 22.
2.1.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The initial cost of 
an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, 
the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation, and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs if the recognition criteria 
are met.
The cost of mining properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral 
rights, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment in the period in which such costs are incurred.
Costs directly related to construction, including costs and revenues arising from testing, speciﬁc ﬁnancing costs and foreign 
exchange losses, are capitalised up to the point where the property, plant and equipment become operational. Property, 
plant and equipment become operational once all testing and trial runs are complete and it is ready for use in the manner 
management intended. Income from the sale of products as a result of testing and trial runs of a new asset are part of the 
directly attributable cost of assets and therefore deducted from the cost of the asset. The purchase price or construction 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. The capitalised 
value of a ﬁnance lease is also included within property, plant and equipment. Likewise, when a major inspection or major 
maintenance is undertaken, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 
recognition criteria are satisﬁed. All other repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in the proﬁt or loss as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction is carried at cost, less accumulated impairment losses, if any, 
and is not depreciated.

STATEMENTS
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in proﬁt or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
ﬁnancial year end.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment other than freehold land and properties under construction is calculated to 
write off the cost of the asset to its residual value using the straight line method or the written down value method or on a unit 
of production basis as appropriate, over its expected useful life. Depreciation begins when the assets become ready for use.
Depreciation is calculated over the estimated useful lives of assets and on the basis of depreciation methods as follows:
Asset Depreciation method

useful life 
(years)

Plant and equipment

Motor vehicles Written down value 9–11
1 Expected useful life post acquisition of Stanlow reﬁnery.
Property, plant and equipment held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term and estimated 
useful life.
2.1.8 Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, including producing properties and leases, intangible assets 
(excluding goodwill) and investments in joint controlled entities are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Where it is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine 
whether the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the carrying value of the asset or the cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and 
impairment loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in 
use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but such that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
2.1.9 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the costs 
of those assets during the construction phase on an effective interest basis, until such time as the assets are ready for their 
intended use or sale which, in the case of producing or mining properties, is when saleable material begins to be extracted 
from such properties. Where surplus funds are available for a short-term out of money borrowed speciﬁcally to ﬁnance a 
qualiﬁed asset, the income generated from such short-term investments is deducted from capitalised borrowing costs.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

2.1.10 Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at 
inception date of; whether the fulﬁlment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a speciﬁc asset or assets or the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the 
leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the 
ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in 
which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs (see above).
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there 
is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Payments made under operating leases, where the lessors effectively retain substantially all the risk and beneﬁts of ownership 
of the lease property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease 
term. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease. 
Property, plant and equipment used by the Group under operating leases are not recognised in the Group’s balance sheet.
2.1.11 Financial assets
All ﬁnancial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a ﬁnancial asset is under 
a contract whose terms require delivery of the ﬁnancial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and 
are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets into the following speciﬁed categories: at Fair Value Through Proﬁt or Loss (‘FVTPL ’), cash 
and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and Available-for-sale (‘AFS’) ﬁnancial assets. The classiﬁcation is dependent on the 
nature and purpose of the ﬁnancial assets acquired. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial 
recognition. Further details on the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and fair value measurement are disclosed in Note 26.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets at FVTPL include ﬁnancial assets held for trading or designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Financial assets are classiﬁed as held for trading if:
(i) acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; 
(ii) they are a part of an identiﬁed portfolio of ﬁnancial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual 
pattern of short-term proﬁt-taking; or
(iii) they are derivatives unless these are designated as effective hedging instruments.
A ﬁnancial asset other than a ﬁnancial asset held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
(i) such designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; 
(ii) the ﬁnancial asset forms part of a group of ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or 
investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
(iii) it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in proﬁt or 
loss. The net gain or loss recognised in proﬁt or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the ﬁnancial asset and is 
included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item in the income statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in 
Note 26.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less any allowance for impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying effective interest rate, except for short-term 
receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. Gains and losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss when the 
loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process.

AFS ﬁnancial investments
Listed shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classiﬁed as being AFS and are stated at fair value. The 
Group invests in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but classiﬁed as AFS ﬁnancial investments and stated at 
fair value (because the Directors consider that fair value can be reliably measured). Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated reserves with the exception of impairment losses, interest 
calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are recognised 
directly in proﬁt or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in proﬁt or loss when the Group’s right to receive the dividend is 
established. The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency 
and translated at the spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in proﬁt 
or loss are determined based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign exchange gains and losses are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the ﬁnancial asset, the estimated future cash ﬂows of the investment have been affected.
For ﬁnancial assets carried at amortised cost the Group assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for assets 
that are individually signiﬁcant, or collectively for ﬁnancial assets that are not individually signiﬁcant. Objective evidence of 
impairment could include:
(i) signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the issuer or counterparty; 
(ii) default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
(iii) it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganisation.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows (excluding future expected credit 
losses that have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows is discounted at the ﬁnancial 
asset’s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss 
is the current effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
For AFS ﬁnancial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an 
investment or a Group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classiﬁed as AFS, objective evidence for impairment would include a signiﬁcant or prolonged 
decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss (measured 
as  he difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously 
recognised in the income statement) is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement; increases in their fair value after 
impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
2.1.12 Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at FVTPL or other ﬁnancial liabilities at initial recognition. The Group’s 
other ﬁnancial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and ﬁnance lease payables. All ﬁnancial liabilities are 
recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, include directly attributable transaction costs.
The measurement of ﬁnancial liabilities depends on their classiﬁcation as follows:
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities at FVTPL include those held for trading and ﬁnancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in 
the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the income statement.
87 Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012
Financial statements
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
Other ﬁnancial liabilities
Other ﬁnancial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other ﬁnancial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised 
on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial liability 
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the ﬁnancial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, 
to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities 
are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Financial guarantee contracts
The Group provides certain guarantees in respect of the indebtedness of subsidiary undertakings, claims under contract and 
other arrangements in the ordinary course of business. The Group evaluates each arrangement to determine whether it is an 
insurance or a ﬁnancial guarantee contract. Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and, 
if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the obligation under the contract 
and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation over period of guarantee provided.
Once the arrangements are designated as insurance contracts, these are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the 
obligations under guarantee become probable.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial liabilities
The Group derecognises ﬁnancial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled, 
extinguished or expire.
2.1.13 Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, and it is 
probable that an outﬂow of resources, that can reliably be estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows to net present 
value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement as a 
ﬁnance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reﬂect the current best estimate.
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed 
the economic beneﬁts expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reﬂect the least net cost 
of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulﬁlling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure 
to fulﬁl it. These provisions are charged to the income statement as and when the contract is executed.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an obligation will only be conﬁrmed by future events or where the 
amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an 
inﬂow of economic beneﬁts is probable.
In normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group.
2.1.14 Inventories
Inventories (other than crude oil extracted by the Exploration and Production segment) are valued at lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Crude oil extracted and in saleable condition is valued at net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the following bases:
(i) Raw materials and consumables are determined at weighted average cost except crude oil for the reﬁnery which is 
measured on a ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out basis. 
(ii) Finished products and work in progress are determined at direct material cost, labour cost and a proportion of 
manufacturing overheads based on normal or allocated capacity. 
(iii) Inventories held for trading purposes are determined at weighted average cost.
Net realisable value is determined by reference to estimated prices existing at the balance sheet date for inventories less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

2.1.15 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are amortised over their useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that an intangible asset may be impaired. The asset’s useful lives and methods of amortisation are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at each ﬁnancial year end.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in proﬁt or loss when the asset is derecognised.
Finite lived intangible assets, which are subject to amortisation, are amortised over their useful lives as mentioned below:

2.1.16 Joint controlled entities
A joint controlled entity is an entity in which the Group shares joint control over the strategic, ﬁnancial and operating decisions 
with one or more ventures under a contractual arrangement.
Investment in joint controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is 
classiﬁed as held for sale, which is recognised at fair value less costs to sell. In accordance with the equity method, investments 
in joint controlled entities are measured at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint controlled 
entities, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Goodwill arising from the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised of the joint controlled entities is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of 
the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised 
immediately in proﬁt or loss.
The income statement reﬂects share of results of operations of the joint controlled entities. Where there has been a change 
recognised directly in equity of the joint controlled entities, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in 
the statement of changes in equity. Proﬁts and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint controlled 
entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant joint controlled entities.
2.1.17 Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for oil and gas resources, the determination of technical feasibility and 
the assessment of commercial viability of an identiﬁed resource.
Exploration and evaluation activity includes:
(i) researching and analysing historical exploration data;
(ii) gathering exploration data through geological and geophysical studies;
(iii) exploratory and appraisal drilling;
(iv) evaluating and testing discoveries;
(v) determining transportation and infrastructure requirements; and
(vi) conducting market and ﬁnance studies.
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a speciﬁc exploration area are charged to the proﬁt and loss account. 
License costs paid in connection with a right to explore an existing exploration area are capitalised. Exploration and evaluation 
expenditure (including amortisation of capitalised license costs) is charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred except in 
the following circumstances:
(i) the exploration and evaluation activity is related to an established discovery for which commercially recoverable reserves 
have already been established; or
(ii) at the balance sheet date, exploration and evaluation activity has not reached a stage which permits a reasonable 
assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable reserves.
89 Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012
Financial statements
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure considered to be tangible is recorded as a component of property, plant 
and equipment at cost less impairment losses, if any. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is monitored for 
indicators of impairment. Where a potential impairment is indicated, an impairment test of the capitalised exploration and 
evaluation expenditure is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the Group or pool of operating assets 
(representing a cash generating unit) to which the exploration is attributed. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is 
not expected to be recovered it is charged to the proﬁt and loss account. Exploration areas, at which reserves have been 
discovered but that require major capital expenditure before production can begin, are continually evaluated to ensure that 
commercial quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional exploration or evaluation work is under way or planned.
2.1.18 Development expenditure
When commercially recoverable reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, the capitalised exploration and 
evaluation expenditure is transferred to assets under construction after impairment is assessed and any resulting impairment 
loss is recognised. Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, 
pipelines and the drilling of development wells are capitalised as assets under construction.
On completion of a development, all capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure together with the subsequent 
development expenditure transferred to producing properties are depreciated using unit of production method. This is carried 
out with reference to quantities, with depletion computed on the basis of the ratio that oil and gas production bears to balance 
proved and probable reserves at commencement of the year.
2.1.19 Tax 
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided on taxable income at amounts expected to be paid or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting purposes.
In India, the current tax payable by a company is charged to the income statement in the applicable period at the corporate 
tax rate computed under the normal provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act or the minimum alternate tax (‘MAT’), whichever 
is higher. Excess paid under MAT can be carried forward for up to 10 years as a credit against corporate income tax in the 
future. Where the MAT credit satisﬁes the relevant criteria under IAS 12 Income Taxes, it is recognised as a deferred tax asset. 
Deferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
(i) where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss; and
(ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint controlled 
entities, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax credits carried forward and unused 
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be 
recovered. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset will be 
realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to 
the extent that it has become probable that future taxable proﬁt will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the income statement, except when they relate to items 
credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the 
initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in 
calculating goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the business combination.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current 
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
tax authority.

2.1.20 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks with original maturity of 
less than 90 days and short-term highly liquid investments, that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to 
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in the principal amount. Bank overdrafts, which are repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the operations are included in cash and cash equivalents.
2.1.21 Retirement beneﬁts
The Group operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution schemes for its employees as well as post employment 
beneﬁt plans. For deﬁned contribution schemes the amount charged as expense is the contributions paid or payable when 
employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
For deﬁned beneﬁt pension and post-employment beneﬁt plans, full actuarial valuations are carried out every year end 
using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognised in the proﬁt and 
loss account.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight line basis over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested.
The employee beneﬁt obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation 
as reduced by the fair value of the related plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the reductions in 
future contributions to the plan.
Detailed disclosures are not provided within the ﬁnancial statements as amounts associated with such schemes are not 
considered to be signiﬁcant.
2.1.22 Share-based payments
The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair 
value at grant date. They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that 
will eventually vest. Charges are reversed if it appears that non-market performance will not be met. Options are valued using 
the Black-Scholes model.
2.1.23 IPO costs
Incremental directly attributable costs incurred on issue of equity shares are offset against the share premium account in 
accordance with Companies Act 2006 and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
2.2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the course of applying the policies set out in section 2.1 above, management have made estimations and assumptions that 
impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures. Several of these estimates 
and judgements are related to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. These estimates and 
judgements are evaluated at each reporting date and are based on historical experience, internal controls, advice from 
external experts and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates may vary from the actual results. The Group believes that the 
assumptions, judgements and estimations that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial period are the following areas:
2.2.1 Sales tax beneﬁt
The Group in the past recognised a beneﬁt from its application for certain sales tax incentives given by the state of Gujarat 
provided the sales were made from the state of Gujarat. Under these incentive schemes, the Group believed it was able to 
defer the payment of up to approximately Rs. 91 billion (US$1.95 billion) collected as sales tax for eligible domestic sales made 
from the state of Gujarat until the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2021 (or earlier if the full eligible limit was exhausted), after 
which it would be required to repay the retained amounts of sales tax in six equal annual instalments. There were a number 
of conditions under which this beneﬁt has been granted including: (i) ensuring that certain percentages of the employees are 
local people; (ii) re-investing certain amounts of the beneﬁt; (iii) adhering to speciﬁed pollution control measures; and 
(iv) contributing a certain amount to the prescribed rural development scheme in the state of Gujarat.
The amount of beneﬁt recorded was based on management’s expectation that it would begin repayments in 2021 and that 
it would comply with all the related conditions. This was based on the fact that management intended to comply with all 
such conditions, was able to control its compliance, and intended to monitor the sales to allow the Group to beneﬁt from 
the maximum deferral period. Any change in this assessment would have resulted in a change in the beneﬁt that would be 
recorded in that period.
91 Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012
Financial statements
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
The Group had recorded the sales tax beneﬁt as revenue in the period in which the associated eligible domestic sales were 
made to customers. Under IAS 20, the beneﬁt may only be recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will 
comply with the conditions attached to the beneﬁt and must be recognised over the period necessary to match the beneﬁt 
systematically with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Recognition of the beneﬁt in proﬁt or loss on an 
accruals basis was appropriate only where no suitable basis exists for allocating the beneﬁt to periods other than the one in 
which it is received.
Management had exercised its judgement in assessing the period over which to recognise the beneﬁt and believed there 
were no signiﬁcant costs or expenses that the incentive was intended to compensate, as the plant’s location was determined 
before the incentive became available and as this incentive was set up, amongst other things, to improve the economic 
wellbeing of the state of Gujarat. Accordingly, the Group had recognised the beneﬁt in the period of the eligible domestic sales 
made from the state of Gujarat, being the primary condition associated with the beneﬁt. An alternative view would be that the 
sales tax beneﬁt was intended to compensate recipients for the costs of setting up and/or conducting their business in the 
State of Gujarat, in which case the beneﬁt could have been recognised over the period necessary to match such costs. For 
example, a differing judgement may be to (i) recognise the beneﬁt during the period in which the Company incurred operating 
expenses whilst it enjoyed the beneﬁt (for example, 13 years being the remaining period for which the sales tax payment could 
be deferred) or (ii) recognise the beneﬁt over the expected life of the capital asset constructed, namely the Vadinar reﬁnery (the 
depreciation period for which is 40 years) both of which would have resulted in materially different results in the periods 
presented with signiﬁcantly lower revenue and proﬁt.
The Group’s eligibility to participate in the Scheme was challenged by the State Government of Gujarat (see Note 8a) and on 
17 January 2012 the Honourable Supreme Court of India set aside the previous judgment of the High Court of Gujarat and 
ruled that the Group could not participate in the scheme. The Group continued to apply the accounting policy in respect of 
the sales tax beneﬁt up to 17 January 2012 as the revenue was earned. The loss of the beneﬁt as a result of the Honourable 
Supreme Court judgment on 17 January 2012 is a change in estimate of revenue earned up to 17 January 2012. This requires 
that the entire amount previously recognised to 17 January 2012 is adjusted in the current period against each individual line 
item through which the relevant beneﬁt or associated costs were recognised.
2.2.2 Borrowing costs
The Group is required to calculate the borrowing costs associated with certain ﬁnancial liabilities based on the estimated 
future cash ﬂows arising on those liabilities under the effective interest method of accounting. These estimated future cash 
ﬂows may be uncertain due to various options and other terms within the related borrowing agreements which may provide 
for early repayment of borrowings, so reducing future interest payments. The Group reassesses its best estimate of such 
future cash ﬂows under each borrowing agreement at each reporting date, and gains and losses may arise as a result  
(refer Note 8b).
2.2.3 Contingencies and commitments
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group. Potential 
liabilities that have a low probability of crystallising or are very difﬁcult to quantify reliably, are treated as contingent liabilities. 
Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. There can be no 
assurance regarding the ﬁnal outcome of these legal proceedings. For further details, refer to Note 29.
2.2.4 Depreciable lives
The Group’s relevant non-current assets are depreciable over their estimated useful lives as set out in section 2.1 above. Such 
lives are dependent upon an assessment of both the technical lives of the assets and also their likely economic lives based on 
factors including commodity prices, alternative sources of supply, relative efﬁciency and operating costs. Accordingly 
depreciable lives are reviewed annually using the best information available to management.
2.2.5 Impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Other non-current assets are tested for impairment when conditions suggest that 
there is a risk of impairment. Where impairment testing is carried out, management uses the best information available to 
them to assess the likely cash ﬂows available to the relevant asset. Key assumptions are inherently uncertain and include 
commodity prices, anticipated production costs, likely asset lives, the timing of granting of licenses and permits and the 
relevant discount rates.
2.2.6 Tax
The Group is subject to tax, principally within India. The amount of tax payable in respect of any period is dependent upon the 
interpretation of the relevant tax rules. Whilst an assessment must be made of the deferred tax position of each entity within 
the Group, these matters are inherently uncertain until the position of each entity is agreed with the relevant tax authorities.

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. The Group reviews the deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period and 
reduces them to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the 
deferred tax assets to be utilised. The estimation of that probability includes judgements based on the expected performance 
of the Group. Various factors are considered to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including 
past operating results, operational plans, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and tax planning strategies.
2.2.7 Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2.1.17 . In making a 
decision about whether to continue to capitalise exploration and evaluation expenditures, it is necessary to make judgements 
about the satisfaction of, if (a) proved reserves are booked or (b) (i) if they have found commercially producible quantities of 
reserves and (ii) if they are subject to further exploration or appraisal activity in that either drilling of additional exploratory wells 
is under way or ﬁrmly planned for the near future or other activities are being undertaken to sufﬁciently progress the assessing 
of reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If there is a change in one of these judgements in a 
subsequent period, then the related capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures would be expensed in that period 
resulting in a charge to income.
2.2.8 Fair valuation on acquisition
On 31 July 2011 the Group acquired the oil reﬁnery and other associated assets at Stanlow, near Ellesmere Port, Cheshire 
(‘Stanlow reﬁnery’) from Shell UK Limited (‘Shell’).
The assets and its existing employees that enable the reﬁnery to be managed to process crude and other inputs to create 
outputs in the form of saleable products are considered to be an integrated set of activities. The acquisition was thus treated 
as a business combination.
The management has fair valued all the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the business combination. The fair value of 
the assets acquired (primarily being the reﬁnery plant and equipment) using a discounted cash ﬂow model. The model was 
based on cash ﬂows projected for the operations of the assets acquired for 10 years. The projected cash ﬂows were 
discounted at a discount rate speciﬁc to the business. The inventory was purchased at fair value.
The difference between the amount paid as purchase consideration plus the deferred consideration and the fair value of 
the assets and liabilities showed a gain on bargain purchase. Management reassessed the identiﬁcation of all assets and 
liabilities. In particular, the exercise focused on the identiﬁcation of intangibles like brand or favourable customer contracts, 
provision for untaken employee leave, lease agreements, unfavourable contracts and other liabilities. This review identiﬁed 
additional provisions that were made based on their fair value. No other items were identiﬁed by management that required 
recognition or measurement of asset or liability.
The surplus of the value in use calculated from the fair value exercise after the identiﬁcation of all assets and liabilities was 
recognised in the income statement as a gain on bargain purchase in line with the Group policy.
3. Segment information
Information reported to the Board for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of performance is primarily 
determined by the nature of the different activities that the Group engages in, rather than the geographical location of these 
operations. This is reﬂected by the Group’s organisational structure and internal ﬁnancial reporting systems. The proﬁtability 
of the segments is reviewed based on proﬁt or loss after tax and is based on IFRS. The Group has the following reportable 
operating segments:
(i) R&M-India (Reﬁnery and Marketing – India and others): The Group owns a petroleum reﬁnery on the west coast of India, 
together with a 50% interest in a petroleum reﬁnery in Kenya, and oil retailing stations on franchise across India. Its main 
products are high speed diesel, motor spirit, fuel oil and superior kerosene oil. The activities of Reﬁning and Marketing 
include the reﬁning of crude oil and trading, marketing and transportation of ﬁnished products and by-products.
(ii) R&M-UK (Reﬁnery and Marketing – UK): On 31 July 2011 the Group acquired the Stanlow reﬁnery in the United Kingdom 
as discussed further in Note 27 . Its main products are high speed diesel, motor spirit, fuel oil and superior kerosene oil. 
The activities of Reﬁning and Marketing include the reﬁning of crude oil and trading, marketing and transportation of 
ﬁnished products and by-products.
(iii) Exploration and Production: The Group has a diverse portfolio of 15 blocks for the exploration and production of oil and 
gas in India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Nigeria and Vietnam.
(iv) Power: The Group operates gas and liquid fuel-based power plants in India and Canada together with a number of 
mining assets.
(v) Corporate: This comprises Essar Energy plc and its subsidiary companies that provide services to the Group as a whole.
Sales between the segments are made at contractually agreed prices. The segment revenues and segment results include 
transaction between business segments. All inter and intra transactions including all proﬁt or loss made within these segments 
are eliminated on Group consolidation.

The sales tax beneﬁt above relates to the beneﬁt previously recognised on eligible domestic sales within the State of Gujarat 
from the Vadinar reﬁnery. Under the incentive scheme, sales tax collected within Gujarat from customers was deferred for 
payment to the State of Gujarat by up to 17 years. This deferral gave rise to time value beneﬁt as the difference between the 
cash received and the net present value of the liability to the State. The beneﬁt was earned as the eligible domestic sales were 
made within the State of Gujarat; the beneﬁt did not compensate the Group for any particular costs or expenses, and the 
Group expected all other conditions related to the beneﬁt to be met in full. The beneﬁt was included within revenue as it was 
derived directly from sales made to customers. The Group continued to apply the accounting policy in respect of the sales 
tax beneﬁt up to 17 January 2012 as the revenue was earned. The loss of the beneﬁt as a result of the Honourable Supreme 
Court judgment on 17 January 2012 is a change in estimate of revenue earned up to 17 January 2012 (see Note 8a).

6. Net ﬁnance costs before adjustment for loss of sales tax beneﬁt and lapse of prepayment option continued
As sales tax was collected from customers, a corresponding liability to the State of Gujarat was recognised at its net 
present value. Accordingly, the discount on the liability unwound over time resulting in the ﬁnance costs as shown above. 
The Group continued to apply the accounting policy in respect of this liability up to 17 January 2012. As a result of the 
Honourable Supreme Court judgment on 17 January 2012 there is a change in estimate of the liability up to 17 January 
2012 (see Note 8a).
In a related transaction, the Group had deposited amounts based on the then estimated net present value of its future sales 
tax payments with a related party. The interest accruing on these deposits of 9.0% (2010: 9.0%) per annum is included in 
ﬁnance income above.
In addition to the above, a further interest charge of US$321.5 million (before tax) arose on the lapse of a prepayment option 
(see Note 8b).

8. Exceptional items
8a. Adjustment for loss of sales tax beneﬁt
As referred to in the Group’s contingent liability note to its annual ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010, 
the eligibility of the Group’s subsidiary Essar Oil Limited (‘EOL ’) to participate in the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) 
was being challenged by the Government of Gujarat in the Honourable Supreme Court of India, following a judgment by the 
High Court of Gujarat which conﬁrmed that EOL was eligible to participate in the Scheme. The case was heard at the end of 
2011 and, on 17 January 2012, the Honourable Supreme Court of India set aside the previous judgment of the High Court of 
Gujarat and ruled that the Group could not participate in the Scheme. 
The Group continued to apply its accounting policy in respect of the Sales Tax beneﬁt up to 17 January 2012 as the revenue 
was earned. The loss of the beneﬁt as a result of the Honourable Supreme Court judgment on 17 January 2012 is a change in 
estimate of revenue earned up to 17 January 2012. This requires that the entire amount previously recognised to 17 January 
2012 is adjusted in the current period against each individual line item through which the relevant beneﬁt or associated costs 
were recognised.
This adjustment affects four line items within the income statement. Adjustments have been made to:
 Revenue – since the difference between the cash received, and the net present value of the liability to the State of Gujarat, 
was originally recognised in revenue in the period in which the associated eligible domestic sales were made to customers;
 General and administration expenses – since as part of the conditions for the Scheme monies were set aside for payment 
to a welfare scheme that were originally recognised within general and administration costs;
 Finance costs – since the unwinding of discount on the liability to the State of Gujarat was previously recorded within 
ﬁnance costs;
 Taxation – since a deferred tax asset based on the India corporate tax rate has been recognised on the consequential 
losses to be set off against future proﬁts.

8. Exceptional items continued
A provision was recognised as at 31 December 2011 of US$1,139.8 million reﬂecting the estimate of the sales tax liability 
subject to the outcome of the review petition ﬁled by the Group. As at 31 March 2012, the provision has been transferred into 
a ﬁnancial liability as the review petition has not been admitted and the liability has not become payable. A current liability has 
been recognised in the balance sheet at 31 March 2012 of US$1,205.9 million reﬂecting the liability to the State of Gujarat.
Notwithstanding the submission of the petition, EOL was served notice by the Government of Gujarat on 24 January 2012 
requiring it to pay the outstanding sales tax liability speciﬁed plus associated interest. 
Based on legal advice obtained by the Group, the Directors do not consider it likely that material interest is payable on the 
outstanding sales tax liability as the Group collected the sales tax and deferred its payment in accordance with a judgment by 
the High Court of Gujarat in favour of EOL.
The Company ﬁled a writ petition before the Honourable Gujarat High Court seeking directions on repaying the sales tax by 
instalments and for remission of interest. This writ petition was admitted by the Honourable Gujarat High Court on 11 May 
2012. Pending the outcome of the petition and taking into account the signiﬁcant uncertainties around the ﬁnal outcome and 
the legal advice received by EOL, the interest demanded by the sales tax authorities which amounts to US$396.0 million 
(Rs. 20.25 billion) up to 31 March 2012 has been treated as a contingent liability (See Note 29).
The impact against each line item in the income statement, together with the accounting period in which the original item was 
recognised, is as follows:

8b. Interest arising on lapse of prepayment option 
Under the terms of the current Master Restructuring Loan Agreement (‘MRA’) the Group had an option to repay a facility at 
advantageous terms, with lenders’ approval, before 24 April 2012 and thereby avoid various interest charges. As Essar Oil is at 
an advanced stage of exiting the MRA, it did not seek to exercise the prepayment option, which therefore lapsed in April 2012. 
As a consequence, the Group has recognised what was previously considered to be contingent liability, arising from interest 
which now becomes payable on these facilities, together with a reassessment of the carrying value of these facilities based 
on the discounted estimated future cash ﬂows. This has resulted in an additional interest charge of US$321.5 million, less an 
associated tax credit of US$104.3 million. The share of non-controlling interest is US$28.0 million in interest charge after tax.
The Group expects to negotiate the terms of exiting the MRA during the next ﬁnancial year, and will re-assess the carrying 
value of these liabilities at that time.

The applicable tax rate is the standard effective corporate income tax rate in India. The Indian tax rate decreased from 
33.99% to 33.22% with effect from 1 April 2010 and further decreased from 33.22% to 32.45% with effect from 1 April 2011. 
Indian companies are subject to corporate income tax or MAT. If MAT is greater than corporate income tax then MAT is levied. 
MAT is charged on book proﬁts at a rate of 20.0% (2010: 19.93%). Tax paid under MAT can be carried forward for up to 10 
years as a credit against corporate income tax liabilities arising in future periods.
The applicable tax rate in the UK is 26%. The UK tax rate decreased from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012.

The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets related to certain unutilised tax losses. These temporary differences of 
US$0.6 million (2010: US$0.7 million) will expire on 31 March 2014. The Group has also not recognised deferred tax assets 
of US$19.2 million (2010: US$31.1 million) in respect of certain credits for MAT.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for the above losses and credits on the grounds that it is not probable that 
suitable taxable proﬁts will arise before the tax losses and credits expire. The recoverability of the unrecognised deferred tax 
asset will be reviewed at future balance sheet dates. 
Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on future proﬁtability and expected tax beneﬁts, and are recognised where 
the Group believes it will recover the deferred tax assets in future periods.

10. Tax continued
The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries  
or joint controlled entities have not been recognised as:
(i) the Group has determined that undistributed proﬁt of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, but 
rather tax-free returns of capital may be made if necessary; and
(ii) the Group’s joint controlled entities cannot distribute their proﬁts without consent of all joint controlled entities partners.  
The Group does not foresee giving such consent at the balance sheet date. 
The temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries and joint controlled entities, for which deferred tax 
liabilities have not been recognised, as explained above, amount to US$213.0 million (2010: US$166.0 million). 
11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing proﬁt after tax for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Operational earnings per share is calculated by dividing proﬁt after tax before adjustment for loss of sales tax beneﬁt, interest 
arising on lapse of a prepayment option and surplus on acquisition of subsidiary for the period attributable to ordinary equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
As noted in the basis of preparation in Note 1, the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 combined the 
results, assets and liabilities of the Reﬁnery and Marketing, Exploration and Production and Power businesses acquired by the 
Company under the re-organisation prior to IPO. During the period, the holding companies of the Reﬁnery and Marketing, 
Exploration and Production, and Power businesses provided cash in exchange for equity in the underlying Group. To reﬂect 
this in earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares was calculated on the basis that this cash represented the 
acquisition of shares at the listing price of £4.20 per ordinary share throughout both the current and the comparative 
period presented. 
The Company issued 999,999,980 fully paid shares to its parent company for a total of US$1,491.1 million in April 2010. At the 
date of Listing (7 May 2010) a further 303,030,302 shares were issued, and as part of the Listing there was a subsequent 
issue of 406,991 shares as an over-allotment option on 4 June 2010.
Subsequent to 1 January 2010 the cash and the related equivalent number of shares calculated as though issued at the 
listing price of £4.20 was as follows:
Shares representing: Shares 
Invested capital at 1 January 2010 907,893,739
Capital contributed in cash in 2010 of US$593.2 million 92,106,261
Issued on IPO 303,437,293
Shares capital at 31 December 2010 and 31 March 2012 1,303,437,293
The shares presented above for 2010 reﬂect capital contributions made to the Group by its parent company prior to IPO in 
cash and are different to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, which also include 
non-cash gifted investments. 
The options issued in accordance with the ESOP scheme in 2010 and 201 1 did not result in a signiﬁcant dilutive potential impact.
The impact of the convertible bonds issued in the period is anti dilutive because the interest that would be added back to 
basic EPS is greater than the relative adjustment to the weighted average number of ordinary shares.

In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (including goodwill) is 
compared with the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash generating unit, the recoverable amount is 
deemed to be the value in use. The Group calculates the recoverable amount as the value in use using a discounted cash ﬂow 
model. The future cash ﬂows are adjusted for risks speciﬁc to the cash generating unit and are discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate. The discount rate is derived from the applicable business segment weighted average cost of capital and is 
adjusted where applicable to take into account any speciﬁc risks relating to the country where the cash generating unit is located. 
Vadinar reﬁnery 
The three-year business plans are used together with long-term market expectations to estimate gross reﬁning margins and 
other cash ﬂows, which are approved on an annual basis by management, and are the primary source of information for the 
determination of value in use based on a pre-tax discount factor of 11.49% p.a. (2010: 11.43% p.a.) and growth rate of 3.0% 
(2010: 3.0%). The three-year business plans contain forecasts for reﬁnery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of 
reﬁned products, revenues, costs and capital expenditure. As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various 
economic assumptions, such as oil prices, reﬁning margins, reﬁned product margins and cost inﬂation rates, are set by senior 
management. The estimated recoverable amount for the reﬁnery unit exceeds its carrying amount by US$12,011.0 million 
(2010: US$3,332.0 million) reﬂecting, amongst other things, work completed at the reﬁnery during the period.
Gross Reﬁning Margin (‘GRM’) is the difference between revenue from reﬁned petroleum products and related cost of crude oil 
used for their production. GRM is calculated based on market information and past experience of management. Prices of the 
petroleum products and crude are exposed to movement in crude prices on the Nymex, International Petroleum Exchange and 
Dubai Mercantile Exchange. If GRM falls by 52% (2010: 26%) compared to what is considered for impairment testing, the Vadinar 
reﬁnery’s recoverable amount would be equal to its carrying amount. 
The discount rate is estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of Essar Oil Limited (‘EOL ’). If the discount 
rate increases by 155% (2010: 42%) above what is considered for impairment testing, the Vadinar reﬁnery’s recoverable 
amount would be equal to its carrying amount.
The Directors do not consider these outcomes to be reasonably likely.
Essar Power Plant
The Group uses the long-term power sale agreements for estimating the cash ﬂows, which are approved, based on signed 
contracts in place and are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use based on a discount factor 
of 10.14% p.a. (2010: 10.60% p.a.). These contain forecasts for plant load factor, generation in Megawatts (‘MW’), ﬁxed and 
variable revenue, operating costs and sustaining capital expenditure. The cash ﬂow projections are based on these forecasts 
which are approved by senior management. The estimated recoverable amount for the power plants signiﬁcantly exceeds its 
carrying amount in all cases and no impairment is necessary at the end of periods presented. The estimated recoverable 
amount for the power plant exceeds its carrying amount by US$382.5 million (2010: US$102.1 million).

The discount rate is estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of Essar Power Limited (‘EPOL ’).  
If the discount rate increases by 138% (2010: 61.7%) above what is considered for impairment testing, the power plants’ 
recoverable amount would be equal to its carrying amount.
The Directors do not consider these outcomes to be reasonably likely. 
Bhander Power Plant 
The Group uses the long-term power sale agreements for estimating the cash ﬂows, which are approved, based on signed 
contracts in place and are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use based on a discount factor 
of 10.44% p.a. (2010: 11.17% p.a). These contain forecasts for plant load factor, generation in Megawatts (‘MW’), ﬁxed and

carrying amount in all cases and no impairment is necessary at the end of periods presented. The estimated recoverable 
amount for the power plant exceeds its carrying amount by US$651.2 million (2010: US$259.3 million).
The discount rate is estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of Bhander Power Limited (‘BPOL ’). If the 
discount rate increases by 293.1% (2010: 187 .7%) above what is considered for impairment testing, the power plants’

Convertible bonds
The Group has issued 4.25% US$550.0 million guaranteed unsecured convertible bonds on 1 February 2011. The bonds are 
convertible into fully paid ordinary shares of Essar Energy plc. The bondholders have the option to convert at any time from 
14 March 2011 to 24 January 2016. The loan notes are convertible at US$11.0861 per share at a ﬁxed exchange rate of 1GBP: 
US$1.5955.
If the bonds have not been converted they can be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time on or after 15 March 
2014 subject to certain conditions or if not converted or previously redeemed will be redeemed at par on 1 February 2016. 
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 9.5% to the liability component. The net 
proceeds of the convertible issue have been split between the liability element and equity and accounted US$107 .0 million in 
equity as convertible bond reserves, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity,

Secured non-convertible debentures
Non-convertible debentures include US$85.6 million (2010: US$92.2 million) of debentures issued during 1995–96 at coupon 
rates of 5.0% to 12.5% per annum (interest expensed at effective interest rate of 10.3%), repayments of which commenced on 
30 April 2006 and will continue until March 2027 . 
Non-convertible debentures of US$96.8 million (2010: US$122.7 million) of the Power business issued during 2010 at coupon 
rates of 10.25% to 1 1.25% per annum (interest expensed at effective interest rate of 10.8%), repayments of which is commenced 
on 31 March 201 1 and will continue until 31 March 2018.
Banks and ﬁnancial institutions 
The Group has borrowings under various loan agreements with a number of banks and ﬁnancial institutions. These lenders 
provide the Group with term loans, revolving facilities and letters of credit facilities. 
Out of the total borrowings from banks and ﬁnancial institutions, US$4,101.7 million (2010: US$1,866.4 million) are ordinary 
borrowings at normal bi-lateral terms.
Borrowings from banks and ﬁnancial institutions of US$1,684.9 million (2010: US$1,658.0 million) are subject to a master 
restructuring agreement entered into by EOL with the lenders on 17 December 2004 (the ‘MRA’), prior to its acquisition by 
the Group. The MRA provided EOL an option to make early repayments at any time over the term of borrowings. The interest 
rates ranging from 8% to 13% per annum are subject to variation on prepayment of any borrowings. The interest rate variation 
on the prepayment option has since expired on 24 April 2012.
Borrowings from banks and ﬁnancial institutions are generally secured pari passu with other lenders of the borrowing 
company with a ﬁrst charge on property, plant and equipment, followed by charges over current assets and pledges of 
certain equity shares in subsidiaries held by the Group.
Interest rates on Indian Rupee borrowings range from 10.25% to 16.0% per annum (2010: 8.0% to 14.5%) while the interest 
rate on borrowings in other currencies ranges from 1.4% to 4.7% per annum (2010: 0.9% to 3.3%).
The Group has undrawn committed facilities as at 31 March 2012 of US$5,287 .7 million (2010: US$4,046.1 million) with 
maturities ranging from one to two years. Details of the maturity and interest proﬁle of the Group’s borrowings are included in 
Note 25.
Optionally cumulative redeemable preference shares
Optionally convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares (‘OCCRPS’) of a nominal value Rs. 3,500 million 
(US$68.2 million) were issued on 18 March 2009 by Essar Power Limited (‘EPOL ’), a subsidiary of the Group. The OCCRPS 
carry interest rate of 0.1% and 8.0% per annum for the ﬁrst two years and subsequent ﬁve years, respectively. The OCCRPS 
are convertible into equity shares at the option of the investor in the event of a covenant default or an IPO of Essar Power 
Limited. The conversion price will be determined based on the equity valuation of the subsidiary at the time of conversion. 
If there is no qualiﬁed offering of Essar Power Limited, until the ﬁnal redemption date, then the Preference shares will be 
redeemed at 14.5% to 20.5% interest p.a. at the end of the original term based on valuation of EPOL. The Group has 
accounted the OCCRPS at amortised cost with effective interest rate of 20.8%. 
EPOL has also issued a warrant to the OCCRPS holder for a consideration of Rs. 100, which entitles the holder to subscribe 
to the equivalent of US$15.0 million of equity shares in EPOL at any time before an IPO of EPOL at an exercise price based on 
a predetermined valuation of EPOL. The OCCRPS continues to be held as long-term borrowings. Refer to Note 22 for further 
information on the valuation of the warrant provided to the OCCRPS holder. 
Working capital loans
The Group has a number of working capital loans which are used in the ordinary course of business which are subject to 
interest rates ranging from 1.4% to 15.50% per annum (2010: 1.0% to 13.75%) and are short-term in nature. Working capital 
loans are secured by a ﬁrst charge on the current assets and a second charge on property, plant and equipment.
Bills of exchange
Bills of exchange are accepted by banks towards payment of customer invoices and typically carry an interest rate ranging 
from 10.0% to 11.0% per annum (2010: 8.9% to 9.0%) and are settled in a period ranging from seven to twenty-one days.
Loans from related parties
The Group has entered into various loan agreements with related parties. The loans carry a range of interest from 9.5% to 
11.0% per annum (2010: 9.5% to 12.0%) (for further details, refer to Note 30).
An analysis of the movement in underlying net debt (including current and non-current) is presented in Note 25.

Rehabilitation and resettlement
An obligation to incur rehabilitation and resettlement costs arises in land acquisition for project purposes. These costs are 
in some cases governed by the Policies of State Governments while allowing the industrialist to set up projects in rural parts 
of India. These are in the nature of subsistence cost to the land owners who are relocated from their land. This provision is 
expected to be utilised over 36 years.
Onerous contacts
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic beneﬁts expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reﬂect the least net cost of 
exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulﬁlling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure 
to fulﬁl it. This provision is expected to be utilised over nine years.
Customer’s claim
Refer ‘Claim by customer’ section of Note 29 for further details relating to the customer’s claim.
Sales tax due
The sales tax due was recognised as a provision in the period but transferred to a liability when the legal appeal process was 
extinguished. Refer ‘Adjustment for loss of sales tax beneﬁt’ section of Note 8a.

The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted 
cash ﬂow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, 
and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward 
exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Commodity swaps are 
measured using a forward curve based on quoted futures or forward prices and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Commodity options are measured using the same data as the commodity swaps, but also 
uses volatility derived from quoted option volatilities. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash ﬂows 
estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. No derivatives are designated 
as hedges for the purposes of ﬁnancial reporting. Warrants provided to the holder of the OCCRPS were valued through use of a 
binomial model by reference to forecast performance of the underlying assets.
The principal amount in respect of interest rate swaps held at 31 March 2012 was US$97 .7 million (2010: US$99.5 million)

25. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and overdrafts, debentures, ﬁnance leases and 
trade payables. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial liabilities is to raise ﬁnance for the Group’s operations. The Group has 
various ﬁnancial assets such as trade receivables, cash, and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group is subject to ﬂuctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates due to the nature of its operations.  
The Group enters into derivative transactions, primarily in the nature of commodity option and swap contracts and forward 
currency contracts. The purpose is to manage commodity price risk and currency risk arising from the Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, 
commodity price risk and credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks 
which are summarised below;
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations 
with ﬂoating interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate debts.
The following table provides a breakdown of the Group’s ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate borrowings:

Fixed rate borrowings 5,441.7  3,463.8

decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s proﬁt before tax due to the impact on ﬂoating 
rate borrowings.

Foreign currency risk
The Group has signiﬁcant investments and operations in India and the United Kingdom. Accordingly, its ﬁnancial state of 
affairs can be affected signiﬁcantly by movements in the INR/US dollar exchange rates.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating unit in 
currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Foreign currency swaps, options and forward contracts are used to 
mitigate the risk arising from ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies are as follows:

The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises in part where a Group company holds ﬁnancial assets and liabilities 
denominated in a currency different from the functional currency of that entity with US dollar being the major non-functional 
currency of the Group’s main operating subsidiaries. Set out below is the impact of a 10% movement in the US dollar on 
(loss)/proﬁt before tax arising as a result of the revaluation of the Group’s foreign currency ﬁnancial assets and liabilities:

Effect of 10% strengthening of the US dollar against INR on proﬁt before tax: (241.9) (185.0)
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments and receipts. The 
Group also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales and 
purchase transactions.
The Group has taken forward cover of US$1,038.9 million (2010: US$910.5 million) to hedge against currency risk against 
movement in INR/US dollar. 
The impact of a 10% weakening of the US dollar on proﬁt before tax will be the same as disclosed above except that losses 
would be converted to gains.
The Group does not designate any instruments as effective hedge and thus has no impact on equity arising from a change in 
exchange rate arising from its ﬁnancial instruments.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. The Group is also exposed to credit risk from 
trade receivables, dues from related parties, term deposits, liquid investments and other ﬁnancial instruments. 
The Group trades with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Cash, liquid investments and term deposits are held and 
derivatives are dealt with in banks either international or domestic with high credit ratings reﬂecting the needs of the Group to 
operate in territories where international credit ratings are limited by the credit rating of the relevant territory. It is the Group’s 
policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit veriﬁcation procedures. In addition, receivable 
balances are monitored on an on-going basis. For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, 
the Group does not offer credit terms without the approval of the appropriate authority. The Group does not consider there to 
be any signiﬁcant credit risks in respect of related parties.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful 
accounts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. Trade receivables disclosed 
above include amounts (see below for aged analysis) which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has 
not recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a signiﬁcant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. No allowance for doubtful receivables has been made in the accounts as at 31 March 
2012 and 31 December 2010. None of those trade debtors past due or impaired have had their terms renegotiated.

Financial statements
25. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of debtors presented in the ﬁnancial 
statements. The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over balances with third parties nor does it 
have a legal right of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.
The Group has assigned certain amounts in respect of its sales tax liability to a related party which has been guaranteed by a 
counterparty as described in Note 30. 
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables is as follows:

Overdue amounts which are ﬁve years or greater are in relation to amounts due for construction activities performed which 
the Group have been successful in securing award of payment through arbitration proceedings. The awards have since been 
challenged by the counterparties. The amounts have not been provided for on the basis of the arbitration award in favour of 
the Group.
Liquidity risk
Group companies monitor their risk of shortage of funds using cash ﬂow forecasting models. These models consider the 
maturity of their ﬁnancial investments, committed funding and projected cash ﬂows from operations.
The Group’s objective is to provide ﬁnancial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective and reliable 
manner and to manage its capital structure in line with its two internal debt protection ratios. A balance between continuity of 
funding and ﬂexibility is maintained through the use of bank loans, debentures, preference shares and ﬁnance leases. Out of 
the Group’s liabilities, 44.2% will mature in less than one year (2010: 27 .9%). The maturity proﬁle of the Group’s recognised 
ﬁnancial liabilities on a gross basis is given in the table below:

25. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
The majority of the Group’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments mature within 12 months of each reporting end. The undiscounted 
cash ﬂows in respect of derivative ﬁnancial instruments are US$1,700.7 million (2010: US$1,086.1 million). Note where the 
amount payable or receivable is not ﬁxed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest 
rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date. 
Commodity price risk
The prices of reﬁned petroleum products and crude oil are linked to the international prices. The Group’s revenues, costs 
and inventories are exposed to the risk of ﬂuctuation in prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the international markets. 
From time to time, the Group uses commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such 
as forecast crude oil purchases and reﬁned product sales. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for 
which changes in their fair value are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
The Group operates a risk management desk that uses hedging instruments to seek to reduce the impact of market volatility 
in crude oil and product prices on the Group’s proﬁtability. To this end, the Group’s risk management desk uses a range of 
conventional oil price-related ﬁnancial and commodity derivative instruments such as futures, swaps and options that are 
available in the commodity derivative markets. The derivative instruments used for hedging purposes typically do not expose 
the Group to market risk because the change in their market value is usually offset by an equal and opposite change in the 
market value of the underlying asset, liability or transaction being hedged. The Group’s open positions in commodity derivative 
instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with its stated risk management policy which 
has been approved by the management.
Set out below is the impact of 10% increase or decrease in base crude and petroleum product prices on proﬁt before tax as a 
result of change in value of the Group’s commodity derivative instruments:

 Crack 37.3  0.1 
Crack refers to the difference between the per barrel price of petroleum products and related cost of crude oil used for 
their production.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives while managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide 
adequate returns for its shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders. The Group’s policy is generally to optimise 
borrowings at an operating company level within an acceptable level of debt. Equity funding for existing operations or new 
acquisitions is raised centrally, ﬁrst from excess cash and then from new borrowings while retaining on an acceptable level of 
debt for the consolidated Group. The Group’s policy is to borrow using a mixture of long-term and short-term debts from both 
local and international ﬁnancial markets as well as multilateral organisations together with cash generated to meet anticipated 
funding requirements. 
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is underlying net debt divided by total capital plus underlying net debt. 
This ratio is used to monitor debt levels both now and forecast for the future, to ensure an appropriate balance of debt and 
equity funding. Total Equity includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the Group as well as non-controlling interest. 
The Group includes within underlying net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings net of short-term working capital loans 
less cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term deposits net of legally restricted funds and funds that have been 
identiﬁed for speciﬁc uses. The current gearing ratio of 63.2% (2010: 43.4%) reﬂects the current stage of our business cycle 
where individual projects are ﬁnanced using relatively high levels of debt, but with long debt amortisation periods of up to 10 
years. This is normal for large infrastructure projects in the power and oil and gas sectors and is appropriate for the current 
circumstances of the Group, but is expected to reduce over time as projects mature. As these projects enter operations, 
gearing levels are expected to reduce over time and loans are repaid and/or reﬁnanced on more attractive terms. The Directors 
consider funding requirement on a case by case basis with a focus on the type of project and its stage development.

Financial guarantee contracts 1.8  4.5 
Total 11,471.9  7,449.3 
The fair value of the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are estimated at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Other than fair value of derivatives set 
out in Note 22, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
i) Cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other current liabilities 
approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities or nature of these instruments.
ii) The fair value of loans from banks and other ﬁnancial indebtedness as well as other non-current ﬁnancial liabilities is 
estimated by discounting future cash ﬂows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities. 
The discounting rate ranges from 11.25% to 12.00%.
The Group ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are derivatives 
(Note 22) and AFS investments (Note 14). Derivative ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are classiﬁed as Level 2 fair value 
measurements, as deﬁned by IFRS 7 , being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the 
assets or liability, either directly (i.e. price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). AFS investments are classiﬁed as Level 3 fair 
value measurements, as assets held are unquoted. There were no transfers between categories throughout the periods 
presented. The carrying value of all other ﬁnancial assets and liabilities closely approximate their fair value except for 
borrowings (Note 19) where fair values are estimated to be US$7 ,290.4 million (2010: US$4,295.7 million).

a. Acquisition of the Stanlow reﬁnery
On 31 July 2011, Essar Energy plc through its subsidiary Essar Oil UK Limited purchased the Stanlow reﬁnery from Shell UK 
Limited (‘Shell’) for a total consideration of US$1,174.0 million including inventory. 
The Stanlow reﬁnery, located on the south side of the Mersey estuary near Ellesmere Port began commercial operations in 
1952, building upon a pre-existing blending and distribution terminal.
It currently has a Nelson Complexity of 8.2 and accounts for around 15% of production from UK reﬁneries. The Stanlow 
reﬁnery produces approximately 3.5 billion litres of petrol a year, which is one sixth of the UK total, plus it produces around 
1.5 billion litres of kerosene per year, used for aircraft fuel.

Stanlow reﬁnery – now Essar Oil UK Ltd. Reﬁning of hydrocarbon product 31 July 2011 100% US$1,174.0 million
As part of the acquisition, Essar Energy acquired, among other things, all the ﬁxed assets, the transfer of most of the land 
at the Stanlow reﬁnery site (including the former Burmah reﬁnery site) and the assignment of a number of lease agreements 
(including the Tranmere crude terminal lease, the White Oil Docks lease and the Carrington lease), agreements to operate 
certain chemical assets, the road gantry and the distribution terminal, the commercial bulk fuels marketing business and the 
local marine marketing business as well as the transfer of staff at the Stanlow reﬁnery.
The Group has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the purchase method. The Group has as a 
result recognised a bargain purchase gain in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) on the Stanlow reﬁnery 
transaction on the basis that the fair value of net assets acquired is greater than the total consideration paid to Shell plc by 
US$43.9 million. 
The Directors believe that the Group has acquired the Stanlow reﬁnery at a competitive price when compared with other 
recent reﬁnery transactions. The acquired reﬁnery in the past has delivered margins above the International Energy 
Association Brent NWE cracking margins.
The Stanlow reﬁnery is geographically very well positioned. It provides Essar Energy access to a UK energy route between 
London and Manchester as well as access into the North West and Central parts of the UK. The Stanlow reﬁnery has 
signiﬁcant distribution capabilities supported by extensive pipeline logistics, inland and coastal waterways, roads and rail.  
The Stanlow reﬁnery is ideally placed to process North Sea and West/North African crudes.
The acquisition is aligned with Essar Energy’s strategy to provide options for the export of products from the Company’s high 
value reﬁnery at Vadinar, in Gujarat state, India. This bargain purchase is recognised in the Group income statement within 
other gains and losses as at 31 March 2012. The gain is non-taxable.

provided for those existing employees. The Group has an obligation to the scheme in respect of beneﬁts for future service at 
the rates agreed, but because this arises on future service only, it is not provided upon acquisition. Shell provided the Group 
with a cash payment of US$61.5 million covering the discounted amount of the future cash ﬂow obligation associated with the 
deﬁned beneﬁt scheme over a ten year period. In addition a payment of US$1.4 million was also made in respect of untaken 
leave. These payments were recognised as a reduction in the purchase consideration.

The Stanlow reﬁnery since acquisition from August to March 2012 has been operating at 70% of capacity and in that period 
contributed revenue of US$6,353.9 million and has made a net loss of US$63.5 million. The GRM in the market was low in  
the period, with the IEA NWE Brent crack margin being US$1.19 bbl. Against this the Stanlow reﬁnery current price GRM  
is higher at US$3.06 bbl. The revenue and net loss contributed by the Stanlow reﬁnery business for the period ended  
31 March 2012, as though the acquisition has occurred at the beginning of that period, are US$11,353.8 million and  
US$121.1 million respectively.

b. Acquisition of Navabharat Power Private Limited 
On 12 July 2010, Essar Energy plc, through its subsidiary EPOL, entered in to a binding agreement for the acquisition of a 
100% interest in Navabharat Power Private Limited (‘NPPL ’) for a consideration of US$50.2 million. EPOL initially acquired a 
76% interest for a cash consideration of US$31.2 million with the balance to be acquired upon completion of certain project 
milestones. After acquisition, the Group also infused further project equity of US$21.6 million. The transaction was treated as a 
100% acquisition on 12 July 2010, as the most signiﬁcant condition for its completion in respect of obtaining project ﬁnancing 
was satisﬁed with remaining project milestones being procedural in nature. 
NPPL is a 2,250 MW coal-fuelled power plant under construction in Orissa, India. The project is estimated to cost a total of 
US$2.0 billion and is being implemented in two phases. The ﬁrst and second phases are expected to provide capacities of 
1,050 MW and 1,200 MW, respectively. Prior to the acquisition, NPPL had already obtained certain key regulatory approvals 
for the construction project including those in respect of environmental and forest clearance from the Ministry of Environment 
and Forests. By virtue of the acquisition, Group has obtained a 17 .39% interest in the allocation of the Rampia coal block of 
112 mmt and a 4.7 mmt per annum coal linkage with Coal India Limited. 
 
The Group has accounted for the acquisition of NPPL as a business combination using the purchase method. The fair value 
of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of NPPL as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts 
immediately before the acquisition was as follows:

c. Acquisition of PT Bara Pratama Indonesia (‘PTBPI’) 
On 13 April, 2010, Essar Energy plc through its subsidiary Essar Minerals FZE acquired a 99.96% voting interest in PTBPI.  
PTBPI holds a 99.99% stake in PT Manoor Bulatn Lestri which own the exploitation license for a coal mine in West Kutai  
(East Kalimantan) Indonesia (the ‘Aries coal mine’). 
The mine has an area of 5,000 Ha and JORC compliant reserves of approx. 64 mmt with appropriate environmental 
approvals in place. The process for obtaining the necessary forest approvals is currently in progress. 
 
The Group has accounted for the above transaction as an asset acquisition. The consideration paid in cash for the acquisition 
of PTBPI and PTMBL was US$118.0 million was recorded as an addition in the period within property, plant and equipment. 
d. Acquisition of Essar Recursos Minerals Mozambique Limitada (‘ERMML ’)
Essar Energy plc acquired ERMML from Essar Minerals Limited, its fellow subsidiary within the EGL group, in April 2010 for a 
cash consideration of US$29.9 million.
ERMML holds a coal licence in the Cambulatsitsi, Mozambique and the mine is estimated to have coal resources of 
approximately 35 mmt. Essar Energy plc has accounted for the above transaction as an asset acquisition with the total 
consideration being included as an addition in 2010 within property, plant and equipment.

Key contingent liabilities have been discussed below.
Interest payable
Under the terms of the MRA the Group had an option to repay a facility at advantageous terms, with lenders’ approval, before 
24 April 2012 and thereby avoid various interest charges. The amount disclosed as a contingent liability at 31 December 2010 
represents the potential interest payable from the date of the inception of the facility to 31 December 2010 under the terms of 
the facility. As the option has now lapsed, a charge has been recognised based on revised estimates of amounts payable into 
the future under these agreements (see Note 8b).
Sales tax beneﬁt
As discussed in Note 8a, the Government of Gujarat has claimed interest on the sales tax amounting to US$396.0 million 
(Rs. 20.25 billion). Based on legal advice obtained by the Group, the Directors do not consider it likely that material interest is 
payable on the outstanding sales tax liability as the Group collected the sales tax and deferred its payment in accordance 
with a judgment by the High Court of Gujarat in favour of EOL. As a claim has been made this has been disclosed as a 
contingent liability.
Claim by customer 
On 14 September 2005, GUVNL, an entity controlled by the State of Gujarat, ﬁled a petition against EPOL with the Gujarat 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (the ‘GERC’) alleging that EPOL diverted electricity generated by its Hazira power plant 
to Essar Steel, a related party, in violation of its power purchase agreement (‘PPA’) with the Gujarat Electricity Board, whose 
assets and liabilities were transferred to GUVNL in 2003 and incorrectly claimed certain fuel generation credits from GUVNL 
between 1996 and 2006. GUVNL claimed a total of approximately US$309.9 million (31 December 2010: US$353.3 million) 
from the Group.
On 18 February 2009, the GERC ruled in favour of GUVNL for the diversion of electricity by EPOL. The GERC also awarded 
GUVNL a refund for generation incentives incorrectly claimed from 14 September 2002 to 29 May 2006. The GERC, however, 
ruled that recovery of the incorrectly claimed generation incentives and of compensation for the electricity supplied to Essar 
Steel Limited in breach of the PPA prior to September 2002 was barred by the applicable statute of limitation. The revised 
amount claimed by GUVNL as per GERC order was US$113.5 million.
Both EPOL and GUVNL appealed the GERC’s ruling to the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, New Delhi. The Appellate Tribunal 
held on 22 February 2010 that EPOL was not liable to pay compensation for alleged wrongful diversion of power to Essar 
Steel or for the reimbursement of the annual ﬁxed charges. The Appellate Tribunal further held that EPOL was liable to refund 
to GUVNL the deemed generation incentive paid on and after 14 September 2002 which the Group had already provided for.
On 29 January 2010, EPOL ﬁled a petition before the GERC against GUVNL claiming certain payments due to it under the 
PPA. EPOL has made a claim for an aggregate amount of US$77 .0 million (December 2010: US$87 .8 million) comprising 
delayed payment charges, depreciation, foreign exchange variation, interest on debentures, bill discounting charges, interest 
on working capital and alleged wrongful deduction of rebate by GUVNL. On 7 March 2012, the Group has ﬁled Amended 
Applications for updated amount of US$123.8 million. The matter is pending before the GERC. The amount of receivables 
under this claim at 31 March 2012 is US$137 .4 million.

29. Contingencies, commitments and guarantees continued
In respect of the outstanding claims, the Group does not expect to incur costs or loss in excess of amounts provided in 
defending its position and recovering its dues (see Note 21).
In April 2010, GUVNL ﬁled two separate appeals before the Supreme Court against the common judgment of the Appellate 
Tribunal for stay of the implementation of the order of the Appellate Tribunal. The Group has ﬁled caveats against the stay to 
oppose admission of the appeals as well as the grants of stay. Honourable Supreme Court vide order dated 2 September 
2011 dismissed the GUVNL appeal for claim for the period up to 14 September 2002 and admitted the other appeal for 
hearing. No stay has been granted.
Other claims 
There are a number of other claims in connection with the Group. However, management believes that the probability of future 
liabilities in respect of such claims is remote and no amounts have been provided or disclosed as contingent liabilities over the 
periods presented.
Contingent assets
In June 1998, a cyclone hit the west coast of India which caused extensive damage to the reﬁnery site leading to delays in the 
construction and completion of the reﬁnery. The insurance company and the Company have since decided to settle the claim 
by arbitration. During the year, the Company received the arbitration award upholding the material damage claim but rejecting 
the advance loss of proﬁt claim. No contingent asset had previously been recorded; hence the award has no impact on the 
ﬁnancial statements.

29c. Corporate guarantees
The Group has provided a number of guarantees in respect of companies outside of the Group to third party lenders that 
were entered into prior to IPO and amount to US$31.5 million (2010: US$151.0 million). Any potential losses incurred in the 
future by the Group in respect of these guarantees are indemniﬁed by EGL. 
The majority of guarantees provided have been treated as insurance contracts in line with the Group’s accounting policies.
30. Related parties
The Group, as discussed in Note 1, is part of the wider group of companies controlled by EGL and its controlling shareholders 
and as a result has entered into a number of transactions with other wider Essar group entities (the ‘Essar Group’). The Group 
shares many functions and services that are performed by various members of the Essar Group for which costs are allocated 
across the relevant beneﬁting entities which have beneﬁted. The costs have been historically allocated on a basis which the 
Essar Group believes is a reasonable reﬂection of the utilisation of each service provided or the beneﬁt received by each Essar 
Group company. The allocated costs, while reasonable, may not necessarily be indicative of the costs that would have been 
incurred by the Company if it had performed these functions or received these services as a stand-alone entity. 
The Company and EGL entered into a Relationship Agreement, the principal purpose of which was to ensure that following 
listing, the Group was capable of carrying on its business independently of EGL and its associates.
Balances and transactions between entities within the Group, which are related parties, have been eliminated and are not 
disclosed in this note.
30a. Transactions with parent company
EGL, incorporated in Cayman Islands, is the ultimate parent company of the Group throughout the ﬁnancial period. The 
ﬁnancial statements of EGL are available at its registered ofﬁce at Clifton House, 75, Fort Street, PO Box 1350 GT, George 
Town, Grand Cayman. Kettle River Holdings Limited and Copper Canyon Holdings Limited have signiﬁcant inﬂuence 
over EGL.
EGL has also provided guarantees to third party lenders in respect of the Group amounting to US$3,060.3 million (2010: 
US$3,173.4 million). 
No signiﬁcant transactions have occurred with EGL during the periods presented, except those which formed the Group as 
described in Note 1 and those set out above.

end are unsecured and bear interest at rates ranging from 9.5% to 10.25%. The Group has not recorded any impairment of 
receivables due from related parties. An assessment for impairment of related party receivables is undertaken each ﬁnancial 
year through examining the ﬁnancial position of the related party and the market in which the related party operates.

 Undertaking in relation to making the CDR non priority loan to priority loan until the repayment of such loan;
 Undertaking in relation to cost overrun, scheduled principal repayment and interest payment until project completion of

amounts used to pre-pay the lenders to the extent required by the lenders.
Other Essar Group companies have provided the following guarantees in favour of a third party lending bank for the beneﬁt of 
a Group company:
 Guarantee in relation to a working capital term loan which expires in March 2016. However, only Rs. 5,000 million 
(US$97 .73 million) has been drawn under this facility as on 31 March 2012.

Essar Power share purchase agreement 
Essar Power Holding Limited (‘EPH’) entered into a share purchase agreement, governed by Indian law, dated 6 April 2010 
with Essar Steel India Limited, a related party, pursuant to which Essar Steel India Limited agreed to transfer its shareholding 
of 217 ,000,000 equity shares, representing 26% of the issued equity share capital of Essar Power Limited, to EPH for a 
consideration of US$99.0 million (Rs. 4.4 billion). This share purchase agreement came to an end on 30 September 2011 
with no shares being transferred.
A new agreement was entered into on 4 November 2011 with similar pre-conditions but requires, notwithstanding any 
pre-conditions, both the buyer and seller to consent to the transaction. Whilst it remains the intention of the Group to acquire 
this shareholding, as there is no commitment the transaction cannot be recognised as a sale and the previously recognised 
liability of US$99.0 million, and the corresponding change in retained earnings, has been reversed.
EOL call option agreement
Under a call option agreement dated 6 April 2010 and related addendum agreements signed on 30 December 2010 and 
1 1 November 201 1, Essar Energy Holding (‘EEH’), a subsidiary of the Company, had an option to acquire the shares held 
by Essar Investments Limited in EOL. In April 2012, the Investments and Finance Division of Essar Investments Limited was 
demerged into a new entity, Imperial Consultants and Securities Private Limited (‘Imperial’), pursuant to a scheme of demerger 
approved by the High Court of Bombay and the High Court of Madras. This demerger transferred the call option arrangements 
and the shares in EOL previously held by Essar Investments Limited are now held by Imperial.
The call option arrangements provide EEHL with an option to acquire the shares held by Imperial in EOL in the period 
between 1 May 2010 and 31 March 2013 at the higher of: (a) INR 153 and (b) the minimum price required to be paid under 
applicable law, which is currently the closing price of the shares of EOL on the relevant stock exchange on the date preceding

On 10 May 2012, Essar Energy announced that it had signed a power purchase agreement with Noida Power Company Ltd 
for 240 MW of contracted capacity from Essar Energy’s 600 MW coal-ﬁred Tori II power station which is under construction

costs, of Rs. 3.27 per kWh (approximately 6.2 US cents per kWh).
On 15 May 2012, Essar Energy announced that it had reﬁnanced its US$450 million bridge loan which was due December 
2012 with a new US$300 million three year secured loan facility and US$150 million of internal cash resources. Separately,

corporate purposes. The US$250 million subordinated unsecured loan facility is being provided on normal commercial terms. 
The facility is currently undrawn, but can be drawn in full or in part at any time during the 3.5 year life of the facility.
On 6 June 2012, Essar Energy announced that it had completed the Vadinar reﬁnery optimisation project four months ahead 
of schedule. This project increased the capacity of the Vadinar reﬁnery from 18 mmtpa to 20 mmtpa by converting a 
redundant Visbreaker Unit into a new Crude Distillation Unit of 2 mmtpa capacity.
On 8 June 2012, Essar Energy plc announced that it has received ﬁnal ‘Pinjam Pakai’ forest approval for its Aries coal mine in

The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company, Essar Energy plc, from 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2012 are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 2006 and prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed IFRSs and the relevant Group 
accounting policies as set out in Note 1 and Note 2 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Change in accounting year
The Indian Income Tax Act requires Indian companies to ﬁle their annual accounts and returns based on the year ended 
31 March. All Indian companies within the Essar Energy Group prepare their accounts on this basis. To ensure that all 
accounting periods are aligned within the Essar Energy Group, the Company announced in August 2011 that it had 
decided to also change its year end to 31 March. This change in year end means that Essar Energy plc is publishing 
ﬁnancial statements for the 15 months ended 31 March 2012. Comparative ﬁgures are for the 12 months ended 
31 December 2010 and hence are not directly comparable.
Investment
Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries held at cost less provision for impairment.
The Directors have taken the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income 
statement for the parent company. The loss after tax for the period of the Company amounted to US$75.1 million (2010: Proﬁt 
of US$25 million). The Company’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Investments in 
subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.

Borrowings from subsidiaries
A convertible bond was issued by Essar Energy Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Essar Energy plc. Essar Energy 
Investments Limited advanced the net proceeds of the bond to Essar Energy plc and hence the liability element of the bond is 
shown within borrowings from subsidiaries.
Essar Energy Investments Limited issued 4.25% US$550.0 million guaranteed unsecured convertible bonds on 1 February 
2011. The bonds are convertible into fully paid ordinary shares of Essar Energy plc. The bondholders have the option to 
convert at any time from 14 March 2011 to 24 January 2016. The loan notes are convertible at US$11.0861 per share at a 
ﬁxed exchange rate of GBP1: US$1.5955. Amount of coupon interest paid or accrued is US$31.7 million. Amounts charged 
to ﬁnance cost at the effective interest rate is US$53.3 million. 
If the bonds have not been converted they can be redeemed at the option of Essar Energy Investments Limited at any time on 
or after 15 March 2014 subject to certain conditions or if not converted or previously redeemed will be redeemed at par on 
1 February 2016. The net proceeds of the convertible issues have been split between the liability element and equity and 
accounted US$107 .0 million in equity as a convertible bond reserve. The interest charged for the period is calculated by 
applying an effective interest rate of 9.5% to the liability component.
Banks and ﬁnancial institutions
The Company has borrowings under a loan agreement with a number of banks and ﬁnancial institutions. The interest rate on 
these borrowings is LIBOR plus 3%. These borrowings are secured with a ﬁrst charge on certain equity shares in subsidiaries 
of the Company and loans given to subsidiaries.

ongoing costs. The average credit period available for such purchases is approximately 30 days. 
Amounts due to subsidiaries are in respect of services provided to the Company by its subsidiaries and are payable on issue 
of invoice. Amounts payable to related parties relate to IPO related costs paid by the parent company on behalf of the Group 
which have been subsequently recharged to the Company.
41. Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities in the Company’s balance sheet comprise of trade and receivables, amounts due from 
subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings from subsidiaries, borrowings, and other payables. The fair value of 
ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at 31 March 2012 approximate their carrying amount. 
Financial risks are managed and monitored on a Group basis in accordance with the policies set out in Note 25 in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Interest rate risk
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s debt obligations 
with ﬂoating interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate debts.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variable held 
constant, of the Company’s proﬁt before tax due to the impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings.
As at

2010

Effect on proﬁt before tax:
LIBOR – decrease by 50 bps 2.2 – 
The impact of a 50 bps increase in interest on PBT and equity will be the same as disclosed above except that income would 
be converted to a charge.
Foreign currency risk
The Company’s signiﬁcant investments and other asset and liabilities including borrowings are denominated in US dollars and 
thus the Company is not exposed to any risk of changes in exchange rate.
Credit risk
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for loans and receivables) and from its ﬁnancing 
activities including deposits with banks and other ﬁnancial instruments. Cash, term deposits and liquid investments are held in 
banks with high credit ratings. The Company does not consider there to be any signiﬁcant credit risk in respect of receivables 
from related parties. The Company has no receivables which are past due or impaired.

Appendix 1 
Deﬁnition and comparability of CP GRM 
GRM is calculated as actual sales net of crude costs derived from the accounts. Inventory gains and losses, hedging gains 
and losses and sales tax beneﬁt for the period also form part of the GRM. Based on this method of calculation, Essar 
Energy’s reported GRMs are not directly comparable to the performance of other reﬁners, other reﬁning benchmarks and 
industry reports due to following reasons: 
 The Vadinar oil reﬁnery operates in the state of Gujarat and until 17 January 2012, the Group beneﬁted from a government 
sales tax incentive, which, following the judgment of the Supreme Court of India on 17 January 2012, the Group is no 
longer entitled to. All such amounts previously recognised in respect of this beneﬁt have been adjusted in the 15 month 
period ended 31 March 2012 (see Note 8a to the ﬁnancial statements). 
 In India, domestic products are sold based on Government decided formulae known as Reﬁnery Transfer Price, (‘RTP’). 
RTP of LPG and Kerosene are based on the average market price of the previous month, while for other products including 
Gasoil and Gasoline it is based on the average price of the previous fortnight. As a result the revenues may not match the 
prevailing product prices for the period. 
 The Company adopts the ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out FIFO methodology for crude inventory valuation. As a consequence the cost of 
crude consumed can be crude purchased in earlier periods which may not reﬂect current prevailing crude prices. For 
crudes with a long voyage time these differences can be more signiﬁcant. 
 Sales quantity does not directly match actual production during the period as there may be inventory movement compared 
to a previous period. 
 Commodity derivative instruments are used to act as an economic hedge against the price risk of forecast crude oil 
purchases, future reﬁned product sales and future product crack margins. These derivative instruments are required to 
be recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognised in income because hedge accounting is not applied. 
The following adjustments are made to the GRM to provide a CP GRM that reﬂects underlying operational performance and 
better communicates industry comparable performance of the reﬁnery. These adjustments are as follows: 
 The sales quantity is taken as actual production during the period. This eliminates the effect of inventory gains and losses in 
the GRM. This sales quantity is allocated into export and domestic sales based on the actual ratio of export and domestic 
sales for the period. 
 The cost of crude is taken at the current prices of crude grades actually consumed, net of premium or discounts as 
applicable. Prevailing custom duty is applied on the cost of crude. 
 In India, to calculate the revenue from the sales quantity the domestic sales price is valued based on the RTP of the same 
period rather than any other period. Export prices are based on actual realised export prices, as they do not have timing 
differences. Revenue is adjusted for premiums or discounts achieved by the Company. For domestic sales custom duty 
recovery is built up in RTP itself whilst Duty Beneﬁt for exports is added separately. 
 In the UK, as there is no equivalent RTP , both domestic and export revenues are based on average prices for the month.
 The impact of economic hedging gains or losses is excluded. 
 The impact of the Gujarat government sales tax beneﬁt is separately identiﬁed.

with what they need to meet the specific challenges of their individual 
industries. We have a complete level of expertise and experience in 
house which, matched with our flexibility, allows us to build solutions 
incorporating the latest technology.
As a growing business we are constantly developing our skill 
and product sets. Our online portal – Your Alternative Portal – 
is a key differentiator in the market place and is a main area of

Results
Alternative Networks has continued to perform 
strongly, maintaining the momentum of the 
previous year. Turnover has increased by 22% 
to £117.3m (2010: £96.2m), with underlying 
organic growth of 4%. Operating margins grew 
slightly from 12.0% to 12.4%, enabling the 
group to report adjusted EBITDA of £15.4m, an  
increase of 27% year on year (2010: £12.1m).
the group continues to be strongly cash 
generative, with cash inflow of £15.4m (2010: 
£13.6m), representing a 100% conversion of 
adjusted EBITDA (2010: 112%), maintaining 
its strong financial position. Net cash at 
30 September 2011 was £10.9m, slightly 
lower than at the end of the previous financial 
year (2010: £11.1m). A creditable result given 
this is after the payment of £9.5m for the 
purchase of scalable.
The group’s continued growth and financial 
strength has enabled the Board to declare 
a final dividend of 7p per share, making a 
total dividend for the year of 10p per share. 
Excluding the special dividend of 3p paid in 
the previous year, this represents a year on 
year increase of 64% in real terms, further 
evidence of the group’s ability to generate 
excellent returns for all shareholders.
Market share
given the tough market conditions, we 
are pleased with these impressive results. 
The executive management’s steadfast 
determination to implement a coherent 
growth strategy is clearly working.  annual report and accounts 2011

Review of the year Corporate governance Financial statements
Not only has it delivered a strong financial 
performance, but the team’s well respected 
experience, industry expertise and commercial 
acumen have enabled the group to increase 
market share. the group’s mobile subscriber 
base grew by 10% to 68,207 (2010: 62,136), 
fixed lines and channels were up 9% to 87,237 
(2010: 79,862) and Advanced Solutions 
revenues increased by 14% to £18.2m 
(excluding the contribution of Scalable). 
this is supported by the group’s success 
in cross selling its products which in this 
period has increased the proportion of 
customers taking more than one product to 
47% (2010: 46%) and, in the larger customer 
base, 78% of customers are buying more 
than one product. the growth in market 
share is a notable achievement in this market 
and in such times.
Acquisitions
the management team has demonstrated 
its ability to identify, negotiate, execute and 
integrate value adding acquisitions that fit 
well within the group, complement organic 
growth and strengthen its market position. 
this strategy has created a powerful platform 
of systems (Echo), billing and software (AKJ) 
and data and IT services (Scalable), which 
demonstrates ours is not an indiscriminate 
buy and build strategy. We have a considered 
low risk approach to inorganic growth; the 
emphasis is on the addition of reasonably 
priced businesses to the group which can 
be fully integrated and improve the business 
as a whole, in terms of growth potential, 
flexibility and resilience.
the most recent acquisition, scalable, at 
the very start of the reported financial year, 
is the best example to date. Scalable has 
performed beyond our initial expectations 
and has transformed the business, 
accelerating the group’s ability to offer the 
full range of telephony and data solutions. 
Scalable delivered an adjusted EBITDA 
of £1.7m on sales of £20.5m, with 160% 
cash conversion.
The acquisition of AKJ, in 2009, has also been 
a key factor behind the group’s increasingly 
multi-faceted offering, providing a further 
platform for growth and again making the 
group more resilient to market conditions. 
AKJ achieved sales of £3.7m, which, on a 
like for like basis, represents 9% annual 
growth. however, in addition to its financial 
contribution, AKJ has also focused on the 
development of “Your Alternative Portal”. 
the portal was successfully launched in 2011 
and has delivered significantly increased 
functionality, visibility and accountability 
to customers, with in-house engineer and 
software capability a key differentiator. Over 
95% of our customers now have access to 
the portal and over 80% use it every month. 
This is a further example of a service that 
enhances cross selling and also improves 
customer retention.
We will continue with our strategy of only 
considering acquisitions that match our 
stringent criteria of price, business fit and 
ease of integration. several prospects are 
being assessed and the tough market 
conditions may also give rise to additional 
opportunities, as smaller businesses conclude 
they will perform better as part of a larger group.
Current trading and outlook
The current financial year has begun well 
and the group is performing in line with 
expectations. The steps taken over the 
last two years have made the business 
significantly more flexible and resilient. 
We are now penetrating a larger proportion 
of the market, through offering a greater 
range of services to a broader base of 
customers. By being able to focus on different 
parts of the market in response to changing 
conditions, in terms of service and customer 
profile, the group can be more nimble 
in targeting growth in a stagnant or 
contracting economy. 
In spite of the difficult market conditions 
and the increasingly gloomy macro-economic 
prognosis, we believe the group is better 
placed than most businesses to withstand 
these challenges. Our confidence is based 
on the group’s unique combination of a 
complementary and comprehensive set 
of telephony and data services, a highly 
experienced and respected management 
team, a strong balance sheet and a 
cash-generative business model. We look 
forward to continued success and to delivering 
growth in market share, earnings and 
shareholder returns.

Overview
This has been another excellent year on a 
number of fronts. Continuing the momentum 
of a successful 2010, we have again delivered 
record results for the group in 2011, with the 
highest recorded sales, adjusted profits, 
operating cash receipts and dividends in 
our history.

 – Underlying organic revenue growth of 4%.
 – successful acquisition of scalable on 
2 October 2010 for an estimated £10m:
 –  impressive growth performance at 
scalable which recorded results of 
£20.5m sales, £7.1m gross profits and 
adjusted EBITDA of £1.7m, with 160% 
cash conversion.
 – Continued gains in market share:

  –    Free cash flow of £11.4m (2010: £10.9m).
  –    Strong cash conversion at 100% adjusted

  –    Net cash funds of £10.9m at 30 September 
(2010: £11.1m).
 – improved shareholder returns:
 –  Final dividend of 7p per share proposed. 
Together with the interim dividend of 3p, 
this equates to a total dividend for the 
year of 10p (2010: 9.1p, which included 
a special dividend of 3p). If the special 
dividend of 2010 is stripped out, the 
dividend increased by 3.9p or 64%.
  –    Progressive dividend policy maintained 
with a minimum 10% dividend growth 
proposed for 2012 and 2013.
the acquisition of scalable and the broad 
spread of the group’s product, specifically 
a large mobility expertise to complement 
fixed line telephony, gives the group greater 
opportunities to grow organically. this is 
partly through access to more and larger 
customers, but also because the group 
has more solutions to cross sell to its core 
sME and enterprise customers. 
Financial results
this year has a material contribution from 
Scalable for the first time, following its 
acquisition on 2 October 2010. We have 
set out the summary contribution in the 
table above. 
This has been an excellent period of trading 
for the group, with headline figures showing 
group revenues up 22% and adjusted operating  
profits increased 26%. This result has been 
supported by the acquisition of scalable, 
which has been a very good fit strategically 
and has performed well ahead of our initial 
expectations. The group’s business mix has 
been transformed with approximately one-third 
of its gross profits now coming from the 
Advanced Solutions data and voice integration 
business (including billing services), with a 
similar amount coming from each of Fixed 
line and mobile telephony services.
At the underlying level, the group generated 
estimated like for like (i.e. organic) revenue 
growth of 4%. This is estimated by excluding 
the impact of AKJ only having eleven months’ 
contribution in 2010; the loss of mobile revenues 
in 2011 from the networks due to the change 
in commercial arrangements; the loss of mobile 
revenue in 2011 due to EU regulation (call 
capping) of SMS and data revenues; and 
the loss of Fixed line revenues due to the 
Ofcom changes to mobile termination rates. 
Excluding Scalable, gross profits and operating 
profits were both significantly up on 2010 due to 
higher gross margins and improved economies 
of scale. 
gross profit margins have increased to 38% 
(2010: 36%). The key reason was the increase 
in telephony margins, both Fixed line and  
mobile. in mobile, the change in supplier 
terms in January 2011 was the main factor 
and in Fixed line, the increased margins on 
minutes have helped bolster performance. 
Margins per product set are reviewed in more 
detail below.
group adjusted operating profits increased 
by 26% to £14.6m (2010: £11.5m). Scalable’s 
contribution was £1.7m, after group recharges. 
scalable’s operating margins were lower due 
to increasing headcount and a step up in the 
related operating costs of the business to 
support the continuing growth.
On a statutory basis, pre-tax profits increased 
1% from £9.2m to £9.4m. The reason for the 
apparent disparity between the statutory 
performance and the adjusted performance 
is the £5.2m exceptional (see Note 2 and 31) 
items, increased from £2.4m in 2010. The 
main adjustment is the £1.8m deferred 
consideration for Scalable being expensed 
as an employee cost under the new iFRs 
standards and supplemented by an increase 
in amortisation of £0.8m on scalable’s intangible 
assets acquired. These adjustments are 
shown on the face of the income statement, 
and also in Note 31.
Cash generation continues to be very strong. 
Net cash generated from operations was 
£15.4m (2010: £13.6m) which was 100% of 
adjusted EBITDA in the period (2010: 112%). 
Free cash flow was £11.4m (2010: £10.9m), 
enabling the group to pay £9.5m for the 
purchase of scalable and still end the year 
with £10.9m net cash (2010: £11.1m).

growth to become the preferred Converged 
Communications partner of choice for the 
UK’s SME business market.
Strategy – acquisitions
the group continues to monitor the market 
proactively looking for further acquisitions that 
will fit well into the group. The strength of the 
group’s balance sheet, together with a weak 
broader economic landscape, are both expected 
to bolster opportunities in 2012. Our criteria 
remain that targets need to be successful, 
growing, profitable and have similar customer 
bases to the group. Further bolt-on acquisitions 
to complement the existing products are being 
considered, as well as targeting businesses 
in adjacent product sets.
Since 30 September 2010, the group has 
made one significant acquisition. We reported 
last year on the acquisition of scalable 
communications plc (Scalable) in the 
annual report. 
Scalable – update
Scalable is a fast growing IP networks 
integrator based in Buckinghamshire and 
london. Employee numbers have grown to 
75 from just over 50 at acquisition. Scalable 
remains a major partner of Juniper, Extreme, 
Mitel and F5. it consults, builds, installs, 
and maintains IP configured voice and data 
networks, also supplying security and a 
number of other bespoke solutions. t ypical 
clients include Charles Russell and liverpool 
Women’s NhS Foundation Trust.
Since acquisition, Scalable has won significant 
new accounts with carillion, Ocado, virgin 
Money and the Medical Research Council. 
it operates directly with clients and also with 
system integrators, and operates a modern 
Network Operating centre (NOc) in its head 
office, so it can constantly monitor and 
support its customers remotely. 
During the year, we have integrated all of 
scalable’s administrative functions into the 
group, refreshed the scalable brand to bring 
it into line with the group’s identity and 
recently combined the london sales office 
with our own office in Bishopsgate, london. 
The former finance director is set to leave in 
January 2012 but the rest of the management 
remains in place.
Strategy – organic growth 
Review of organic growth factors – 
update on key performance indicators
the four key organic growth factors 
supporting our strategy remain:
Focus on larger customers in SME space
We continue to target the mid enterprise 
market, particularly those customers with 
multi-sites and employees ranging from 
80 to 1,000.
At 30 September 2011, excluding Scalable’s 
new customers, we had 1,214 customers with 
spends over £1,000 per month. this is slightly 
down on 1,249 at 30 September 2010, due to 
the reduction in spends in Fixed line telephony  
by existing clients which took them below 
the threshold, and reflecting the economic 
softening and MTR (Mobile T ermination Rates) 
reductions of some customers on the cusp 
rather than a net loss of larger customers. 
there was a net gain of 57 newly acquired 
customers during the period. these included 
a number in targeted industry verticals such 
as the professional services sector and charities. 
the average monthly spend of these larger 
customers at 30 September 2011 was £5,080, 
up 7% on £4,765 in 2010.
At 30 September 2011, the number of higher 
spending business customers who take more 
than three products from the group increased 
to 746 from 734 at 30 September 2010, 
representing 61% of the larger client base 
(2010: 59%). The average monthly spend 
for these customers also increased 7% to 
£5,864 in September 2011, up from £5,506 
in september 2010.  annual report and accounts 2011

Review of the year Corporate governance Financial statements

At 30 September 2011, Scalable had 235 
customers. Their average spend is nearly five 
times the size of the remainder of Alternative 
Networks’ customers and, in some cases, 
the customers are clearly large enterprises, 
rather than sME businesses. this supports 
the continuing trend of increasing the size of 
the group’s customers and the longer-term 
strategy is to continue to introduce and 
develop products and services which larger 
customers might take from a single platform.
the success of cross selling products into 
our existing smaller customers so that smaller 
customers become larger ones can also be 
measured as below.
Cross selling 
A key part of our organic growth strategy 
remains to sell more products to new and 
existing customers. During the period we 
have had further success in this objective, 
increasing the product penetration in our 
customer base. the number of customers 
taking more than one product is 47% (up 
1% from 46% in September 2010). This has 
been helped by the number of multi-product 
new customers. in the larger customer base 
(i.e. those spending over £1,000 per month) 
we have seen a sustained resilience in high 
product penetration, with the number of large 
customers buying more than one product 
remaining at 78% (78% in September 2010).
Reduction in churn
The group has continued to experience 
low churn levels across all products (mobile 
churn is covered separately on page 10). 
Unsurprisingly, churn remains lower in 
customers who take more than one product 
and are users of “Your Alternative Portal” 
(see page 11).
Product development
During the year the group continued to ensure 
it was in a position to provide clients with the 
full range of communications technology. 
The main addition, aside from Scalable’s lAN  
and data centre IP integration skills, was a 
much broader set of wide area networking 
and internet connectivity products. As a 
result, the group is well positioned in the 
UK market to provide advice and services 
to business customers and ensure their 
organisations have the right infrastructure 
to be IP and cloud enabled and be more 
competitive in the mobile workplace.
During this period, new products included:
Advanced solutions
The Internet and Wide Area Networking 
portfolios were completed this year with the 
addition of Ethernet First Mile connectivity 
and a new suite of MPlS, vPlS and Ethernet 
services allowing aggregated access from a 
number of tier-one providers. We launched 
the first cloud based services to be delivered 
over this infrastructure providing data backup

Case study – Sheffield haworth
Sheffield Haworth is a leading global executive 
search firm focusing on the financial services 
industry. It employs over 100 professionals across 
ten international offices.
At the outset
Sheffield Haworth’s impending office move presented 
several communications challenges. T o ensure seamless 
customer service, it needed to keep existing number 
ranges. However, the new site was served by a different 
exchange, which meant the company’s existing ISDN30 
number ranges could not be retained. Sheffield Haworth 
was also looking to improve communications, increase 
resilience and reduce telecoms expenditure. 
Development
With the existing ISDN30 number ranges no longer an 
option, Alternative investigated other methods of keeping 
the same DDIs, recommending a hybrid SIP/ISDN. 
At the same time, we recommended an upgrade 
to the existing Avaya IP Office to a SIP compatible 
version. Existing numbers were ported to Gamma 
and redirected to the new SIP DDIs thus implementing 
a robust business continuity solution.
To boost resilience, ISDN30 channels were used 
to handle all outbound traffic. This provides added 
failover potential, if for example, the SIP network 
should suffer an outage. 
Summary
The use of SIP and ISDN in combination means that a 
sophisticated disaster recovery system is now in place.
Such a solution would ordinarily mean excess cost, 
but Sheffield Haworth actually saved money. Reduced 
rates on outbound calls were possible by switching 
supplier, and SIP is cheaper than ISDN 30, so line 
rental was lowered.  REv IEW OF ThE YEAR

in order to improve business continuity and 
flexibility, the group developed its virtualisation  
capabilities with the addition of vMware to 
the portfolio which complements the Mitel 
virtualised PBX update launched this year. 
Enhancements to the group’s unified 
communication suite included the addition 
of video conferencing from Polycom.
Mobile
The group extended and improved its 
commercial arrangements with both vodafone

. in addition, the key feature of the 
year was the inclusion of Apple’s iPhones 
and iPads to the group’s product portfolio 
and a broader mobile device range including 
the latest versions of all the major operating 
systems (BlackBerry, Apple iOS, Windows 
and Android). Major device launches included 
BlackBerry’s T orch 9810, 9860, Bold T ouch 9900 
and Playbook, and Android devices including 
Samsung galaxy S2 and S Tablet and the 
Motorola Zoom tablet. to complement the 
core Mobile offering, we also added a 
solution for Mobile Call Recording to help 
our financial services clients meet new 
compliance regulations.
Fixed Line 
During the year, the group consolidated its 
position as a leading provider of business 
grade SIP connectivity, converting customers 
from traditional voice services to SIP and 
delivering clients greater flexibility, enhanced 
resilience and the opportunity to consolidate 
their voice estate. Due to AKJ’s extensive 
experience with BT Openreach’s platform, 
the group was able to enhance its customers’ 
services with a range of business continuity 
services from the WlR3 platform. As a result, 
they benefited from better engineer visit booking, 
better visibility of spare capacity at exchanges, 
and temporary lines products, which have 
been adopted to service our hospitality and 
construction industry clients.
New developments planned for the next 
six months:
Mobile
We expect the growth in smartphones to 
increase, along with the trend for Bring Your 
Own Technology (BYOT), resulting in the need 
for organisations to support multiple mobile 
operating systems and increase the security 
of important corporate data on a range of 
devices. to meet these challenges, the group 
will launch a range of Mobile Device 
Management solutions in the first half of the 
year, allowing our clients to achieve the highest 
levels of security and device management on 
the main mobile operating systems. to continue 
to offer choice and flexibility, the first half of 
the year will see the addition of Ht C and 
Nokia devices to the portfolio alongside new 
BlackBerry devices running the new BBX 
operating system and the new Playbook, 
which has the important addition of native 
email client and citrix support. 
CASe StUDY – ASCrIBe
Ascribe is a leading supplier of consultancy 
and clinically focused IT solutions in healthcare 
throughout the UK, Europe and Asia Pacific.
At the outset
With an international office network serving a global 
customer base, reliable connectivity is critical to 
Ascribe. After a period of rapid growth, the company 
decided to upgrade to a more flexible and scalable 
network and communications infrastructure, having 
experienced bandwidth and connectivity issues, 
as well as customer complaints about the existing 
phone system.
Development
Scalable proposed a Wide Area Network (WAN) 
based on VPLS technology, increasing bandwidth 
connectivity to 100Mb. LAN switches were installed 
at the two data centres, while for remote locations 
secure Internet VPN solutions using Juniper firewalls 
were implemented. Scalable also implemented a 
Juniper Unified Threat Management (UTM) system, 
a solution that meets the strict compliance criteria of 
the NHS. This meant Ascribe could move to a Central 
Group N3 connection. To improve communications 
an upgraded Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) and 
Audio Web-Conferencing (AWC) were also added. 
Summary
Since implementation, VPLS technology has helped 
reduce latency and increase bandwidth to all UK and 
international sites. User satisfaction has increased, 
connectivity has improved and there is a now a 
business continuity solution in place. The Juniper 
firewalls have drastically reduced the amount of 
spam and virus traffic, customer service satisfaction 
has improved, while web conferencing has reduced 
running costs.

The focus for the first half of the year in Fixed 
line is for us to package products to provide 
enhanced business continuity services, fixed 
and mobile vPN services, enhanced reporting 
and to develop a new Alternative own-label 
inbound platform.
Advanced Solutions
Advanced Solutions continues to show the 
greatest growth for the group and to give 
added impetus to this we are developing a 
new Optimised Wide Area Network solution 
complemented by an enhancement to the 
group’s Network Operations centre.
Your Alternative Portal
the portal was successfully launched in 
2011. this involved £0.5m investment in 
the architecture and data warehouse, and 
the software required to replicate all previous 
online services. since March 2011, the group 
has focused on adding enhancements to the 
system and there is a phased roll out planned 
for 2011/2012 with scheduled work planned 
until December 2012. the highlights of the 
deployments in 2011 were: 
 – successfully deployed the new Portal 
Framework and hardware as a platform 
on which to grow new functionality in the 
next 18 months;
 – launched an integrated Case Management 
service across all five product sets 
(Outbound Fixed line, Inbound Fixed line,  
Mobile, PBX systems and Data), which 
gives clients industry leading visibility 
of their service experience;
 – released a new Asset Management module 
that gives clients the ability to upload all of 
their telecoms estate (including those services 
that are not being provided by the group) 
in order to manage it centrally. Future 
releases will allow cases to be raised and 
services changed directly from this module;
 – increased the Portal penetration in the 
managed client base to over 95% enjoying 
Portal access and over 80% using it every 
month; and
 – over 200 key clients are engaged in the 
Portal Focus group, which helps to drive 
both the roadmap and give feedback on 
what we deliver. 
The next twelve months will see:
 – release of Mobile Management in 
2011 which will allow mobile clients 
to self-administer “bars” and add 
or reduce bespoke services;
 – development of enhanced reporting that 
will improve both the delivery of the information 
and the depth of data available. this will be 
done with a view to incorporating additional 
reporting across all product ranges and 
service levels;
 – enabling of online ordering for all product sets 
and enable tracking of online orders; and
 – further integration with suppliers’ systems 
that will allow both client self-service and 
also increase operational efficiencies.
Outlook
All of our operations are currently trading in 
line with expectations and we have a healthy 
pipeline of opportunities. the most encouraging 
feature of our business today is that, in many 
cases, customers are expressing an interest 
in more than one part of our offering, evidence 
that our strategy is gaining further momentum. 
We are also very excited about the prospects 
for scalable and have ambitious plans to drive 
further growth as it capitalises on increasing 
demand by customers for faster and more cost 
efficient data management services. Finally, 
we remain alert to acquisition opportunities, 
especially as worsening market conditions 
force independent businesses in our market 
to consider a different course.
We are therefore optimistic as to future growth 
prospects, notwithstanding the difficult economic 
backdrop. We have created a unique business 
that is ideally placed to meet customers’ 
requirements to manage their communications 
and data requirements cheaply, seamlessly 
and efficiently. We have a committed and 
experienced sales and marketing team that 
is adept at recognising customers’ varying 
needs and who is able to deliver value for 
money at a time when all organisations are 
scrutinising their costs. Few businesses in 
our sector are able to do this and it leaves 
us well equipped to enter 2012 ready for 
all eventualities.

business coming from clients such as towers 
Watson, save the Children and Mencap. these 
wins in resilient market sectors help drive growth 
while public sector spending was lower than 
in the previous year. however, the “blue lights”  
team continued to make decent headway with 
wins of South East coast  Ambulance Services 
and Nottingham and Derbyshire NhS trusts. 
these customers are considerably smaller than 
those targeted by Scalable, in that maximum 
order size tends to be around £0.25m.
IP PBX support revenues grew 4% to £4.7m 
as the group acquired larger customers, to 
offset some revenue erosion where smaller 
customers decided not to renew support 
on their system. There are now 40 customers 
spending more than £20,000 a year on support 
and this is up 11% on the previous year. 
Average spend per customer also increased 
11% from £3,800 in 2010 to £4,200 in 2011, 
reflecting the larger customer wins.
Data circuit revenues increased 33% to £2.8m 
from £2.1m in 2010. This reflects the growth 
in sales from the new sales team established 
in summer 2010 and the launch of several 
new products over the last year, e.g. MPlS, 
Ethernet First Mile, SIP , data storage and 
business continuity products.
gross margins held up well at 41%. The 1% 
decline in margins is due to a small reduction 
in IP PBX support margins, as a result of an 
increase in contracted-out third party support 
for customers, mostly overseas. this more 
than offset an encouraging gain in IP PBX 
install margins in the year. Engineering costs 
for these services increased 5% to £1.55m.
AKJ Billing Services
AKJ Billing Services revenues increased 
19% to £3.7m. however the year ended 
30 September 2010 included only eleven 
months’ sales contribution following 
acquisition. On a like for like basis we 
estimate revenues grew 9% year on year, 
which was a very pleasing result, given the 
focus of AKJ on the development of the 
Portal for the group. During the year, the 
development time spent by AKJ on group 
products was approximately worth £0.5m 
at market value and twice as much as in 
the previous year. gross margins at 53% 
were slightly down on the previous year 
due to higher levels of services intra group 
which are not capital in nature.
the main reason for the increase in revenues 
was the previously announced major contract 
with a mobile network operator for their fixed 
line billing and provisioning services. in this 
period, sales of £0.4m were derived from 
installing and managing these services. this 
three year project successfully went live in 
February 2011. 
During the year, in the rest of its 70 strong 
customer base, AKJ incurred a net loss of 
three customers. there were four customers 
who billed more than £20,000 per year and, 
in each case, their decision to leave AKJ’s 
platform was due to disposal of their businesses, 
and subsequent acquisition by other operators 
with their own billing platforms. the net position 
is a lower level of recurring revenues at the 
end of 2011 than at the start of the year, which 
means revenues are unlikely to grow 
significantly in the next year. 
going forward the business will remain 
similarly committed to developing the Portal 
and group services in 2012, which will also 
deliver considerable benefit to the customer 
base, in terms of technology and new 
functionality, as the system evolves at pace. 
Although continuing consolidation in the 
sector presents challenges to net customer 
growth, AKJ intends to build on its recent 
large customer win and is currently 
developing a hosted billing data centre 
to support growth in larger customers.
Scalable
scalable revenues were £19.5m, with revenues 
in the second half of the year £9.9m compared 
to £9.6m in the first half. This was a tremendous 
achievement, given we had highlighted the 
unusually large deals of carillion and virgin 
Money in the first half of the year. In the second 
half of the year, scalable continued to win some 
major new accounts, including the Medical 
Research council, Newsquest and Ocado.
the key achievement of the year was for scalable 
to establish itself as a significant partner for 
Juniper in both IP security and networking 
product in and around the corporate data centre. 
In addition, it continued to develop an excellent 
reputation in the enterprise market and won 
considerable consulting business around its 
existing products, e.g. Extreme and Mitel. 
At acquisition, we estimated forecast revenues 
for the year to 30 September 2011 would be 
in the region of £14m for these Advanced 
solutions’ products and services, compared 
to approximately £11.5m in the calendar year

the year, and these are slightly higher margin.
scalable’s pipeline remains strong and 
currently at record levels, which would, if 
converted, deliver continued strong growth.
Telephony services
Mobile network services
the performance in the key metrics of subscriber 
growth, ARPU and churn are set out below 
and represent a good performance in a very 
competitive market.
the mobile subscriber base has grown by over 
6,000 subscribers net to 68,207, representing 
10% annual growth, and has grown 5% in the 
six months since 31 March 2011. 
the key change is the large increase of nearly 
4,500 subscribers in the managed subscriber 
base. the largest customer win was RsM t enon 
with over 2,500 connections in March 2011. 
the core business subscriber base has 
increased by 2,327 to 56,788 subscribers since 
the year end. Notably, over three-quarters of 
this increase came in the second half of the 
year, after the new commercial agreements 
were in place.
the gross new connections in the period were 
21,847 (2010: 15,044), made up of 15,113 
(2010: 14,271) on the Alternative contracted base 
and 6,734 on the managed base (2010: 773). 
This represents a significant increase on 2010 
and reaffirms the group’s ongoing success in  
direct sales and marketing in a flat overall market.
small net subscriber losses were recorded 
on a base of customers which are directly 
contracted with Alternative but via a virtual 
service provider (vSP). This business was 
acquired with IcB in 2005 and has gradually 
declined to less than 500 connections, with 
nearly 750 net disconnections in the last year. 
Following the new commercial framework 
established in the period, it is expected that 
these declines will start to be reversed in 2012.
Data connections 
Data connections continued to grow rapidly, 
at the expense of voice only connections 
decreasing. They now represent 53% of all 
connections, up from 46% a year ago. 
 – “converged devices” or smartphones 
continue to gain wider adoption with Apple 
devices being added to our portfolio this 
year. t he number of smartphones has 
grown 17% (2010: 25%) in the year to over 
22,000 connections (2010: 19,000) and 
they now account for over 33% of all 
connections. this trend is set to continue. 
 – Data only devices include connections for 
iPad, generic netbooks and tablets as well 
as traditional “dongles”. These are low 
ARPU and tend to dilute ARPU, but are a 
core part of our business service. these 
have grown significantly in 2011 – up 43% 
to 13,949 connections. 
 – During the period, 74% of all devices shipped 
to customers were either smartphones or 
data only devices. This compares to 72% 
in 2010. At the end of the year, Apple data 
products represented only 3% of our total 
base of subscribers, after our first year of 
supplying their products, but this is clearly 
likely to grow in 2012.
ARPU 
ARPU represents the average spends 
in line rental and usage charges per live 
connection per month in AN’s contracted 
base of subscribers. it has reduced by 
£1.38 from £51.63 to £50.25, representing 
a 3% reduction, in line with expectations. 
The positive influences on ARPU are the 
17% increase in smartphones combined 
with significant growth in data usage 
across the base of customers. 
This is then offset by a few negative influences 
on composite ARPU in this period: 
 – reduction in EU roaming tariffs. these were 
reduced again in July 2011 and are estimated 
to have reduced monthly ARPU by £1 
(£0.25 impact for this period);
 – significant growth in data-only subscriptions 
over the year. these have much lower 
ARPU; and
 – a reduction in international voice usage – 
minutes billed were down by 9% against 
the previous year.

Churn
Network churn was marginally higher than 
2010 at 20% (2010: 19%). The small increase 
was expected and is due to more willingness 
from customers to switch networks (but remain 
with the group) and convert to one smartphone  
devices, as opposed to keeping one voice and 
one separate data device. since the change 
in commercial terms with one network provider, 
“network churn” no longer drives the margins 
and costs of sale for that revenue and means 
network churn is less important to the group 
going forward. 
More important is the metric of churn by 
value, which ultimately relates to the value 
of all contracted customers to the group. 
In 2011, churn by value was lower at 17% 
compared with 18% in 2010. This is a 
relatively low metric in our industry where 
churn levels of 3% a month are not unusual.
the number of contracted subscribers 
in contract has reduced from 75% to 72%. 
this is an ongoing trend as many data only 
devices continue to roll on monthly terms 
beyond their minimum contract length and 
contracts are not formally renewed as it is 
not economic for the group to do so. 
the churn in the relatively new managed 
subscriber base has averaged 25% over the 
period, but this was in line with expectations; 
however, at the year end over 90% of the base 
is contracted in, so churn rates are expected 
to fall in 2012.
Although total group mobile revenues have 
decreased by 8% to £39.9m (2010: £43.3m), 
this does not reflect the full impact of the 
business in making continued market share 
gains, much of which was in the second 
half of the year. Nor does it reflect the good 
performances in ARPU and churn in the 
period, set out above. this revenue reduction 
is principally due to the change in commercial 
arrangements with one of the major mobile 
networks from 1 January 2011. this meant 
that approximately £3m of network subsidies 
which would have been recognised in turnover 
as a commission for connection to their network 
have not been received. Also during the year, 
there has been a significant increase in the 
managed subscriber base. A net commission 
is received for these customers which means 
a much lower revenue is now recognised in 
turnover, but with much higher margins. 
this applied to some customers who were 
previously contracted customers in 2010.
the net impact of these changes, combined 
with growth in the mobile base has been to 
deliver a strong growth in gross profits, which 
were up 10% in line with the subscriber base 
growth (10%), in spite of marginally lower 
ARPUs. In return for the removal of connection 
commissions, gross margins on services are 
significantly enhanced and are expected to 
be at least 37% going forward. The agreement 
also allows for further margin gains if certain 
performance criteria are met. the new 
commercial agreement is to last for three 
years to end March 2014 and applies 
specifically to all “AN contracted base” and 
“AN contracted vSP” (third party distributors) 
on that network. The “managed subscriber” 
base on the vodafone network is subject to 
a separate agreement, which comes up for 
renewal in September 2013.
As a result, mobile gross margins have 
increased to 38% from 32%. going forward 
the margins of the group are expected 
to settle in the 36% to 40% range, with the 
key variables being the cost of subsidised 
smartphone equipment and the growth 
in data revenues.
Fixed Line network services 
group revenues are up 8% year on year to 
£39.8m. This includes £1m from Scalable, 
and without these, like for like sales have 
grown strongly, and organically, by 5% from 
£36.9m to £38.8m. There has been continued 
good momentum, after a strong first half, with 
the group continuing to win market share and 
the number of lines and connections in the estate 
grew by 9% over 2010. This is an excellent 
performance given market conditions. in the 
second half of the year, revenues were only 
just ahead of the second half of 2010 and this 
was due to a softening of the economy and 
customer price reductions being triggered 
by the Mobile Termination Rate (MTR) cuts 
introduced by Ofcom from April 2011. 
On a worst case estimated scenario, the impact 
of the MtR cuts on the group could reduce 
overall Fixed line revenues by up to 7% over 
the year, followed by a further 3% annual 
reduction from April 2012. To date, that level 
of price reduction has not been seen and the 
industry does not appear to be handing over 
the whole price reduction to the retail customers. 
However, assuming that the worst case could 
arise and combined with a softening of the 
economy which has already been seen to 
impact inbound revenues in the second half,

the continuing impact of Ofcom’s regulation 
on MtRs means that the likelihood for revenue 
growth for the group in Fixed line over the 
next two years is now no longer assured, 
even with Alternative Networks making further 
market share gains.

Stripping out Scalable’s lower margin Fixed line  
business at 15%, the gross margins were nearly 
1% ahead of 2010, with a strong performance 
across all products. the key points were:
 – outbound rental margins were slightly ahead 
of 2010 and a small adverse change in 
sales mix in 2011 to 2010 has meant that, 
for once, there has been no net adverse 
impact on group margins;
 – outbound minutes margins were up 4% 
for the full year, with the gain coming mostly 
in the second half as the group retained 
some of the lower costs of mobile calls 
passed on from the carriers; and 
 – inbound margins held up better than expected 
– guidance was given for 48%–52% – largely 
on the back of improved buy rates negotiated 
from the carriers. in spite of this, longer-term 
guidance remains that margins will gradually 
move to the bottom of this range.
the group is focused on retaining and 
improving margins, especially as revenues 
are constrained by regulatory impact. Recent 
negotiations have been successful and margins 
in 2012 are expected to be in the 37–38% 
range, even assuming a similar sales mix.
Outbound services – Fixed Line
Outbound revenues increased 9% to £31.9m 
(2010: £29.3m). Scalable made a contribution 
of £1m for the first time. Excluding Scalable, 
line rental revenues grew 12% to £15.5m, 
reflecting market share gains, and usage 
revenues were 1% down to £15.4m for 
reasons set out above.
Usage revenues
With the exception of calls to mobiles, 
average call values are declining at a much 
lower rate than previous years:
 – the number of billed call minutes increased 
2% year on year (2010: 6%) due to a 
continuing increase in higher usage 
customers, offsetting lower levels of calls 
being made in customers’ offices; and
 – total usage revenues were down 1%, with 
overall price drops of approximately 3% 
(2010: between 6% and 10%). 
Outbound average revenue per customer per 
month (ARPU) has increased 9% over the year, 
as more customers take both line rentals and 
calls, and with the addition of larger customers 
in the period. Significant customer wins included 
Persimmon plc and British car Auctions.
Wholesale line Rental revenues (WlR) grew 
13% to £15.1m from £13.4m. The number of 
lines grew by 7,465, representing 9% growth. 
In the second half, growth was 10%, and this 
was after a small but noticeable increase in 
the number of disconnections of old analogue 
lines by continuing customers, who were 
cleaning up their estates as they benefited 
from the Portal’s new reporting on asset 
management. WlR now accounts for 49% 
of outbound revenues (2010: 46%), with 
a further increase expected as MTR cuts 
push down usage revenues.
Inbound services – Fixed Line
Inbound services grew 3% organically over 
the year to £7.9m. there were no inbound 
revenues from Scalable. In the first half of the 
year, revenue growth was strong, up 11% on 
the previous year’s first six months at £4.1m 
and having added new customers such 
as ceridian UK limited. In the second half, 
revenues were £3.8m, down 4% year on 
year, a return to the average of 2010.
A review of spends showed:
 – across the board there were lower levels 
of activity in both 08xx and revenue share 
customers especially in the last three months 
of the year. Many of these customers are 
call centres for retail or consumer activity 
which is being hit in the economic 
downturn; and
 – in 2010, there was an additional one-off 
revenue of £0.1m in April 2010 due to the 
“ash cloud” which meant call centre 
revenue share for airlines and holiday 
companies spiked. this did not repeat 
in 2011.
Notwithstanding the economic impact, the 
outlook for inbound services remains positive. 
it is a niche market with relatively few players, 
and the group still has a small market share, 
and so a return to double digit revenue 
growth is feasible.

Capital investment
The group invested £1.0m (2010: £0.2m) 
in tangible fixed assets and intangible 
software assets during the year. this was 
in line with expectations.
Spend on the Portal was £0.5m of which 
approximately £0.2m was hardware and the 
balance in software. scalable spent £0.2m 
on data switches and servers required as 
rotating spares of data switches at scalable 
customers. the balance was routine 
expenditure on IT for the group.
in 2012, we estimate that a further £1m will 
be spent. This is £0.3m ahead of previous 
guidance – an additional £0.2m is on the AKJ 
hosted data centre, established for its managed 
billing services for vodafone and which relates 
to a contract hosting agreement, with the 
balance of £0.1m being on investment in 
Scalable’s NOc, their new london premises, 
and customer management systems. Further 
investment on the Portal in 2012 is expected 
to be £0.3m as previously guided.
Scalable consideration – update on deferred 
consideration and accounting treatment
The first period of the deferred consideration, 
for which there was a maximum £2.25m 
consideration payable, was the year ended 
31 December 2010. The amount of the 
consideration due to the shareholders of 
scalable has been settled at £1.5m, being 
approximately two-thirds of the maximum 
amount. in the acquisition agreement, there 
is a mechanism for the scalable shareholders 
to claw back any shortfall to the extent that 
the deferred consideration in the year ended 
31 December 2010 fell short of the maximum, 
by outperforming targets in the year ended 
31 December 2011 on a pro rata basis. 
Current estimates of the deferred consideration 
payable are £2.9m in total, of which £1.5m 
has been paid.
Recent amendments to accounting standards 
under IFRS have meant that 75% of the deferred 
consideration is to be deducted from profits 
as an employee cost, on the basis that the 
deferred consideration of the two founders 
and largest shareholders was linked to them 
being employed by the group at the time the 
payments fell due. the element which relates 
to performance up to 30 September 2011 
(being the 2010 earn-out and three-quarters 
of the 2011 earn-out) is estimated at £1.77m 
and has been treated as an exceptional item 
in the comprehensive income statement 
(Note 2 and 31).
Cash flow
cash inflow from operations was again strong,  
bringing in £15.4m (2010: £13.6m), compared 
to adjusted operating profits of £14.6m (2010: 
£11.5m). This included a working capital inflow 
of £0.1m (2010: inflow of £1.8m). 
The working capital inflow includes the £0.6m 
inflow for the new provision for deferred 
consideration payable to the two principal 
former shareholders in scalable as above.
Excluding this item there was a small working 
capital outflow of £0.5m, in line with the £0.5m 
forecast outflow for the year. The main changes 
in working capital were a £0.2m increase in 
stocks due to scalable growth, and a £1m 
reduction of trade receivables due largely to 
improved collection of scalable debts, and 
a £2.2m reduction in trade payables which 
was principally due to resolving a number 
of mobile supplier issues and the change 
in mobile commercials in the period, both 
offsetting the impact of an increase in vAT .
the high rates of cash conversion continue 
to highlight the group’s strong control over 
working capital (the cash conversion rate 
of adjusted EBITDA averaged around 106% 
in the previous three years). In 2011, the 
cash conversion is 100% adjusted EBITDA 
(2010: 112%). The cash conversion of 
Scalable’s adjusted EBITDA was 160% in 
its first year, twice the level (80%) it averaged 
in the two years prior to acquisition. this was 
due to exerting some significant control over 
payment cycles of trade debtors and creditors.
the group has renewed its facilities at a lower 
level in 2011. it has unutilised bank facilities 
of £6m (2010: £12m) which are committed 
until March 2014.

Tax
The effective tax rate was 29.4% (2010: 27.4%).
This has increased in spite of a 1% fall in the 
expected main composite rate of corporation 
tax to 27% in this period, achieved by six months 
at 28%, followed by six months at 26% since 
April 2011.
The reason for the increased tax rate (above 
27%) was the significant impact of the £1.8m 
deduction for the deferred consideration for 
the scalable acquisition, which is not allowable 
as a deduction for tax. Without this, the tax 
rate would have been 24.7%, a rate that is 
lower than the headline rate due principally 
to the benefit of schedule 23 deductions for 
share options exercised in the year outweighing 
the share option charges in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Earnings per share 
Fully diluted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) 
have increased by 22% to 20.4p (2010: 16.7p). 
Basic adjusted earnings per share have 
increased 28% from 18p to 23.1p.
The statutory or unadjusted fully diluted earnings 
per share have decreased 8% from 14.5p to 
13.3p. This is due to the adjustments for the 
deferred consideration for scalable, which 
has been written off to the income statement, 
and the exceptional deal costs (e.g. stamp 
duty). If these costs of £1.9m were added 
back, the basic fully diluted earnings per 
share would be 3.8p higher and would have 
delivered 18% growth to 17.1p from 14.5p.
the weighted average number of shares in 
the year used for calculating the basic earnings 
per share has increased by 1.19m. this is due 
almost entirely to the exercise of share options 
in the two years by staff, with 655,811 options 
being exercised in this year. The fully diluted 
number of shares has increased 2.3m to take 
into account the potential l TIP share issues, 
following strong share price performance 
in 2011.
Dividend per share 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 
7p per share (2010: 4.1p per share) making a 
total dividend of 10p per share for the full year 
(2010: 9.1p per share). In 2010, a “special” 
dividend of 3p was paid on 1 April 2010. If this 
dividend is stripped out, the comparative 
increase was 3.9p or 64%. The Board remains 
committed to a progressive dividend policy 
and has announced its intention to raise the 
dividend by at least 10% successively in 2012 
and 2013. 
The dividend will be paid on 26 January 
2012 to shareholders on the register as of 
23 December 2011, with an “ex-dividend” 
date of 21 December 2011. 
The Trustees of the Alternative Networks plc 
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) have waived 
their rights to receive dividends on 2m shares 
during the vesting period of the value creation  
Plan, which runs until 31 December 2012.
Business risk assessment
the group’s Risk Management Framework 
requires a regular review of the key risks 
facing the group. The specific risks thought 
to affect the group the most in 2012 have 
not changed substantially from 2011.
Contracts with suppliers 
the group resells the products of its suppliers 
and, whilst many of the group’s products are 
supplier agnostic and there exists a freedom 
to substitute various suppliers’ products, the 
group acknowledges that it has reliance in 
particular on the contracts with the mobile 
networks, O
2
 and vodafone. These contracts 
have just been renewed to July 2013 and 
March 2014 respectively.
the group mitigates this risk by maintaining 
strong relationships with its suppliers at 
various levels of the business, as well as 
paying close attention to ensuring the 
expectations of suppliers are met and, 
where possible, exceeded. 
Acquisition integration execution
the group has set out that its strategy includes 
the acquisition of businesses where they are 
earnings enhancing. The Board acknowledges 
that there is a risk of operational disturbance 
in the course of integrating acquired businesses 
with existing operations. The group mitigates 
this risk by careful planning, rigorous due 
diligence and segregation of the target 
operations where possible. Where there is full 
integration of acquired businesses, the group 
receives a report on the effectiveness of the 
integration and variances from business plan.

Review of the year Corporate governance Financial statements
Technological change
the group operates in a market of rapid and 
dynamic technology changes and there is a 
risk that the group fails to secure the necessary 
contracts to supply its customers with a new 
technology (disruptive) which substitutes existing 
technology. the group mitigates this risk by 
maintaining close relationships with its suppliers, 
and by employing a product marketing team 
whose duties include research, review and 
procurement of appropriate new technology 
products for testing prior to release to our 
customers. Details are regularly set out in 
interim and preliminary results announcements.
Ability to continue to attract and retain key 
sales and client management executives
the group is a direct sales and marketing 
business and, whilst the revenues of the 
group are largely recurring on a monthly 
basis, the group depends on being able 
to recruit and retain staff of the right calibre 
in order to win and service key contracts. 
the group has sought to mitigate this risk 
by investing in a clear succession and training 
plan for career development and improving 
the employee benefits and remuneration over 
the last three years, including commissions, 
and specifically share options and pension 
contributions. The Board monitors the results 
of exit interviews, recruitment statistics and 
staff attrition by department on a regular basis.
Regulatory risk
the group acknowledges that the pricing 
of products and services can be affected 
by regulatory bodies in the UK and the EU. 
in recent years, pence per minute pricing from 
fixed to mobile destinations and EU roaming 
mobile voice and data retail prices have 
been substantially altered and there has been 
a substantial change in the 0870 price 
regulation affecting inbound and outbound 
pricing. looking ahead to 2012, there are 
substantial further reductions in retail pricing 
for mobile data in the EU and for wholesale 
prices for fixed line to mobile calls in the UK. 
The Board believes that where the pricing 
regulations are directed at wholesale prices, 
the group is more able to mitigate the risk 
through its own buying and pricing policies. 
Where the regulator imposes price caps at 
the retail level, the group is more exposed 
to a reduction in margin where the operators 
do not substantially reduce their wholesale 
prices. the group mitigates the risks by 
careful and detailed research on the future 
regulations and has been involved in lobbying 
where applicable. the group will assess each 
risk and build it into its forecasts of income 
as soon as possible and will amend its pricing 
policies accordingly.
The Board is confident that there is a satisfactory 
framework for monitoring, assessing and 
reporting on these risks. there is also a robust 
regular framework for reporting on predictive 
KPIs in the business.

The Company purchased and maintained throughout the financial year Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its Directors.
Share schemes
The directors believe that a key element in attracting, motivating and retaining employees of the highest calibre is employee involvement in the 
performance of the Group through participation in employee share schemes. By doing so, the Directors believe that employees’ interests will be 
more closely aligned with those of the shareholders. The schemes are described in the Remuneration Report.
Substantial shareholdings
As at the 1 December 2011 significant shareholders (those with over 3% shareholding) are as follows:

Directors’ report continued FOR THE y EAR ENd Ed 30 SEPTEMBER 2011
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) statement
The Group is committed to operating in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and structures its policies, initiatives and practices 
accordingly, as the business evolves.
Employees
The Directors believe that the Group’s employees are a source of competitive advantage and recognise that continued and sustained 
improvement in the performance of the Group depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain employees of the highest calibre.
The Group is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in employment and seeks to ensure that no employee or applicant is treated 
less favourably on the grounds of age, disability, gender, gender reassignment, pregnancy, maternity, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief, 
or because they are married or in a civil partnership or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements which cannot be objectively justified.
Entry into and progression within the Group are solely determined by the application of job criteria, personal attitude and competence.
It is the Group’s policy to apply best practice in the employment of disabled people. Full and fair consideration is given to every application 
for employment from people with disabilities whose aptitude and skills can be utilised in the business and to their training and career 
development. This includes, wherever possible, the retraining and retention of staff who become disabled during their employment.
All employees are informed of matters concerning their interest as employees and the financial and economic factors affecting the business. 
The Company maintains established communication channels: management forums and briefings, conferences, employee newsletters and 
the Company intranet as well as team and individual meetings.
The Group strives to create an enjoyable, challenging and progressive employee experience where employees are offered a flexible reward 
and benefits package and that encourages a healthy work/life balance and general well‑being.
The Group takes pride in offering outstanding consultation and service and therefore places great importance upon training and development. 
The business has a well‑established in‑house learning and development academy and over 61% of Group employees have been promoted into 
management roles internally. 38% of our employees have worked for us for more than five years.
Effective two-way communication and teamwork is also critical in creating a positive and productive work environment and, in addition to 
conducting team building events and initiatives, we actively encourage regular employee feedback through staff committees. The Group 
also informs employees of the business’ activities and performance through face to face briefings, weekly bulletins, and Directors operating 
an open‑door policy. Exit interview feedback is also regularly reviewed to ensure any potential concerns can be identified and managed at 
an early stage.
Our environmental commitment
The Group appreciates the importance of sound environmental practice and the need to increase awareness and change behaviour amongst 
employees. It aims to share responsibility for improving the Group’s practices with employees to progressively reduce its environmental impact. 
As part of this commitment the Group commits to improving its monitoring of waste, recycling, energy and water consumption.
Recycling of unavoidable waste is considered a priority and in 2010–11 the Group recycled in the region of 15.9 tonnes of waste at its head 
offices alone (a 48% increase from 2009–10) and continues to recycle paper, cans, plastic, cardboard, computer equipment, toner cartridges 
and mobile phones.
Although travel to and between offices is inevitable, the Group is committed to reducing the environmental impact of transportation. The business 
has conferencing facilities within all offices and, role permitting, supports home working; 37% of Group employees regularly or permanently work 
from home.
The Group encourages employees to use environmentally friendly transport options by offering bicycle loans, restricting flights between offices 
and using rail travel as an alternative to driving wherever practical. Scheduling of field engineers also minimises time spent on the road and 
public transport and/or overnight stays (hotels) are encouraged for engineers where this is an alternative to excessive additional mileage.
Where possible, we now source environmentally friendly products and services, including paper from sustainable sources, energy efficient 
appliances and Company vehicles with low CO
2
 emissions and fuel consumption.
Community involvement and charitable donations
The Group has chosen to forge links with local charities at each Company location which are coordinated by the Group-wide Charity Committee.
During the year charitable donations of £18,855 (2010: £14,818) were made to charities including a number of local and health related charities. 
The Group supports its employee’s charitable endeavours through sponsorship and during the year employees participated in fundraising 
activities raising additional donations of £6,041, taking this total to £24,896. The chosen charities for 2010–11 were The Little Princess Trust, 
The Fred Foundation, When You Wish Upon a Star, Our Kids Eyes, Naomi House Children’s Hospice, Reading & Berkshire District Hospitals, 
The Friends of the Wisdom Hospice and The Iain Rennie Hospice.
There were no political donations made in the current year (2010: £nil). annual report and accounts 2011

Review of the year Financial statements Corporate governance
Payment to creditors
The Group has a variety of payment terms with its suppliers. The Group agrees payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into binding 
purchasing contracts for the supply of goods and services. Its suppliers are made aware of these terms. The Group seeks to abide by these 
payment terms when it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. 
At 30 September 2011 the amount of trade payables shown in the balance sheet represents 41.0 days of average purchases of the Group 
(2010: 47.5 days) and 44.0 days for the Company (2010: 48.5 days).
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is disclosed within Note 3 of the financial statements.
Share repurchase
The Group began its share buy-back scheme in 2008. The scheme was entered into as the Group had funds surplus to the operational 
requirements of its continuing activities. In arriving at the level of cash available to be returned to shareholders, the Board took into account 
the levels of funding remaining in the Group to enable it to meet its working capital requirements.
At a general meeting on 29 March 2010, the Group was granted further authority to repurchase up to 4,436,085 shares before 29 March 2013. 
To date the Group has not repurchased any shares under that authority. The Directors will continue to monitor the level of cash required for 
the business and determine if further repurchases remain in the shareholders’ best interests.
Going concern
After considering the Group’s financial projections, borrowing facilities and other relevant financial matters, the Board is satisfied that on the date 
of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The Group’s trading performance has been discussed in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s Statements.
Statement of disclosure of information to auditors
Each Director of the Group, in office at the time of approval of this report, acknowledges that:
– so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
–  he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Independent auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the Group will be submitted to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
corporate Governance report
Introduction
The Board of Alternative Networks plc is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance in so far as it is practical for a Group of its 
size and, although not a requirement of the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), the Group has complied with the provisions of the Combined 
Code 2010 (the “Code”) except as explained in the report below. The Board evaluated the amendments between the 2008 and 2010 Code and 
do not consider these to significantly impact the Group or its disclosures. The Group is not required to adhere to the provisions of the Code and 
this report is a voluntary statement.
The Group has applied the exemption applicable to smaller companies (outside the FTSE 350) in the Code that states that no one non‑executive 
director should sit on all three principal board committees simultaneously. In addition, it has also applied the concession that smaller companies 
can have only three non‑executive directors, rather than non‑executive directors representing half of the board. Although the Audit Committee 
does not meet the Code’s requirement to have recent relevant financial experience, a senior representative from the finance department attends 
all Audit Committee meetings by invitation providing advice to the Committee members when required.
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for the overall management of the Group and is accountable to shareholders for the creation and delivery of strong 
sustainable financial performance and long‑term shareholder value.
There is a clear division of the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer which are set out in writing and have 
been agreed by the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for leading the Board and ensuring its effectiveness, setting the agenda for and conducting Board meetings, 
ensuring that all Directors receive sufficient, accurate and relevant information on financial business and corporate issues and maintaining 
effective communication with shareholders.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the executive management and performance of the Group’s business, the development, 
recommendation and implementation of the Group’s strategy and budget and setting the overall policy and direction of all business operations.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its decisions. The specific issues include the Group’s overall strategy, the Group’s 
acquisition and divestment policy, approval of key suppliers, approval of major capital expenditure projects and significant financing matters 
and all corporate governance and compliance matters. It monitors the exposure to key business risks and reviews the strategic direction of 
the business, annual budgets, progress towards achievement of those budgets and their capital expenditure programmes. The Board also 
considers employee issues and key appointments.
Subject to the matters which it has reserved for itself, the Board has delegated authority for the management of the Group’s business to the 
Chief Executive Officer who exercises this authority through delegation to members of the senior management team.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Chairman and the Board on all matters concerning corporate governance. He supports 
the Chairman in ensuring the provision of accurate and relevant information to the Board and for ensuring that there is a flow of information within 
the Board and its Committees and between senior management and Non‑executive Directors.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of Directors’ and officers’ liabilities. This insurance cover does not provide cover 
in the event that the director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
The Board, which is scheduled to meet monthly, met on eleven occasions in the current year, in addition to three off-site strategy meetings.

Review of the year Financial statements Corporate governance
Board balance and independence
The Board of Directors of the Group comprises a Non‑executive Chairman, four Executive Directors and two independent Non‑executive Directors. 
Their biographical details on pages 20 to 21 demonstrate the range of experience and judgement they bring to bear on Board matters. The Board is 
satisfied that the executive and Non‑executive elements of the Board are well balanced, that no individual or Group is or has been in a position to 
dominate the Board’s decision making and that there is a substantial degree of independence and diversity.
Each of the Non‑executive Directors is considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with the exercise of his judgement. The Non‑executive Directors are up for re‑election on 19 January 2012 and, 
as part of the re‑election process, the Board will consider the independence of Timothy Holland‑Bosworth (appointed May 1999) and Tony Caplin 
(appointed April 2001), owing to their tenure on the Board. The Board consider both to be independent due to never having been an employee 
of the Group and having never received any fees or benefits from the Group other than salaries.
Related party transactions are listed in Note 30.
Having considered the position of each Non‑executive Director, the Board is of the view that no current interests or prior interests of the Non‑executive 
Directors will either influence or prejudice their objective and independent judgement or their ability to act in the best interests of the Group.
The Board is satisfied that each of the Non‑executive Directors commits sufficient time to the fulfilment of his duties as a Director of the Group.
Performance evaluation
A performance evaluation of the Board is undertaken annually by the Group’s Business Excellence department using a detailed questionnaire 
and follow up interviews with Board members. The questionnaire includes consideration of the behaviour of the Board and its processes. 
The report on the evaluation of the Board is considered and discussed by the Board and specific actions agreed.
The Board has established a framework for the induction of all newly appointed directors which includes the provision of corporate information 
and meetings with Directors and members of the senior executive team.
Board committees
The Board has established a number of standing committees and has delegated certain responsibilities to each of those committees. 
The principal Board committees are the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees.
Remuneration Committee
The membership and a summary of the terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Remuneration report on page 30.
Audit Committee
Ben Mingay was appointed to the Committee on 19 January 2011 and replaced T ony Caplin as Chairman. T ony Caplin and Timothy Holland‑Bosworth 
remained as members of the Committee throughout the year. The members of the Committee are considered by the Board to be independent

Audit Committee meetings
The Committee met on two occasions during the financial year.
Attendees at Committee meetings held included: Chief Financial Officer, Financial Controller and representatives of the internal and external 
auditors. All of these attended at the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee.
Main activities of the Audit Committee in the year to 30 September 2011
On one of the two occasions the Committee met with the Group’s external auditors in the absence of executive management.
The principal issues addressed by the Committee during 2010/11 were:
–  The external auditors’ year‑end report for 2010, the review of the Group’s preliminary results and annual report disclosures.
–  The external audit plan for the 2011 financial statements which included a review of the audit objectives, scope, timetable, deliverables 
and audit fee.
–  The Group’s risk management process.
–  The reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external auditors.
–  The Group’s internal audit activities and the effectiveness of internal controls, including the consideration of the internal auditors’ findings 
and recommendations and the external auditors’ observations on internal financial controls arising from their annual audit and interim review.
Independence of external auditors
The Committee has adopted a policy on non‑audit services designed to ensure that the provision of such services by the external auditors does 
not impair the auditors’ objectivity and independence. The policy is based on the ICAEW Guidance for Audit Committees and defines both the 
type and value of services that require prior authorisation of the Committee and the services that the external auditor is prohibited from providing. 
The Committee annually reviews all non‑audit services provided by the external auditors to ensure compliance with the policy. The Committee 
remains satisfied with the objectivity and independence of the Group’s external auditors.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Company’s auditors since 2000. The Audit Committee manages the relationship with the external 
auditors on behalf of the Board. It considers the reappointment of the external auditors each year, as well as remuneration and other terms of 
engagement, and makes a recommendation to the Board. The last competitive audit review was in 2008, when PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
were reappointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the Audit 
Committee to recommend a particular firm for appointment as auditors.
Nomination Committee
During the year, the membership of the Committee comprised Ben Mingay (Chairman), Timothy Holland‑Bosworth and Tony Caplin. 
The members of the Committee are considered by the Board to be independent Non‑executive Directors.
During the year, the Committee met on one occasion and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer were invited to attend. 
The Committee meets as necessary to make recommendations to the Board on all new Board appointments and to consider executive 
and Board succession planning. The Committee has written terms of reference which are available from the Company Secretary.
Internal control
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness. The Group’s 
systems and controls are designed to safeguard the Group’s assets and to ensure the reliability of information used within the business and 
for publication.
Systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The key features of the internal control systems, which operated throughout the period 
covered by the financial statements and to the date of signing the financial statements, are described below.
The Board has put in place an organisation structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority to executive 
management. Individuals are formally made aware of their level of authority. The Group appoints experienced and professional staff of the 
necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities.
Executive managers are required to produce a business plan for approval by the Board prior to the beginning of each financial year and detailed 
financial forecasts are formally produced during the year and reviewed by the Board.
Management accounts are produced each month and the financial results are measured against the business plan to identify any significant 
variations. The Board discusses financial and operational performance at its monthly meetings. annual report and accounts 2011

Review of the year Financial statements Corporate governance
Internal control continued
The Group has an internal audit function whose responsibilities include ensuring that internal controls are complied with. The Group’s internal 
controls framework is reinforced by the Group’s successful certification to both the ISO27001:2005 international information security standard 
and the ISO9001:2008 international quality management standard. During the year eight external ISO audits were conducted by the British 
Standards Institute.
The Group procedure for approving and controlling capital expenditure and investment appraisal requires approval of initial capital expenditure 
in the budgets by the Board. Approval of budgeted capital expenditure projects is made at various levels of senior management including the 
Board where required.
Throughout the year, the Group conducts an ongoing risk management evaluation process covering both financial and non‑financial risks. This 
involves senior management and Executive Directors identifying areas of perceived risk and the existing control mechanisms in place to monitor 
those risks. Through a series of management workshops, attended by all Executive Directors and Senior Executives, the Board has reached 
consensus on those risks facing the Group that are considered business critical. The Group has implemented, and continues to implement, 
actions intended to manage and mitigate those key risks. during 2012, the Board will continue to review its risks and implement the necessary 
mitigating steps as those risks evolve and change.
Financial reporting
A review of the performance and financial position of the Group is included in the Financial and Business Review on pages 12 to 19. The Board 
uses this, together with the Chairman’s Statement and the Directors’ Report, to present a balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s position 
and prospects.
Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to and recognises the importance of effective communication with shareholders. Ongoing communication is achieved 
mainly through the publication of the Annual and Interim Reports, trading statements, the announcement of significant developments within the 
Group and the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to regular financial reporting, significant matters relating to trading or development of the business are released to the market by way 
of stock exchange announcements.
The Board is responsible for ensuring that dialogue with the shareholders takes place and is based on a mutual understanding of objectives. 
A series of meetings and presentations take place during the year with institutional investors to review the Group’s performance and prospects. 
These presentations are made available via the Company’s website.
The Annual General Meeting provides shareholders with an opportunity to meet the Chairman and other directors, receive an update on the 
development of the business and to ask questions of the Board. The Annual Report and financial statements and the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting are sent to shareholders at least 21 days prior to the date of the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders have the opportunity to vote on 
each substantially different issue by the proposal of a separate resolution for each item of business. The results of the proxy votes received by 
the Group, including abstentions, are declared at the meeting, following votes by shareholders on a show of hands.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
remuneration report
Scope of the report
The Remuneration Report summarises the Group’s remuneration policy and particularly its application in connection with the Directors. 
The report also describes how the Group applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to Directors’ remuneration. 
This report is not mandatory for companies listed on the AIM but has been voluntarily included as a matter of best practice.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and comprises only Non‑executive Directors, including the Non‑executive Chairman. 
The Committee meets regularly to determine, on behalf of the Board, the framework of executive remuneration.
During the year, the membership of the Committee comprised Timothy Holland‑Bosworth (Chairman), Tony Caplin and Ben Mingay (appointed 
19 January 2011). The members of the Committee are considered by the Board to be independent Non‑executive Directors.
during the current year, the Committee met on four occasions, with the attendance of all members.
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board. These are available for inspection at the Group’s registered 
address. The members of this Committee do not have any conflicts from cross‑directorships that relate to the business of the Committee. The 
members do not have any day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group. T ony Caplin is the sole member not regarded as being independent, 
as defined by the Combined Code on corporate governance, for the reason that he is the Group’s Non‑executive Chairman. However, he is 
considered to be independent by the Board.
To assist the work of the Committee, the views of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Human Resources are also 
invited where appropriate. These individuals did not, however, participate in any decision related to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to the governing objective of maximising shareholder value over time. Each year the remuneration framework and the 
packages of the directors are reviewed to ensure they continue to achieve this objective.
The Group’s policy is to attract, retain and incentivise Executive Directors to run the Group and meet the expectations of shareholders whilst 
adopting a prudent approach to overall remuneration.
Basic salary and benefits
The Group’s policy for executive Directors’ salaries is that they should be maintained at competitive levels for those in comparable positions, 
with variations to reflect individual performance, experience and job size. Benefits in kind consist of car allowances, private medical and health 
insurance, employer pension contributions and health club membership.
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
An EBT was established during the year ended 30 September 2005 and Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each awarded 
interests in 638,400 0.125p shares held by the trust.
These shares are held on trust for them absolutely subject to the trustees retaining a lien on the shares. The lien is in respect of the trustees’ 
obligation to settle the loan from the Company used to acquire the shares (which is equivalent to £277,000 each, £831,000 being the total loan).
In March 2010 the EBT subscribed to 2,000,000 shares at the nominal price of 0.125p per share. The trust has waived its rights to dividends on 
these shares. James Murray, Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham each have an interest in these shares which could be used to settle 
future entitlements to shares under the Group’s incentive plans.
2010 Value Creation Plan (VCP) (Note 29)
A VCP was established on 24 February 2010. Under the scheme James Murray, Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each 
awarded potential share options which are subject to meeting specific performance criteria. The first measurement date under the scheme 
was 31 December 2010 and the number of options to be granted based on performance to that date is 2,179,570. This number has been 
approved by the Remuneration Committee but no formal grant of options took place during the year so the total number of options 
outstanding at 30 September 2011 is nil (2010: nil).
All employee share and share option plans (Note 29)
The Group’s EMI scheme was adopted on the 22 December 2004. Under the Group’s EMI Scheme, options which are qualifying options under 
the Enterprise Management Incentive regime and also unapproved options may be granted. As at the 30 September 2011 there were no options 
outstanding for 2004 scheme (2010: nil).
A second EMI scheme was established on 18 January 2006 (EMI 2006). As at 30 September 2011, options were outstanding over 55,796 
ordinary shares (2010: 99,183) under this scheme. annual report and accounts 2011

Review of the year Financial statements Corporate governance
All employee share and share option plans (Note 29) continued
A third EMI scheme was established on 17 January 2007 (EMI 2007). As at 30 September 2011, options were outstanding over 263,109 ordinary 
shares (2010: 773,400) under this scheme.
A fourth EMI scheme was established on 3 July 2008 (EMI 2008). As at 30 September 2011, options were outstanding over 132,318 ordinary 
shares (2010: 243,018) under this scheme.
At 30 September 2011 options were outstanding over a total of 451,223 ordinary shares (2010: 1,115,601) under all four schemes.
Options under the EMI 2006 scheme were eligible to be exercised from 31 December 2008 based on the conditions that the option holder 
is still an employee of the Group and the Group had achieved certain performance criteria in the period 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2008. 
The exercise price is £1.025 per share which was the market value at the date of the grant. During the year ended 30 September 2011, there 
were 43,387 options exercised (2010: 56,106) and no options lapsed (2010: 10,016).
Options under the EMI 2007 scheme can be exercised from 31 December 2009 based on the conditions that the option holder is still 
an employee of the Group and the Group has achieved certain performance criteria in the period 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2009. 
The exercise price is £1.505 per share which was the market value at the date of the grant. During the year ended 30 September 2011, 
there were 501,724 options exercised (2010: 71,182) and 8,567 options lapsed (2010: 68,485).
Options under the EMI 2008 scheme can be exercised from 3 July 2011 based on the conditions that the option holder is still an employee of 
Alternative Networks plc and the Group has achieved certain performance criteria in the period 3 July 2008 to 2 July 2011. The exercise price 
is £1.355 per share which was the market value at the date of the grant. During the year ended 30 September 2011, there were 110,700 options 
exercised (2010: nil) and no options lapsed (2010: nil).
Service Agreements
Each of the Executive Directors has a Service Agreement with the Group. These are rolling agreements which can be terminated by either party 
giving not less than six months notice in writing at any time. If the Group terminates the contract by notice but other than on giving full notice, the 
Service Agreements provide for the payment of the fixed amount equal to the salary and other contractual benefits for the unexpired proportion 
of the duration of the appointment or entitlement to notice, as the case may be. It is the Committee’s view that they should not change the term 
of the existing Directors’ Service Agreements.
Non-executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of the Chairman and Non‑executive Directors is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Chief Executive 
Officer on an annual basis and takes into account market rates based on independent advice, as required. The Chairman and Non‑executive 
directors concerned do not participate in this process.
Ben Mingay, Tony Caplin and Timothy Holland‑Bosworth have fixed one year appointments until 19 January 2012. The appointments may 
be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice at any time without compensation.
As Chairman, Tony Caplin is entitled to receive a fee of £35,000 per annum with no pension, bonus, benefits or share options.
Ben Mingay and Timothy Holland‑Bosworth receive basic fees of £33,000 per annum and £23,795 per annum respectively.
The Non‑executive Directors do not participate in any incentive, pension or benefit scheme.

Review of the year Financial statements Corporate governance
statement of Directors’ responsibilities
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ANd THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
–  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
–  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
–  state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
–  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

TO THE MEMBERS OF ALTERNATIVE NETWORKS PLC
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of Alternative Networks plc for the year ended 
30 September 2011 which comprise the Consolidated and Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and 
the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 33, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non‑financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
–  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2011 
and of the Group’s profit and Group’s and Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
–  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union;
–  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
–  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
–  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
–  the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
–  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
–  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

The notes on pages 42 to 68 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
a)  The balance classified as share capital includes the proceeds arising on issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising 0.125p 
ordinary shares and the cancellation of shares purchased during the year.
b)  Share premium represents the difference between the fair value consideration received and nominal value of shares issued.
c)  Capital redemption reserve arose from the purchase of own share capital.
d)  The merger reserve results from the previous acquisitions of Integrated Communications for Business (UK) Limited, Aurora Kendrick James 
Limited and The Telecom Centre Limited and represents the difference between the value of the shares acquired (nominal value plus related 
share premium) and the nominal value of the shares issued.
e)  Shares acquired in relation to the employee Share Incentive Plan are held in treasury until such time as the awards vest. At 30 September 2011 
the number of shares held in treasury was 980,326 (2010: 1,000,000). These had a nominal value of £1,225 (2010: £1,250) and a market value 
of £2.74m (2010: £1.92m). During the year 19,674 treasury shares were issued to employees under incentives plans at their market value of £1.92 
per share. Treasury were purchased as an average price of £1.42 so this issue resulted in the creation of £10,000 of share premium.

Review of the year Corporate governance Financial statements
2 Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding 
of more than one‑half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are 
considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of 
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and can be reliably measured. 
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Revenue from calls, which excludes value added tax, is recognised in the income statement at the time the call is made with the exception 
of international roamed calls which are recognised when the data is supplied by the UK networks. Calls made in the year, but not billed by 
year end are accrued within receivables as accrued income with the exception of international roamed calls as noted above.
Revenue from line rentals is recognised in the month that the charge relates to, commencing with a full month’s charge in the month 
of connection. Revenue and related costs from the sale of handsets are recognised on the date of connection.
Connection commissions received by mobile network operators are recognised when the customer is connected to the mobile network 
after providing for expected future clawbacks. Mobile commissions in respect of average revenue per user are recognised at the end 
of the relevant performance period.
Revenue and related costs from the sale of accessories are recognised when despatched.
Revenue arising from the provision of internet and other services is recognised evenly over the periods in which the service is provided 
to the customer.
Revenue and related expenditure is recognised upon despatch for the sale of equipment and on completion of work for systems installations. 
Maintenance income in respect of systems is recognised evenly over the period to which it relates.
Billing services income and related costs are recognised in the month of service.
Revenue earned from consultancy is recognised upon completion of the project.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
dividend income is recognised on receipt. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

annual report and accounts 2011
notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost includes the original purchase 
price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows:
Building element of long leaseholds 2% per annum
Leasehold improvements over the lease term
Plant and equipment 20%–33% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
The useful economic lives and residual values attributable to each class of asset are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date and when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed 
the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
An item of property, plant and equipment is removed upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued 
use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de‑recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Land is not depreciated and is held at historical cost.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight‑line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets
Goodwill is accounted for by recognising identifiable assets (including previously unrecognised intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent 
liabilities and excluding future restructuring) of the acquired business at fair value. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
fair value of payments made, assets transferred and future payments, over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. The results of the acquired entities are included in the Group’s results from the date when control of 
the company passes to the Group. Goodwill is valued at cost less accumulated impairment.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill 
allocated to a cash generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
to which the goodwill relates. Where recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Purchased customer contracts are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life, from the 
date of acquisition, as considered reasonable by the directors.
Software and software licences includes computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware. These assets are stated at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value. Amortisation is calculated on straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 
the asset.
Customer contracts, relationships, order backlog and trade names is the fair value determined by the net present value of the future cash flow 
benefits anticipated to arise from the intangible assets less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation of intangibles is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. 
Goodwill is tested systematically for impairment at each annual balance sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date that 
they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer contracts and relationships 7–10 years
Technology 4 years
Trade name 3 years
Purchased customer contracts 3–5 years
Computer software 3–5 years
Order backlog (included within customer contracts and relationships) 1 year annual report and accounts 2011

Review of the year Corporate governance Financial statements

Investments
All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with 
the investment. Investments are tested for impairment at each reporting date or if events indicate that the carrying value has been diminished.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items. Net realisable 
value is reviewed regularly to ensure accurate carrying values. Cost is determined on a first‑in first‑out basis and includes transportation and 
handling costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables which comprise “trade and other receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents” 
in the balance sheet. Financial assets are held at amortised cost and management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired. For loans 
and receivables categories, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 14–60 day terms, are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost. A provision 
for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy 
or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The provision 
is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the original invoice amount less bad debts written off. The carrying amount of the 
asset is reduced through the use of the provision and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. When a trade receivable 
is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset or liability is generally de‑recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, recognised initially at fair value and subsequently valued at amortised cost.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at their nominal value. Proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, is split between share 
capital and share premium.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments require identification on the basis of internal reporting about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the 
chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. For further information see Note 4 of the 
financial statements.
Exceptional costs
For the purpose of providing the users an analysis of the Group’s underlying performance, management have termed certain items as 
exceptional costs. These include large one‑off costs, significant non‑cash charges and charges relating to acquisitions.
Current taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 46
annual report and accounts 2011
notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued
Deferred taxation
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for, if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme and contributes to an independent stakeholder pension. Contributions are recognised 
as an expense in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Employee benefits
In accordance with IAS 19, the Group provides for accrued holiday benefit. The cost is measured as the additional amount that the Group 
expects to pay as a result of the unused holiday entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date.
The Group contributes to employees defined contribution pension plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group 
pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions once contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit‑sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed 
to a termination when the entity has a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current employees without possibility of withdrawal.
Employee Benefit Trust
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) have been included in the Group financial statements. Any assets held by the EBT 
cease to be recognised on the Group balance sheet when the assets vest unconditionally in identified beneficiaries. The costs of purchasing own 
shares held by the EBT are shown as a deduction against equity. The shares held by the EBT are treated as if they are held in treasury.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s management awards certain employees bonuses in the form of equity‑settled, share‑based compensation plans on a discretionary 
basis. These options are subject to between two and three-year vesting conditions.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non‑market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non‑market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the 
number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity. In the event of amendments to option schemes the fair value of the scheme is assessed immediately before and after the amendment 
and any change in the fair value is recognised in the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when 
the options are exercised.
The Group has applied IFRS 2 “Share‑based Payments” and has adopted the Black‑Scholes model for the purposes of computing “fair value” 
for the EMI and LTIP schemes. The VCP scheme has been valued using the Monte Carlo model (Note 29).
Deferred tax is also provided based upon the expected future tax deductions relating to share‑based payment transactions and is recognised 
over the vesting period of the scheme concerned. annual report and accounts 2011

Customer acquisition costs
The Group defines these as subsidised hardware, free hardware and credits which can be used against equipment or rental/usage billing which 
the client is entitled to over the life of their fixed term contract. These costs are booked in full to the income statement as soon as the customer 
is entitled to start drawing down on the free hardware and credits; at a date which is normally when the customers’ services commence, unless 
otherwise specified in the contract.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life such as goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash‑generating units). Non‑financial assets other than goodwill that 
suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; 
any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of borrowing using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured 
at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value 
where the effect is material.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill: The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the 
“value in use” of the cash‑generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires management to make 
an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash‑generating unit (CGU) and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value of those cash flows. Sensitivity analysis is undertaken on the weighted average cost of capital and the future growth 
assumptions for the individual CGUs.
Deferred tax assets: Deferred tax assets are recognised for timing differences to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profit will 
be available against which the timing differences can be utilised. Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax 
assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Refer 
to Note 16 where the impact of the change in tax rates is considered.
Share-based payment: The estimation of the fair value of share options and other equity instruments at the date of their grant requires management 
to make estimates concerning the number of employees likely to exercise together with the expected volatility of, and dividends payable on, the 
underlying shares and the time at which employees are likely to exercise vested options.
Receivables: Receivables are recognised to the extent that they are judged recoverable. Management reviews are performed to estimate 
the level of provision required for irrecoverable debt. Provisions are made specifically against invoices where recoverability is uncertain.
Value of intangibles: The valuation of intangibles on acquisition requires management estimates and judgements in relation to the valuation 
of separately identifiable assets and contingent liabilities. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

notes to the financial statements continued 3 Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks. The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit adverse 
effects on the financial performance of the Group by using a mix of financial instruments.
a)  Foreign exchange risk: The Group is exposed to minimal foreign exchange risk as the Group operates almost wholly within the United 
Kingdom. The Group has no exposure to foreign currencies as no billing is carried out in foreign currencies. In addition, all of the Company 
assets and liabilities are held in Pound Sterling so sensitivity analysis is deemed unnecessary regarding foreign exchange risk.
b)  Interest rate risk: Although the Group has interest‑bearing assets and liabilities, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are 
substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, due to the nature of the underlying business.
  If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year would increase/decrease 
by £58,000 (2010: £60,000). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
c)  Credit rate risk: Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and this policy has been implemented by requiring staff to 
carry out appropriate credit checks on customers before sales commence. The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject 
to a limit, which is reassessed at least annually. The Group also insures all debts greater than £2,500 where accepted, with a leading credit 
insurance company.
  Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries across the United Kingdom. Ongoing credit evaluation 
is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single 
counterparty or any Group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics 
if they are connected entities.
  Credit risk may also arise from deposits with banks. It is the Group’s policy that deposits are only made with banks that have high credit 
scores and deposits are split between multiple banks.
d)  Liquidity risk: Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors. They have built an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium, and long‑term funding and liquidity risk management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities through cash flow 
forecasting, acquisition planning and monitoring working capital and capital expenditure requirements on an ongoing basis.
  The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance to the 
contractual maturity date. These amounts disclosed in the table are the contracted undiscounted cash flows.

e)  Capital risk management: The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to provide returns to shareholders. The Group defines capital as share capital plus reserves. The Group is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements.
  The Board monitors levels of cash on a monthly basis utilising rolling three month cash flow forecasts. Any excess levels have historically been 
used for acquisitions. Since 2008 the Group has also run a share buy-back programme and during 2010 declared a special dividend to continue 
providing shareholder returns. There were no share buy-backs in 2011.
4 Segmental information
Per IFRS 8, adopted by the Group on 1 October 2009, operating segments require identification on the basis of internal reporting about components 
of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board. The Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance 
and allocate resources. The operating segments are Telephony Services, Advanced Solutions Voice, Advanced Solutions data and Advanced 
Solutions Billing Services which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the Board. The Board assesses the performance 
of the operating segments based on revenue, gross profit, net profit and EBITDA.
Telephony Services consists of two revenue streams, fixed line and mobile. The maintenance and sale of voice telephone systems is Advanced 
Solutions Voice, Advanced Solutions Billing Services relates to the provision of billing facilities and Advanced Solutions data is the integration of 
computer networks.
There are no comparatives for Advanced Solutions Data as this only came into existence with the purchase of Scalable Communications plc on 
2 October 2010. Scalable also provides some telephony services which have been separated and included within that segment.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. Accordingly, the Group’s profits for this 
accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 27%. Further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 
Budget Statement. The Finance Bill 2011 includes legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012. 
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014. The changes have been 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are included in these financial statements.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each 
year. The overall effect of the further changes from 25% to 23%, if these applied to the deferred tax liability at 30 September 2011, would be to 
reduce the deferred tax liability by £156,000 (being £78,000 recognised in 2013 and £78,000 recognised in 2014).
In addition, if these applied to the deferred tax asset at 30 September 2011, this would reduce the deferred tax asset by £80,000 (being £40,000 
recognised in 2013 and £40,000 recognised in 2014).

The Directors paid a 2011 interim dividend of 3.00p per 0.125p ordinary share (2010: 2.00p), with a total payment value of £1,380,000 
(2010: £888,000). This was paid on 1 July 2011 to shareholders on the register on 17 June 2011.
In addition, the directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending 30 September 2011 of 7.00p per 0.125p ordinary 
share (2010: 4.10p) which will require an estimated £3,233,000 of shareholders’ funds (2010: £1,875,000). Assuming it is approved by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 23 January 2012, it will be paid on 26 January 2012 to shareholders who are on the register 
of members at 23 december 2011. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

notes to the financial statements continued 12 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic and fully diluted earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company divided 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. The Group has one category of potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price 
is less than the average price of the Company’s ordinary share during the year.
The profit and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

2010 earnings per share – diluted        6,704   46,090,848  14.5 
The adjusted EPS is based on the adjusted profit before tax as set out in Note 31 and the weighted average number of shares as described above.

Share option costs included within adjusted profit attributable to shareholders are reducing the earnings per share in 2011 by 2.2p (2010: 2.2p).
As in prior periods, the calculation of the weighted average number of shares in issue excludes 1,915,200 shares held by the Alternative Networks 
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). These shares are then added to the total of extant options when calculating the fully diluted weighted average 
number of shares.
In 2010, a further 2,000,0000 shares were subscribed to by the EBT which have also been excluded from the weighted average number of shares 
for both basic and diluted EPS.
There were 49,161,766 shares in issue at 30 September 2011 including 980,326 shares held in treasury. On 30 September 2010 there were 
48,482,552 shares (inclusive of 1,000,000 shares held in treasury). The weighted average number of shares during the year was 43,913,478 
(2010: 42,720,001). annual report and accounts 2011

during the year the goodwill in respect of each cash-generating unit was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. All were assessed 
to have a value in use in excess of their respective carrying values, and hence no other adjustments to goodwill were considered necessary.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were:
–  The forecasts were based on pre‑tax cash flows derived from approved budgets for the 2011–2014 financial years. Management believes 
the forecasts are reasonably achievable based on market performance and its expectations of market developments. Subsequent cash flows 
were extrapolated using a 1% growth rate reflecting an approximate forecasted long‑term growth rate for the UK economy, the Group’s 
principal market.
–  The pre‑tax discount rate used to assess the carrying value of goodwill is 13.5% (2010: 13.6%) which approximates the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital. This discount rate has been calculated on a consistent basis to take into account specific factors of the Group.
The review performed at the year end did not result in the impairment of goodwill for any cash-generating unit as the estimated recoverable 
amount exceeded the carrying amount in all cases. The Group undertakes sensitivity analysis by increasing the weighted average cost of capital 
and reducing future growth expectations in the model, and the results of this analysis show no indication of impairment.

The effect of the changes to be enacted in the Finance Bill 2011 has reduced the deferred tax asset provided at 30 September 2011 by £40,000. 
This £40,000 decrease in the deferred tax asset has decreased profit for the year by £40,000 and decreases other comprehensive income by 
£40,000. This decrease in the deferred tax asset is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 26% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.
The changes enacted have also decreased the deferred tax liability provided at 30 September 2011 by £78,000. This £78,000 decrease in 
the deferred tax liability would increase profit for the year by £78,000 and increase other comprehensive income by £78,000. This decrease 
in the deferred tax liability is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 26% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.
17 Acquisition of Scalable Communications plc
On 2 October 2010 the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Scalable Communications plc (Scalable) and obtained control of the 
Company. Scalable is a computer network integrator based in Buckinghamshire and London and employed more than 50 staff on the date of 
acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Group expects to increase its presence in the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) market, have greater 
cross-selling opportunities and to reduce costs through increased Group purchasing power.
The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 2 October 2010 contributed by Scalable was £20,546,000. 
Scalable also contributed profit after tax of £885,000 over the same period.
The following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated information of the Group as if the business combination had occurred 
on 1 October 2010.

The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay certain former owners of Scalable dependent on the gross profit and the 
recurring gross profit for the twelve month periods ending 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 respectively. A maximum undiscounted 
amount of £1,000,000 (£250,000 in shares and £750,000 cash) is to be paid if all of the following criteria are met:
a)  systems gross profit for year ending December 2010 is greater than £3,450,000;
b)  systems gross profit for year ending December 2011 is greater than £4,170,000;
c)  recurring gross profit for year ending December 2010 is greater than £3,390,000; and
d) recurring gross profit for year ending December 2011 is greater than £3,920,000.
A further £250,000 (cash) will be paid contingent on a schedule 23 tax deduction being obtained relating to Scalable share options exercised 
pre-acquisition.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement 
is between £nil and £1,250,000. Management’s estimate, at the date of acquisition, of the amount potentially payable was £923,000.
Additionally, the Company is required to pay up to £3,000,000 (£750,000 in shares and £2,250,000 cash) to the key shareholders based on the 
performance criteria stated above. These payments are conditional on their continued employment within the Group. Under IFRS 3 (revised) this 
amount is debited to the income statement over the earn-out period as employee costs, rather than being treated as deferred consideration on 
acquisition. The total expense during the current year was £1,774,000 and the amount accrued at 30 September 2011 is £656,000.
As part of the above agreement £1,493,000 was paid during the year relating to the targets for the year ending December 2010 of which £1,448,000 
was paid in cash. £1,118,000 of this cash payment relates to the amount recognised through the income statement and the remaining £330,000 
forms part of the cost of investment in Scalable. The 23,403 shares issued in the year as contingent consideration make up part of the cost of 
investment in Scalable and had a fair value of £45,000.
The fair value of trade and other receivables was £5,800,000 and included trade receivables with a fair value of £4,358,000. The gross contractual 
amount for trade receivables due was £4,387,000, of which £29,000 was impaired at the acquisition date.
The residual goodwill of £3,627,000 arising from the acquisition consists largely of the workforce of the acquired business and the significant 
synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Group and Scalable.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The Group incurred £73,000 of third‑party costs related to this acquisition. These expenses are included in operating costs in the Company’s 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period ended 30 September 2011. annual report and accounts 2011

The creation and release of a provision for impaired receivables has been included in operating costs in the income statement. Amounts charged 
to the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
Management regularly reviews the outstanding receivables and does not consider that any further impairment is required.
The other asset classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Share option scheme
The Group’s EMI scheme was adopted on 22 December 2004. Under the Group’s EMI Scheme, options which are qualifying options under the 
Enterprise Management Incentive regime and also unapproved options may be granted.
On 18 January 2006, the Group granted a series of 429,307 EMI scheme options (EMI 2006). The options can be exercised from December 2008 
if the option holder is still an employee of the Group and subject to certain performance criteria all of which were met. There were 55,796 EMI 2006 
options outstanding as at 30 September 2011 (2010: 99,183).
On 17 January 2007, the Group granted a further series of 1,147,907 EMI scheme options (EMI 2007). The options can be exercised in 
December 2009 if the option holder is still an employee of the Group and certain performance criteria have been met. There were 263,109 
EMI 2007 options outstanding as at 30 September 2011 (2010: 773,400).
On 3 July 2008, the Group granted a further series of 243,018 EMI scheme options (EMI 2008). The options can be exercised in July 2011 
if the option holder is still an employee of the Group and certain performance criteria have been met. There were 132,318 EMI 2008 options 
outstanding as at 30 September 2011 (2010: 243,018).
On 24 February 2010, the Group announced the Alternative Networks plc 2010 Value Creation Plan (VCP). Awards under the VCP have no value 
at grant but give the participants the opportunity to be awarded Company shares proportionate to a percentage of the value created for shareholders 
over and above a threshold value over a three year period. A fair value of the options was determined at the grant date and is being expensed 
to the income statement over the term of the plan. The main assumptions used to determine the fair value were as follows:
–  expected volatility which is based on historical volatility of the Company share price over the last three years;
–  the risk free rate of return which is the yield on zero‑coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the scheme duration; and
–  dividend yield which is based on management expectations of dividends to be paid.
In accordance with the VCP scheme rules, the first measurement date was 31 December 2010 and the number of options banked under the plan 
was determined to be 2,179,570. The options banked were approved by the Remuneration Committee on 29 September 2011. Under the VCP 
scheme rules, the awards result in a grant of nil cost options for the plan participants as soon as practical after the measurement date and this 
process is in hand.

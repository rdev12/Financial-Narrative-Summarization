CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
I am delighted to report another successful year for the Company with revenues, 
profits, earnings and dividends all reaching record levels.
This has been achieved in the face of the most competitive trading conditions 
we have yet seen, where a sustained fall in wholesale energy prices over the last 
18 months and aggressive promotional activity by a number of new entrants 
into the energy market (who are not carrying the burden of energy hedged at 
historically higher prices), has combined to create a record gap between the 
introductory fixed price deals available to those who switch, and the standard 
variable tariffs paid by the vast majority of domestic consumers; this has been 
exacerbated by an industry-wide tendency (excluding ourselves) to use the 
higher margins earned on legacy customers to help fund such introductory 
deals. We are strongly opposed to customers being exploited in this way, and 
there is a widespread expectation that this issue will be addressed in due 
course through a combination of regulatory intervention (either as part of the 
CMA review of the energy industry whose report is expected this summer, or by 
Ofgem), and by reductions in standard variable tariffs as larger suppliers reflect 
the prevailing lower level of commodity costs.
Against this background, the continued strong organic growth we have 
delivered in both service numbers and the size of our membership base over 
the last year is a clear and positive endorsement of our unique business 
model. We remain on track to achieve our medium term target of one million 
households, although it is now apparent that our path towards this destination 
will not be in a straight line; growth will be higher during periods when market 
conditions are favourable, and slower when (as currently) the competitive 
environment is more challenging.
On 16 April 2015 the Company informed shareholders that a detailed review of 
the unbilled energy debtor on our balance sheet had revealed that our share of 
the industry-wide leakage within the national gas distribution network had been 
running at a significantly higher level than we had previously provided against. 
The resultant £11m write-down of this current asset on our balance sheet (net 
of anticipated tax credits), although a non-cash item, has reduced both historic 
and current reported earnings, and is extremely disappointing given the strong 
underlying performance of the business over the last year, and our exciting 
prospects for future profitable organic growth.

RESULTS OVERVIEW
Adjusted pre-tax profits increased by 22.5% to £52.2m (2014: £42.6m) on revenue up by 10.5% to 
£729.2m (2014: £659.7m); adjusted earnings per share for the year rose by 9.3% to 53.0p (2014: 
48.5p).
The increase in profitability reflects the consistent organic growth we have achieved over the last two years, 
combined with a full year’s additional margin contribution from the new supply arrangements with Npower 
which we entered into in December 2013, partially offset by writing off the higher costs associated with 
leakage within the national gas distribution network than had previously been expected.
Revenue growth was constrained by a fall in average energy consumption within our domestic membership 
base compared with the previous year, reflecting both milder weather and the progressive impact of the 
energy efficiency measures that have been delivered by the industry over the last few years; this impact 
was exacerbated by lower average energy prices during the year following the price reductions we 
implemented in early 2014 and early 2015. 
We remain encouraged by the continuing organic growth in the number of services we are providing 
through our Utility Warehouse brand, which reached 2,093,447 (2014: 1,884,694) by the year end – an 
increase of more than 200,000 services during the year. This growth has been broadly spread across all 
our core services (Gas, Electricity, Home Phone, Mobile and Broadband) with 58,753 (2014: 40,544) 
residential Members now taking all five of these services from us out of a total of 66,898 with our ‘Double 
Gold’ bundle. This takes our ‘Double Gold’ penetration up to around 12% of our residential membership 
base - a 44% increase in the number of Members taking this premium bundle over the last 12 months.
In line with previous guidance, we are proposing a final dividend of 21p (2014: 19p), bringing the total 
for the year to 40p (2014: 35p); this represents an increase of 14% compared with last year. We remain 
committed to a progressive dividend policy consistent with the underlying strong cash generation of our 
business.
We were delighted to receive a number of further endorsements from Which? and MoneyWise during the 
year recognising both the value we offer and the quality of service provided by our UK based membership 
service team, including being ranked as one of the top three suppliers in all the surveys we were featured 
in, and being shortlisted as ‘Best Telecom Services Provider’ at their 2015 Annual Awards. This is a 
reflection of the continuing focus and significant ongoing resources invested into delivering the best possible 
service to our Members, consistent with securing our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility supplier. 
Our share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited (“Opus”), in which we maintain a 20% stake, 
increased during the year to £6.0m (2014: £4.7m). This business continues to trade strongly, and we 
anticipate our contribution for the coming year will remain at a broadly similar level, before moving 
forward again in 2017.  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 6
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Our commitment to being the Nation’s most trusted utility supplier and to treating our Members fairly makes 
it inappropriate for us to adopt the same marketing strategies as our competitors, who combine cheap 
introductory deals for new customers with much higher tariffs charged to their loyal existing customer base 
who do not appreciate the extent to which they are being exploited.
This approach has become increasingly prevalent across the market for all the services we offer. 
Introductory standard broadband deals offering up to 18 months free, compared with a monthly charge of 
up to £20 (or more) for existing loyal customers; new mobile tariffs with larger inclusive allowances and 
lower monthly charges, that existing customers cannot switch to without paying substantial penalties; and 
in domestic energy markets, one-year fixed term introductory deals have emerged that are up to £400 
cheaper than the standard variable tariffs available from the same supplier. They are all competing for 
market share using the same distribution channels (direct marketing campaigns and price comparison 
websites), where the primary means of differentiating themselves from each other is the headline price of 
the introductory deal they are offering.
This is not only fundamentally unfair on existing loyal customers, but unlikely to create a sustainable long 
term business, as customers who have chosen to switch once based solely on the headline price on a 
comparison site must have a higher propensity to do so again when their introductory deal expires. 
Our alternative approach is to focus on treating all our Members in a fair manner, and to give everyone 
consistently good value on all their services. Accordingly, we don’t offer heavily discounted one-year 
introductory energy deals to new Members, and with all our telephony services (landline, broadband and 
mobile), both new and existing Members pay exactly the same prices for identical packages. 
Our bad debt charge for the year remained low, even though a significant number of new Members joined 
during the year, and delinquency levels (which are a useful lead indicator of future bad debt) saw a further 
small reduction over the course of the year reflecting the improving quality of our membership base.
ROUTE TO MARKET
Significant numbers of new Partners joined the business during the year, taking the total number of 
registered Partners at the year end to a record high of 49,539 (2014: 44,056). Although many of these 
will not be active on a regular basis, this continuing high level of interest reflects the growing awareness of 
our brand and the attractiveness of the secure part-time additional income opportunity we offer.
We continue to invest in improving the personal development programme we offer, free of charge, to both 
new and existing Partners. This is designed to help them gather Members more effectively and build a 
growing long-term residual income.
It is encouraging that notwithstanding the absence of ‘loss leader’ introductory deals for new Members, 
the combined impact of an improved online training course and a revised incentive structure means that a 
higher proportion of new Partners are making a successful start to building their Utility Warehouse business 
than we were seeing during the comparable period last year. Improving the effectiveness of new Partners 
remains a core focus for the business, and we have recently been trialling a new approach to classroom 
training; this has delivered encouraging results, and we will be rolling this out across the UK next month.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) encourages the Chairman to report personally on how 
the principles in the Code relating to the role and effectiveness of the Board have been applied.
As a Board we are responsible to the Company’s shareholders for delivering sustainable shareholder value 
over the long term through effective management and good governance. A key role of mine, as Executive 
Chairman, is to provide strong leadership to enable the Board to operate effectively. 
We believe that open and rigorous debate around key strategic issues and risks faced by the Company is 
important in achieving our objectives and the Company is fortunate to have non-executive directors with 
diverse and extensive business experience who actively contribute to these discussions. 
Further detail of the Company’s governance processes and compliance with the Code is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Statement. 
OUTLOOK
Recent Trading
A record number of Partners attended our annual sales conference in March, where we made some 
important changes to our membership proposition designed to help them build their businesses more 
effectively. These included discontinuing our previous introductory offer of six months free broadband for 
all new Members taking our ‘Gold Talk’ and ‘Double Gold’ bundles, and replacing it with a two-year fixed 
price energy tariff and choice from a range of new optional extra benefits; these are only available to 
owner-occupiers, and on identical terms to both new and existing Members. 
This decision was driven by the significant difference in churn rates (and hence the length of time they can 
be expected to remain a Member) between different segments of our membership base, which makes it 
logical to invest more in attracting and keeping the most valuable types of Member, and to reduce our 
investment where the expected membership lifetime value is lower.
This removal of up-front incentives has obviously not made it easier for our Partners to sign-up new 
Members, within a competitive environment where other suppliers have adopted a diametrically opposite 
strategy of putting as much value as possible into short-term introductory deals. Against this background, 
it is pleasing that our Partners continue to identify substantial numbers of households who can make 
significant savings by switching to us, and who empathise with our core messages of treating our Members 
fairly, delivering consistently good value and providing great service – albeit that absolute growth in the 
number of new Members is currently running below our target run-rate for the year as a whole.
Partner recruitment levels remain solid, and we look forward to the positive impact on activity levels which 
should be created by our new skills-based training programme being introduced shortly. 
Energy Prices
Within the energy sector as a whole, significant investment is needed over the next decade to renew and 
extend the distribution network, replace nuclear and coal-fired generating plant that is approaching the 
end of its useful life, roll out smart meters, and encourage the take up of energy efficiency and renewable 
energy programmes. The costs associated with delivering these initiatives are likely to put continued upward  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 8
pressure on retail energy prices in due course, although in the shorter term we anticipate these will be  
more than offset by lower wholesale energy commodity prices, which have fallen significantly over the last 
18 months, and will steadily be reducing the average hedge book costs for all major suppliers.
Regulatory
The Competition and Markets Authority has been carrying out a detailed review of the domestic energy 
market, and its initial findings are expected to be announced shortly. We welcome its focus on ensuring that 
competition amongst suppliers is working in the best interests of consumers, and look forward to hearing 
its proposals for protecting those on standard variable tariffs across the industry whose inertia is being 
exploited by their existing supplier and used to cross-subsidise introductory fixed price deals aimed at those 
who are switching.
We will shortly be starting to roll-out the installation of smart meters for our Members in line with our 
obligations to ensure all domestic energy meters are replaced by the target completion date in 2020. 
However, the continuing delays in finalising the specification of SMETS2 meters, in getting them certified, 
and in the DCC testing schedule, have created a broad consensus amongst energy suppliers that the 
original target end date for this programme is no longer achievable, and maintaining this deadline will 
simply lead to even higher fulfilment costs which will ultimately be borne by consumers.
Much money continues to be wasted within the industry with little thought apparently given to delivering 
initiatives in a way that will minimise their costs, which ultimately get passed on by suppliers to customers 
through their bills. A prime example of this is the establishment of Smart Energy GB, which has a mandate 
to spend over £85m of customers’ money over the next five years on advertising the benefits of smart 
meters, and making the public aware that this meter replacement programme is taking place, through an 
expensive multi-media campaign featuring two cartoon characters called ‘Gaz’ and ‘Leccy’. 
The changes mandated as part of Ofgem’s Retail Market Review have now been in force for over 12 
months, and it is disappointing how little impact the cheapest alternative supplier messaging rules seem to 
be having on preventing larger suppliers exploiting the inertia of their legacy customer bases, and using 
the excess profits from these customers to fund cheap introductory deals for those who are switching. This 
seems to be due to a combination of factors including: (i) a general lack of interest by many consumers in 
even reading their bill; (ii) a failure by consumers to notice or understand the cheapest tariff messaging; 
and (iii) the practice of most suppliers to send energy bills to their customers on a quarterly or annual basis, 
by which time many of the cheaper deals which were available since the previous billing date will have 
been withdrawn. 
Regulation has an important role to play in ensuring the energy markets are operating in a transparent 
manner, creating a framework which encourages real competition, protecting the rights of consumers, and 
ensuring they receive a fair deal for their energy. However, it is not clear that the right balance has recently 
always been struck. We look forward to a less detailed and more principle based approach in future, 
where innovation can flourish, and there is a clearer understanding of the need to reduce the burden of 
regulation which ultimately falls on those least able to afford it – namely domestic customers.
Within the telecoms markets, significant corporate activity has been announced during the last 12 
months, with BT having made an agreed bid for EE, and ‘3’ planning to merge with O2. If completed, 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
CONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 9
these transactions will reduce the number of networks available for Mobile Virtual Network Operators 
(’MVNO’s’) such as ourselves to work with in future, and we are therefore encouraged that the CMA and 
Ofcom (in relation to the BT/EE transaction) and the European Commission (in relation to the ‘3’/O2 
merger) are focussed on ensuring this likely consolidation will not lead to a reduction in competition or 
consumer choice in future.
Prospects
We are encouraged by the high proportion of new owner-occupiers who are applying for our ‘Double 
Gold’ bundle (Landline, Broadband, Mobile and Energy), which has been consistently running at around 
45% since the start of our new financial year. Over time, this will lead to a progressive further rise in the 
quality of our membership base.
Absolute growth in membership numbers is currently running below our target run-rate for the year as a 
whole, and the likelihood is that our percentage organic growth will remain in mid-single digits until the 
gap between the introductory fixed-price energy deals available to new customers on the one hand, and 
the higher standard variable tariffs charged to most domestic households on the other, narrows significantly. 
We anticipate this will happen progressively over the course of the next 12 months, starting with price 
reductions from all the major energy suppliers later this summer.
In the meantime we are in the process of rolling out improvements to our training programme which we 
believe will improve the effectiveness of new Partners joining the business, and are planning a number of 
new initiatives for later in the year designed to make our unique proposition even more attractive to ‘Double 
Gold’ multi-service owner-occupiers.
Our focus remains on building our membership base to 1 million Members and beyond over the medium 
term; this would represent a UK market share of less than 4%, and seems eminently achievable in due 
course given our track record of consistent organic growth, our unique fully integrated multi-utility service 
proposition, and clearly differentiated proven route to market.
The high quality of our membership base gives us good visibility over future revenues and margins on the 
various services we provide, and we re-iterate our previous guidance that adjusted pre-tax profits for the 
current year will be between £54m and £58m. In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, we intend to 
increase the dividend by 15% to 46p per share. 
It only remains for me to thank my boardroom colleagues for their support and all our staff and Partners for 
their loyalty and hard work during the past year, and to wish each and every one of them success in the 
years to come.

MARKETS
We supply a wide range of essential services under the Utility Warehouse brand (Gas, Electricity, Landline, 
Broadband and Mobile) to both domestic and small business Members throughout the UK; these are all 
substantial markets and represent a vast opportunity for further organic growth.
The markets we operate in are dominated by a relatively small number of former monopoly suppliers and 
other owners of infrastructure assets, although in each there are also a number of independent suppliers 
carving out their own niches, generally based on offering highly competitive introductory short-term fixed 
price contracts promoted through price comparison sites. 
BUSINESS MODEL
We have a fundamentally different business model to any other utility provider in the UK in three key 
respects:
•  we operate our business as a Discount Club; each of our customers becomes a Member, receiving a level 
of service commensurate with that status;
•  we are the only fully integrated provider of both energy and communications services in the country. This 
enables us to enjoy unparalleled levels of operating efficiency as we are able to spread a single set of 
overheads across the multiple revenue streams that we derive from each of our Members; and 
•  we have a unique route to market, with an ‘army’ of almost 50,000 part-time self-employed Partners; 
rather than seeking to attract new Members through expensive advertising, direct marketing or price 
comparison sites, we instead benefit from genuine personal recommendations by both our Partners, and 
by existing Members.
Partners can earn a small percentage of the monthly revenues generated by any Members gathered, 
either personally, or by someone in their team. On a similar basis, we reward our existing Members with 
shopping vouchers when they introduce a new Member to the Club. 
Our Members value the Savings (compared with the prices they were paying their previous suppliers), 
Simplicity (the convenience and ease of budgeting provided by a single monthly bill), and Service (from 
our award-winning UK call centre) that we offer. In addition, an increasing number are benefitting from our 
innovative CashBack proposition.
The delivery of these core benefits is critical to our route to market, giving our Partners the confidence to 
promote our services to their friends and family – as well as generating recommendations from existing 
Members who in many cases also become advocates for our brand. The Net Promoter Scores (“NPS”) of 
around +45 that we consistently achieve reflect our relentless focus on this goal, and are in stark contrast to 
the negative NPS scores prevalent within the utility and telecoms markets. 
Against a backdrop where most of our competitors seem focussed almost solely on price, we believe that 
genuinely earning the Trust of our Members is the key point of differentiation that will enable us to achieve 
our medium term growth objectives. By treating our Members as we would like to be treated ourselves, we  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 11
aim to earn both their loyalty (which delivers long term, sustainable revenues) and their enthusiasm for our 
business model (which creates growth through referrals). 
We have taken a number of steps in this direction over the past few years, culminating most recently in 
our decision to stop giving introductory short-term discounts to new Members as an incentive to switch; this 
reflects our view that it is unfair for existing loyal Members not to be able to benefit from the same prices 
and tariffs as those offered to new ones. 
Simultaneously we are progressively segmenting our customer base, based on their expected lifetime value 
to us as a Member. Consistent with this approach, we have recently increased our focus on attracting 
owner-occupiers taking multiple services from us, by introducing a range of extra benefits from which they 
can choose. 
We continue to invest heavily in our bespoke IT systems; these enable us to integrate all the services we 
supply into a single monthly bill, supported by just one set of central overheads (including all administrative 
and membership service functions). This highly efficient cost base is a key factor in enabling us to offer 
attractive pricing and a wide range of valuable benefits to our Members, a secure residual income to our 
Partners, and a growing dividend stream to shareholders.
We are extremely pleased with the further progress we have made this year in taking advantage of our 
multiple key points of differentiation, and towards securing our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility 
provider. 
STRATEGY
Our strategy is to build on the consistent strong organic growth we have historically delivered in order to 
progressively increase our share of the markets in which we operate.
We will achieve this by maintaining our focus on delivering best-in-class service and support to our 
Members, treating them fairly, investing in our systems and staff, simplifying and, where possible, improving 
the competitiveness of our services even further, encouraging existing Members to talk about the unique 
benefits we offer to their friends and acquaintances, and making it easier for our Partners to promote our 
services more effectively.
We continue to explore the possibility of expanding our current range of core services into areas where we 
can leverage our existing strong relationship with our Members to offer them improved service and better 
value on services they currently obtain from other suppliers, whilst also delivering a satisfactory return for 
our shareholders. Later this year we hope to introduce a range of insurance products, such as home and 
motor policies; in the medium to longer term, other potential new services might include water, television, 
and home emergency cover (including boiler cover). Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 12
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND NON-FINANCIAL KPIS
Our overall performance for the year has been extremely encouraging in a number of key respects:
•  continuing strong organic growth with service numbers up by 208,753 (2014: 305,100)
•  low chur n
•  lower delinquency
•  higher proportion of Members taking our ‘Double Gold’ bundle
•  healthy increase in the number of new Partners
•  positive reviews and recognition from Which? for both energy and telephony services
•  consistently high Net Promoter Scores 
Against the background of a broadly flat economy, and with household incomes remaining under pressure, 
our value-based consumer proposition and the part-time income opportunity we offer are extremely 
attractive to both Members and Partners respectively.
Our continuing strong organic growth is underpinned by high levels of confidence amongst our Partners in 
our brand and financial strength, the good value we provide, and our commitment to delivering best-in-class 
service and support to our Members.

TOTAL CLUB 581,513 524,332 
In addition, there are 5,700 predominantly small-business customers within our TML subsidiary, which does 
not form part of our core Discount Club proposition. We will therefore no longer be including or reporting 
any customer or service numbers for TML, although the relatively modest financial contribution it makes will 
continue to be reflected in the consolidated group numbers.
Within the residential Club, there is a significant difference in average expected lifetimes between Members 
(and therefore in the revenues and profits they will generate), depending on whether they are an owner-
occupier, and on the number of services we are providing to them. 
The most attractive category, with a calculated expected average lifetime of over 25 years, are owner-
occupiers taking our ‘Double Gold’ bundle. We have therefore recently made it even more attractive for 
them to take this bundle from us, by introducing a range of additional ongoing benefits and a new two-year 
fixed energy tariff which are only available to owner-occupiers (both new and existing Members); these 
have replaced the introductory broadband discount previously only offered to new Members taking our 
‘Gold Talk’ and ‘Double Gold’ bundles, irrespective of the type of housing they occupied.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 13
This focus on attracting Members who will have the highest lifetime value has been reflected in an 
increasing proportion of new Members signing up for ‘Double Gold’ and switching all their services to us 
(Landline, Broadband, Mobile, Electricity and/or Gas) to us:
PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEMBERS TAKING ‘DOUBLE GOLD’ BUNDLE
27.7% Q4 FY15
23.6% Q3 FY15

21.1% Q1 FY15
In the first two months of the current quarter, and following the recent changes to our proposition, the 
proportion of ‘Double Gold’ amongst new Members gathered by our Partners had further increased to  
over 29%.
Overall churn within our membership base has remained close to the record low we reported last year. This 
is best illustrated by the level of individual energy supply point churn, which has remained below 1% per 
month (on average), notwithstanding the widening gap between the introductory fixed price deals available 
from other suppliers and the range of competitive variable tariffs we offer:

We enjoy high levels of overall satisfaction within our membership base, as evidenced by the positive 
reviews we receive from Which? magazine on a regular basis, the feedback we receive from the surveys 
we send out each month to Members who have contacted our call centre, and the low level of complaints 
made by our Members to the various industry ombudsmen. This feedback is reflected in our consistently 
positive Net Promoter Score of around +45 against a background where many other suppliers in the utility 
and telecoms sectors achieve negative scores; indeed, our high positive score would have put us in second 
place overall out of more than 60 brands (across nine sectors including mobile and internet) in the most 
recent Satmetrix report (April 2015), and is almost double the latest score of +23 reported by British Gas. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Our innovative CashBack card continues to generate significant monthly savings for our Discount Club 
Members, with the total value of CashBack credited to Members since launching this programme now in 
excess of £21m. In addition, we have seen increasing numbers of Members using our online shopping 
portal and price comparison service to help them find the cheapest online supplier for a wide range of 
everyday household goods, and to earn additional CashBack.
Services
The full range of services we offer includes Landline Telephony (calls and line rental), Broadband, Mobile, 
Gas, Electricity, and our CashBack card. At the year end, we supplied a total of 2,093,447 services to 
Club members (2014: 1,884,694), representing an increase of over 200,000 during the year.

We saw consistent quarterly growth throughout the year in all the core services we provide (Gas, Electricity, 
Landline, Broadband and Mobile), with a particularly pleasing 23% rise in the number of Mobile services 
provided. This increase means penetration of Mobile within our residential Club has almost doubled to 25% 
over the last four years with scope for significant further improvement in this level of penetration in future.
CashBack
Our exclusive CashBack card has proven itself as an important Member acquisition and retention tool. It 
gives our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping 
at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as an automatic credit on their next monthly 
bill from us. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 16
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED 
We have seen a 20% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 167,434 (2014: 
139,769), with around 40% of new residential Club Members gathered directly by our Partners applying 
for a card. We believe this continuing strong demand demonstrates the attractiveness of this unique 
membership benefit, and would be even higher were it not for the difficulties faced by some new Members 
in funding the switch from paying in arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in advance 
with our prepayment card.
We have seen a pleasing increase in the use of our online shopping portal, with Members earning 
CashBack on over £1m of online retail spend each month. We aim to further develop this membership 
benefit within the online Clubhouse and via a Member App to be launched later in the year. 
We paid over £5.4m (2014: £4.9m) in CashBack to our Members during the year (funded entirely by the 
retailers in the programme), with many Members achieving a reduction of between 20% and 30% on the 
amount they pay for the utilities we are supplying to them each month, simply by using their CashBack card 
(instead of an alternative payment card) for most of their regular household shopping, and/or our online 
shopping portal.
Membership Service and Support
We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single call centre based in the 
UK. We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues 
they may have with their multi-utility account.
We have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members; we readily 
invest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the 
numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects 
of our Members’ interactions with us in order to ensure the overall quality of their experience. 
We have been delighted at the consistently high ratings we receive in Which? magazine for the quality of 
the service and support provided to our Members, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive 
from Members in our own surveys.
Partners
Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business. In contrast to the routes to market adopted by 
other suppliers of similar household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenue-
sharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold 
equity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy 
higher-spending Members who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be 
least likely to churn; by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income. This ensures that cases of mis-
selling are both inadvertent and extremely rare.
We provide a variety of training and personal development courses both online and classroom based, 
designed to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners 
effectively and successfully; all of these courses are free to attend. In addition, we offer an interest-free hire 
purchase scheme which gives Partners access to a Tablet so they can present the benefits of our unique 
Discount Club more effectively. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with a subsidised Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini, 
remains extremely popular with around 700 vehicles now on the road (2014: 575). Owners inform us that 
they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from both potential new Members 
and Partners.
Premises and Systems 
The refurbishment of our new headquarters office building which we purchased in February 2012 is now 
substantially complete, and we took occupation around the end of March. This exciting new space will 
support our growing business for the foreseeable future. From a systems perspective, we have the capacity 
to manage a substantial increase in our current membership base and service numbers, without the need 
for any material further capital investment.

In order to provide a clearer presentation of the underlying performance of the Group, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic 
EPS exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of the intangible asset arising on entering into the energy supply 
arrangements with Npower in December 2013.
SUMMARY
The increase in revenue during the year has been driven by continuing strong organic growth in the number 
of services we provide, partially offset by lower energy prices and lower average household energy usage 
compared with the previous year. 
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits of 22.5% reflects the underlying increase in the average 
number of Members during the year, and a full-year contribution from our new energy supply arrangements, 
offset by higher costs being attributed to us than we had previously expected relating to leakage within the 
national gas distribution network which is discussed in more detail below.
Increased promotional activity during the year targeted on recruiting high quality multi-utility new Members 
in a highly competitive market has led to an increased loss from our Customer Acquisition operating 
segment of £15.5m (2014: £12.1m). 
Distribution expenses, which primarily consist of commissions paid to our Partners, increased by £3.3m to 
£21.9m (2014: £18.6m), reflecting the higher number of services being provided to our Members and 
additional promotional costs associated with gathering new Members.
Administrative expenses increased during the year by £4.9m to £46.5m (2014: £41.6m) mainly as a result 
of higher staff costs.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 9.3% to 53.0p (2014: 48.5p), reflecting the full impact of the 
increase in the Company’s share capital resulting from the transaction with Npower in December 2013. In 
accordance with previous guidance and our strong cash position, the Company is proposing to pay a final 
dividend of 21p (2014: 19p) per share, making a total dividend of 40p (2014: 35p) per share for the year. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

WRITE-DOWN OF UNBILLED ENERGY DEBTOR
As announced in our trading update on 16 April, a detailed review of the unbilled energy debtor 
carried on our balance sheet disclosed that approximately £11m (net of anticipated tax credit), which 
had accumulated over the seven years between April 2007 and March 2014 was not recoverable. This 
related to higher levels of leakage within the national gas distribution network than had previously been 
anticipated, and as fully explained in the trading update, has been written off. 
The Board has restated the Company’s accounts to reflect the impact of this write-down on previous years, 
providing stakeholders with an accurate reflection of the historic underlying trend in the performance of the 
business. 
MARGINS
Our overall gross margin for the year was 15.9% (2014: 14.9%) reflecting a full year’s contribution from 
the new energy supply arrangements with Npower which were completed in December 2013, and an 
improving gross margin on our telephony services where higher pricing has largely offset the continuing 
downward trend in call spend amongst Members using their landlines. We expect our gross profit margins 
to remain within the previously stated range of 15% to 17% for the foreseeable future, subject to the impact 
from any new services which may be introduced. 
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS
We have continued to achieve steady growth in the number of services we are supplying, with an increase 
of over 200,000 services during the course of the year. This takes the total number of services provided by 
our Discount Club to almost 2.1 million – an increase of more than 10% compared with the previous year.
These numbers reflect our continuing focus on making it easier for Partners to gather new Members by 
simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our prices more competitive, and 
improving the quality of service and support we provide to our membership base. As a result, all our core 
services have continued to see consistent organic growth.
Revenues increased across all our core services, notwithstanding both lower average energy consumption 
and lower retail energy prices compared with the previous year:

CUSTOMER ACQUISITION
Our net investment in acquiring new Members increased during the year to £15.5m (2014: £12.1m), 
mainly reflecting increased promotional activity in a challenging and increasingly competitive market and a 
higher proportion taking our ‘Double Gold’ bundle. 
Although the cost of acquiring an owner-occupier taking our ‘Double Gold’ Bundle is generally 
considerably higher than for a tenant taking fewer services, our experience shows that the return on 
that investment will more than compensate for the higher upfront costs we incur, due to the much longer 
expected lifetime of this type of Member.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Distribution expenses include both the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Partners, 
and other direct costs associated with gathering new Members included as part of the Customer 
Acquisition Segment result for the year. These increased by £3.3m to £21.9m (2014: £18.6m), reflecting 
a combination of higher residual income payments to Partners, and the costs of various promotional 
incentives (such as shopping vouchers) provided to new Members.
Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year remained at 1.5% of revenues  
(2014: 1.5%), but increased slightly in absolute terms to £10.7m (2014: £9.9m).
Notwithstanding our growing membership base, the number of prepayment meters we installed during the 
year fell to 8,642 (2014: 8,958), of which many were provided at the Member’s own request. This reflects 
our efforts over the last few years to attract and retain high quality multi-service owner-occupiers. At the 
end of the year we had an installed base of 68,066 (2014: 50,095) prepayment meters, representing 
approximately 7.1% of the energy services we supply. This remains significantly below the average level of 
prepayment meters within the industry of around 15% (source: Ofgem). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

DELINQUENT MEMBERS
1.15% 2014
1.23% 2013
1.46% 2012
1.10% 2015
Delinquency (the proportion of Members who have at least two energy bills outstanding) has been on a 
steady downward trajectory over the last few years, and we are pleased that this trend has continued over 
the last 12 months. 
The average number of employees increased from 696 to 787, reflecting our commitment to continue 
delivering the best possible service experience to our Members, and a significant ongoing investment in 
strengthening our management structure. Personnel expenses (excluding the non-cash accounting cost of 
share incentive schemes) increased by 12.2% during the year to £26.7m (2014: £23.8m). 
Overall, administrative expenses remained broadly flat at 6.4% of revenue for the year (2014: 6.3%).
OPUS 
Our share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited (“Opus”), in which we maintain a 20% stake, 
increased during the year to £6.0m (2014: £4.7m). This excellent result reflects a continuing strong trading 
performance, and the further steady progress they have made in supplying gas alongside electricity into the 
small business and corporate sector, for which they are now buying renewable energy from over 500 small 
UK generators. Opus revenues increased by 20.5% to just over £523m (2014: £434m) and profit before 
tax increased from £30.2m to £38.0m.
We remain encouraged by the resilience of the business model and the strength and experience of the 
Opus management team, and look forward to receiving a dividend of approximately £5.4m from them 
later this month. Our shareholding in Opus is valued on our balance sheet at £10.8m in line with standard 
accounting policy, notwithstanding the likelihood that its market value is substantially in excess of this figure; 
we are extremely pleased to have such significant exposure to this rapidly growing, profitable and highly 
cash generative business. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 22
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED 
CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL
Our cash balances at the year-end reduced to £16.5m (2014: £45.4m) as we took advantage of the 
opportunity to re-negotiate our banking facilities and reduce our borrowing costs by repaying £30m to the 
bank ahead of the originally agreed repayment schedule. We also spent £19m during the year out of the 
£23m anticipated total cost of refurbishing our new office headquarters.
Our overall working capital position benefitted from a year on year cash inflow of £8.4m, largely due 
to lower average energy consumption and payment timing differences related to our energy purchasing 
arrangements with Npower. This cash inflow is expected to reverse during the current financial year.
On an underlying basis, and in the normal course of events, we anticipate a modest rise in our working 
capital requirements over the next two years due to a number of factors: (i) the costs associated with 
funding the growth in our mobile business (where increasing numbers of Members are choosing to be 
provided with a premium mobile handset, which they can obtain from us with no upfront cost on a 24 
month contract); (ii) an increase in the number of BMW Minis supplied to Partners on hire purchase 
agreements; and (iii) the cost of providing them with Tablets (on 30 months interest-free credit) to help them 
build their businesses more effectively.
Under the terms of our energy supply arrangements Npower remains responsible for funding the working 
capital requirements associated with providing energy to Members who have chosen to pay on a  
budget plan.
BORROWINGS 
Our balance sheet at the year-end shows a net debt position of £74.0m (2014: £75.1m) including the 
deferred consideration of £21.5m payable to Npower in December 2016. 
DIVIDEND 
The final dividend of 21p per share (2014: 19p) will be paid on 18 August 2015 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 24 July 2015 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting which will be held on 11 August 2015. This makes a total dividend 
payable for the year of 40p (2014: 35p), an increase of over 14% compared with the previous year.
We believe our strong underlying cash flow, rising earnings and significant borrowing capacity will enable 
us to refinance or repay our remaining borrowings as they fall due, whilst maintaining a progressive 
dividend policy. We remain comfortable with previous guidance that our total dividend for the current year 
will increase by 15% to 46p per share, and thereafter that further growth in earnings from the level we 
achieve this year should be reflected in a corresponding rise in the level of distributions to shareholders.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES
Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme credits of £1.0m (2014: charges of £4.2m). These 
credits relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments (“IFRS 2”) and arose principally 
as a result of the fall in the Company’s share price over the year.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 23
As a result of the relative size of share incentive scheme credits/charges as a proportion of our pre-tax 
profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income for the period (and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits and earnings) 
so that the underlying performance of the business can be clearly identified. Our current adjusted earnings 
per share have also therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION
A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The tax 
charge for the year is £9.8m (2014: £7.2m). 
The effective tax rate for the year was 23.2% (2014: 20.8%), with the increase compared with last year 
primarily due to the inclusion of a full year’s amortisation charge in respect of the intangible asset, which is 
not tax deductible.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
BACKGROUND
The Group faces various risk factors, both internal and external, which could have a material impact on 
long-term performance. However, the Group’s underlying business model is considered relatively low-
risk, with no need for management to take any disproportionate risks in order to preserve or generate 
shareholder value.
The Group continues to develop and operate a consistent and systematic risk management process, which 
involves risk ranking, prioritisation and subsequent evaluation, with a view to ensuring all significant risks 
have been identified, prioritised and (where possible) eliminated, and that systems of control are in place to 
manage any remaining risks. 
A formal document is prepared by the executive directors and senior management team on a regular basis 
detailing the key risks faced by the Group and the operational controls in place to mitigate those risks; this 
document is then reviewed by the Audit Committee.
BUSINESS MODEL
The principal risks outlined below should be viewed in the context of the Group’s business model as a 
reseller of utility services (gas, electricity, fixed line telephony, mobile telephony and broadband internet) 
under the Utility Warehouse and TML brands. As a reseller, the Group does not own any of the network 
infrastructure required to deliver its services to its membership base. This means that while the Group is 
heavily reliant on third party providers, it is insulated from all the direct risks associated with owning and/
or operating such capital intensive infrastructure itself. 
The Group’s services are promoted using ‘word of mouth’ by a large network of independent Partners, who 
are paid solely on a commission basis. This means that the Group has minimal fixed costs associated with 
acquiring new Members.
The principal specific risks arising from the Group’s business model, and the measures taken to mitigate 
those risks, are set out below.
REPUTATIONAL RISK
The Group’s reputation amongst its Members, suppliers and Partners is believed to be fundamental to the 
future success of the Group. Failure to meet expectations in terms of the services provided by the Group, 
the way the Group does business or in the Group’s financial performance could have a material negative 
impact on the Group’s performance.
In relation to the service provided to its membership base, reputational risk is principally mitigated  
through the Group’s recruitment processes, a focus on closely monitoring staff performance, including the 
use of direct feedback surveys from Members (Net Promoter Score), and through the provision of rigorous 
staff training. 
Responsibility for maintaining effective relationships with suppliers and Partners rests primarily with the 
appropriate member of the Group’s senior management team with responsibility for the relevant area. Any 
material changes to supplier agreements and Partner commission arrangements which could impact the 
Group’s relationships are generally negotiated by the executive Directors and ultimately approved by the 
full Board. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 25
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISK
The Group is dependent on its proprietary billing and membership management software for the successful 
operation of its business model. This software is developed and maintained in accordance with the 
changing needs of the business by a team of highly skilled, long-standing, motivated and experienced 
individuals. The Group relies on this software and any failure in its operation could negatively impact 
service to Members and potentially be damaging to the Group’s brand.
All significant changes which are made to the billing and membership management software are tested as 
extensively as reasonably practicable before launch and are ultimately approved by the heads of the IT and 
Billing departments in consultation with the Chief Executive as appropriate. 
Back-ups of both the software and underlying billing and membership data are made on a regular basis 
and securely stored off-site. The Group also has extensive back-up information technology infrastructure in 
the event of a failure of the main system, designed to ensure that a near-seamless service to Members can 
be maintained.
During the year the Group agreed to acquire the underlying source code behind its billing and membership 
management system which had previously been used under licence. As a result of the acquisition the Group 
now has full strategic control over the source code and has therefore removed any risk of future software 
development not being able to meet the precise requirements of the Group.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RISK
The Group is subject to varying laws and regulations, including possible adverse effects from European 
regulatory intervention. The energy markets in the UK and Continental Europe are subject to comprehensive 
operating requirements as defined by the relevant sector regulators and/or government departments. 
Amendments to the regulatory regime could have an impact on the Group’s ability to achieve its financial 
goals and any failure to comply may result in the Group being fined and lead to reputational damage 
which could impact the Group’s brand. Furthermore, the Group is obliged to comply with retail supply 
procedures, amendments to which could have an impact on operating costs.
The Group is a licenced gas and electricity supplier, and therefore has a direct regulatory relationship 
with Ofgem. If the Group fails to maintain an effective relationship with Ofgem and comply with its licence 
obligations, it could be subject to fines or to the removal of its respective licences.
Proposed regulatory changes such as the new requirements in relation to smart energy meters (with the 
potential for additional costs if existing meters must be replaced prior to the end of their planned lives) and 
social tariffs, and changes to the current decommissioning regime could all have a potentially significant 
impact on the sector, although any additional costs associated with smart metering are not expected to 
affect the net margins earned by energy suppliers in the longer term (as any such extra costs are likely to be 
reflected in higher retail charges). 
In general, the majority of the Group’s services are supplied into highly regulated markets, and this 
could restrict the operational flexibility of the Group’s business. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group 
maintains an appropriate relationship with both Ofgem and Ofcom (the UK regulators for the energy and  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 26
communications markets respectively) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (“DECC”). The 
Group engages with officials from all these organisations on a periodic basis to ensure they are aware of 
the Group’s views when they are consulting on proposed regulatory changes or if there are competition 
issues the Group needs to raise with them.
However, it should be noted that the regulatory environment for the various markets in which the Group 
operates is generally focussed on promoting competition. As one of the new entrants, it seems reasonable 
to expect that most potential changes will broadly be beneficial to the Group, given the Group’s relatively 
small size compared to the former monopoly incumbents with whom it competes, although these changes, 
and their actual impact, remain uncertain at present. It currently remains unclear how the governmental 
focus on reform of the energy market and the current investigation by the Competition and Markets 
Authority will impact the operations of the Group. 
Political and consumer concern over energy prices and fuel poverty may lead to further reviews of the 
energy market which could result in further consumer protection legislation being introduced through energy 
supply licences. The Government could also choose to introduce adverse measures such as a windfall 
tax on the Group or price controls for certain customer segments. In addition, political and regulatory 
developments affecting the energy markets within which the Group operates may have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and overall financial condition.
FINANCING RISK
As a result of the transaction with Npower in December 2013, the Group entered into new debt facilities 
leading to increased debt service obligations which may place operating and financial restrictions on 
the Group. This debt could have adverse consequences insofar as it: (a) requires the Group to dedicate 
a material proportion of its cash flows from operations to fund payments in respect of the debt, thereby 
reducing the flexibility of the Group to utilise its cash to invest in and/or grow the business; (b) increases 
the Group’s vulnerability to adverse general economic and/or industry conditions; (c) may limit the Group’s 
flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business or the industry in which it operates; (d) 
may limit the Group’s ability to raise additional debt in the long term; and (e) could restrict the Group from 
making larger strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities.
Each of these prospective adverse consequences (or a combination of some or all of them) could result in 
the potential growth of the Group being at a slower rate than may otherwise be achieved.
FRAUD AND BAD DEBT RISK 
The Group has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. 
This means that although the Group is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from potential new Members 
who are not considered creditworthy, the Group is obliged to supply domestic energy to everyone who 
submits a properly completed application form. Where Members subsequently fail to pay for the energy 
they have used (“Delinquent Members”), there is likely to be a considerable delay before the Group 
is able to control its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or 
disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such Delinquent Members from 
increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recovered.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 27
Fraud within the telephony industry may arise from Members using the services without intending to pay 
their supplier. The amounts involved are generally relatively small as the Group has sophisticated call traffic 
monitoring systems to identify material occurrences of fraud. The Group is able to immediately eliminate 
any further bad debt exposure by disconnecting any telephony service that demonstrates a suspicious 
usage profile, or falls into arrears on payments.
More generally, the Group is also exposed to payment card fraud, where Members use stolen cards to obtain 
credit (e.g. on their CashBack card) or goods (e.g. Smartphones and Tablets) from the Group; the Group 
regularly reviews and refines its fraud protection systems to reduce its potential exposure to such risks.
DATA SECURITY RISK
The Group processes sensitive personal and commercial data during the course of its business. The Group 
looks to protect customer and corporate information and data and to keep its infrastructure secure. A 
significant breach of cyber security could result in the Group facing regulatory fines, loss of commercially 
sensitive information and damage to its brand. The Group uses high specification firewalling and anti-viral 
management systems; external consultants are also used to conduct penetration testing on the Group’s IT 
infrastructure. 
WHOLESALE PRICES RISK
The Group does not own or operate any utility network infrastructure itself, choosing instead to purchase 
the capacity needed from third parties. The advantage of this approach is that the Group is protected from 
technological risk, capacity risk or the risk of obsolescence, as it can purchase the amount of each service 
required to meet its Members’ needs. 
Whilst there is a theoretical risk that in some of the areas in which the Group operates it may be unable 
to secure access to the necessary infrastructure on commercially attractive terms, in practice the pricing of 
access to such infrastructure is either regulated (as in the energy market) or subject to significant competitive 
pressures (as in telephony and broadband). The profile of the Group’s Members, the significant quantities 
of each service they consume in aggregate, and its clearly differentiated route to market has historically 
proven attractive to infrastructure owners, who compete aggressively to secure a share of the Group’s 
growing business.
The supply of energy has different risks associated with it. The wholesale price can be extremely volatile, 
and Member demand can be subject to considerable short term fluctuations depending on the weather. The 
Group has a long-standing supply relationship with Npower under which the latter assumes the substantive 
risks and rewards of hedging and buying energy for the Group’s Members, and where the price paid 
by the Group is set by reference to the average of the standard variable tariffs charged by the ‘Big 6’ to 
their domestic customers less an agreed discount; this may not be competitive against the wholesale prices 
available to new and/or other independent suppliers. If the Group did not have the benefit of this long term 
supply agreement it would be exposed to the pricing risk of securing access to the necessary energy on the 
open market. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 28
COMPETITIVE RISK
The Group operates in highly competitive markets and significant service innovations or increased price 
competition could impact future profit margins. In order to maintain its competitive position, there is a 
consistent focus on ways of improving operational efficiency and keeping the cost base as low as possible. 
New service innovations are monitored closely by senior management and the Group is typically able to 
respond rapidly by offering any new services using the infrastructure of its existing suppliers. The Group 
offers a unique multi-utility proposition. The increasing proportion of Members who are benefiting from 
a genuine multi-utility solution, that is unavailable from any other known supplier, materially reduces any 
competitive threat.
The Directors anticipate that the Group will face continued competition in the future as the market grows, 
new companies enter the market and alternative technologies and services become available. The Group’s 
services and expertise may be rendered obsolete or uneconomic by technological advances or novel 
approaches developed by one or more of the Group’s competitors. The existing approaches of the Group’s 
competitors or new approaches or technologies developed by such competitors may be more effective 
or affordable than those supplied to the Group. There can be no assurance that the Group’s competitors 
will not develop more effective or more affordable technologies or services, thus rendering the Group’s 
technologies and/or services obsolete, uncompetitive or uneconomical. There can be no assurance that the 
Group will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors or that competitive factors 
will not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
However, as the Group’s membership base continues to rise, competition amongst suppliers of services 
to the Group is expected to increase. This has already been evidenced by various volume-related growth 
incentives which have been agreed with the Group’s three largest wholesale suppliers. This should ensure 
that the Group has direct access to new technologies and services available to the market. 
INFRASTRUCTURE RISK
The provision of services to the Group’s Members is reliant on the efficient operation of third party physical 
infrastructure. There is a risk of disruption to the supply of services to Members through any failure in 
the infrastructure e.g. gas shortages, power cuts or damage to communications networks. However, 
as the infrastructure is generally shared with other suppliers, any material disruption to the supply of 
services is likely to impact a large part of the market as a whole and it is unlikely that the Group would 
be disproportionately affected. In the event of any prolonged disruption isolated to the Group’s principal 
supplier within a particular market, services required by Members could be sourced from another provider.
ENERGY INDUSTRY ESTIMATION RISK
A significant degree of judgement and estimation is required in order to determine the actual level of 
energy used by Members and hence that should be recognised by the Group as sales. There is an 
inherent risk that the estimation routines used by the Group do not in all instances fully reflect the actual 
usage of Members.

CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 29
GAS LEAKAGE WITHIN THE NATIONAL GAS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
The operational management of the national gas distribution network is outside the control of the Group. 
There is a risk that the level of leakage in future could be higher than those historically experienced, and 
above those currently expected.
KEY MAN RISK
The Group is dependent on its key management for the successful development and operation of its 
business. In the event that any or all of the members of the key management team were to leave the 
business, it could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s operations.
SINGLE SITE RISK
The Group operates from one principal site and, in the event of significant damage to that site through fire 
or other issues, the operations of the Group could be adversely affected. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 30
PEOPLE AND ORGANISATION
EMPLOYEES
We rely on the combined efforts of around 800 employees to manage relationships with both our Members 
and Partners, and deliver a consistently high quality of service at all times. We pay considerable attention 
to recruiting, developing and retaining people with appropriate skills.
We continue to recruit new members of staff through our own Assessment Centre designed to give the 
Company greater control over the recruitment process and to ensure we select the very best candidates for 
our positions. Once they have joined, new starters go through a structured training programme to ensure 
that they are fully equipped to resolve any queries from our membership and to provide the high level of 
service that we demand. Everyone who successfully completes this programme celebrates their achievement 
at a quarterly Academy graduation ceremony, where they are presented with a certificate and Champagne 
by the Chief Executive.
The combination of valuing and developing our staff, our service-oriented culture and the day-to-day 
reinforcement of our core values are key competitive advantages in enabling us to attract and retain a 
motivated, talented and diverse workforce. 
We continue to invest in our people, and have comprehensive Manager and Supervisor development 
programmes, which are accompanied by selective executive coaching. We have an online learning portal 
to assist in the development of all our employees, and make available a wide range of ‘Skills Builder 
Courses’ in addition to e-learning modules. We promote from within where possible into both specialist and 
managerial roles. 
Our monthly employee recognition awards (known internally as ‘Piggy Awards’) enable the Company to 
celebrate and reward employees who have gone ‘over and above’ in the performance of their role. 
We actively seek to engage all our employees in changes that may concern them, rather than just a 
representative few on a committee. Focus groups are held on a continual basis to ensure that any changes 
we have introduced continue to encourage our staff to perform to their best. We keep employees informed 
on a regular basis of the financial performance of the business and other matters of potential concern 
to them, through the Company intranet, ad-hoc emails, the monthly Company newsletter and quarterly 
breakfast forums with the Chief Executive.
We operate an ‘open-door’ policy throughout the business, provide employees with various mechanisms 
for providing feedback and making suggestions, and include open ended questions within the staff 
survey. This year we held our very own ‘Dragons’ Den’ competition, ‘The Piggies’ Pen’ to elicit innovative 
suggestions for improving our business from our staff, and were delighted when over 70 members of staff 
submitted entries. 
We have an active staff social committee which organises a wide range of events, supported by the 
Company, including the annual summer and Christmas parties, quiz nights and many other ad hoc fun 
events. We also have a ‘Fun Fund’ set aside for departmental social events. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 31
We promote staff wellbeing, through an employee assistance helpline, periodic at-desk massages, healthy 
meal options in the staff restaurant and a cycle to work scheme. Each September we run our ‘Fit Pig Week’ 
to promote health and well-being within the Company with a range of fun events and initiatives, such as 
offering well-being check-ups. Last year we introduced private health care with BUPA, which our staff can 
elect to join at advantageous corporate rates, with premiums deducted from salary. This has been taken up 
by a significant number of our staff, and in particular, longer-standing members and management.
Our new headquarters has been designed to offer our staff a much enhanced working environment. In 
addition to offering state of the art facilities, the offices include design features to inspire our staff and 
encourage collaboration. Spacious and light, there are break out rooms on all floors and a recreation 
suite that boasts a wide-screen TV lounge, pods for relaxing in, plenty of seating areas and a library area 
with table-tennis and pool tables. Our new staff restaurant has been upgraded to a brasserie style eatery, 
complete with its own Deli Bar. This highly subsidised restaurant is an increasingly popular benefit for our 
staff and provides a great venue for the staff social events; including regular ‘Drinks After Work’. With the 
exception of our logistics team, all our employees work together in Network HQ, our new Head Office 
building in London. We provide a wide range of other staff benefits including a significant discount on the 
services we provide, employee loans at preferential interest rates, a generous Christmas bonus scheme, 
Gourmet Society dining membership and recognition for five, 10 and 15 years’ service.
The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved employee share option plan, under which 
employees are granted options to purchase shares in the Company which are exercisable between three 
and ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price is the market price at the time of granting the 
option. Our policy is to issue options to all employees after the satisfactory completion of their probationary 
period, and additional options when 10 years’ service has been completed and in other appropriate 
circumstances (e.g. promotion). As at 31 March 2015 there were outstanding options over 1,882,082 
shares which had been granted to staff, representing approximately 2.3% of the issued share capital of the 
Company.
Employees returning from maternity leave with children less than 12 months old are able to benefit from a 
company contribution towards the cost of an external childcare service provider of their choice. We also 
provide facilities for staff to purchase childcare vouchers in a tax-efficient manner using a salary sacrifice 
scheme, in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines.
We encourage all employees to participate in a stakeholder pension scheme operated by Aviva. 
Participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the Company within certain 
limits, depending on length of service. As a result of pension auto-enrolment the Company is contributing to 
the pension funds of virtually all employees, on a monthly basis.
We actively facilitate ‘Access to Work’ grants for employees who have a disability, health or mental health 
condition providing the practical support to enable them to continue working effectively. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 32

ENVIRONMENT
We are conscious of the role we have to play in minimising the environmental impact of our activities.
We operate an energy efficiency helpline to provide advice to Members on how they can reduce their 
energy usage; we enable qualifying Members to access free home insulation; we actively promote Feed-In 
Tariffs; and we encourage Members to monitor their energy usage by providing regular meter readings.
Since moving to an online Member application process, we have reduced the amount of printed marketing 
materials we are using, and seen a significant increase in the proportion of new members choosing not to 
receive a paper bill each month.
We participate in a waste paper recycling programme, with a certificated saving of 457 trees and 
61,330kg of CO2 during the year (2014: 298 trees and 39,370kg of CO2); we also recycle all of our 
cardboard, and use only fsc-certified paper. We recycle both mobile phones and toner cartridges, within 
the scope of our annual Charity Partnership.
During the year we completed the refurbishment of our new Head Office building, Merit House. The 
refurbishment of Merit House ensured that the building which was previously under-performing was made 
compliant with current environmental efficiency regulations. In refurbishing the existing building, we have 
also minimised the environmental impact from carbon emissions when compared to demolishing and 
constructing a new building.
Key aspects of efficiency incorporated into the refurbished building are set out below:
• modular office LED lighting;
• PIR daylight saving light sensors;
• high efficiency air conditioning system;
• highly efficient lift motor and control system;
• percussive water saving taps;
• efficient sensor flush systems; and
• fresh air quality improved providing 10 litres/second per person.
In addition, upgrades were made to the thermal envelope of the building leading to greater energy 
efficiency and insulation values.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STATEMENT
The greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions statement below provides a summary of the Company’s 
greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015. It gives a summary of emissions 
from fuel combustion and the operation of our facilities (which include our offices and company cars, scope 
1), and from our purchased electricity use during the year (scope 2).
We have adopted the operational control approach, as defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) 2004, therefore emissions associated with 
our Members’ energy usage, the activities of our independent distributors and the supply of energy from 
Npower are not included in this statement as they are outside the Company’s operational control. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2015 34

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Save in the limited instances explained below, the Board is pleased to report that during the year and as 
at the date of this Annual Report the Company has applied the main principles and complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2012. Additionally, the Board has given consideration to the requirements set out in the new 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 which applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 
2014 (“the New Code”). The Board’s position in relation to certain of the provisions of the New Code is set 
out in this Annual Report. Copies of the Code and the New Code are available at www.frc.org.uk.
This report, together with the Director’s Report on pages 72 to 76 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 50 to 71, provides details of how the Company has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions of the Code and where required explains the rationale for instances where the Company has not 
been compliant, namely: (i) the external facilitation of a Board evaluation exercise; and (ii) the design of 
performance-related elements of remuneration, i.e. the requirement for share awards to be phased rather 
than being granted in blocks. Further detail in relation to the Company’s position regarding performance-
related elements of remuneration is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board meets regularly to review the progress of the Company and to discuss the measures required for 
its future development. Directors are provided in advance with a formal agenda of matters to be discussed 
at each meeting, and with the detailed information needed to monitor the progress of the Company. 
Records of meetings and the decisions of the Board are maintained by the Company Secretary and are 
approved by the Board at the following meeting. All directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary and, if required, are able to take independent advice at the Company’s expense 
in the furtherance of their duties. Any question of the removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the 
Board as a whole. Whilst the members of the Board are all experienced and well qualified, the opportunity 
to receive further training at the Company’s expense is available to them at all times. The non-executive 
directors attended such formal, externally facilitated courses as they considered relevant to their roles and 
responsibilities during the year.
BOARD DUTIES
The matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board are fully documented and include the following 
principal areas:
• Reviewing and agreeing the Company’s strategy and long term objectives.
• Assessing performance in the light of the Company’s strategy and objectives.
• Ensuring an effective system of risk management and internal controls is in place.
•  Approving changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board and reviewing its performance on 
an annual basis.
• Reviewing the Company’s overall corporate governance arrangements.
• Approval of the Company’s financial statements prior to publication. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 38

In accordance with provision A.4.2 of the Code, the non-executive directors also met without the executives 
present during the year.
BOARD EVALUATION
The directors recognise that the Code requires an external evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 companies 
to be carried out at least every three years. However, the directors considered the position in relation to the 
current year and concluded that an external evaluation was not necessary. In reaching this conclusion the 
directors were mindful of the effective operation of the Board during the year and the results of the internal 
Board evaluation exercise detailed below. The Board considers it unlikely that an external evaluation will 
be conducted in the medium term.
An internal evaluation of the Board for the current year was conducted through the completion of formal 
detailed board, and board committee evaluation questionnaires by each director. In addition a review 
involving each director was carried out. This review was conducted by the Deputy Chairman and Company 
Secretary and principally covered the following areas: specific matters of concern arising from the board 
evaluation questionnaires, individual directors’ performances and key objectives for the coming year, and 
the identification of any specific training and development requirements.
The evaluation questionnaires were focussed on assessing effectiveness in the following key areas:
• the size and balance of the Board;
• the quality of board debates and its decision making processes; Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 39
• the individual contributions made by each director;
• the Chairman’s approach to leadership;
• the non-executive directors’ challenge of the executive directors;
• the Board’s approach to identifying and mitigating key business risks;
• the quality of the Company’s communications with key stakeholders; 
• the Board’s consideration of diversity and succession planning; and
• the induction and training of board members.
In accordance with provision B.6.3 of the Code and building on the results of the evaluation questionnaires, 
the Deputy Chairman led a separate evaluation of the performance of the Chairman. This evaluation 
principally comprised a review of the Chairman’s leadership style and tone in promoting effective decision-
making and ensuring constructive and sufficient debate took place around key issues. The results of this 
evaluation were entirely satisfactory.
The evaluation concluded that overall the Board and its Committees had operated satisfactorily during the 
year, with all directors making an effective contribution to the Board commensurate with their experience 
and responsibilities. However, the evaluation identified that succession planning, and in particular the 
need to strengthen the independent non executive presence on the Board, was required in the current year. 
As such the Nomination Committee is in the process of identifying potential non-executive candidates for 
appointment to the Board in the short term.
BOARD BALANCE AND DIVERSITY
The Board remains comprised of three executive directors and three independent non-executive directors. 
Chris Houghton, former Finance Director, resigned from the Board on 3 October 2014 and was replaced 
by Nick Schoenfeld on 7 January 2015. Julian Schild acts as the Company’s Deputy Chairman and Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Membership of each committee of the Board is set out in the table below:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED
The Board, in conjunction with the Nomination Committee, regularly reviews whether the composition of 
the Board and the diversity of its members remain appropriate in the light of the commercial challenges and 
risks facing the Company. 
The members of the Nomination Committee believe that the composition of the Board is currently 
appropriate for the size of the Company and the nature of its operations which have not materially 
changed in scope since the prior year. However, consistent with the requirement of the Code to ensure 
a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Nomination Committee has been implementing its plan for 
independent non-executive director succession in the near future, to reflect the long service of both 
Michael Pavia and Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in late 2006. Further detail of the 
Committee’s activities during the year is set out in the Nomination Committee report on page 44.
The main objective of the Nomination Committee in considering the appointment of new directors to the 
Board remains to ensure that successful candidates are of the highest calibre and demonstrate the best 
possible combination of skills and experience. The Committee’s Terms of Reference further stipulate that 
candidates from a wide range of backgrounds shall be considered and that due regard will be given to the 
benefits of diversity on the Board.
The Code requires companies to set out any measurable objectives that exist in relation to Board diversity. 
However, it remains the Committee’s strong view that it is not appropriate to stipulate the characteristics of 
any future directors, including gender, ahead of a full assessment of the particular requirements of each 
role at the time a candidate is being sought. The Committee will continue to adhere to the principles set out 
above in identifying and recruiting the best candidates for any future Board roles in a non-discriminatory 
manner.
Further detail regarding the Company’s position in relation to encouraging diversity within all layers of the 
organisation is set out in the “People and Organisation” section of the Strategic Report on pages 30 to 32.
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company with the Executive Chairman 
responsible for developing the strategic direction of the business and ensuring the effective operation of 
the Board, including compliance with principles of good corporate governance, and the Chief Executive 
primarily responsible for implementing strategy and running the Group’s operations on a day to day basis. 
As appropriate, and in order to ensure good corporate governance, the Executive Chairman is assisted 
by the Company’s independent non-executive Deputy Chairman in ensuring compliance with the effective 
operation of the Board. 
The division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive has been set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board in accordance with the Code (provision A.2.1).
SUPPLY OF INFORMATION
Information is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in 
advance of meetings. When the Board requests additional information it is provided. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

RE-ELECTION
The Company’s Articles stipulate that one third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each 
Annual General Meeting and all newly appointed directors are required to offer themselves for election by 
the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. 
However, the Code requires that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election 
by shareholders. Therefore all the directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting in August. Acknowledging the Code requirement for a particularly rigorous review in 
circumstances where non-executive directors’ terms are being extended beyond six years, the Board has 
determined that all directors continue to make a valuable contribution to the commercial success of the 
Company, with each bringing a complementary range of skills to the team. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Board has a Remuneration Committee whose responsibility is to ensure that the remuneration 
of executive directors is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate people of the highest calibre. The 
Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, namely Julian Schild 
(Chairman of the Committee), Melvin Lawson and Michael Pavia. The Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
giving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 50 to 71.
The Remuneration Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by 
the Board.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael Pavia (Chairman of the 
Committee), Melvin Lawson and Julian Schild in compliance with the Code (provision C.3.1). The activities 
of the Audit Committee are set out on pages 46 to 49.
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it

NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia (Chairman of Committee), Julian Schild and Charles 
Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the Code 
(provision B.2.1). The main purpose of the Nomination Committee is to make recommendations to the 
Board on the appointment of new directors.

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
It is the policy of the Company to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them 
informed about the objectives of the business. The Board considers that it is appropriate for the executive 
directors to discuss any relevant matters regarding company performance with major shareholders and this 
is undertaken primarily by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Executive provides 
feedback from major shareholders to the other directors, in order to ensure that Board members, and in 
particular non-executive directors, develop a balanced understanding of the views of major investors. The 
executive directors met with a number of the Company’s main shareholders during the year.
The Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer also have periodic discussions 
with the Company’s brokers and issues are fed back to the Board as appropriate. When reports are 
received from the Company’s brokers following investor presentations, these are submitted to the Board for 
review. Additionally the non-executive directors have at least one opportunity each year to meet with the 
Company’s brokers to discuss any issues.
Responsibility for communication with key shareholders in relation to corporate governance and Board 
remuneration matters lies primarily with the Deputy Chairman who is assisted in this regard by the 
Company Secretary. Individual invitations to engage with the Deputy Chairman have previously been 
sent out to key shareholders and, where requested or considered necessary, certain matters have been 
discussed in more detail during the year.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 21 working 
days before the meeting. Separate resolutions are proposed for each matter including the adoption of the 
Report and Accounts, the approval of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the appointment of the Group’s external auditor. Proxy votes are counted and the meeting 
is advised of the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution. The chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination committees and the remaining non-executive directors are normally 
available to answer questions. Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the 
meeting.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management. 
However it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The principal risks faced by the Company and the measures taken to address 
these risks are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 24 to 29.
In conjunction with the Company’s senior management team, the executive directors regularly identify, 
review and evaluate the key risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in 
place to mitigate these risks. The results of these reviews are recorded in a formal document which sets 
out a detailed evaluation of each risk and the associated internal control in place to mitigate that risk. The 
document is reported to the Audit Committee and the Company’s external auditor for review at least once 
per year. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 43
The Board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the Company (including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management) and the principal risks which the Company 
faces during the year. No material weaknesses in internal controls were identified during the year. 
The disclosures regarding internal controls do not encompass the Company’s investment in the associate 
Opus Energy Group Limited.

INTRODUCTION
The Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia (Chairman of the Committee), Julian Schild and 
Charles Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) (provision B.2.1).
The key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:
•  making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new non-executive and executive directors, 
including making recommendations as to the composition of the Board generally and the balance 
between executive and non-executive directors;
•  giving consideration to succession planning for directors and other senior executives;
•  reviewing on an annual basis the time required from non-executive directors and assessing whether the 
non-executive directors are spending enough time to fulfil their duties;
•  reviewing the re-election by shareholders of directors under the annual re-election provisions of the Code; 
and
•  evaluating any matters relating to the continuation in office of any director including the suspension or 
termination of service of an executive director.
THE COMMITTEE’S ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
Recruitment of new Chief Financial Officer
During the year Chris Houghton, the Company’s former Finance Director, resigned from the Board and the 
Committee was therefore instructed to seek a replacement. The Committee commissioned executive search 
consultants Korn Ferry in London to present a shortlist of potential candidates. Korn Ferry was instructed 
to identify candidates from as wide a pool as possible with an emphasis on ensuring that the Company’s 
approach to recruitment, namely that candidates from a wide range of backgrounds should be considered 
and that due regard be given to the benefits of diversity on the Board, was adhered to.
The key criteria against which the candidates were selected are set out below:
•  strategic vision and commercial awareness;
•  intellectual ability;
•  previous financial experience within large companies; and
•  previous experience of leading finance functions through periods of growth.
The recruitment process principally comprised an initial selection round conducted by Korn Ferry. A small 
number of candidates were then interviewed by the members of the Committee and the Chief Executive. 
The Committee assessed the results of the interviews and recommended to the Board that the strongest 
candidate, Mr Nick Schoenfeld, be appointed as Chief Financial Officer.
Mr Schoenfeld was, since 2006, Group Finance Director of Hanover Acceptances, a substantial diversified 
private company with holdings in the food manufacturing, real estate, and agribusiness sectors. He was 
previously employed at Kingfisher plc, where he was responsible for the group’s financial planning and

analysis functions. Prior to this, he held senior strategic and development roles within Castorama and the 
Walt Disney Company, having started his career as a management consultant at the Boston Consulting 
Group. Mr Schoenfeld also has an MBA from the Harvard Business School.
Other activities
The Committee met informally on a number of occasions during the year and Committee matters were 
also discussed formally as part of certain full Board meetings. Consistent with the requirement of the 
Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Committee has been implementing its plan for 
independent non-executive director succession in the near future, to reflect the long service of both Michael 
Pavia and Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in late 2006. The Committee is in the 
process of identifying potential non-executive candidates for appointment to the Board in the short term.
Other discussions concerning Committee matters during the year principally related to the appropriateness 
of the composition of the Board in the light of the Company’s existing operations and medium-term strategic 
objectives, and succession planning for directors and senior management. Aside from the position in 
relation to independent non-executive directors set out above, no other changes to the Board were deemed 
necessary during the year. 
The Committee’s position in relation to diversity and the Code requirement to set out any measurable 
objectives that exist in this regard is included in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 40 of this 
document.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The Audit Committee (“the Committee”) comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael 
Pavia (Chairman of the Committee), Julian Schild and Melvin Lawson in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) (provision C.3.1). Michael Pavia is also identified as having recent and 
relevant financial experience. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Attendance at Committee meetings during the current year by Committee members is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 38 of this document. In accordance with best practice, the 
Committee has the opportunity, as required, to meet with the external auditor of the Company without the 
presence of any executive directors and has done so during the current year. 
The key responsibilities of the Committee include:
•  reviewing the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and the direction of the 
external auditor to investigate any matters of particular concern;
•  assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s external auditor, including considering the scope and results 
of the annual audit; 
•  reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and assessing any potential impact on 
objectivity resulting from the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor;
•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and any formal announcements 
relating to the Company’s performance; and
•  reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and other internal control and risk management 
processes.
The senior management team and executive directors periodically review the effectiveness of key internal 
control and risk management processes within the Company and report any changes in such activities to 
the Audit Committee and the external auditor for consideration. The review covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls. 
THE COMMITTEE’S ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
External Auditor 
During the year, whilst the Committee remained satisfied with the performance of the Company’s existing 
auditor BDO LLP (“BDO”), it was decided to put the external audit contract out to tender. 
BDO had been the Company’s auditor since March 2013 following its merger with PKF (UK) LLP (“PKF”) 
who had been in place as the Company’s auditor since its inception in 1996. The Committee’s decision 
to conduct a tender was principally driven by the awareness that certain shareholders did not view the 
merger of PKF and BDO as constituting a change of auditor which would absolve the Company from the 
requirement to tender its external audit contract.
In addition, the Committee was increasingly mindful of the regulatory focus on mandatory auditor rotation 
following the recent EU Audit Directive and specifically on the existing requirements for publicly listed  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 47
companies to put their audit contracts out for tender more regularly. In particular the Committee noted the 
requirement in the Corporate Governance Code and the Competition and Markets Authority Order, for 
FTSE 350 companies to tender their external audit contract at least every ten years. 
As such, the Committee recommended to the Board that the external audit contract be put out to tender 
during the year. The tender process was conducted during January and concluded in mid February. A total 
of five audit firms, including the existing auditor BDO, were invited to submit a formal document outlining 
their proposed approach to the audit of the Company. The five firms were principally selected based on 
their credentials in the markets within which the Company operates and their experience of auditing large 
publicly listed companies.
The five firms were asked to submit a structured written proposal to the Committee covering the following areas:
•  detailed proposed audit plan and timeline;
•  proposed approach to communication with the Finance Team and Audit Committee;
•  critique of the Company’s prior year Annual Report;
•  analysis of any key specific audit risks identified;
•  a detailed auditor transition plan;
•  credentials in the markets within which the Company operates;
•  client references in relation to the proposed lead audit partner; and
•  proposed audit fees.
The five firms were also invited to spend time with the executive directors of the Company in order to 
further their understanding of the business and they were also granted access to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. This enabled the firms to tailor fully their proposals to the Committee.
The Committee reviewed the written proposals received and selected three firms to present formally to the 
full Board of the Company. The three firms were principally selected based on the quality of their written 
proposals submitted and the demonstration therein of a good initial understanding of the Company’s 
operations and a detailed understanding of the markets within which it operates.
All three prospective audit firms invited to present performed well and demonstrated a deep understanding 
of the Company’s markets and the audit approach required for large publicly listed companies. The high 
quality of all three pitches presented the Committee with a difficult decision. However, after a thorough 
analysis of the three firms, the Committee decided to recommend to the Board the appointment of KPMG 
LLP (“KPMG”) as auditor of the Company. The Committee determined that the key differentiating factor in 
favour of KPMG was the highly tailored nature of their presentation and in particular the significant level of 
detailed practical specification in the proposed audit plan.
Other activities
The Committee’s other main activities during the year included a review of the financial statements involving 
a detailed evaluation of the significant accounting issues therein.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 48
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED
The actions taken by the Committee in regard to these issues are described in the table below. 
ISSUE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE
Operational accuracy of billing system Review of internal analysis and external auditor 
procedures.
Monitoring of regulator communications (Ofgem, BABT) 
and monthly monitoring of detailed call centre statistics 
which would indicate significant billing issues.
Revenue recognition and associated unbilled energy 
revenues
Review of key assumptions underlying the recoverability 
of unbilled energy revenues based on internal analysis. 
Review of the adjustments required as a result of 
the restatement detailed in Note 22 of the financial 
statements.
Valuation of intangible assets Review of key assumptions underlying the value and 
recoverability of the intangible asset relating to the new 
energy supply agreements entered into with Npower in 
December 2013.
Risk of management override of internal controls Review of significant accounting estimates and 
judgements in relation mainly to receivables balances.
Also, in conjunction with the Company’s external auditor, the Audit Committee has considered, amongst 
other matters, compliance with the provisions of the Code and accounting developments, the Company’s 
financial control environment and its risk management and control processes. As part of this process the 
Audit Committee has also considered the need for any special projects or internal investigations and 
concluded that no such additional projects or investigations have been required. 
In accordance with the Code (provision C.3.5), the Audit Committee has also considered the need for 
an internal audit function at the Company. In the light of the simplicity of the Group structure, its single 
country focus, its relatively straightforward financial model, the internal controls in place and the fact that 
management and the Board conduct regular financial reviews, the Committee has recommended to the Board 
that an internal audit function is not currently appropriate for the business. This decision will be kept under 
regular review and where appropriate extended assurance will also be sought in specific areas of concern. 
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s half year and annual  
financial statements. The Committee advised the Board that the annual report and accounts taken as a 
whole provide a fair, balanced and understandable picture of the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS
The Company’s new external auditor, KPMG, presented a detailed audit report to the Audit Committee 
following a review of the annual financial statements. Having regard to its review of the work performed by 
the external auditor during the year and its approach to key audit issues, the Audit Committee was satisfied 
with the effectiveness of KPMG in its first year as external auditor.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 49
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee assessed:
•  the approach of the audit team to the transition from BDO;
•  the efficiency with which the audit team was able to understand the Company and its systems and processes;
•  the experience and expertise of the audit team;
•  the scope and eventual fulfilment of the detailed audit plan;
•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the audit team in their handling of key accounting and audit 
judgements; and
•  the nature and quality of the content of the external auditor’s report.
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board, for approval by shareholders at the AGM, the 
reappointment of KPMG as the Company’s external auditor for the coming year. 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE 
In order to guard against the objectivity and independence of the external auditor being compromised, the 
provision of any significant additional services aside from audit and tax compliance remains subject to the 
prior approval of the Audit Committee. The Committee would normally be likely to prohibit the provision of 
the following types of non-audit related work by the Company’s external auditor:
•  book-keeping and work relating to the preparation of accounting records and financial statements  
that will ultimately be subject to external audit;
•  financial information system design and implementation; 
•  appraisal or valuation services in respect of material assets;
•  inter nal auditing;
•  investment advice or corporate broking; and
•  any other work where mutual interests exist that could compromise the independence of the external auditor.
It is also currently envisaged that in accordance with best practice, tax compliance advice will not be 
awarded to the external auditor.
REPORTING OF STAFF CONCERNS
The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Michael Pavia, is the primary point of contact for staff of the 
Company to raise, in confidence, concerns they may have over possible improprieties, financial or 
otherwise. All employees have been notified of this arrangement on the Company’s intranet website which 
sets out Michael Pavia’s contact details (Code provision C.3.4). No such matters were raised by employees 
during the current year.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to provide an introduction to the Remuneration Committee report which appears on pages 
51 to 71. There have been no material changes to the Remuneration Policy which was approved by 
shareholders’ at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. However, the Committee continues to keep the Policy 
under review to ensure that it remains appropriate to the Company’s circumstances.
It is important that remuneration packages are competitive but not excessive. Accordingly, we would not 
expect total remuneration to fall within the upper quartile relative to comparable organisations over the 
long term. 
The Committee reviews executive directors’ salaries annually. Charles Wigoder received an increase of 
13.5% to £420,000 per annum largely to compensate for the cessation of company pension contributions 
after reaching the limit of lifetime allowance under current HMRC rules. After consulting research on current 
salary levels amongst FTSE 250 chief executives the Committee awarded Andrew Lindsay an increase of 
16.7% to £455,000 per annum. Both gentlemen will receive the Company’s standard increase of 1.5% for 
the year to 31 March 2016.
Nick Schoenfeld joined the Board on 7 January 2015 as Chief Financial Officer following a thorough 
search using independent consultants. We are confident, therefore, that his salary of £400,000 per annum 
represents a fair reflection of current market conditions.
At present executive directors do not receive annual bonuses in either cash or shares. The Committee’s 
view is that the grant of market price share incentives at periodic intervals provides long term commonality 
of interest between executives and shareholders. In line with current practice, such grants are valued for 
illustrative purposes in the accounts at one-third of face value although in reality at date of grant their 
economic value is much lower.
Andrew Lindsay was granted options over 300,000 shares at £13.37 vesting in three tranches over seven 
years. The Remuneration Committee believes that the length of exercise period is sufficient to deal with any 
claw back issues that may arise.
Nick Schoenfeld was granted options over 300,000 shares at £12.62 on his appointment. In the light 
of recent events, and to ensure that his compensation fairly reflects future performance, the Remuneration 
Committee, exceptionally, intends to reissue these options following the announcement of the 2015 results. 
Finally, I should like to thank our shareholders for their support and constructive engagement over the  
past year.

REMUNERATION POLICY
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations 
to the Board regarding the policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the executive directors and 
members of senior management of the Company. It meets regularly to review and set all elements of the 
remuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the 
level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company. It also exercises all the 
powers of the Board in relation to the operation of the Company’s share incentive schemes, including the 
grant of options and the terms of those grants.
The Committee met formally five times during the year and details of attendance at this meeting are 
provided in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 38.
The Committee’s principal activities during the year included:
•  reviewing and approving executive remuneration packages, including for the new Chief Financial Officer;
•  monitoring senior management remuneration packages;
•  reviewing and approving the issue of share options to the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, certain 
employees and independent distributors of the Company; and
•  determining the performance conditions attached to the issue of share options.
REMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION
The Company’s overall remuneration policy remains to ensure that the executive directors and other senior 
managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall long term 
performance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and 
retain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company. 
The Company’s current remuneration policy is based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors 
and senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders, and this is 
predominantly achieved through the use of share incentive plans. The Remuneration Committee currently 
believes that share incentive awards granted at market value provide a far more transparent method by 
which to align directly each director’s interests with all shareholders when compared to the payment of 
regular annual cash bonuses based on short-term performance measures and/or the granting of ‘free’ 
shares with little or no downside risk to the participant. In the light of the focus on share incentive awards 
rather than cash bonuses the Remuneration Committee believes it continues to be appropriate to grant 
meaningful share awards in blocks rather than using a phased approach as set out in the Corporate 
Governance Code.
The outstanding awards made under share incentive schemes prior to the approval of the Company’s 
remuneration policy at the AGM in July 2014 were broadly consistent with that policy and, for the 
avoidance of doubt, will remain in place until exercise. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 52
REMUNERATION POLICY
CONTINUED 
The remuneration policy described in this part of the report was prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium–sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended in August 2013). The policy was duly approved by the Company’s 
shareholders at the AGM on 15 July 2014 and it is intended to apply for the three years beginning on 
that date. However, the Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy annually to ensure it 
remains appropriate for the Company’s requirements and consistent with market practice. The Committee 
determined that no amendments to the policy were required during the current year.

N/A
CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Committee chose the performance measures described in the table above as these are deemed to 
align directly the executive directors’ interests with those of all shareholders in an easily understood and 
transparent manner. 
The performance measures comprise a combination of relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’), Adjusted 
EPS (excluding share incentive scheme charges and amortisation of intangible assets) and service number 
growth measures. Adjusted EPS is considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company 
if it is to drive profitable growth in each year. It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers 
shareholder value creation and reflects market expectations of future performance, and absolute service 
number growth which, when achieved responsibly, will also drive long-term value creation. 
The use of relative TSR and Adjusted EPS growth measures provides a combined focus on the Company’s 
financial performance and shareholder value creation. Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to 
internal budgeting plans and external market expectations. TSR targets are set on a standard practice, 
median to upper quartile ranking range. Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of 
performance.
The Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future 
grants to directors should this be required in order to reflect appropriately the strategic responsibilities of 
the particular director concerned. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 56

ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration 
policy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance. For the purposes of the illustration 
the values assume the maximum grant of share incentive awards during the year and no annual cash 
bonuses are paid. However, as outlined in the above table, the Remuneration Committee reserves the 
right to bring or carry forward any unused annual share incentive scheme allowances. Therefore, share 
incentives might not be awarded during a particular year, and/or share incentive awards may be larger 
than 200% of base salary in any one year. 
The amounts included for share incentive awards are based on one third of the market value of the shares 
under option, although the awards have no realisable value inherent at the date of grant. The amounts for 
pensions and benefits included in the fixed remuneration figure have been calculated on the same basis as 
payments made for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The potential rewards available for ‘on–target’ performance under share incentive schemes have been 
based on 30% vesting of share incentive awards. 
All performance measures or targets for share incentive scheme awards relate to more than one  
financial year.

with which the office is held 
ceases to be a member of 
the Group or the transfer

cessation of employment.
If a participant ceases to be employed 
within the Group otherwise than as 
a “good leaver”, no unvested share 
options held shall be exercisable 
after the date of such cessation unless 
the Remuneration Committee in its 
absolute discretion (provided that such 
discretion must be exercised fairly 
and reasonably) so decides but for a 
period of not more than 12 months from 
the date of cessation. The Committee 
considers it unlikely that such discretion 
would be used in the event of a 
participant ceasing to be employed by 
the Company as a “bad leaver”. 
In relation to unvested awards made 
under the Joint Share Ownership Plan 
(“JSOP”) for a “good leaver”, the 
Remuneration Committee will specify 
the extent to which such awards should 
vest having regard to the length of time 
since the award was acquired and the

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee’s approach to recruitment is to pay a sufficient amount necessary to attract the best 
candidates to the particular role. In determining these amounts the Committee will be mindful of, inter 
alia, prevailing market rates, the chosen candidate’s skills, knowledge and experience, and their existing 
location and position.
Where the candidate has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost 
on leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the value 
foregone, either as an award under an existing share incentive scheme or a bespoke award under the 
Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose. The face and/or expected values of the award(s) offered 
will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award(s) foregone, and would normally follow the same 
vesting timing and form (i.e. cash or shares) save that the Committee may award the whole of the value 
in shares, at its discretion. The application of performance conditions would be considered and, where 
appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back in certain circumstances. For material amounts 
the Committee would, where practicable, consult with key institutional shareholders ahead of committing 
to make any such sign-on awards, and in any event a full explanation of any amounts awarded, an 
explanation of why it was necessary and a breakdown of the awards to be made will be announced to the 
markets at the time of granting. For the avoidance of doubt, should a new director be internally promoted 
from the Company’s senior management team they will not be expected to give up or amend any element 
of remuneration granted to them prior to becoming a director which is inconsistent with the remuneration 
policy set out above.
Any new executive director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the 
same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as outlined in the above policy table.

STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Chairman of the Committee engages with certain of the Company’s largest shareholders who have 
expressed an interest in being consulted in relation to remuneration matters to understand their expectations 
and monitor any changes in their views. 
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Committee considers pay levels across the organisation when setting remuneration for all directors 
(both executives and non-executives). However this review is undertaken against a background of ensuring 
that the prevailing market rates for all levels of employee in the organisation are taken into account in order 
to attract, retain and motivate the best employees at each level. In relation to directors, specific account 
is taken of any change in the level of responsibility of the director (whether through a change in role or 
the increased size of the Company) or an increase in experience and knowledge of the Company and its 
markets which may not be relevant to roles elsewhere in the Company. 
The Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination 
of the directors’ remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all 
employees, i.e. the payment of a base salary, benefits and share incentive scheme awards at market price. 
However, employees have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect of the Company’s activities 
through an employee survey and any comments made which are relevant to directors’ remuneration would 
be considered by the Committee.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 and Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium–Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended 
in August 2013) (“the Regulations”), has been approved by the Board of directors for submission to 
shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The sections under the headings 
“Single Total Figure of Remuneration”, parts of “Share Incentive Schemes” and “Pension Schemes” have 
been subject to external audit.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION
The Committee recommended increases to the annual base salaries of Executive Chairman Charles 
Wigoder and Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay during the year. 
Mr Wigoder received an increase of 13.5% to £420,000 per annum. This increase primarily reflected  
the fact that the Company would no longer be making pension contributions on behalf of Mr Wigoder as 
he reached the limit of the lifetime allowance for pension contributions under current HMRC rules during  
the year. 
Mr Lindsay received an increase of 16.7% to £455,000 per annum reflecting his strong personal 
performance and the incremental responsibility resulting from the significant increase in the size and 
profile of the Company during the previous year following the entering into of the new energy supply 
arrangements with Npower in December 2013. 
Nick Schoenfeld joined the Board on 7 January 2015 as Chief Financial Officer with a base salary of 
£400,000 per annum. In determining the level of Mr Schoenfeld’s base salary the Committee was mindful 
of the need to attract a high calibre candidate through an open-market recruitment process who would 
successfully contribute to driving the Company through the next stage of its development. 
In addition, share options with performance conditions attached were issued to Mr Lindsay and Mr 
Schoenfeld during the year, details of which are set out below in this report.
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below. The 
level of these fees was unchanged during the year.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 62

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 63
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES 
The Company has two share option plans and a Joint Share Ownership Plan (the “JSOP”). The first share 
option plan and the JSOP are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the 
Company’s independent distributors.
The Employee Share Option Plan
Subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the 
Company, the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.
The Committee recognises that the collective contribution of all employees is critical to the success of the 
Company and continues to believe that the granting of share options at all levels within the organisation 
generates employee loyalty and helps to ensure that staff turnover is kept to a minimum and below the 
levels seen across the industry for employees passing their probationary periods.
The Joint Share Ownership Plan
Awards made through the JSOP provide participants with a joint interest in tranches of shares which are held 
until vesting by an independent employee benefit trust (the “JSOP Share Trust”). The trustee of the JSOP Share 
Trust is Barclays Wealth Trustees (Guernsey) Limited. The value to participants of awards made under the JSOP 
is based upon the growth in the value of the Company’s shares from the date of grant in a similar manner to 
the value achieved through participation in the conventional share option scheme. However, participants in the 
JSOP only receive value to the extent that the share price increase exceeds a compound annual growth rate 
of at least five per cent (the “Hurdle Rate”). On vesting, participants receive any gain over the Hurdle Rate on 
the tranche of shares in which they hold a joint interest, with all the gain below the Hurdle Rate being retained 
by the JSOP Share Trust. In addition, awards made under the JSOP to executive directors will only vest to the 
extent applicable performance conditions relating to the financial and trading performance of the Company 
are met. It is currently considered unlikely by the Committee that further awards will be made under the JSOP .
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those 
distributors who have been most successful in gathering new Members for the Company. These distributors, 
whilst not being employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future growth, and it is the 
opinion of the Committee that this plan can in some cases be an important factor in their motivation. 
During the year options were issued to 36 distributors under a share option promotion scheme which 
requires the participants to achieve performance conditions in order for the options to vest. These 
performance conditions will involve distributors consistently gathering Members throughout the three-year 
vesting periods of the options.
Statement of Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests (audited)
Details of the directors’ shareholdings are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 72. As set out in the Future 
Remuneration Policy Table of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, a target level of share ownership is not 
stipulated for directors, however, subject to personal circumstances and existing shareholdings they are 
encouraged to retain a proportion of shares issued as a result of the exercise of share incentive awards. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 64

Mr Andrew Lindsay
The award of a joint interest in 500,000 shares made to Mr Lindsay on 31 March 2011 under the JSOP 
(“the JSOP Share Award”) was made subject to performance conditions which were described in detail in 
the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2011. The performance conditions in relation to the JSOP 
award were all fully achieved as at 31 March 2015 and therefore Mr Lindsay at the time of exercise will 
receive any increase in value of the 500,000 shares over the share price on the date of grant (£4.55) plus 
an annual compound growth rate of five per cent. 
The table below sets out the compound annual growth rates that were required to be achieved during the 
vesting period across the three performance conditions.

The average annual EPS growth achieved during the vesting period was 13.0%, the average annual TSR 
growth 21.1% and the average annual Service number growth 15.9%. The total unrealised gain in relation 
to the JSOP award as at 31 March 2015 was therefore approximately £1.7m being the increase in value 
of the 500,000 shares over the 553p exercise price given the closing share price on 31 March 2015 of 
888.22p. In practice had Mr Lindsay been in a position to exercise his right under the JSOP on 31 March 
2015, 188,703 shares would have been transferred to Mr Lindsay in settlement of the JSOP Share Award.
A further 300,000 share options were awarded to Mr Lindsay on 1 July 2014 under the terms of the 
Employee Share Option Scheme. These options will vest in three discrete tranches of 100,000 options 
over three, five and seven year periods, each representing shares with a face value of £1.3m equating to 
approximately 294% of Mr Lindsay’s annual base salary. However, it should be noted that as market price 
options their value to Mr Lindsay rests solely on the increase in the Company’s share price from the point 
of grant. In accordance with guidance in the FRC’s Lab Project Report: Reporting of pay and performance 
issued in March 2013, the value of market price share options can be measured as one third of the market 
value of the shares under option. The value of each tranche of these options granted to Mr Lindsay under 
this measure would therefore represent approximately 98% of his annual base salary. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 66

The extent to which these options will vest will depend on the average growth, weighted 40% by reference 
to adjusted EPS growth, 40% by reference to relative TSR growth and 20% by reference to service number

Mr Nick Schoenfeld
Options over 300,000 ordinary shares were granted to new Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld on 
his appointment to the Board on 7 January 2015 under the terms of the Employee Share Option Scheme. 
These options will vest in five discrete tranches over three, four, five, six and seven year periods as set out 
in the table above. The largest tranche of options represents shares with a face value of £1.3m equating to 
approximately 315% of Mr Schoenfeld’s annual base salary. However, it should be noted that as market 
price options their value to Mr Schoenfeld rests solely on the increase in the Company’s share price from 
the point of grant. In accordance with guidance in the FRC’s Lab Project Report: Reporting of pay and 
performance issued in March 2013, the value of market price share options can be measured as one third 
of the market value of the shares under option. The value of these options granted to Mr Schoenfeld under 
this measure would therefore represent approximately 105% of his annual base salary for the year. Under 
this measure the value of each of the other four tranches of options represents approximately 53% of Mr 
Schoenfeld’s annual base salary. 
However, in the light of the fall in the Company’s share price following the release of the Trading Update 
on 16 April 2015, which set out details of certain issues related to historical accounting estimates pre-
dating Mr Schoenfeld’s appointment to the Board, the Committee has decided to cancel the options issued 
to Mr Schoenfeld on 7 January 2015 and proposes to re-issue a similar number of options to him following 
the announcement of the Company’s results for the year ended 31 March 2015. It is expected that the new 
award will comprise market value options over 300,000 shares and will follow the same vesting profile as 
the cancelled options issued to Mr Schoenfeld on 7 January 2015. The new options will be made subject to 
performance conditions which will be broadly similar to the structure of those attached to the options issued 
to Andrew Lindsay on 1 July 2014 described above.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Mr Chris Houghton
The share options granted to former Finance Director Chris Houghton on 10 December 2008 and 26 June 
2009 were fully exercised on 4 August 2014. In accordance with the rules of the Employee Share Option 
Plan, the Company elected to satisfy the exercise of 91,200 of these options by transferring 71,521 shares 
to Mr Houghton, representing the value of the gain made on these options at the prevailing market price 
for the shares. Following the exercise of these options, Mr Houghton sold 71,521 Ordinary Shares on 4 
August 2014 at 1400p per share. 
In addition to the above transactions, on 4 August 2014 Mr Houghton also exercised the remaining options 
over the 8,800 shares and acquired the shares at an exercise price of 340p per share. 
The 50,000 options issued to Mr Houghton on 26 June 2012 and 50,000 on 16 December 2013 lapsed 
without being exercised on 3 October 2014 as a result of Mr Houghton leaving the Board of the Company.
At the year end the Company’s share price was 888.22p and the range during the financial year was 
888.22p to 1790.20p. Details of all the directors’ interests in the shares of the Company are set out in the 
table in the Directors’ Report on page 72.
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS OF SERVICE 
There are Service Contracts or Letters of Appointment for Charles Wigoder (5 May 2011), Andrew Lindsay

The following graph shows the Company’s performance measured by total shareholder return compared 
with the performance of the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index and the FTSE 350 for the period 1 
April 2010 to 31 March 2015. As noted in previous years, the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index 
was initially selected at a time when a larger proportion of the Company’s revenues related to the supply 
of telephony services; only approximately 16% of the Company’s revenues are now generated from such 
telephony services. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 68

The Company’s pay review for the year ended 31 March 2015 which took effect on 1 April 2014 
awarded average percentage increases in salaries to employees of 2.0%. The size of the increase 
awarded to Mr Lindsay reflected his strong personal performance and the incremental responsibility 
resulting from the significant increase in the size and profile of the Company during the previous year 
following the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013. In 
addition the Committee was mindful of the prevailing market rates for remuneration packages of Chief 
Executives at similarly-sized companies. At other levels within the Company increases of a comparable 
relative proportion to Mr Lindsay’s were made where appropriate to similarly reflect increases in 
responsibility for certain individuals.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PAY
The Regulations require an illustration of the significance of the Company’s expenditure on pay in the 
context of its operations. Set out below is a summary of the Company’s levels of expenditure on pay and

STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR
Base Salaries
The Committee recommended that increases to the base salaries of the executive directors for the 
forthcoming year ended 31 March 2016, with effect from 1 April 2015, be made as described below.
Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder’s annual base salary was increased from £420,000 to £426,300, 
the annual base salary of Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay was increased from £455,000 to £461,825, 
and Nick Schoenfeld the new Chief Financial Officer was increased from £400,000 to £406,000,  
these increases broadly reflecting the average increase in the base salaries of the majority of the 
Company’s employees. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 70
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
CONTINUED
Share Incentive Schemes
Following the recent fall in the share price, the Committee feels that it is important to ensure that employees 
and distributors at all levels remain motivated and committed to the Company. It therefore believes that 
it is in the best interests of the Company to offer all employees and distributors with existing options that 
currently have an exercise price above the current market price the chance to have their existing options 
cancelled and to receive new options in their place. The maximum number of options that could therefore 
be cancelled and replaced is 712,950 (excluding the 300,000 share options being reissued to the new 
Chief Financial Officer as set out above). Irrespective of when the original options were granted, none 
of these replacement options will be exercisable earlier than three years from the new date of grant, thus 
helping to retain the employees concerned.
Full details of the proposed award will be set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016.
Other benefits
Directors’ remuneration in relation to pension contributions and other benefits for the year will be made in 
accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
SHAREHOLDER VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
As set out in the Remuneration Policy, the Committee encourages dialogue with the Company’s major 
shareholders regarding remuneration matters and will endeavour to consult with these shareholders ahead 
of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.
Details of the votes cast in relation to the remuneration policy and report at last year’s AGM are set out below:
2014 AGM %
To approve the Remuneration Policy
Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 36,373,789 79.76
Votes cast against 9,230,504 20.24
Total 45,604,293 100.00
To approve the 2014 Remuneration Report
Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 43,226,678 98.71
Votes cast against 563,317 1.29
Total 43,789,995 100.00
In addition to the above there were 838,888 votes withheld in relation to the approval of the Remuneration 
Policy and 2,653,186 votes withheld in relation to the approval of the 2014 Remuneration Report. 
The Committee understands that a significant factor in relation to the relatively high number of votes cast 
against the Remuneration Policy related to concerns raised around the flexibility perceived to be inherent 
in the policy itself, particularly in relation to there being no specific upper award limit in place for share 
incentive scheme awards in any one year.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 71
The Committee recognises that the Remuneration Policy allows for larger one-off share incentive scheme 
awards than might normally be expected. However, the Committee would like to take the opportunity to 
reassure shareholders of its intention to use this inherent flexibility only after the careful consideration of 
shareholders’ best interests. The Committee would also like to highlight that whilst individual awards to 
directors in any one year might be considered large, unlike other listed companies, there is no expectation 
that awards will be made automatically on an annual basis. Furthermore, awards made will typically 
have longer than normal vesting periods of up to seven years. As has been offered in previous years, the 
Chairman of the Committee would be pleased to meet with shareholders to discuss any particular issues 
and discuss the Committee’s overall approach to remuneration. Shareholders are also able to attend the 
Company’s AGM in order to ask any questions they have around remuneration and other matters.
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Committee acknowledges the new requirement set out in the Corporate Governance Code issued by 
the FRC in September 2014 (“the new Code”) for companies to put in place arrangements that will enable 
them to recover or withhold variable pay when appropriate to do so. The new Code applies to accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014. 
The Committee does not currently propose to amend the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at 
the last AGM within the three year period of application originally envisaged in order to reflect these new 
requirements. Nonetheless, the Committee will remain mindful of the requirements of the new Code in this 
area when making future share incentive awards to directors. It is therefore likely that provisions to withhold 
or recover such share incentives in the event of fraud or malus committed by the director concerned will be 
included in the terms of such awards in future.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The directors have pleasure in presenting their report and the audited financial statements for the year to  
31 March 2015.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW
A full review of the development of the business is contained in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 34. A 
summary of the financial risk management objectives and policies is contained in note 19 to the financial 
statements. 
This Directors’ Report, together with the information in the Strategic Report forms the management report for 
the purposes of DTR 4.1.8R.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The profit for the year after tax of £32,301,000 (2014: £27,463,000) has been transferred to reserves. 
An interim dividend of 19p per share (2014: 16p) was paid during the year. A final dividend of 21p per 
share (2014: 19p per share) is proposed. 
On 16 April 2015 the Board announced that it expected adjusted profit before tax to be between £52 
million to £53 million for the year ended 31 March 2015. The actual adjusted profit before tax for the year 
ended 31 March 2015 was £52.2 million.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 73
Following the year end, and ahead of the commencement of the Company’s closed period, certain of the 
directors acquired further shares in the Company. The purchases were made on 16 April 2015 at a price 
of 800.75p per share as follows: (i) Charles Wigoder 46,875 shares; (ii) Julian Schild 31,250 shares; (iii) 
Nick Schoenfeld 6,250 shares; (iv) Melvin Lawson 46,875 shares; and (v) Michael Pavia 10,000 shares. 
The shares acquired remain held by the directors as at 22 June 2015.
The powers of Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”). The Articles 
may be amended by way of a special resolution of the members of the Company. The Board may exercise 
all powers conferred on it by the Articles and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, and other 
applicable legislation.
The Board has established a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the selection and subsequent 
appointment of new directors to the Board. The rules relating to the appointment and replacement of 
directors are contained within the Articles. The Articles provide that Directors may be appointed by an 
ordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Directors, provided that, in the latter instance, 
a director appointed in that way retires at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment. In 
addition, shareholders with in excess of 20% of the shares in the Company, as is currently the case for Mr 
Wigoder, are entitled under the Articles to appoint a director and remove any such director appointed. 
In accordance with current best practice, all Board directors will be retiring at the forthcoming AGM and 
will then offer themselves for re-election.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Companies Act 2006 and 
the Company’s Articles allow the Board to authorise such conflicts of interest should this be deemed to be 
appropriate.
The Board has put in place effective procedures for managing and, where appropriate, approving 
conflicts or potential conflicts of interest. Under these procedures, the Directors are required to declare 
all directorships or other appointments to companies which are not part of the Group, as well as other 
situations which could give rise to a potential conflict. The Board will, where appropriate, authorise a 
conflict or potential conflict, and will impose all necessary restrictions and/or conditions where it sees fit. 
The Company maintains a register of directors’ interests which is reviewed regularly by the Board.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
The Company maintains appropriate insurance to cover directors’ and officers’ liability and has provided 
an indemnity, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006, in respect of all of the Company’s directors which 
was in force throughout the financial year and remains in force. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity 
provides cover where a director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

Restrictions on the transfer of shares
The Company only has ordinary shares in issue. Other than as set out below, there are no restrictions 
on the transfer of the ordinary shares, except where a holder refuses to comply with a statutory notice 
requesting details of those who have an interest and the extent of their interest in a particular holding of 
shares. In such cases, where the identified shares make up 0.25% or more of the ordinary shares in issue, 
the directors may refuse to register a transfer of any of the identified shares in certificated form and, so far 
as permitted by the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, a transfer of any of the identified shares 
which are held in the electronic share dealing system CREST, unless the directors are satisfied that they have 
been sold outright to an independent third party.
Other than as set out below and so far as the directors are aware, there were no arrangements at 31 
March 2015 by which, with the Company’s co-operation, financial rights carried by securities are held 
by a person other than a holder of securities, or any arrangements between holders of securities that are 
known to the Company and which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder entered into an agreement to charge 325,000 of his shares in the 
Company as security for a loan from Barclays Bank on 3 December 2013. The loan enabled him to apply 
for 57,142 ordinary shares as part of his open offer entitlement which resulted from funding the Company’s 
entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on 20 December 2013. Under the terms 
of the charge, title to the 325,000 shares can be transferred, sold or otherwise dealt with by Barclays 
following the occurrence of a failure to pay any amount due and payable under the loan. 
In addition, certain members of senior management have loans secured against some or all of their 
shareholdings in the Company which restrict their ability to transfer these shares prior to repayment of the loans.
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan (“the JSOP”) on 30 March 2011. As part of the 
JSOP an employee benefit trust was established to jointly hold shares with the participants in the plan (“the 
JSOP Share Trust”). As at 31 March 2015 the JSOP Share Trust jointly held 500,000 shares with the Chief 
Executive, Mr Andrew Lindsay. Prior to vesting, all voting and dividend rights attached to these shares have 
been waived. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 75
Takeovers
There are no significant arrangements to which the Company is party that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, save in relation to the arrangements 
with Npower and EE (formerly T-Mobile) for the supply of energy and mobile telephony respectively, or 
any agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss 
of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.
Authority for purchase of own shares
At the last AGM held on 15 July 2014, the Company obtained authority to purchase up to 8,002,465 
ordinary shares representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) as at 6 June 2014. The Company intends to renew this authority at this year’s AGM. 
During the year the Company made the following purchases of ordinary shares on the London Stock 
Exchange:
•  On 20 June 2014 12,500 ordinary shares were purchased at 1322 pence per share and 7,500 were 
purchased at 1332 pence per share;
•  On 3 July 2014 20,000 ordinary shares were purchased at 1243 pence per share; and
•  On 10 July 2014 10,000 ordinary shares were purchased at 1200 pence per share, 7,000 at 1190 
pence per share and 3,000 were purchased at 1195 pence per share.
These shares were purchased to be held in treasury.
Treasury shares
The Company held 60,000 ordinary shares in treasury as at 31 March 2015 (2014: Nil).
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Each of the directors has confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware, and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company’s position in relation to compliance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
37 to 43.
GOING CONCERN 
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 34. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 76
Review on pages 18 to 23 and within notes 12 and 19 to the financial statements. In addition, notes 15 
and 19 include the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower 
continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of 
energy to the Company’s Members. This includes funding the Budget Plans of Members who pay for their 
energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
The Group has from Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) total working capital credit facilities of £35 million for 
the period to 20 December 2017. In addition the Group has a transaction loan facility of £70 million with 
Barclays which was fully drawn down at the year end. 
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small 
business membership base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks.
On this basis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The annual financial statements have therefore 
been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the FRC’s Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: 
Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued in October 2009.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the group and company and of the profit or loss for the group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare a director’s report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
WEBSITE PUBLICATION
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are published on the company’s website in accordance with legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may 
vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is 
the responsibility of the directors. The directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
financial statements contained therein.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES PURSUANT TO DTR4
The directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
•  the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Group; and
•  the annual report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
financial position of the Group and the parent company, together with a description or the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 78
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF  
TELECOM PLUS PLC ONLY 
OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC for the year ended 31 March 2015 set out 
on pages 83 to 124. In our opinion: 
•  the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
•  the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Financial Statements the risks of material misstatement that 
had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows:
REVENUE RECOGNITION (£729.2 million)
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee report), pages 90 and 91 (accounting policy) and pages 96 and 97 
(financial disclosures)
THE RISK THE RESPONSE
Revenue recognised in relation to the supply of gas and 
electricity includes estimates of the value of the energy 
supplied to customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the year end. 
The method of estimating such revenues is complex and 
judgemental, requiring estimates and assumptions to be 
made to assess the volume of energy supplied, which is 
sensitive to a number of factors, one of which includes 
any volatility in weather patterns. 
The risk of misstatement is that the accounting for the 
Group’s estimated revenues does not appropriately reflect 
the underlying actual delivery of gas and electricity and 
as a result revenues may be misstated. 
In this area our audit procedures included:
•  we assessed the appropriateness of the revenue 
recognition through comparison with relevant accounting 
standards and industry practice; 
•  we analysed the accuracy of the estimates made by the 
billing system for a sample of customers by comparing 
actual usage, obtained from meter readings, with the 
billing system generated estimated usage for the same 
period;
•  for a sample of customers, we agreed the meter 
readings, including those taken after the year end, used 
as the key inputs in assessing the estimation accuracy 
back to source documentation; 
•  we tested the Group’s controls over revenue recognition 
including reconciliations between the billing system, cash 
receipts and the general ledger; and
•  we also considered whether the critical accounting 
estimates, judgements and assumptions, and accounting 
policy disclosures properly reflect the judgements and 
estimates inherent in recognising revenue. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 80
VALUATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS (£209.6 million)
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee report), pages 90 and 93 (accounting policy) and page 101 (financial 
disclosures)
THE RISK THE RESPONSE
An intangible asset is held on the Group’s balance 
sheet at amortised cost, representing an energy supply 
agreement to supply gas and electricity to the Group. 
The recoverability of the intangible asset is subject 
to judgement in terms of the assumptions used in the 
Group’s discounted cash flow forecasts. Energy prices 
are volatile, and there are high levels of competition in 
the energy supply market, leading to changing market 
conditions. These factors increase the risk of error in the 
Group’s assumptions and therefore increase the risk of 
impairment.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting 
and discounting future cash flows, which are the basis 
of the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the key 
judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on.
In this area our audit procedures included:
•  assessing the appropriateness of the design and 
implementation of the Group’s discounted cash flow 
model;
•  comparing actual performance for the year against 
forecasts in the model for the same period; 
•  evaluating the Group’s assumptions included within the 
discounted cash flow forecasts by comparing key inputs 
such as projected growth, cost inflation and discount 
rates to internally and externally derived data; 
•  performing sensitivity analysis on the assumptions; and
•  assessing the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £2.0 million, determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax of £42.1 million, of which it represents 4.75%.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.1 
million, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s four components we subjected the three significant components to audits for group reporting 
purposes, performed by the group audit team, using component materialities which ranged from £0.7 
million to £1.5 million.
The remaining component, an equity accounted investment, was subject to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures by the group audit team.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the group’s results:

  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 89
GENERAL INFORMATION
Telecom Plus PLC (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2015 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in associates. 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 22 June 2015. 
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As a result of the relative size and volatility of the cash-settled share incentive scheme charges it has been 
decided to separately disclose the amounts on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. During the current period, as a result of the significant fall in the Company’s share price, the 
share incentive scheme charge has become a credit due to the required revaluation of certain share 
incentives at year end. Separate disclosure was therefore deemed appropriate in order to provide a clearer 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of intangible assets has 
also been separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the 
period. More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Statement of compliance 
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
(b) Basis of preparation 
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis. The Board has decided to restate the Group’s 
historical accounts to reflect the impact of a write-down of an unbilled energy debtor previously carried on 
the Group’s balance sheet. Further detail regarding the restatement is set out in note 22.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have made 
judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future. The judgements, estimations, and assumptions 
that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In future, actual 
results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 90
(b) Basis of preparation (continued)
(i) Revenue recognition
Revenue relating to the sale of energy includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to 
customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This will have been estimated by 
using historical consumption patterns, prevailing weather data and other industry information. 
Whilst the estimation routines are currently considered appropriate, a significant change in historical 
consumption patterns and/or a failure to maintain the accuracy of the estimation routines could impact 
the amount of revenue recognised.
(ii) Intangible assets
The Group intangible assets relate to the entering into of the energy supply arrangements with Npower 
on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited 
and Gas Plus Supply Limited from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013. The valuation 
of intangible assets represents a significant area of judgment as certain key assumptions are required in 
relation to the future financial performance of the assets. Further detail regarding intangible assets is set 
out in notes 6 and 21. 
(iii) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter, 
or are in the process of having such a meter installed. This requires the Directors to make estimates and 
judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on historical 
experience. While the provisions are currently considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis 
or in economic and regulatory conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded and 
consequently on the charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
(iv) Share incentive scheme charges 
The Group has a conventional share option scheme and a Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”) for 
employees and Directors. The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Binomial valuation 
model on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. The fair value of JSOP awards is also 
estimated using the Binomial valuation model, however, as a cash-settled award the valuation is 
conducted at each reporting period end. The assumptions used in the valuations are described in note 
18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of the options and 
number of options expected to vest. 
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of 
comprehensive income. The Company made a profit for the year of £31,464,000 (2014: £13,938,000).
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Company during the current 
accounting period, but where relevant to the Company they have not had a material impact on the financial 
statements: 
• IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011);
• IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011);
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements; 
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements; and
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.

(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries 
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its 
subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are 
included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them. 
Control is recognised where an investor is expected to receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
investment in the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the relevant 
activities of the investee. Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
(ii) Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary 
nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the 
equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the 
consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an 
associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised.
(d) Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for in accordance with the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (“IFRS 3”). An analysis of whether any subsidiaries acquired constitute businesses in their 
own right is initially undertaken with reference to the guidance in IFRS 3. 
Where an acquired subsidiary does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 (i.e. it does not have, inter alia, 
the inputs, processes and outputs to function on a standalone basis) the acquisition of the subsidiary is 
treated as an acquisition of assets. The assets acquired are recorded at cost and no goodwill is recognised. 
Transaction costs are capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition.
Where an acquired subsidiary constitutes a business under IFRS 3, the assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the fair 
value of consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
(e) Revenue
Overview
Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors 
excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes. For each of the Group’s main income streams 
from the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, 
transactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of 
goods takes place. The Group’s customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services 
are provided. 
The Group also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and accidental death 
cover to customers for a monthly fee. The Group does not retain the insurance risk for these services. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 92
(e) Revenue (continued)
Revenue recognition – Energy services
The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services to customers by 
the Group relies on estimates of usage where meter readings are not available. These estimates are 
based on historical usage information adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather. Revenue 
is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and any unbilled revenue is accrued 
at each period end.
Revenue recognition – Telephony services
The Group principally generates revenue from providing the following telecommunications services: (i) 
fixed telephony line rental, call and broadband data charges; and (ii) mobile telephony call and data 
charges, and mobile handset sales. Revenue is recognised during the period in which the services are 
supplied and any unbilled revenue is accrued at each period end. Revenue for mobile handset sales are 
recognised when the devices are delivered to the end customer and the sale is considered complete.
Revenue recognition – Other services
The Group also generates revenues from providing Members with bill protection cover, and CashBack 
cards. In addition the Group generates revenues from providing services to its network of independent 
distributors. Revenue is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and any unbilled 
revenue is accrued at each period end. 
(f) Interest income
Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective 
interest rate method.
(g) Leases
Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.
(h) Hire purchase agreements
Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases. When assets are leased out 
under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
(i) Taxation
The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of  
previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 93
(j) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated 
so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected 
useful lives. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided on other assets at the 
following rates:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Freehold and leasehold improvements 3 to 25 years
Plant and machinery 15 years
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment
- Fixtures and fittings
- Computer and office equipment
7 to 10 years
3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an 
indication that they may be impaired.
(k) Intangible assets
Intangible assets which arise (e.g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements) 
are capitalised and amortised over the shorter of their useful life and the term of any contractual 
arrangement or, where appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment 
review.
(l) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the fair value 
of consideration and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to 
impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. 
(m) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.
(n) Investments
In the Company’s accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated 
at cost. Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments. In the Group accounts 
investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends 
received from the associated undertakings.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 94
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
(o) Inventories
Inventories principally include mobile telephones and other electronic equipment and are valued at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution.
(p) Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, 
a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a 
financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
(q) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the 
short credit period is not considered to be material.
(r) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the 
Cash Flow Statement, revolving credit facilities.
(s) Borrowings
Short and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans. The fees associated 
with entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over 
the term of the borrowings.
(t) Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting 
future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
(u) Share based payments
The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated 
using a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period of the award. The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest. All share option based remuneration is equity 
settled, except as set out below. 
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan (the “JSOP”) on 30 March 2011. On vesting, 
any gains made on awards granted under the JSOP may be settled at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee either through: (i) a cash payment to the participant equal to the gain; or (ii) the transfer of legal 
and beneficial ownership to the participant of such number of shares as have full value equal to the gain. 
JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a 
binomial pricing model. The fair value is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, 
and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 95
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
(v) Segmental reporting
Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the 
chief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
(w) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
(x) Pensions
The Group makes contributions to certain employees’ personal pension plans. These are charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
(y) Dividends
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
(z) New standards issued but not yet effective
The Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation 
dates. It is not expected that adoption of the standards or interpretations which have been issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU, but have not been adopted, will have a 
material impact on the financial statements.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 96
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. SEGMENT REPORTING 
The Group’s reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised:
• Customer Acquisition; and
• Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues represent joining fees from the Group’s distributors, the sale of marketing 
materials and sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers. Customer 
Management revenues are principally derived from the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, 
electricity and internet services to residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, which 
is referred to as operating profit. The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across both 
operating segments.

Carrying amount
At 31 March 209,592 220,778 
The Group intangible assets primarily relate to the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements 
with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus 
Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited (“the Companies”) from Npower Limited having effect from 1 
December 2013 (“the Transaction”).  
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a payment to Npower of £196.5 million on 20 
December 2013, a deferred amount of £21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a payment of 
£2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash 
and short term working capital balances.
The addition to intangible assets of £221.6 million in 2014 therefore represented the total consideration 
paid and payable to Npower, excluding the payment for net assets acquired in the Companies, plus 
certain transaction costs of £3.6 million which in accordance with the relevant accounting standards were 
recognised as a cost of acquisition. 
The intangible asset is being amortised evenly over the 20 year life of the new energy supply agreement 
reflecting the period over which the Company will benefit from the agreement.
The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of the intangible assets. A review was undertaken at 
31 March 2015 to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets was supported by their value 
in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow 
projections based on current levels of profitability. 
A post-tax discount rate of 8.5% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the 
expectation that, for term of the contract and beyond, the Group will continue to derive significant value 
from supplying energy to its customers.  The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2015 indicated 
that no impairment was necessary.  No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the 
impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of intangible assets.
Further information regarding the energy supply arrangements is set out in note 21 of these financial 
statements.

Goodwill is attributable wholly to the Customer Management operating segment and comprises assets 
relating to the Company’s subsidiary Telecommunications Management Limited (“TML”). 
The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill. A review was undertaken at 31 March 
2015 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by 
the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on 
current levels of profitability. 
A post-tax discount rate of 10% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the 
expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue to operate as a going concern. The result of 
the review undertaken at 31 March 2015 indicated that no impairment was necessary. No reasonably 
possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment  
of goodwill.

The Group entered into total bank loan facilities of £125 million during the year ended 31 March 2014, 
comprising a transaction facility of £100 million (“the Transaction Facility”) which was fully drawn down as 
at 31 March 2014 and working capital facilities of £25 million (“the Working Capital Facilities”) of which 
£Nil were drawn down as at 31 March 2014. The Transaction Facility was divided into two tranches: 
(i) Term Loan A of £70 million repayable by 20 December 2016; and (ii) Term Loan B of £30 million 
repayable by 20 December 2015. 
In July 2014 the Group restructured the Transaction Facility which involved the early repayment of Term 
Loan B and extending the maturity and repayment dates of Term Loan A. An extension to the Working 
Capital Facilities up to £35 million was also agreed, with an additional £5 million for December 2014 to 
February 2015.
The Transaction Facility is now only comprised of Term Loan A of £70,000,000 repayable by 20 
December 2017. Interest is charged in accordance with the schedule set out in the table below. As at 31 
March 2015 the interest rate was LIBOR + 1.85%.

12. INTEREST BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)
The Working Capital Facilities carry interest at the same rate as Term Loan A and are repayable by 20 
December 2017. Any elements of the Working Capital Facilities which are used for the purposes of letters 
of credit carry interest at only the margin over three month LIBOR in accordance with the interest schedule 
for Term Loan A.
All bank loans are secured through a floating charge on the assets of the Group.
The Transaction Facility is stated net of unamortised arrangement fees of £927,000 (2014: £980,000) on 
the face of the Balance sheet. These costs have been capitalised and are being amortised over the term of 
the Transaction Facility. 
In addition, as at 31 March 2015 the Company had letters of credit in place relating to certain energy 
distribution charges with a total value covered of £12,023,500 (2014: £11,787,500).

15. CAPITAL AND RESERVES (CONTINUED) 
The Group’s current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day 
operating requirements. In addition, as a result of the entering the energy supply arrangements with 
Npower in December 2013, and the consequent drawdown of transaction debt facilities, the Group’s 
capital management strategy is also to ensure that interest costs are minimised and that the schedule for 
repayment of the debt can be comfortably achieved.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower 
continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of 
energy to the Company’s customers. This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their 
energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.

as at 31 March 2015. This dividend will be subject to income tax at each recipient’s individual marginal 
income tax rate.

Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of the intangible asset 
recognised as a result of the new energy supply arrangements entered into with Npower in December 2013.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments (“IFRS 2”), awards made under the Company’s JSOP 
share incentive scheme are deemed to be cash-settled. On vesting, any gains made on awards granted 
under the JSOP may be settled at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee either through: (i) a cash 
payment to the participant equal to the gain; or (ii) the transfer of legal and beneficial ownership to the 
participant of such number of shares as have full value equal to the gain. In line with IAS 33 for EPS 
purposes it is assumed the gains will be settled in shares and it has therefore been deemed appropriate to 
present the above analysis of earnings per share as adjusted for share incentive scheme charges. In the 
current year the share incentive charge relating to the JSOP was a credit of approximately £2,573,000 
(2014: charge of approximately £3,395,000). 
It has also been deemed appropriate to present the analysis of adjusted earnings per share excluding the 
amortisation of intangible assets arising from the energy supply agreement with Npower in order to present 
a clearer picture of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

Amounts payable: 
Less than one year 91 183
Between one and five years 248 251

The principal lease arrangements relate to office premises.
Capital commitments
At 31 March 2015 the Company had capital commitments of approximately £2,481,000 (2014: 
£7,675,000) relating mainly to items in respect of the refurbishment of Merit House, the Group’s new 
head office building, the acquisition of a small office building previously occupied by the Group and the 
acquisition of the licence for the source code of the software underlying the Group’s billing system.
Energy supply arrangements
The Group entered into a 20 year energy supply agreement with Npower (“the SSA”) on 20 December 2013. 
In the event that the SSA is terminated by Npower in certain circumstances, including on a material breach by 
the Group or on the insolvency of the Company, additional consideration of up to £194 million may become 
payable by the Company to Npower. Full details of the termination provisions of the SSA were set out in 
paragraph 4 of Part VIII on page 38 of the prospectus issued to shareholders on 20 November 2013. 
However, given the energy supply agreement termination rights are either, in the directors’ view, very 
unlikely to occur or entirely within the control of the Group, the directors believe the likelihood of this type 
of termination event is remote. 
The amount of the additional consideration reduces from £194 million to £11 million over the remaining 
life of the supply agreement. Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination 
event, the additional consideration (if payable) may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply 
agreement. Following any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale 
energy markets and the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Group’s 
customer base.

18. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS      
The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to distributors 
of the Company.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with market price options 
over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their 
seniority and length of service (“The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan”). 
The distributor scheme (“The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan”) exists 
to provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company. 
As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit 
received has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
On 30 March 2011 the Company established a new Joint Share Ownership Plan (“The Telecom Plus PLC 
Joint Share Ownership Plan 2011” or “the JSOP”). Under the terms of the JSOP 500,000 shares were 
issued to an Employee Benefit Trust (“the JSOP Share Trust”) administered by Barclays Wealth (Guernsey) 
Limited, which holds the shares jointly with the only current participant, Mr Lindsay. The JSOP Share Trust 
was provided with an interest free loan from the Company to subscribe for the 500,000 shares, and 
therefore the transaction was cash flow neutral for the Company. 
As set out in note (u) of the Significant Accounting Policies, JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled 
and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model. The fair value liability is 
charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the 
award. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value 
of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the amortisation charge in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value liability of the JSOP award of 335p 
per share as at 31 March 2015: a strike price of 553p per share, a share price of 888p as at 31 March 
2015, expected volatility of 39.0%, an expected remaining life of 1 day, a risk free rate of 0.34% and an 
expected dividend yield of 4.5%.

19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board. They 
are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest 
rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments
All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified 
as loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of £158,593,000 (2014: £202,268,000) and 
for the Company of £46,008,000 (2014: £66,172,000). All financial liabilities, which include trade and 
other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 
£227,546,000 (2014: £251,835,000) and for the Company £143,488,000 (2014: £149,317,000).
Credit risk 
All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit; accordingly credit risk 
in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of 
whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue. 
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. 
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new 
customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone 
who submits a properly completed application form. Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for 
the energy they have used (“delinquent customers”), there is likely to be a delay before the Company 
is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter 
or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from 
increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable. 
The Group has identified specific balances for which it has provided an impairment allowance on a line by line 
basis across all ledgers, in both years. No general impairment allowance has been provided in either year.
The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the 
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered 
irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.
The maximum credit risk for the Group is £158,593,000 (2014: £202,268,000) and for the Company 
£46,008,000 (2014: £66,365,000).
Interest rate risk 
The Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business. Cash 
surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns. 
The Group’s profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK 
base rate of +/- 1% from current levels despite the increase in the level of net borrowings resulting from the 
transaction with Npower in December 2013. 
Commodity price risk
The Group is not materially exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the 
agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of 
any such fluctuations through to its customers.

19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Liquidity risk
The Group’s treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities
All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling. Receivables due after one year include 
£3,971,000 (2014: £4,242,000) due mainly from distributors which earns interest at variable rates above 
Base Rate. 
Borrowing facilities 
At 31 March 2015, the Group had total working capital facilities of £35,000,000 (2014: £25,000,000). 
These facilities are available to the Group until 20 December 2017. As at 31 March 2015 the Company 
had letters of credit in place relating to certain energy distribution charges with a total value covered of 
£12,023,500 (2014: £11,787,500).
At 31 March 2015, the Group had a transaction loan facility of £70,000,000 (2014: £100,000,000) 
which was fully drawn down. 
The facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Company and through a 
cross guarantee with the Company’s subsidiaries Electricity Plus Supply Limited, Gas Plus Supply Limited 
and Telecommunications Management Limited. Further details of the facilities are set out in note 12 of these 
financial statements.
Fair values
There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments 
and their net book amount due to the short term maturity of the instruments.

21. ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
The Company entered into new energy supply arrangements with Npower through the acquisition of 
Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited (“the Companies”) from Npower Limited on 20 
December 2013 (“the Transaction”). The Transaction had economic effect from 1 December 2013. 
The accounting treatment for the Transaction was considered against the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (“IFRS 3”).
It was determined that the acquisition of the Companies did not represent business combinations under 
IFRS 3 as both Companies did not have the three key elements of a standalone business as set out in IFRS 3 
(i.e. inputs, processes and outputs). The principal factors behind this determination were as follows: (i) the 
Companies were originally set up solely as legal vehicles to facilitate the supply of energy to Telecom Plus 
customers by Npower; (ii) all customer relationships were acquired, held and managed by Telecom Plus; 
(iii) the Companies did not have any influence over the terms on which energy was supplied to them; (iv) 
the Companies were not able to influence who their customers were and had no pricing discretion for the 
onward supply of energy; (v) the Companies did not have any infrastructure, management or employees 
with all functions being carried out by either Telecom Plus or Npower; and (vi) given the unique nature of 
the Companies and the associated energy supply agreement between Telecom Plus and Npower, it was not 
considered feasible that another market participant could effectively acquire and operate the Companies on 
a standalone basis.
As a result of these factors the acquisition of the Companies was accounted for as an acquisition of assets 
rather than as business combinations. 
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a cash payment to Npower of £196.5 million on 
20 December 2013, a deferred cash amount of £21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a 
cash payment of £2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which 
comprised cash and short term working capital balances. 
Summary balance sheets for the Companies as at 30 November 2013, adjusted for the payment of 
pre-disposal permitted dividends to Npower Limited on 11 December 2013 (Gas Plus Supply Limited: 
£1,378,000 and Electricity Plus Supply Limited: £1,876,000), are set out below:

22. PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENT
A detailed review was recently conducted of the unbilled energy debtor previously carried on the Group’s 
balance sheet and which had accumulated over the seven years between April 2007 and March 2014. 
As a result of this review it was concluded that a total of approximately £11 million (net of an anticipated 
tax credit), was not likely to be recoverable. This primarily related to higher levels of industry-wide leakage 
within the gas distribution network than had previously been anticipated. 
Background
In common with other domestic energy suppliers, the majority of the Group’s customer energy invoices are 
prepared using estimated meter readings, as actual meter readings are rarely available on the date that 
bills are produced. This gives rise to timing differences between the estimated volumes of energy invoiced 
to customers, and the actual volume of energy invoiced to the Group by energy industry system operators, 
which contribute to the unbilled energy debtor carried forward on the Group balance sheet.
A detailed assessment was recently undertaken of the accuracy of the estimates created by the Group’s billing 
system and the recoverability of the unbilled energy debtor. This review of current and historic meter reading 
data that existed at each balance sheet date provided a strong endorsement of the accuracy of the Group’s 
billing system in calculating customer usage, but showed that overall leakage within the gas industry (which is 
ultimately not billable to customers) had been running at a higher rate than previously expected. 
It was therefore decided to write down the unbilled gas energy debtor to bring its value in line with the 
amount expected to be recoverable.

22. PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENT (CONTINUED) 
Restatement
The Board has decided to restate the Group’s accounts to reflect the impact of this write-down on previous 
years in order to provide stakeholders with an accurate reflection of the historic underlying trend in the 
performance of the business. 
Gas
Fully writing down the unbilled gas debtor insofar as it relates to our share of this industry-wide leakage, 
which has built up over the seven years to March 2014 has a negative balance sheet impact as at March 
2014 of £11.0 million (net of the anticipated £1.8 million tax credit).
Electricity
As a result of the more sophisticated way in which wholesale costs are reconciled to actual customer meter 
readings by electricity industry system operators, the net negative balance sheet impact as at March 2014 
from the restatement relating to Electricity is limited to £0.3 million. This impact relates solely to providing 
accurately for timing differences.
The tables below set out the impact of the restatement on each line item affected in the prior year

Annual Report 2007
CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
Overview
2007 was another successful year for our growing 
company. The Board remained focused on executing 
the Company’s strategy of creating shareholder 
value through the de-risking of the Company’s Indian 
exploration portfolio, whilst continuing production from 
its development assets.
The year commenced with the announcement of the Ganesha discovery on 
the Hardy-operated CY-OS/2 exploration block on the east coast of India.  
This was followed by the announcement in May of the Dhirubhai 33 gas 
discovery on the GS-01 exploration block on the west coast of India.
The Company completed a further placing of new Ordinary Shares in June 
raising over $40.2 million to fund our ongoing capital programme at  
423 pence per share.
2008 has also started well, with the recent announcements of two 
consecutive discoveries on the D3 exploration block on the east coast 
of India and the expansion of the Company’s exploration portfolio with 
the granting of a petroleum exploration licence for the AS-ONN-2000/1 
onshore block in Assam, India.
“Our exploration success 
in India underpins 
our strategy to create 
shareholder value through 
high impact exploration 
interests and mitigating 
risk through appropriate 
partnerships.”
E. P. Mortimer
Chairman 5 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
Corporate
During the year, the Board took the decision to move the listing of Hardy’s 
shares from AIM to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange’s market 
for listed securities (‘Main Market’). The admission of Hardy’s shares to 
the Main Market should assist in increasing the profile and liquidity of the 
Company’s Ordinary Shares whilst increasing access to capital to fund its 
future exploration and development expenditures.
Hardy’s shares began trading on the Main Market on 20 February 2008 
and with effect from 26 March 2008 Hardy’s shares have been included in 
the FTSE 250 index.
The senior executive team has been strengthened with the appointment 
of Mr Dinesh Dattani in July 2007 as Finance Director. Mr Dattani’s strong 
financial background in the upstream oil and gas industry provides greater 
balance to the executive team. We will continue to look for appropriate 
additions to strengthen the Board and the senior management team.
Outlook
We will continue to work closely with the Ministry of Petroleum and key 
industry groups, in connection with the Government of India’s recent 
intervention in gas pricing and proposed modification to the tax holiday,  
to help ensure that our interests and those of all operators in India  
are protected.
Over the past decade the oil and gas industry in India, in partnership with 
the Government, has invested heavily in various midstream and upstream 
projects. In 2008, the first gas production from the Reliance Industries 
Limited (Reliance) operated D6 block adjacent to the Company’s D9 
block in the Krishna Godavari basin will commence . This will significantly 
increase the supply of gas into the energy-constrained Indian market.  
The infrastructure and market development associated with this east  
coast domestic gas supply augurs well for the rapid exploration and 
development of the D3 and D9 blocks in the Krishna Godavari basin,  
in which Hardy has an interest.
The Board looks to the balance of 2008 with great anticipation. In 2008, 
the Company is planning for the largest drilling programme in its history, 
with six exploration wells and up to two appraisal wells. Our asset base 
has also increased in India with the addition of the Assam block providing 
further long-term growth potential. The Company is in excellent shape and 
we are enthusiastic about the year ahead.
E. P. Mortimer
Chairman  
9 April 2008
“We have made an encouraging 
start to 2008 with the moving 
of our share listing to the Main 
Market of the London Stock 
Exchange and two discoveries  
on the D3 block. “ “The Company will 
continue to focus on 
organic growth as our 
primary strategy to create 
shareholder value.”

6 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
Summary of the Year
2007 was a landmark year for Hardy. In India,  
our discovery on CY-OS/2 block (Ganesha) has 
increased the Company’s Contingent Resource 
inventory, which will be further appraised in the  
latter part of 2008 and early 2009 with the  
drilling of three wells on the Fan-A discovery.
The announced discovery of Dhirubhai 33 on the GS-01 block, with 
our partner Reliance, also contributed to the growth of our Contingent 
Resource inventory. An appraisal programme has been proposed by the 
operator and is currently under review by the joint venture. Drilling of an 
additional three exploration wells will commence in the second quarter  
of 2008 targeting several other independent prospects.
The recent KGV-D3-A1 (Dhirubhai 39) and KGV-D3-B1 (Dhirubhai 41) 
gas discoveries on the D3 block are an encouraging start to evaluating 
the prospectivity of this block. We anticipate that the newly acquired 3D 
seismic data will identify further drilling prospects as we complete the full 
evaluation of the block.
Key Financial Results
Revenue in 2007 , as anticipated, decreased to $1 1.8 million in 2007 
compared to $21.3 million in 2006. This was due to several factors 
including the expected increase in the Government of India’s profit  
oil share, a decrease in production levels and an increase in closing 
inventory. Net profit was $8.3 million compared to $10.2 million in  
2006. The Company also realised a gain of $10.2 million from the  
sale of shares in Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited (HOEC).
Diluted earnings per share were $0.1 3 in 2007 compared to $0.1 7 for 
2006. We anticipate that earnings will continue to fall in 2008 as PY -3 
operating and administrative costs have increased while production from 
PY -3 will decline from 2007 levels.
The active drilling programme in 2007 resulted in capital expenditure  
of $32.2 million compared with $51 .6 million in 2006.
At the end of 2007 , the Company had cash reserves of $31.2 million.  
In 2007 , the Company raised $40.2 million through a placing of 5,009,541 
Ordinary Shares. The Company participated in an HOEC rights issue and 
also partially liquidated its investment in HOEC resulting in a net addition 
to cash resources of $7 .4 million during January 2008.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 7 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
India
In 2007 the major focus of the Company was on the Hardy-operated 
assets, CY-OS/2 exploration licence and PY-3 production block.
PY-3 – Production from the PY-3 field was lower than expected in 2007 
due to the shut-in of the PY-3-3RL well in August 2007 . The drilling of two 
additional wells (Phase III) is on-track but additional production from this 
drilling programme is not expected until 2009.
CY-OS/2 – The Fan-A1 well discovery (Ganesha) was announced at the 
beginning of the year and the focus quickly turned to evaluating results 
and, subsequently, submitting an appraisal programme to the CY-OS/2 
joint venture. The additional geological and geophysical work, along with 
well planning, remains a focus of the Group as we move into 2008. We are 
considering farming-out a portion of our interest to be more consistent 
with the risk profile of the Company’s other exploration assets.
Results on our non-operated exploration assets have also been encouraging 
as we continue to pursue our strategy of de-risking this portfolio.
GS-01 – The gas discovery in well GS-01-B1 (Dhirubhai 33) was the 
second well to be drilled under this exploration licence. The operator has 
submitted an appraisal programme which is awaiting approval. A further 
three exploration wells are scheduled to commence drilling in the second 
quarter of 2008.
The assets that continue to generate the most interest and anticipation 
are the Company’s Krishna Godavari basin blocks D9 and D3.
D9 – Due to the industry-wide shortage of drilling ships capable of 
operating in water depths greater than 2,000 m, delays have been 
experienced on the D9 exploration licence. We anticipate that drilling  
of the first well on the D9 block may commence before the end of 2008.
D3 – The drilling phase on D3 began much sooner than expected 
with the commencement of drilling of the first well at the end of 
2007. Subsequently, we were pleased to announced two successive 
gas discoveries on the block, with encouraging initial testing results 
including an observed flow rate of 38.1 MMscfd. We anticipate that 
the operator will submit an appraisal programme for approval shortly. 
Further drilling on the D3 block is not expected to commence until 
the first quarter of 2009 as the joint venture evaluates the additional 
2,800 km
2
 of 3D seismic acquired in 2007.
Assam – As announced on 3 April 2008, the pursuit of our Indian strategy 
resulted in the award of the Assam onshore petroleum exploration licence 
AS-ONN-2000/1. We are also delighted with the Company’s continued 
partnership with Reliance. This is the fourth block that Hardy holds in 
partnership with Reliance and the Company’s first onshore asset in India. 
The block provides further long-term potential to create significant 
shareholder value.
Nigeria
We observed several key milestones with respect to our Nigerian operations.
Oza – Hardy was able to conduct its first full field operation with the well 
flow test of Oza-4. The initial results are positive and, more importantly,  
the operator received cooperation and support from the local 
communities. We have established open channels of dialogue with all 
stakeholders in the Oza communities and we look for this to continue as  
we move towards initial field development in the latter part of 2008.
As announced on 3 April 2008 the Company entered into an agreement 
to farm-out a 20 per cent interest in the Oza block to Emerald Energy 
Resources Limited (Emerald). Emerald has agreed to assume Hardy’s 
financial obligations in the funding of the Oza field initial development 
programme.
Atala – Securing the necessary equipment for the planned re-entry 
operating in Atala continues to be difficult. The Company’s Nigerian 
management team have been working closely with a consortium of 
swamp operators. This group has several options available to them and we 
anticipate that greater clarity on the timing of operation will be achieved 
in 2008.
2008 Programme
We are looking forward to an active 2008 with the following plan of work:
+ GS-01 – Drilling of three exploration wells 
+ D3 – Processing and interpretation of acquired 3D seismic data
+  D3 – Submission of appraisal programme for Dhirubhai 39 and  
41 discovery
+  CY-OS/2 – Commencement of appraisal drilling to assess  
Ganesha discovery
+ D9 – Commencement of exploration drilling programme
+ Assam – Acquisition of 350 line km of 2D seismic data
+ Oza – Commence field development operations.
The Company will continue to focus on organic growth as our primary 
strategy to create shareholder value. The NELP rounds have become 
increasingly competitive; however, they still offer the most direct way  
of acquiring exploration acreage in India.
Staff
The accomplishments of 2007 would not have been possible without  
the dedication of the Company’s staff in India, Nigeria and London, UK.  
The India team continues to drive the core of our business. The Nigerian 
team have reached a key milestone in 2007 despite challenging conditions. 
The corporate team in London, along with the India team in Chennai,  
were instrumental in the efficient execution of the Main Market listing.  
I would like to take this moment to recognise them all for their efforts  
in the past year.

REVIEW OF OPERA TIONS
Review of Operations
At the beginning of 2007 , the Company planned to drill three exploration 
wells, conduct a production test of two wells in Oza, and acquire 3,288 km
2
 
of 3D seismic data. At the end of 2007 , the Company had participated in 
the drilling of three exploration wells, the production testing of one well 
and the acquisition of 2,800 km
2
 of 3D seismic data.
During 2007 , and as part of the process of moving the Company to the 
Main Market, an independent report was prepared for the Company by 
Gaffney, Cline & Associates Ltd (GCA) on the reserves and resources 
inventory of the Company. As at 30 June 2007 , GCA estimated 2.69 million 
barrels of Proved plus Probable (2P) net entitlement reserves in the  
PY-3 field.
The Company’s operations in India are conducted through its wholly 
owned subsidiary Hardy Exploration & Production (India) Inc. (HEPI).  
The Company’s operations in Nigeria are conducted through its wholly 
owned subsidiary Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited (HON).
CAUVERY BASIN – Eastern India
Block CY -OS 90/1 (PY -3): Producing Oil Field
(Hardy 1 8% interest – Operator)
Production
Actual gross field production for the year ended 31 December 2007 
was 4,150 stbd (2006: 5,81 1 stbd). The production facilities’ uptime 
performance was 96.8 per cent (2006: 96.7 per cent). The decrease in 
production was attributable to the seizure of the PY3-3 RL well, due to 
water loading, in August 2007 and the failure of the Endeavor’s (FSO) 
mooring system in December 2007 (resulting in 1 1 days’ shut-in).
The production forecast for 2008 is 2,700 stbd, reflecting the expected 
continued natural decline of the field. In 2008, around 10 days’ downtime 
is anticipated due to the need to carry out underwater inspection and 
maintenance work on Normor Buoy (SPM) to comply with ABS certification 
requirements. Increase in PY -3 production is not anticipated until 2009.
For the year ended 31 December 2007 , the average water injection rate 
was 5,800 bwpd (2006: 6,678 bwpd) which, at current production levels, 
is sufficient to maintain voidage replacement. Injection facilities’ uptime 
performance was 86.8 per cent (2006: 96.7 per cent). The reduction in 
uptime was attributable to the scheduled plant shutdown in March 2007 
for further underwater inspection and for rectifying the FSO forward 
mooring system in December 2007 .
“The exploration drilling 
programme on the  
D3 block commenced earlier 
than expected, with the 
KGV-D3-A1 well, which  
has resulted in the first 
discovery on this licence 
named Dhirubhai 39.”

Chief Operating Officer 9 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
Operations
The PY -3 field joint venture has approved a $90.0 million Phase III 
development programme which provides for the drilling of two additional 
lateral wells (one producer and one injector) and various gathering lines 
and facility upgrades. The Company has issued a request for tender for 
long-lead items such as subsea trees and flow lines.
In order to identify a suitable production facility for the operation of 
the PY-3 field beyond July 2009, Hardy commissioned a Conceptual 
Field Design study that was undertaken by ODE Ltd, UK. Based on the 
recommendations obtained from the ODE study, further investigations  
are in progress to select a suitable production facility.
Background
The PY-3 field is located off the East Coast of India 80 km south of 
Pondicherry in water depths of between 40 and 200 m. The Cauvery basin 
developed in the late Jurassic/early Cretaceous period and straddles the 
present-day East Coast of India.
The licence, which covers 81 km
2
, is currently the deepest producing 
subsea field in India and produces oil of high quality light crude (49° API). 
The field was developed using floating production facilities and subsea 
wellheads, a first for an offshore field in India.
HEPI is the Operator of the PY-3 field, and the participating interests for 
this licence are as follows:
 HEPI TATA HOEC ONGC
 18% 21% 21% 405
The facility at PY -3 consists of the floating production unit, ‘T ahara’,  
and a 65,000 DWT tanker, ‘Endeavor’, which acts as a floating storage  
and offloading unit. There are four sub-sea wells tied back to Tahara. 
Tahara has a three-stage crude oil separation system, with the first two 
stages being three-phase separators and the third stage a two-phase 
separator. Actual liquid processing capacity on Tahara is 20,000 stbd  
with 1 7 MMscfd of gas handling capacity.
The field currently produces associated gas in the range of 3.5 MMscfd. 
This produced gas is used as fuel gas, with excess gas being flared.  
The stabilised crude oil is pumped from Tahara to Endeavor for storage and 
offloading to shuttle tankers. Crude oil from the PY-3 field is sold to CPCL at 
its refinery in Nagapattinam, approximately 70 km south of the PY-3 field.
CAUVERY BASIN – Eastern India
Block CY -OS/2: Exploration
(Hardy 75% interest – Operator)
Operations
In 2007 HEPI completed the exploration licence’s phase III minimum  
work programme. On 8 January 2007 the Company announced that the 
Fan-A 1 well had discovered hydrocarbons. On 1 0 August 2007 the Company 
announced that it would proceed with an appraisal programme to delineate 
the Cretaceous Fan-A 1 discovery to establish the potential commerciality of 
the Cretaceous with the planned drilling of three further wells.
As part of the appraisal programme a number of geological and 
geophysical studies have been undertaken, including the reprocessing  
of the 3D seismic data covering the block to improve subsurface imaging. 
Special studies such as AVO and inversion are ongoing to improve 
characterisation and delineation of the reservoir.
Analysis of oil and gas crude samples and other well data from the  
Fan-E1 and Fan-A1 wells were also undertaken in 2007 , including 
geochemical studies.
HEPI has recently hired a third party to begin the well planning work and 
to provide well management services and consultation through the entire 
appraisal drilling programme. Subject to rig availability, the drilling portion of 
the appraisal programme is expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The Board is presently considering farming out a portion of its 
participating interest in the licence.
Background
The CY-OS/2 block is located in the northern part of the Cauvery Basin 
immediately offshore from Pondicherry and covers approximately 859 
km

the CY-OS/2 licence at an interest of 30 per cent. 10 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
The PY-3 oil field and PY-1 gas field are both contained within the  
CY-OS/2 licence but have been ring-fenced out, each with a separate PSC.  
The CY-OS/2 exploration licence has been under an approved phase III 
extension which expired at the end of March 2007 . HEPI, as operator of 
the joint venture, has fulfilled the exploration phase III commitment work 
programme of 3D seismic surveys and drilling of two exploratory wells.
GUJARA T -SAURASHTRA BASIN – Western India
Block GS-OSN-2000/1 (GS-01): Exploration
(Hardy 1 0% interest)
Operations
T o date the GS-01 joint venture has drilled two exploration wells on 
the GS-01 block. On 1 5 May 2007 Hardy announced that the second 
exploration well, GS-01-B1, had discovered hydrocarbons in the  
mid-Miocene Limestone (Dhirubhai 33). The exploration well was  
drilled to a depth of 2,282 m MDRT and encountered natural gas and 
condensate within the mid Miocene Limestone over an interval from  
1,988 m to 2,052 m MDRT.
The two intervals selected for cased hole DST were 1,988 m to 1,993 m 
and 2,019 m to 2038 m MDRT respectively. The test produced natural gas 
at a rate of 18.6 MMscfd together with 41 5 stbd of condensate through a 
56/64 “ choke with a flowing tubing head pressure of 1 ,346 psi.
The operator has subsequently proposed an appraisal programme 
involving additional 3D seismic data interpretation, development concept 
studies, reserve assessment and validation, and two contingent appraisal 
wells. The appraisal wells will be dependent on the findings of the 
proposed studies.
The proposed exploration programme for 2008 comprises of the 
acquisition of an additional 1 ,000 km
2
 of 3D seismic data and the drilling 
of three further exploration wells which will meet the phase I work 
commitment for the exploration licence. The 3D seismic acquisition 
programme was completed in March 2008 covering 1,1 65 km
2
 and 
processing and interpretation is expected to be fast-tracked by the 
operator. The three-well drilling programme is expected to commence  
by the end of April 2008.
In 2008, the GS-01 joint venture will be required to elect to proceed to 
phase III of the exploration licence or relinquish the block not covered by 
the appraisal programme. The minimum work programme for phase III 
stipulates the drilling of eight exploration wells.
Background
The GS-01 exploration licence is located in the Gujarat-Saurashtra offshore 
basin, off the west coast of India, directly adjacent to the prolific Bombay 
High oil field. The licence encompasses 8,84 1 km

Operations
As announced by the Company on 13 February 2008, after careful 
consideration of the current equipment shortage and the priority of the 
operator to complete offsetting commercial developments, the Board is  
of the view that drilling on the D9 licence is unlikely to commence until  
the latter part of 2008.
However, as experienced with the D3 licence, windows of availability do 
occur and the Directors will endeavour to ensure that shareholders are 
notified of developments on a timely basis.
During 2007 , the operator continued to interpret and evaluate the  
3D seismic data. PSDM reprocessing 3D seismic data was completed  
and the data is being studied to optimise the selected locations for drilling. 
Sea-bed logging was also conducted and the results provided encouraging 
results with similar indicators observed in the adjacent D6 block.
Background
The licence encompasses 1 1 ,605 km

These leads are areally large structural closures located toward the 
relatively shallower-water north-western corner of the concession,  
for which GIIP of many TCF has been computed by the operator. A fourth 
lead is a Pleistocene channel in the south eastern part of the block which 
is in ultra deep water with a prognosticated GIIP of a similar order of 
magnitude to the other leads.

Annual Report 2007
“Hardy was pleased to announce 
the award of a 1 0% interest in 
the exploration licence AS-ONN-

Initial exploration will be focused upon amplitude anomalies within 
closure in the Miocene and Pliocene rather than a pure structural  
play. There are many seismic anomalies within the block and, given its 
proximity to D6, exploration potential of this large block is regarded  
with considerable optimism.
KRISHNA GODA V ARI BASIN – Eastern India
Block KG-DWN- 2003/1 (D3): Exploration
(Hardy 1 0% interest)
Operations
In 2007 the operator acquired 2,800 km
2
 of 3D seismic data. The D3 joint 
venture has also taken the decision to process and evaluate the acquired 
data prior to acquiring additional data with the intention of modifying the 
acquisition parameters to optimise the data quality.
The exploration drilling programme commenced earlier than expected 
on 28 December 2007 , with the KGV-D3-A1 well which has resulted in the 
first discovery on this licence named Dhirubhai 39. The well was drilled to 
a depth of 1,937 m MDRT and encountered natural gas between 1,51 3 m 
and 1,597 m MDRT with a gross sand thickness of 84 m.
One interval was selected for cased hole DST covering 1,565 m to  
1,585 m MDRT and produced natural gas at a rate of 38.1 MMscfd  
through a 1 20/64 " choke.
The D3 joint venture then moved the rig ‘‘C Kirk Rhein’’ to a second location 
(KGV-D3-B1) to evaluate the Pleistocene and Late to Mid Miocene 
sandstone reservoirs. On 1 April 2008, the Company announced a second 
discovery (Dhirubhai 41) on the D3 block. The well encountered good 
quality reservoirs in the Pleistocene and Miocene formations. MDT tests 
were conducted over several intervals (1,814 to 2,101 m MDRT and 2,1 19 
to 2,463 m MDRT) and confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons. Several 
gas samples were collected over both intervals however, due to poor well 
bore casing integrity, a decision was taken to not conduct a DST and the 
well was plugged and abandoned.
Although early indications are encouraging, the potential extent and 
commerciality of the Dhirubhai 39 and 41 discoveries are yet to be 
established. On 31 March 2008 the operator issued a B-1 notification to 
DGH stating the details of the tests carried out. It is anticipated that the 
operator will submit an appraisal programme for approval in the second 
half of 2008.
Background
In August 2005, Reliance and HEPI were awarded, under NELP V,  
a second licence in the deepwater Krishna Godavari Basin. The D3 licence 
encompasses an area of 3,288 km

(Hardy 1 0% interest)
Operations
On 2 April 2008, Hardy was pleased to announce the award of a 10% 
interest in the exploration licence AS-ONN-2000/1. This is the Group’s first 
onshore block and fourth licence in partnership with Reliance. This block 
was offered in NELP II but commencement of operations had been delayed 
due to the outstanding grant of an onshore petroleum exploration licence 
from the appropriate state agencies.
The proposed 2008 work programme primarily involves the reprocessing 
of the 124 line km (lkm) of existing 2D seismic data. Field operations are 
expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2008 with the acquisition 
of approximately 350 lkm of 2D seismic data. This will meet the phase I 
minimum work programme commitment for the block.
Background
The AS-ONN-2000/1 exploration licence is located in the north eastern 
state of Assam, India, and north of Brahmaputra River. The exploration 
licence covers an area of 5,754 km

Block Oza (OML 1 1): Development
(Hardy 20% interest)
Operations
In November 2007 the Oza joint venture successfully executed a flow  
test of the Oza 4 well. Oil and gas production rates, reservoir pressures  
and crude samples were obtained during the test. This is a significant  
step towards full development of the field. As technical partner,  
HON has worked closely with the operator to design and implement the 
field operation. The flow rates averaged approximately 600 stbd of oil with 
a GOR of 5,466 scf/stb. The operator transported and sold the produced 
fluids without incident.
Millenium Oil and Gas Limited, the operator for Oza field, with inputs from 
HON, continued efforts to obtain additional field data in the field and to 
conclude agreements for crude handling and purchase of Oza 3D seismic 
with Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).
Discussions are ongoing with the operator of an adjacent export facility 
at a near-by flow station. Current discussions suggest that the initial work 
programme will entail the installation of a 9 km multiphase pipeline to 
SPDC’s Isimiri flow station. To comply with the Nigerian government’s 
no-flare initiative, associated gas will need to be exported to an alternative 
facility with a gas export line.
Recently HON has entered into a farm-out agreement with Emerald  
Energy Resources Nigeria Limited (Emerald), a well-known local oil and  
gas company. Under the terms of the farm-out agreements Emerald 
assumes HON’s obligation to fund the initial work programme of the Oza 
field. The capital expenditure is currently estimated at approximately  
$1 5 million. The farm-out is subject to government approval.
Community relations will continue to be a focus of the operator and 
progress is expected in discussions regarding a sustainable agreement 
with the host communities surrounding the Oza field. Emerald has 
extensive experience and expertise in community relations and has 
committed to make available its experienced personnel to the operator.
Background
The Oza Field is located on-land in the north-western part of OML 1 1,  
near Port Harcourt. The concession area is 20 km

approved by the Nigerian Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).
REVIEW OF OPERA TIONS (continued)
“The Oza joint venture successfully 
executed a flow test of the Oza 
4 well. This is a significant step 
towards full development of  
the field.”
The topography of the area is primarily a plain of low relief and there is a 
reasonably established road network across the block. A national highway 
runs parallel to the river Brahmaputra and passes through the block.
Assam foreland constitutes the shelf part of the Assam – Arakan 
intermontane basin. It forms a north-east south-west trending,  
largely alluvium-covered, narrow, linear tract encompassing an area  
of 40,000 km
2.
 The exploration block lies north of Brahmaputra River  
while most of the discovered oilfields in the basin are located south  
of Brahmaputra River over an area of approximately 4,000 km
2
.
Intense exploration activities since 1956 have resulted in the discovery  
of seven major fields which include Naharkatiya, Moran, Rudrasagar, 
Geleki and Lokwa. Most of these fields have reached a mature stage  
of exploration for Mio-Pliocene reservoirs and are in the advanced phase  
of delineation and development.
Very limited seismic data is available only in the eastern-most part of the 
block and suggests the presence of subsurface structure. Different play 
types expected are as follows:

The field has cumulatively produced approximately 1 .0 MMstb from 
four open zones of three wells targeting three reservoirs, M5.0, L9.0 and 
M2.1, with the principal reservoir being M5.0. At present, Oza has three 
suspended wells in the field.
Since taking over the field in 2004, Millenium, along with HON,  
has completed a number of field operations and other studies. The log  
data of existing wells has been re-analysed both internally and through 
third party study to identify potential re-completion targets. There is 
existing 3D seismic data covering the Oza field. Negotiations between 
SPDC and Millenium for the acquisition of this data are ongoing.
NIGER DEL T A BASIN – Nigeria
Block Atala (OML 46): Development
(Hardy 20% interest)
Operations
In 2007 the Atala joint venture continued to struggle to secure the 
appropriate drilling equipment for a planned re-entry and test programme. 
The operator, with the help and support of Hardy, has taken the initiative 
to form a swamp operators group, comprising several companies with 
fields in the swamps to collectively approach potential drilling companies 
with suitable rigs. Meetings were held in the latter half of 2007 and 
potential vendors have been identified.
During 2007 , a field development plan (FDP) report was completed by 
local consultant Eogas with close involvement and inputs from HON.  
The FDP recommends a phased approach, initially focusing on oil 
development with later completion for gas production and based on  
initial production from the two wells, drilling of new oil and gas wells.
Recently the swamp operators group has identified and commenced 
negotiations with several vendors for a swamp barge. It is expected that 
a rig will be identified and a contract negotiated in the latter half of 2008 
and the Atala operations may commence in the first quarter of 2009,  
with the re-entry of Atala-1 well. HON is working closely with the operator 
to finalise the re-entry programme, obtain government approvals, appoint 
a competent company for procurement, logistics and rig management and 
ensure all long lead items are procured in timely fashion. The Atala FDP has 
been presented to the federal government for its approval.
Background
Atala is located within OML 46 which is located in a mangrove swamp on 
the Dodo River, a coastal area of NW Bayelsa State. The concession area 
is 34 km
2
. The Atala field was discovered in 1982 with the drilling of the 
Atala-1 well to a total depth of 4,058 m. Hydrocarbons were encountered 
and the well was cased but not tested or completed. The participating 
interests for this licence are as follows:
 Area HON Millennium Emerald
 Atala 20% 60% 20%
The Atala field is subject to a farm-out agreement between NNPC, SPDC,

of the Atala Farm-out Agreement if approved by the Nigerian Department 
of Petroleum Resources.
HON entered into a farm-in agreement with Bayelsa pursuant to which 
Bayelsa agreed to farm out a 20 per cent participating interest in the 
Atala field to HON. HON also agreed to act as technical partner for the 
development and operation of the Atala field.
The proposed development plan involves two phases. The first phase 
envisages the re-entry, testing and completion of the existing Atala-1  
well and the drilling of a second lateral well to optimise oil drainage.  
AGIP operated Clough Creek field is the intended destination of Atala  
oil for evacuation.

Production, Sales and Revenue
The Company operates the PY-3 field in the Cauvery Basin with an  
18 per cent participating interest. Since August 2007 , one of the three 
producing wells in the PY-3 field has been shut-in due to excessive water 
production. As a result of natural decline, PY -3 field crude oil production 
was lower by 29 per cent during 2007 from the same period in 2006. 
Current oil production is at a level of approximately 3,050 stbd.  
The Company does not expect to recover additional production until  
the implementation of the PY -3 field’s Phase III development.
Hardy’s net entitlement interest in production is after the Government of 
India’s share of profit oil. Under the terms of the PSC, profit oil increased 
from 10 per cent to 25 per cent effective 1 April 2005 and was further 
increased to 40 per cent on 1 April 2006. On 1 April 2008, profit oil is 
expected to increase to 50 per cent.
Revenue, after profit oil, declined from $21.3 million in 2006 to  
$1 1.8 million in 2007 . The average price realised per barrel increased 
marginally to $66.65 during 2007 . No sales took place during the 
fourth quarter of 2007 and all production during that period was held in 
inventory. Reduced revenue in 2007 resulted from lower production levels, 
higher inventory levels and higher profit oil to the Government of India.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for 2007 increased by $0.6 million during 2007 . This results 
principally from higher costs of operating the PY-3 field. The contract  
for the floating processing and storage systems was renegotiated  
effective from July 2007 , resulting in a substantial increase in day rates.  
The increase in operating cost was offset in part by lower depletion  
and decommissioning costs.
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined from $ 1 6. 1 million in 2006 to $6. 1 million in 2007 .  
The reduction principally stemmed from lower revenues and higher 
operating costs from July 2007 .
Other Operating Income
An insurance claim of $1.0 million was received for business interruption 
caused by an operational accident in the year 2002. This has been 
accounted for as other operating income in 2006 when insurance 
proceeds were received.
Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses increased from $5.7 million in 2006 to  
$6.9 million in 2007 . The increase principally results from a higher share 
based payment expense by $0.9 million for the stock options granted by 
the Company to its directors and employees since 2005. During 2007 , 
costs include those relating to the move from AIM to the Main Market, 
higher manpower costs with the addition of an additional executive 
director and higher remuneration of executive directors.
Operating Profit (Loss)
As a result, the Company is reporting an operating loss of $0.8 million 
compared with an operating profit of $1 1.4 million reported in 2006.
Gain on Sale of Investment
During December 2007 , the Company sold 3,010,000 Ordinary Shares 
of HOEC for a cash consideration of $12.5 million which was received 
in January 2008. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on sale of 
investment of $10.2 million. The after-tax gain amounted to $7 .4 million  
or $0.1 1 per share.
Investment and Other Income
Investment and other income declined from $2.3 million in 2006 to  
$1.4 million in 2007 . The decline was the result of reduced deposits and 
lower interest rates in 2007 compared to 2006.
Finance Costs
Finance costs principally include the cost of providing bank guarantees 
to the Government of India required in accordance with the provisions 
of Production Sharing Contracts and are based on the agreed work 
programme on blocks in India.
Taxation
Most of the provision for taxation is with respect to deferred income taxes 
since the Company’s capital expenditure programme is sufficient to shield 
the Company from a large portion of current tax liabilities. The group’s 
Indian operations can avail the treaty benefit for the taxes suffered either 
in India, the UK or the USA and the group could also benefit from prior year 
capital losses by way of group relief for the capital gain made in sale of 
investment in HOEC shares. 
Net Profit 
As a result, net profit declined from $ 1 0.2 million in 2006 to $8.3 million 
in 2007. 16 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Cash flow from operating activities, before changes in non-cash working 
capital, has declined from $ 1 4.5 million in 2006 to $2.6 million in 2007 . 
This results principally from lower revenues arising from lower production 
volumes and higher profit oil to the government, and higher operating and 
administrative costs.
Changes in non-cash working capital principally reflect reduction in 
debtors (excluding receivable from the sale of investment of $12.5 million 
that was received in January 2008) as a result of lack of sales in the fourth 
quarter of 2007 and a significant reduction in creditors. At the end of 
2006, the Company was in the process of drilling a well on its CY-OS/2 
block in which it has a 75 per cent participating interest.
Capital Expenditures
The Group’s capital expenditures amounted to $32.2 million during 2007 , 
compared to $51.6 million incurred during 2006. Capital expenditures 
amounting to $21.9 million were incurred on the CY-OS/2 block with  
the drilling of the successful Fan-A1 well. The Company expended  
$4.2 million with respect to its interest in the GS-01 block with the drilling 
of the B-1 discovery well. Expenditures on the D3 block amounted to 
$4.6 million with the acquisition of 2,800 km
2
 of 3D seismic data and the 
commencement of the drilling of the first well on 28 December 2007 . 
Approximately $1.0 million was incurred with respect to the Company’s 
operations in Nigeria, principally with respect to the testing of a well in  
Oza and ongoing expenditures. The drilling has resulted in discoveries  
on the CY -OS/2, GS-01 and D3 blocks and the test on Oza has been 
successful as well.
During 2006, Hardy incurred a significant amount of capital expenditures 
on the CY-OS/2 block. As of 31 December 2006, Hardy had invested 
$59.5 million for its share of the drilling and testing of the two wells which 
included costs associated with the side track of the second well. In 2006, 
Hardy also participated in the drilling of the A- 1 well on the GS-01 block. 
In the Krishna Godavari Basin on the east coast of India, 3,440 km
2
 of 3D 
seismic data had been acquired over the D9 block during 2006, which 
has now been processed and interpreted, and six prospects have been 
identified for drilling.
Investment in HOEC
The Company had an investment of approximately 8.5 per cent in shares 
of HOEC, a publicly traded company in India. HOEC’s primary assets are a 
21 per cent participating interest in PY-3 and a 100 per cent participating 
interest in PY-1 (a gas discovery adjacent to PY-3 and ring-fenced by 
the CY-OS/2 exploration licence). In October 2006, HOEC raised 
approximately $33.0 million via a public rights issue in which Hardy  
took up its pro rata entitlement at a cost of $2.8 million.
In December 2007 , the Company sold 3,010,000 shares of HOEC for a cash 
consideration of $1 2.5 million. In early January 2008, HOEC completed a 
rights offering with Hardy participating in the rights offering to the extent 
of its pro rata share investing an additional $1 3.2 million. In January 2008, 
the Company sold a further 1,971,41 1 shares for a cash consideration 
of $8.1 million. At the present time, the Company has 6,1 14,745 shares 
representing 4.7 per cent equity in HOEC. Based on the market value  
of Rs.134 per share on 8 April 2008, this represents an investment value  
of approximately $20.5 million.
Site Restoration Deposits
As of 31 December 2007 , the Company had deposited $3.4 million for  
site restoration of the PY-3 field. Of this amount, $2.8 million was placed  
in 2006 with the remainder of $0.6 million placed in 2007 .
Investment and Other Income
The Company has raised equity capital during the past three years.  
Surplus cash is invested in short-term deposits generating investment 
income on a regular basis. The level of such income was reduced from 
$2.4 million in 2006 to $1.3 million due to reduction in deposit and lower 
interest rates during 2007 .
Finance Costs
Finance costs essentially represent the cost of bank guarantees provided 
to the Government of India in connection with annual work programmes 
in India.
Equity Financings
The Company undertook its initial public offering (IPO) of ordinary  
shares on 7 June 2005 when its shares commenced trading on AIM.  
The IPO was successfully completed at a placing price of 144 pence  
per share, raising net proceeds of $20.8 million. In 2006 and 2007 ,  
the Company also successfully completed an additional equity placement 
of Ordinary Shares at 276 and 423 pence per share, raising additional 
proceeds of $24.5 million and $40.2 million respectively. 17 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
“The Company continues to  
be an emerging company with 
limited cash flows, and as a result,  
has been principally relying upon 
equity capital markets to build  
and grow its asset base.”
Cash Position
As a result of the equity placing, the Company has been able to maintain 
a significant amount of cash resources to fund its ongoing capital 
expenditures and work programmes. Total cash increased from  
$24.5 million at the end of 2006 to $3 1 .2 million at the end of 2007 .  
The Company does not have any long-term debt.
Summary Balance Sheets
Hardy has continued to grow during 2007 . Its non-current assets have 
increased from $89.1 million at the end of 2006 to $121.4 million at the 
end of 2007 . This results largely from the capital expenditure programme 
on exploration, principally on the drilling of wells on CY-OS/2 and GS-01 
blocks as well as expenditure on seismic data acquisition.
Current assets represent the Group’s cash resources, together with  
trade and other receivables and inventory. At the end of 2007 , of the  
$48.4 million of current assets, $31.2 million are represented by cash, 
generated principally from the equity issue that was completed in June 
2007 . The accounts receivable at the end of 2007 included $ 1 2.5 million 
from the sale of shares in HOEC which was received in January 2008.
Current liabilities are principally trade and other accounts payable.  
The level of current liabilities fluctuates significantly depending upon  
the timing of capital programmes. At the end of 2006, the Company was 
in the process of drilling a well on its CY-OS/2 operated block, resulting 
in a significant increase in payables. At 31 December 2007 , the accounts 
payable were reduced to more normalised levels.
Consequently, the Company has been successful in growing its net  
asset base, which has increased from $91.4 million at the end of 2006 to 
$ 1 44.0 million at the end of 2007 . The increase in the carrying value of net 
assets results from a combination of new equity placements, earnings that 
have been retained in the business and the impact of valuation gains with 
respect to its investment in HOEC.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Hardy has been funding its cash requirements from internally generated 
cash flows and equity capital, principally from institutional investors,  
in each of the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 . The Company continues  
to be an emerging company with limited cash flows and, as a result,  
has been principally relying upon equity capital markets to build and  
grow its asset base.
At 31 December 2007 , the Company had cash resources of approximately 
$31.2 million that were available to meet future capital expenditures.  
In addition, the Company has realised proceeds (net of participation in the 
rights offering) from the sale of a portion of its shareholdings in HOEC of 
$7 .4 million which has augmented its cash resources and working capital. 
At 8 April 2008, the Company’s remaining investment in HOEC is worth 
$20.5 million which, if required, can be made available to further augment 
the Company’s cash resources and working capital during 2008.
The Company is presently considering farming-out a portion of its 
participating interest of 75 per cent in the CY-OS/2 block. The Company’s 
plans provide for the drilling of three appraisal wells on the block and 
the farm-out is anticipated to contribute towards the Company’s 
commitments with respect to its appraisal programme.
At the present time, the Company does not have any short-term or  
long-term debt, nor does it presently have any bank facilities in  
place. The Company presently produces from the PY-3 field in India.  
The Company believes that it may be possible to secure financing on  
the strength of this producing block in the future.
Based on present plans, the Company believes it has adequate financial 
resources to fund its capital expenditure requirements for 2008.
Dividends
The Company has limited internally generated cash flows and has a 
significant planned capital expenditure programme. In the circumstances, 
the Board of Directors has chosen to reinvest cash flows and does not 
recommend the payment of a dividend in the foreseeable future.

Health, Safety and Environment (‘HSE’)
The Board has tailored the Group’s HSE policy and management system 
taking reference from world class operations to suit Indian conditions. 
Safety, security and emergency procedures have been incorporated 
into the weave of the Group’s operations. The central HSE Committee 
and Environment Management Committees meet on a monthly basis to 
assess and monitor compliance. The Group regularly undertakes internal 
and external HSE audits, including pre-mobilisation HSE audit of rigs 
and vessels. The Group undertakes periodical environmental marine 
monitoring around production facilities and around the drilling locations. 
Prompt compliance with applicable regulations by the Group has been 
recognised by concerned agencies.
There were no lost time accidents (LTA) during the year. The PY-3 floating 
production unit, Tahara, has operated for over six years without LTA.
All statutory requirements and certification for the operating 
 facilities at PY-3 field were maintained. Compliance to ministerial  
and regulatory bodies such as DGH, MOEF, DGMS, ODAG, Coast Guard,  
Navy and others are maintained by forwarding necessary reports as 
required. Hardy participates in different meetings convened by these 
agencies. Senior officials from these agencies also visited our offshore 
facilities and appreciate our HSE management system.
The CHSE Committee, the Company’s apex body on HSE activities, meet 
every month and review the HSE plans, activities, accidents/incidents 
pertaining to the month. Representatives from contractors are also invited 
for these meetings. Regular HSE audits, drills and emergency exercises are 
carried out in all facilities offshore. 
The Environment Management Committee also meets once a month.  
Annual marine environmental monitoring is carried out by consultants  
in collaboration with Universities in the region.
The Board believes that prevention of accidents, ill health and protection  
of the environment are essential to the efficient operation of its 
business. The Board is committed to high standards of health, safety and 
environmental protection. These aspects command equal prominence  
with other business considerations in the decision making process.  
Health, safety and environmental protection are responsibilities shared 
by everyone working for the Group and the full support of all the Group’s 
staff, corporate partners, and contractors is vital to the successful 
implementation of this policy. The Board ensures that personnel are  
aware of their delegated health, safety and environmental responsibilities 
and are properly trained to undertake them diligently. The Board aims to 
ensure that the necessary resources are provided to support this policy fully 
and to seek continuous improvement in performance. High HSE standards  
and constant grass roots level interaction give the Group the awareness  
of local communities’ sensibilities and needs. With an awareness driving  
the commitment, the Group provides its expertise and resources,  
wherever required, to be a responsible Company. 20 Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Annual Report 2007
RISK FACTORS 
As an oil and gas exploration and production company with current operations concentrated in India and Nigeria, Hardy is, by virtue of the nature 
of its business and the countries in which it operates, subject to a variety of business risks. Outlined below is a description of the principal risk 
factors that may affect the Group’s business. Such risk factors are not intended to be presented in any assumed order of priority. Any of the risks, 
as well as the other risks and uncertainties discussed in this document, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the risks 
set out below may not be exhaustive and additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to the Company, or which the Company currently 
deems immaterial, may arise or become material in the future.
In particular, the Company’s performance might be affected by changes in market and/or economic conditions and in legal, regulatory and tax 
requirements. Additionally, there may be risks of which the Board is not aware or believes to be immaterial which may, in the future, adversely 
affect the Group’s business.
General Exploration, Development and Production Risks
The Group’s strategy is predominantly driven by the exploration, exploitation, appraisal, development and production of its existing  
assets. There are risks inherent in the exploration, exploitation, appraisal, development and production of oil and gas reserves and resources. 
Whilst the rewards can be substantial, there is no guarantee that exploration will lead to further commercial discoveries. Exploration and 
production activities by their nature involve significant risks. Risks such as delays in the construction and commissioning of drilling platforms 
or other technical difficulties, lack of access to key infrastructure, adverse weather conditions, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, 
occupational and health hazards, technical failures, labour disputes, unusual or unexpected geological formations, explosions and other acts of 
God are inherent to the business. Although in many cases these represent insurable risks, the Group may also become subject to other hazards 
(including pollution and oil seepage liability) against which it is not insured or is under insured. The occurrence of any of these incidents can result 
in the Group’s current or future project target dates for drilling or production being delayed or interrupted, increased capital expenditure and 
production costs and result in liability to the Contractor or Operator of the field.
Business Risk
OIL AND GAS RESERVES OR RESOURCES 
Reserves and resource estimates have been prepared in accordance with the definitions of the SPE, the WPC, the AAPG and the SPEE, March 2007. 
Estimating the quantity of reserves and resources and projecting future rates of production is a subjective process and has inherent uncertainties, 
including factors beyond Hardy’s control.
Reserve and resource estimates are based on production, prices, costs, ownership, geophysical, geological and engineering data and other 
information collated by Hardy. The estimates may prove to be incorrect after further drilling, testing and production. Forward-looking statements 
contained herein concerning the Group’s reserves and resources definitions should not be unduly relied upon. Certain categories of reserves and 
resources (such as Prospective and Contingent Resources) are inherently riskier than certain other categories (such as Proved Reserves).
If the assumptions upon which the estimates of Hardy’s oil and gas reserves or resources are based prove to be incorrect, Hardy may be unable to 
recover and produce the estimated levels or quality of oil or gas set out in this document and Hardy’s business, prospects and financial results could 
be materially and adversely affected.
Considering that all reserve estimates are subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves:
•	 t h e	 q u a n t i t i e s	 a n d	 q u a l i t i e s	 t h a t	 a r e	 u l t i m a t e l y	 r e c o v er e d ;
•	 t h e	 p r o d u c t i o n	 a n d	 o p er a t i n g	 c o s t s	 i n c u r r e d ;
•	 t h e	 a m o u n t	 a n d	 t i m i n g	 o f	 a d d i t i o n a l	 e x p l o r a t i o n	 a n d	 f u t u r e	 d e v e l o p m e n t	 e x p e n d i t u r e s ;	 a n d
•	 f u t u r e	 o i l	 a n d	 g a s	 s a l e s	 p r i c e s .
Many of the assumptions used in estimating reserves are beyond the Group’s control and may prove to be incorrect over time. Evaluations of 
reserves necessarily involve multiple uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves or resources evaluation depends on the quality of available 
information, petroleum engineering and geological interpretation. Exploration drilling, interpretation, testing and production after the date of the 
estimates may require substantial upward or downward revisions in Hardy’s reserves or resources data. Moreover, different reservoir engineers may 
make varying estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect 
to reserves and resources will vary from estimates and the variances may be material.
The probability that Prospective Resources will be discovered, or be economically recoverable, is considerably lower than for Proven, Probable and 
Possible Reserves. Volumes associated with Prospective Resources should be considered highly speculative. 23 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
APPRAISAL AND DEVELOPMENT 
Appraisal results for discoveries are also uncertain. Appraisal and development activities involving the drilling of wells across a field may be 
unpredictable and not result in the outcome planned, targeted or predicted, as only by extensive testing can the properties of the entire field be 
fully understood.
PRODUCTION
The Group’s production operations involve risks common to its industry, including blowouts, oil spills, explosions, fires, equipment damage or 
failure, natural disasters, geological uncertainties, early water breakthrough, unusual or unexpected rock formations and abnormal geological 
pressures. In the event that any of these occur, environmental damage, injury to persons and loss of life, failure to produce oil or gas in commercial 
quantities or an inability to fully produce discovered reserves could result. They can also put at risk some or all of Hardy’s licences enabling it 
to explore and/or produce and incur fines or penalties as well as criminal sanctions against the Company and/or its officers. Consequently, 
production delays and declines from normal field operating conditions may result in revenue and cash flow levels being adversely affected.
Ex PLORATION
Exploration activities are capital intensive and their successful outcome cannot be assured. Hardy undertakes exploration activities and incurs 
significant costs with no guarantee that such expenditures will result in the discovery of commercially deliverable oil or gas. The Group is exploring 
in geographic areas where environmental conditions are challenging and costs can be high. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is 
often uncertain. As a result, the Group may incur cost overruns or may be required to curtail, delay or cancel drilling operations because of many 
factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in geological formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse 
weather conditions, compliance with environmental regulations, governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling 
rigs and the delivery of equipment.
Ex PLORATION LICENCES
Some licences held by the Group are solely exploration licences and as such they have a limited term which is divided into three stages.  
Through each stage a portion of the licence will need to be relinquished. At the end of the term, if no commercial discoveries have been declared, 
the Group will be obliged to relinquish the entire licensed area.
WORK PROGRAMME
Each of the Group’s India exploration licences requires minimum work programmes to be fulfilled within each phase of the licence. These may 
include seismic surveys to be performed, wells to be drilled and other data acquisition. Failure to comply with such obligations, whether inadvertent 
or otherwise, may lead to fines, penalties, restrictions and withdrawal of licences with consequent material adverse effects.
With respect to each of the Group’s Nigeria assets, minimum work programmes are mutually agreed between the joint venture and the Government 
of Nigeria’s Department of Petroleum Resources. Failure to comply with such obligations, whether inadvertent or otherwise, may lead to fines, 
penalties, restrictions and withdrawal of licences with consequent material adverse effects.
INTERRUPTIONS IN AVAILABILITY OF Ex PLORATION, PRODUCTION OR SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE
The Group may suffer from delays or interruptions due to lack of availability of drilling rigs or construction of infrastructure, including pipelines, 
storage tanks and other facilities, which may adversely impact Hardy’s operations and could lead to fines, penalties, criminal sanctions against 
the Company and/or its officers or some or all of the Group’s licences being withdrawn. Delays in obtaining licences, permissions and approvals 
required by the Group in the pursuance of its business objectives, including construction of pipelines, storage tanks or other facilities could likewise 
have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business and the results of its operations.
THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS AND PROVIDERS OF CAPITAL Eq UIPMENT
The Group contracts or leases services and equipment from third-party providers and suppliers. Such equipment and services can be in short  
supply and may not be readily available at the times and places required. In particular, the Group utilises specialised offshore drilling rigs and 
various special-purpose vessels, of which there are a limited number relative to demand globally and more specifically in the India region.  
In addition, the costs of third-party services and equipment have increased significantly over recent years and may continue to rise. This may, 
therefore, have an adverse effect on Hardy’s business.
CLIMATE
The Group operates in areas with extreme and seasonal weather conditions, including severe storms and monsoons. Each of these climate 
conditions can adversely affect the Group’s operations. 24 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
The Group’s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety and the environment.  
Failure, whether inadvertent or otherwise, by the Group to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements may give rise to significant 
liabilities. The Group’s health, safety and environment policy is to observe local and national legal and regulatory requirements. The terms 
of licences or permissions may include more stringent environmental and/or health and safety requirements. The obtaining of exploration, 
development or production licences and permits may become more difficult or be subject to delay due to governmental, regional or local 
environmental consultation, approvals or other considerations or requirements.
CURRENT AND FUTURE FINANCING
The Group’s business necessarily involves significant capital expenditure. In addition, if the Group is required to provide further capital in pursuit 
of additional opportunities, the Group may have a need to seek further external debt and future equity financing. There is no guarantee that such 
additional funding, if required, will be available on acceptable terms at the relevant time. Furthermore, any additional debt financing may involve 
restrictive covenants which may limit or affect the Group’s operating flexibility.
UNINSURED RISKS
Substantial damages may be claimed against the Group due to events arising from the inherently hazardous nature of its operations and omissions 
of sub-contractors. Any indemnities the Group may receive from such sub-contractors may be difficult to enforce if they lack adequate resources. 
The Group considers that the extent of its insurance cover is reasonable based on the costs of cover and the risks associated with its business and 
industry practice. 
FOREIGN ExCHANGE RISK
The proceeds of the Group’s domestic oil and gas sales in India are received in US dollars. The majority of the Group’s expenditure requirements 
are in US dollars. The Group has general and administrative expenditure with respect to offices in India, United Kingdom and Nigeria, the Group 
is exposed to foreign exchange risk against Indian Rupees, Nigerian Naira and UK Sterling. The Group has no current plans to enter into ongoing 
hedging arrangements.
As the Company will be listed on the London Stock Exchange, any funds which may be raised through the issue of share capital will be denominated 
in UK Sterling. However, the majority of the Group’s capital expenditure will be in US dollars.
LIq UIDITY RISK
The Group’s cash requirements and cash reserves are projected for the Group as a whole and for each country in which operations are conducted. 
Whereas the Group currently has no debt, going forward the Group expects to meet these requirements through an appropriate mix of available 
cash and assets, equity funding and debt financing. The Group seeks to minimise the impact that any debt financings may have on its balance sheet 
by negotiating borrowings in matching currencies. Primarily, these are expected to be in US dollar denominations. The Group further mitigates 
liquidity risk by maintaining an insurance programme to minimise exposure to insurable losses.
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Historically, oil prices have fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors over which the Group has no control, including world production 
levels, international economic trends, currency exchange rate fluctuations, expectations for inflation, speculative activity, consumption patterns 
and global or regional political events. 
Numerous factors will affect future gas prices, including domestic supply, domestic economic growth, consumption patterns and the locations 
of gas fields, all of which will have an impact on the price realised but are still outside the control of the Group. In India, government approval is 
required with respect to the pricing of natural gas sales contracts.
SPEED OF DEVELOPMENT
There are numerous factors which may affect the success of the Group’s business which are beyond the Group’s control, including local, national 
and international economic, legal and political conditions. The Group’s business involves a high degree of risk which a combination of experience, 
knowledge and careful evaluation may not overcome.
PROCURE APPROPRIATE DRILLING Eq UIPMENT
Oil and natural gas development and exploration activities are dependent on the availability of drilling and related equipment in the particular 
areas where such activities will be conducted. Demand for limited equipment such as drilling rigs or access restrictions may affect the availability 
of such equipment to the Group and may delay its development and exploration activities. In the areas in which the Group operates, there is 
significant demand for drilling rigs and other equipment. Failure by the Group to secure necessary equipment could adversely affect the Group’s 
business, results of operations and financial condition. 
RISK FACTORS (continued) 25 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
Ec On Omic and p Olitical risk
The Group’s principal assets and operations are located in India where there may be risks over which it will have no, or limited, control. These may 
include economic, social, or political instability or change, hyperinflation, currency non-convertibility or instability and changes in laws affecting 
foreign ownership, government participation, taxation, working conditions, exchange control and custom duties as well as government control 
over domestic production.
rEG ulat Ory appr Oval
Following the announcement of various discoveries, exploitation of discovered oil and gas deposits will involve the need to obtain licence or 
clearance from the relevant governmental authorities. In particular for the Group, future successful exploitation of deposits discovered in the 
CY-OS/2, GS-01, D9 and D3 exploration licences will be dependent upon development plan approval being granted by the GOI. 
Envir OnmE ntal fact Ors
The Group’s operations are, and will be, subject to environmental regulation (with regular environmental impact assessments and evaluation of 
operations required before any permits are granted to the Group) in all the jurisdictions in which it operates. Environmental regulations are likely  
to evolve in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement measures being implemented, increases in fines and penalties for  
non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and 
their directors and employees.
attracti On and r EtE nti On Of k Ey Empl Oy EEs
The Group relies heavily on a small number of key individuals, in particular the Executive Directors, for the operation of its day-to-day activities  
and implementation of its growth strategy. In addition, personal connections and relationships of its key management are important to the 
conduct of its business. The Group’s business and operations may be negatively affected by the departure of any of these individuals, or any of  
a number of other key employees. There can be no guarantee that the Group will be able to continue to attract and retain required employees. 26 Hardy Oil and Gas plc

introduction
As a company incorporated in the Isle of Man, the Company is not subject to any corporate governance regime in its place of incorporation.  
The directors, however, recognize the value of the Combined Code and support high standards of corporate governance. 
Ordinary Shares of the Company were admitted and traded on AIM from 7 June 2005 until 20 February 2008 when such shares were de-listed  
from AIM and admitted to the Official List and the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market for listed securities. Compliance with the Combined  
Code was not required whilst the Company’s Ordinary Shares were admitted to trading on AIM. However, the Directors have always taken note  
of its provisions and complied whenever it has been appropriate to do so for a small oil and gas company listed on AIM. 
Following the Company’s admission to the Main Market, the Company is required to comply with the Combined Code pursuant to the Listing Rules. 
On 26 March 2008, the Ordinary Shares were included in the FTSE 250 Index, as a result of which the Company will no longer be regarded as a 
smaller company under the Combined Code for the financial year ending 31 December 2008. It is the directors’ intention that the Company will 
comply with the Combined Code wherever possible. 
Set out below are Hardy’s corporate governance practices for the financial year ending 31 December 2007. Disclosures below include matters 
where Hardy has not fully complied with the Combined Code during 2007 together with its plans for compliance during 2008. 
Board of d irectors
cO mpOsiti On
In July 2007, the size of the Board of Directors was increased from five to six with the addition of the Finance Director. As a result, the Company 
presently has three Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors. Each of the Executive Directors has extensive knowledge of the oil and 
gas industry with combined experience of around 100 years. The Non-Executive Directors have either held or currently hold senior appointments 
in oil and gas companies, companies with interests in the energy sector or have significant corporate and financial experience. The Non-Executive 
Directors bring a broad range of business and commercial experience to the Board. The Board believes it is an effective board which is collectively 
responsible for the success of the Company and that its composition has been suitable providing a balance of skill sets to run an effective 
international junior oil and gas company. 
As a result of the inclusion in the FTSE 250 index, the Board intends to expand its size from six to seven by the addition of one independent 
 Non-Executive Director during 2008.
At the time of the initial public offering, the Board of Directors comprised of Messrs Mortimer, Karra, Sharma and Shah. Dr Bell and Mr Dattani 
joined the Board in December 2005 and July 2007 respectively. Mr Karra and Mr Shah were re-elected by shareholders at Annual General 
Meetings on 28 June 2006 and 26 July 2007 respectively. The re-elections of Mr Mortimer and Dr Bell and the re-appointment of Mr Dattani 
will be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting of shareholders to be held on 29 May 2008 and brief biographical details of each of these 
directors is set out on pages 20 and 21. The Board of Directors believes all of the Directors that are proposed for re-election or re-appointment have 
served the Company well, have provided the Company with adequate advice, counsel and strategic guidance in moving the Company forward 
and have effectively participated in the running of the Company. Although no formal performance appraisals of each of the directors has taken 
place, the Chairman of the Board believes all of the nominees for re-election as Directors continue to be effective and have demonstrated their full 
commitment to their roles as Directors. In addition the Board is satisfied with the performance of its Chairman.
rO l E and OpErati Ons Of t HE BOard
The Board is accountable to the shareholders for the creation of long-term shareholder value and delivery of strong, sustainable operating and

verbal and written contact with the Non-Executive Directors to discuss various issues affecting the Company and its business. In addition,  
the Board executes a number of resolutions in writing to conduct Company business. Attendance by Directors at board meetings and all committee 
meetings was 100% during 2007.

The Chairman establishes the agenda for each Board meeting. Business set out on Board agendas are discussed at each meeting with sufficient 
information to all the Directors to the extent appropriate. Board meeting agendas and supporting information are circulated to each Director 
prior to each meeting. Directors are provided sufficient information on the basis of which to discuss relevant matters in order to make informed 
decisions. Each agenda item is discussed with sufficient information on each matter to allow Board members to make an informed decision.
At each Board meeting, the Board reviews future cash flows and historical financial information with respect to the business and affairs of the 
Company. In addition, the Directors are provided a status report on each of its exploration, development and production assets and a meaningful 
dialogue takes place. The Board receives reports of its various committees – Audit, Remuneration and Nomination – and takes appropriate 
action. Matters requiring resolutions are voted upon and approved if appropriate. Matters reserved specifically for Board approval are discussed 
and evaluated prior to approval. Decisions requiring Board approval in between scheduled Board meetings are made by circulating supporting 
information and approved unanimously in writing by the Directors. 
ind EpEnd Ent pr Of Essi Onal advic E
All of the Directors are aware that independent professional advice is available to each Director in order to properly discharge his or her duties as a 
Director. In addition, each Director and committee has access to the advice of the Company Secretary.
mattErs sp Ecifically r EsErv Ed By t HE BOard
A formal schedule of matters is reserved for consideration by the Board. The matters reserved include management structure including appointments 
and remuneration, consideration of strategic policies and corporate direction, approval of annual and interim results, acquisitions and disposals, 
material contracts, major capital expenditure projects and budgets, approval of capital structure, debt and equity financing, dividends, and other 
matters. Subject to those reserved matters, the Board delegates authority for the management of the business primarily to the Executive Directors  
and certain other matters are delegated to the Board committees, namely the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
pErf Ormanc E Evaluati On
Each Director’s position is subject to satisfactory performance of their responsibilities and is subject to re-appointment by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting. During 2007, no formal evaluation of the Board, its committees and Directors (including the Chairman) was carried  
out although the performance of the Directors is discussed on an informal basis and at the Remuneration Committee. The Board fully intends  
to undertake a performance evaluation of the Board, its committees and each of the Directors during 2008.
cH airman and c HiEf Ex Ecutiv E
There is a clear division of duties and responsibilities between the Non-Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive of the Company. The Chairman 
is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensures its effectiveness of its role and setting the agenda. The Chairman is also responsible to 
ensure that the board is provided with accurate, timely, and clear information in relation to the Group and its business. The Chief Executive is 
responsible for the running of the organization. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are exercised by different individuals.
Paul Mortimer is the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company. In addition to Hardy, he is also a director of the following entities:

nO n-Ex Ecutiv E d ir Ect Ors
The Board has determined that Mr E.P . Mortimer (Chairman), Mr Pradip Shah and Dr Carol Bell are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board considers that independence is a matter of judgment and therefore it believes that the Non-Executive Directors should be free from 
any business or other relationships that could materially interfere in the exercise of their independent judgment. It is the Board’s policy to provide 
its Non-Executive Directors fair remuneration for the contribution they make with respect to the business and affairs of the Company and the 
responsibilities they undertake in performing their duties as Non-Executive Directors.
Each of the independent Non-Executive Directors has been granted 260,333 options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company either on the 
admission of Ordinary Shares of the Company on AIM in June 2005 or on appointment as a Non-Executive Director, if later. 
The Board acknowledges that both Messrs Mortimer and Shah have shareholdings in the Company thus expressing their confidence in the 
Company and its future. 
Notwithstanding Non-Executive Directors’ interest in Ordinary Shares or options of the Company, the Board considers that their independence is 
not prejudiced or compromised as a result of such positions. 
The Executive Directors and Chairman of the Company visit major shareholders on a regular basis. These Directors are in regular dialogue with 
the other two independent Non-Executive Directors and communicate to them the views of major shareholders about the Company. Dr Carol Bell 
serves in the capacity as the Senior Non-Executive Director of the Company and is available to shareholders if they have concerns through the 
normal channels of Chairman or Executive Directors or for which such contact is inappropriate.
At the present time, half of the Directors are Non-Executive and independent. The Combined Code requires half of the Board, excluding  
the Chairman, to be independent. It is the intention of the Board to add one additional Non-Executive Director to the Board during 2008.  
Following such appointment, the majority of the Directors will be independent Non-Executive Directors. 
BOard c OmmittEE s
The Board established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, each of which has terms of reference (approved by the Board) setting 
out its authority and duties. In 2006, the Board considered various issues that would normally fall within the terms of reference of the various 
Committees. All Non-Executive Directors are members of the Audit Committee. Both executive and Non-Executive Directors are members of 
the Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee although the majority of committee members are independent. The Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee meet as and when required, but at least once a year. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year  
to review, among other things, financial reporting with respect to interim and annual results. The Company’s auditors attend one of these meetings 
to discuss any audit related issues and to review formally with committee members reports issued to the Company by the auditors. The Audit 
Committee ensures that any non-audit services conform to the ethical standards for auditors issued by the u K Auditing Practices Board.
nO minati On cO mmittEE
The Nomination Committee comprises two Non-Executive Directors – Mr E.P. Mortimer (Chairman) and Mr Pradip Shah – and one Executive 
Director, Mr Sastry Karra. The Nomination Committee considers the structure, size and composition of the Board, retirements and appointments of 
additional and replacement Directors, reviews succession plans for the Directors and makes recommendations to the Board on membership of the 
Board, its committees and other matters within its remit.
There were two meetings of Nominating Committee held during 2007. Any new appointments to the Board are considered by the Nomination 
Committee and made after Board approval. Following appointment, a new Director is given a detailed presentation of the activities of the 
Company. If an appointment is made without using an external search agency or open advertisement, the entire Board selects a new Director. 32 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
rE munErati On cO mmittEE
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises two Non-Executive Directors, Mr E.P. Mortimer and Mr Pradip Shah (appointed in December 
2007) and one Executive Director, Mr Sastry Karra. Mr E.P . Mortimer is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Hardy’s Remuneration 
Committee operates within the terms of reference made by the Board. There were two meetings of the Remuneration Committee during 2007.
The Remuneration Committee meets at least two times a year, considers remuneration policy and the employment terms and remuneration of 
the Executive Directors and in future will also review the remuneration of senior management. The Remuneration Committee’s role is advisory 
in nature and makes recommendations to the Board on the overall remuneration packages for Executive Directors in order to attract, retain 
and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving the Group’s objectives. The Remuneration Committee also reviews proposals for the 
share option plans and other incentive plans, makes recommendations for the grant of awards under such plans as well as approving the terms 
of any performance related pay schemes. None of the Directors participates in any discussion or votes on any proposal relating to his or her own 
remuneration. The Board’s policy is to remunerate the Group’s senior executives fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, 
retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel. The Remuneration Committee, while considering remuneration packages of Hardy 
executives will, in future, review the policies of comparable groups in the industry. As and when required, the Committee will take external 
professional advice for determining the appropriate remuneration policy for Hardy executives.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors outside the framework of the 
Remuneration Committee.
a udit cO mmittEE
The Audit Committee is chaired by Dr Carol Bell and its other members are E. P. Mortimer and Mr Pradip Shah. All of the committee members  
are independent Non-Executive Directors. Dr Carol Bell and Mr Pradip Shah both have extensive corporate, financing and banking experience.  
The board is satisfied that the Audit Committee has recent and relevant financial experience. The Audit Committee is responsible for a wide  
range of financial matters and meets at least two times a year. There were two meetings of the Audit Committee in 2007. It monitors the  
controls that are in place to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. The Audit Committee also oversees  
the relationship with the external auditor, reviews the scope and results of audits and provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s auditors.  
The Company has a policy in place for the award of non-audit services provided by external auditors, which requires approval of the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee ensures that the independence and objectivity of the external auditors is safeguarded when securing  
non-audit services from the auditors. The Audit Committee also focuses on compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and the  
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and ensures that an effective system of internal control and risk management systems  
are maintained. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the annual report and accounts and the half-yearly reports remains  
with the Board. Some or all Executive Directors attend meetings of the Audit Committee through invitation.
shareholder r elations
Communication with shareholders is given high priority and there is regular dialogue with institutional investors, as well as general presentations 
made at the time of the release of the annual and interim results. All Directors are kept aware of changes in major shareholders in the Company and 
are available to meet with shareholders who have specific interests or concerns. The Company issues its results promptly to individual shareholders 
and also publishes them on the Company’s website – www.hardyoil.com. Regular updates to record news in relation to the Company and the status 
of its exploration and development programmes are included on the Company’s website. Shareholders and other interested parties can subscribe 
to receive these news updates by email by registering on-line on the website free of charge.
The Chairman and all Executive Directors are available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any issues and gain an understanding 
of the Company’s business, its strategies and governance. Dr Carol Bell serves in the capacity as the senior independent Non-Executive Director 
of the Company and is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved through the normal channels of Chairman or 
Executive Directors or for which such contact is inappropriate.
internal c ontrols
The Board of Directors reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls in line with the requirement of the Combined 
Code. The internal control system is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve its business objectives. This covers internal financial and 
operational controls, compliances and risk management. The Board considers it necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 1 of the 
Combined Code and to implement the guidance. The Company has necessary procedures in place for the year under review and up to the date  
of approval of the annual report and accounts.
CORPORA TE GOvERNANCE ST A TEMENT (continued) 33 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board 
confirms the need for an ongoing process for identification, evaluation and management of significant risks faced by the Company.
A risk assessment for each project is carried out by a team consisting of the Executive Directors and senior management before making 
any commitments. This team meets as and when required. Internal and external risks are continuously assessed, including exploration and 
development risks, regulatory and compliance obligations under various production sharing contracts, economics including oil price,  
interest rate and currency exposure, as well as natural catastrophes are continuously assessed. 
The Board reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control through detailed consideration of the financial control procedures in place. 
Given the size of the Company, the relative simplicity of the systems and the close involvement of senior management, the Board considers that 
there is no current requirement for an internal audit function. The procedures that have been established to provide internal financial control  
are considered appropriate for a company of its size and include controls over expenditure, regular reconciliations and management accounts. 
Most of the assets are owned jointly with others, budgets and expenditures are rigorously reviewed and approvals as well project audits take place 
with respect to capital and operating expenditures take place on a regular basis.
The Directors are responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably available to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Four of the Company’s six blocks in India are held jointly with Reliance. During December 2007, the Board visited Reliance’s upstream headquarters 
in Mumbai India where Reliance made presentations to the Board with respect to the jointly held assets. The Board has been favorably impressed 
with Reliance’s technical capabilities with respect to the upstream oil and gas business in India.
All of the non Executive Directors have been granted share options in 2005. In order to comply with the Combined Code, the Board of Directors  
intends to expand its size with the addition of one additional Non-Executive Director during 2008. Having regard to the nature of the Company’s 
business, and to recruit and retain Non-Executive Directors of international caliber, the board believes it is important to grant options to  
Non-Executive Directors. In the circumstances, and in accordance with the Combined Code, a resolution is being proposed for shareholders to  
consider, and if appropriate, authorize the Board of Directors to grant share options to Non-Executive Directors at the next Annual General Meeting.
Going c oncern
The Directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of the opinion that the Company has adequate working capital to execute its operations 
and that the Company has access to additional financing in the form of debt or equity or a combination thereof and therefore believe the going 
concern basis to be appropriate in preparing its annual financial statements.
share Options
The Directors believe that equity incentives are and will continue to be an important means of retaining, attracting and motivating directors, 
senior management and key employees. Accordingly, in June 2005, the Board adopted the share option scheme entitling the Company to  
award options to directors and employees. The Company’s share option scheme has been considered and approved by the shareholders in 2006. 
Options are not granted at a discount to the market value. u nder the scheme, options are exercisable between the first and tenth anniversaries  
of the date of grant. 
Options granted in June 2005 were subject to performance conditions whereby the share price of Hardy would need to rise by 20%, 45% and  
70% of the price at which the Hardy IPO was undertaken. In first year of performance period, one third of the options will become exercisable at  
or after 12 months following the date of grant. One third of the options will become exercisable at or after 24 months following the date of 
grant. The remaining one third of the options will become exercisable at or after 36 months following the date of grant. All of such performance 
conditions have been met. 
In the future, it is intended to grant options under the share option scheme which will generally vest in three equal instalments over a three year 
period but (due to the nature of the Group’s business) are not subject to any other performance conditions. 34 Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Resolutions numbered 7 to 9 comprise ‘special business’ of the Annual General Meeting resolutions numbered 7 and 8 will be proposed as special 
resolutions and resolution 9, will be proposed as an ordinary resolution. 36 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
Resolution number 7 will be proposed as a special resolution to authorise the Company to purchase up to 9,333,154 of its own Ordinary Shares  
in the market, representing 14.99% of the current issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company, at a price not less than the nominal value of the 
Ordinary Shares and not more than 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of the Company’s Ordinary Shares derived from the  
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days before the purchase is made. The authority would be given for the period ending  
on the date of next year’s Annual General Meeting or 18 months after the passing of the resolution (whichever is the earlier) and it is presently 
intended that a resolution for the renewal of such authority would be proposed at each succeeding Annual General Meeting. The Directors have no 
present intention of making such purchases, but believe it is prudent to have this authority so as to be able to act at short notice should circumstances  
warrant purchases. The authority would only be exercised if the Directors believe that to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally. 
Options over an aggregate of 4,352,099 Ordinary Shares in the Company were outstanding at 8 April 2008 representing 6.99% of the Company’s 
issued share capital at that date and which would represent 6.08% of the Company’s issued share capital if the proposed authority being sought at 
the Annual General Meeting to buy back 9,333,154 was exercised in full.
Resolution number 8 will be proposed as a special resolution for approval with respect to the disapplication of the provisions of Article 5.1 of the 
Articles of Association, thereby allowing the Company to issue such amount of Ordinary Shares for cash as is equal to five per cent of the issued 
share capital of the Company as at the date of the notice of meeting. 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code, resolution number 9 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution providing for 
approval of the grant of options under the Company’s 2005 u napproved Share Option Scheme to any new Non-Executive Directors appointed 
to the Board and also any current Non-Executive Directors. Such authority will expire at the date of next year’s Annual General Meeting. In order 
to attract and retain Non-Executive Directors of international stature, the Board of Directors believes that it will be appropriate to provide a 
remuneration package possibly including options.
a ction to be taken in respect of the a nnual General meeting
Shareholders will find enclosed with this document a form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting. Whether or not you intend to be present 
at the meeting, you are requested to complete and return the form of proxy so as to reach the Company’s registered office, 15-19 Athol Street, 
Douglas, Isle of Man IM1 1LB as soon as possible and in any event not later than 10.00 a.m. on 27 May 2008.
r ecommendation
The Directors consider that all of the resolutions set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and 
its shareholders as a whole and unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions. All of the Directors intend to vote in 
favour of all resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings of, in aggregate 14,219,086 Ordinary Shares (representing 22.84% of the 
issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as of 8 April 2008).
This Annual Report (including the Notice of Annual General Meeting) is an important document and requires your immediate attention. If you  
are in doubt as to the action you should be taking, please consult your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other professional  
advisor immediately.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued) 37 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
c onsideration by the d irectors of matters relating to d irectors’ r emuneration
The Company has a Remuneration Committee comprising of Mr E.P . Mortimer (Non-Executive Chairman), Mr Sastry Karra (Executive Director and 
Chief Executive) and Pradip Shah, an independent Non-Executive Director. Mr E.P . Mortimer is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. All of 
the members of the Remuneration Committee have considered matters relating to Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2007 .
statement of Hardy’s policy on d irectors’ r emuneration
The Company has established levels of remuneration that are appropriate to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run its 
business successfully. A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual 
performance so as to align their interests with those of shareholders and to incentivise them to perform at the highest levels.
The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration policy and the employment terms and remuneration of the Executive Directors.  
The Remuneration Committee’s role is advisory in nature and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on the overall remuneration 
packages for Executive Directors in order to attract, retain and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving Hardy’s objectives.  
The Remuneration Committee also reviews proposals for the share option plans, makes recommendations for the grant of awards under such 
plans as well as approving the terms of any performance related pay schemes. None of the Directors participate in any discussion or votes on any 
proposal relating to his own remuneration. The policy of the Board of Directors is to remunerate Hardy’s Executive Directors fairly and in such 
manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors 
is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors outside the framework of the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
All of the Directors have been granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares of Hardy. Options granted following the initial public offering in June 2005 
were subject to performance conditions based upon appreciation in the price of Ordinary Shares of the Company. All of the performance conditions 
have been met. Subsequent options granted are subject to vesting provisions over a three year period, commencing from the anniversary of the date of 
grant. All of the options granted are at the market prices based on the five day average price prior to the date of grant. The Directors believe that the 
best indicator of performance of a company and its directors is its share price performance. The Directors further believe that the grant of options and 
the associated vesting provisions provides an alignment of the interests of the Directors and shareholders. No options were granted to Non-Executive 
Directors during 2006 or 2007 . 
All of the service contracts with Directors are on an evergreen basis, subject to termination provisions. u nder the terms of the service agreements 
of all Executive Directors, the Company may in lieu of notice terminate the executive’s employment with immediate effect in such instance must

Directors are subject to termination upon at least 3 months’ notice.

DIRECTORS’ REMuNERA TION REPORT (continued) 41 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
INDEPENDENT AuDITORS’ REPORT 
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF HARDY OIL AND GAS PLC
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’) of Hardy Oil and Gas plc for the year ended 
31 December 2007. These comprise the Group Income Statement, 
Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent 
Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity, and the related notes. These financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set 
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Parent Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 15 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for  
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
r espective r esponsibilities of d irectors and a uditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European u nion are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (u K and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies Acts 
1931 to 2004 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the information given  
in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.  
The information in the Directors’ Report includes that specific 
information presented in the Review of Operations and the Financial 
Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the 
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept 
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified  
by law, regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions,  
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and 
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other 
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s 
Review, Review of Operations, Financial Review, Corporate Social 
Responsiblity, Risk Factors, Group Reserves and Resources, Directors’ 
Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report,  
and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of a udit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (u K and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 3 1 DECEMBER 2007 46 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
1. a cc Ountin G pOlici Es
The following accounting policies have been applied in preparation of consolidated financial statements of Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
(‘Hardy’ or the ‘Group’). 
a) a ccounting standards
Hardy prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European u nion. 
Hardy adopted IFRS for the first time in the financial year which ended on 31 December 2007. The adoption of these standards and interpretations 
has resulted in changes to the Hardy’s accounting policies. The effect of the adoption of IFRS on the results for the year ended 31 December 2006, 
the comparative year, are set out in note 32 to the financial statements.
As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 2 (amendment) Share based payments 
IFRS 3 (revised) Consolidated financial statements 
IFRS 8  Operating Segments 
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements 
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes 
IFRIC 14 IAS19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction 
IAS 1 (revised) Presentation of financial statements 
IAS 23 (revised) Borrowing costs 
IAS 27 (revised) Consolidated and separate financial statements
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these interpretations in future reporting periods will have a material impact on the  
Group’s results.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Hardy Oil and Gas plc and its subsidiary undertakings. The consolidated income 
statement and consolidated cash flow statements include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings up to the date of disposal. 
The Group conducts the majority of its exploration, development and production through unincorporated joint arrangements with other companies. 
The consolidated financial statements reflect the Group’s share of production and costs attributable to its participating interests under the 
proportional consolidation method.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 3 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982 not to publish its individual 
income statement and related notes. The Company’s profit for the year was u S$8,194,489 (2006: u S$283,578). 
c) r evenue and other income
Revenue represents the sale value of the Group’s share of oil which excludes the profit oil sold and paid to the Government as a part of profit sharing 
in the year, tariff, and income from technical services to third parties if any. Revenues are recognised when crude oil has been lifted and title has 
been passed to the buyer or when services are rendered.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 3 1 DECEMBER 2007 47 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
d) Oil and gas assets
i) Expl Orati On and Evaluati On ass Ets
Hardy follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas assets. u nder this method, all expenditures incurred in connection with and 
directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration and appraisal having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation  
of Mineral Resources’ are accumulated and capitalised in two geographical cost pools, which are not larger than a segment: India and Nigeria.
The capitalised exploration and evaluation costs are classified as Intangible assets – exploration, which includes the licence acquisition, 
exploration and appraisal costs relating either to unevaluated properties or properties awaiting further evaluation, but do not include costs 
incurred prior to having obtained legal right to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred.
Intangible exploration and evaluation cost relating to each licence or block remain capitalised pending a determination of whether or not 
commercial reserves exists. Commercial reserves are defined as proven and probable on a net entitlement basis. 
When a decision to develop these properties is taken or there is evidence of impairment, the costs are transferred to the cost pools within 
development/producing assets, when the commercial reserves attributable to the underlying asset have been established.
ii) Oil and Gas d Ev El OpmEnt and pr Oducin G ass Ets
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field by field basis. These comprise of the cost of developing commercial reserves 
discovered, putting them on production and the exploration and evaluation costs transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets, 
as stated in policy above. In addition, interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development 
projects, if any, and assets in the production phase, as well as cost of recognising provision for future restoration and decommissioning,  
are capitalised.
iii) dE c Ommissi Onin G
At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing, decommissioning facilities, plugging and abandoning wells. 
Decommissioning costs are estimated and stated at an amount representing the costs which would be incurred should decommissioning occur 
at the balance sheet date and the estimates are reassessed each year. The provision is assessed at prices ruling at the balance sheet date and, 
accordingly, it is not appropriate to discount this provision. The decommissioning asset is included within the tangible fixed assets with the cost of 
the related assets installed and are adjusted for any revision to the decommissioning costs and the provision thereof. The amortisation of the asset, 
calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is shown as ‘Decommissioning charge’ in the income statement.
iv) d isp Osal Of ass Ets
Proceeds from any disposal of assets are credited against the specific tangible or intangible capitalised costs included in the relevant cost pool and  
any loss or gain on disposal is recognised in the income statement. Gain or loss arising on disposal of a subsidiary is recorded in the income statement.
e) d epletion and impairment 
i) dE plE tiO n
The net book values of the producing assets are depreciated on a field by field basis using the unit of production method, based on proved and 
probable reserves taking into consideration future development expenditures necessary to bring the reserves into production. Hardy periodically 
obtains an independent third party assessment of reserves which is used as a basis for computing depletion. 
ii) impairmE nt
Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment, if any, where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be 
recoverable. In such circumstances, if the exploration asset has a corresponding development/producing cost pool, then the exploration costs are 
transferred to the cost pool and depleted on unit of production. In cases where no such development/producing cost pool exists, the impairment of 
exploration costs is recognised in the income statement. Impairment reviews on development/producing oil and gas assets for each field is carried 
out each year by comparing the net book value of the cost pool with the associated discounted future cash flows. If there is any impairment in a 
field representing a material component of the cost pool, an impairment test is carried out for the cost pool as a whole. If the net book value of the 
cost pool is higher, then the difference is recognised in the income statement as impairment.  48 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
1. a cc Ountin G pOlici Es (c Ontinu Ed)
f) property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
     depreciation  
   annual rate (%) method
Leasehold improvements   over lease period Straight line
Furniture and fixtures   20% Straight line
Information technology and computers   33% Straight line
Other equipment   20% Straight line
g) intangible assets
Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
    depreciation  
   annual rate (%) method
Computer software   33 % Straight line
h) investments 
Investments in publicly traded securities are treated as available-for-sale and are recognised at fair values based upon the quoted market prices 
on the balance sheet date. u nrealised gains and losses are recognised under equity – other reserves. On disposal of an investment, the cumulative 
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Investments in subsidiary companies are carried at cost in the financial statements of the  
Parent Company.
i) inventory
Inventory of crude oil is valued at lower of average cost and market. Average cost is determined based on actual production cost for the year. 
Inventories of drilling stores are accounted at cost including taxes duties and freight. Provision is made for obsolete or defective items where 
appropriate, based on technical evaluation.
j) f inancial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at fair value on the Group’s balance sheet based on the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by necessary provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
k) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Hardy and the Group are recorded at net proceeds after direct issue costs.
l) taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit of the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement as it excludes 
certain items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in years other than the current year and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The current tax liability is calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS (continued) 49 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investment in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled 
and it is possible that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more tax.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
m) f oreign currencies
Hardy maintains its accounts and the accounts of its subsidiary undertakings in u S dollars. Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the year end, all foreign currency assets are restated at the average of the buying and 
selling exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising out of actual payments/realisations and from the year 
end restatement are reflected in the income statement.
Rates of exchanges are as follows:
   3 1 december 3 1 december  
   2007 2006
£ to u S$   1.9828 1.9658
u S$ to Indian Rupees   39.420 44. 1700
n) Estimation uncertainty
(i) dE c Ommissi Onin G
The liability for decommissioning is based on the best estimate of the costs of decommissioning that will arise at some point in the future. 
Significant changes in costs or technological advancement could result in a material change to this provision.
(ii) dE plE tiO n
Depletion calculations are based on the best estimate of commercial reserves existing as at the balance sheet date. The determination of 
commercial reserves is based on assumptions which include those relating to the future price of crude oil, capital expenditure plans and the costs of 
production. Any changes in these assumptions could result in a material change in the depletion charge or the carrying value of associated assets.
o) l easing commitments
Rental charges or charter hire charges payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement as part of production cost over the 
lease term. 
p) share based payments
Hardy issues share options to directors and employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of the equity settled 
options determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the actual number of shares vested in  
the accounting period. In performing the valuation of these options, only conditions other than the market conditions are taken into account.  
Fair value is derived by use of the binomial model. The expected life used in the model is based on estimates of the management considering  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 50 Hardy Oil and Gas plc

The Directors do not consider there to be more than one class of business or geographic segment for the purposes of reporting. The Group is 
engaged in one business activity, the production of and exploration for oil and gas. The revenue, segment result and assets of the geographic 
segments, other than India, are nil or less than 10% of the total for all segments. Other income relates to technical services to third parties, 
overhead recovery from joint venture operations and miscellaneous receipts if any. Revenue arises from sale of oil produced from the contract  
area CY-OS-90/1-India and the revenue by destination is not materially different from the revenue by origin.

Other operating income relates to an insurance claim on business interruption received in 2006. The claim relates to an accident which occurred  
in November 2002. This income has been accounted for based on the acceptance of the claim by the underwriters and receipt of payment.
4. Gain On sal E Of inv Estm Ents
During the year 3,010,000 equity shares of Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (‘HOEC’) were sold for a consideration of u S$12,502,931, which

Indian operations of the Group are subject to a tax rate of 42.23% which is higher than u K and u S corporations tax rates. To the extent that the 
Indian profits are taxable in the u S and/or the u K, then those territories should provide relief for Indian taxes, principally under the provisions 
of double tax agreements. Based on the current expenditure plans, the Group anticipates that the tax allowances will continue to exceed the

i) intan GiBl E ass Ets – Expl Orati On
u nder u K GAAP , intangible fixed assets represented pre-licence acquisition costs and exploration and evaluation (‘E&E’) costs of individual licence 
interests held outside the depreciable cost pools pending determination of commerciality. u nder IFRS, intangible assets have been adjusted to 
write off cumulative pre-licence acquisition costs of u S$272,675 relating to the Nigeria cost pool, which was capitalised in intangible assets during 
2005. u nder u K GAAP , the cost of dry holes of exploration blocks pending determination of commerciality of reserves have been capitalised and 
included in the tangible fixed assets in the respective cost pools. u nder IFRS, the cost of dry holes of exploration blocks pending determination of 
commerciality are capitalised under Intangible cost – exploration and are not depleted. Accordingly, under IFRS an amount of u S$6,907,647 was 
transferred to Intangible assets – exploration from tangible fixed assets at 1 January 2006.
ii) pr OpErty, plant and EquipmE nt
u nder u K GAAP , tangible fixed assets comprised of oil and gas properties for which the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves had  
been established, recorded by reference to the geographic cost pools such as India and Nigeria. This caption also included certain exploration  
and evaluation expenditure incurred within the cost pools and other fixed assets, including non oil and gas specific plant and equipment,  
office furniture and IT equipment.
u nder u K GAAP , the loss on sale of asset and the loss on sale of wholly owned subsidiary undertakings amounting to u S$705,742 were capitalised 
as tangible fixed assets in 2004 and were also considered for charging depletion. Consequent to the above transfer, including the transfer of dry 
hole cost u S$6,907,647 to Intangible assets-exploration, the depletion charge of u S$732,500 was reversed and added to the cost of property, 
plant and equipment. u nder IFRS, Software costs u S$147,510 were transferred to Intangible assets – others on 1 January 2006. All the above 
resulted in a decrease of property, plant and equipment by u S$7,028,399.
iii) inv Estm Ent
u nder u K GAAP , the investment in publicly traded securities is held at cost. u nder IFRS, such investments are recognised at fair values based upon 
quoted market prices on balance sheet dates. As a result, the carrying value of investment has been increased by u S$15,750,130 at 1 January 
2006. Deferred tax has been provided on such unrealised gain on investment as of 1 January 2006 and the net gains at 1 January 2006 have been 
directly credited to equity – other reserves.
iv) pr Ovisi On f Or d Ef Err Ed taxati On
Consequential changes have been made to the provision for deferred taxes by u S$3,777,628 as at 1 January 2006, as a result of writing off  
pre-exploration expenditures, reducing depletion and reflecting investment at fair value.
v) rE tainE d Earnin Gs
The above adjustments resulted in a reduction in retained earnings by u S$358,509.

ended 31 December 2006.
a) c onsolidated income statement
i) dE plE tiO n
u nder u K GAAP , costs carried within each regional cost pool, which may contain a number of individual fields, were depleted on a unit of 
production basis by reference to that cost pool. u nder IFRS costs are still depleted on a unit of production basis but by reference to specific fields. 
u nder u K GAAP , unsuccessful exploration costs were transferred from intangible fixed assets to tangible fixed assets and depleted accordingly. 
u nder IFRS, the unsuccessful exploration costs are capitalised as intangible fixed assets pending determination of whether or not commercial 
reserves exist. As a result, the depletion charge for the year 2006 has been reduced by u S$3,184,503.
ii) t axati On
There is no impact on current tax. Deferred taxation has been adjusted by u S$945,188 to account for the impact of reduction in depletion for the 
year 2006.

u nder u K GAAP , the investment in publicly traded securities is held at cost. u nder IFRS, such investments are recognised at fair values based upon 
quoted market prices on balance sheet dates. As a result, the carrying value of investment has been adjusted by u S$8,839,874 at 31 December 
2006. Deferred tax has been adjusted on such unrealised gain on investment as of 31 December 2006. Net gains at 31 December 2006 have been

iv) sitE r Est Orati On d EpOsit
As at 31 December 2006, an amount of u S$2,784,660 was deposited with State Bank of India as site restoration fund. This amount was included in 
cash and cash equivalents and is now transferred to site restoration deposit under IFRS as at 31 December 2006.
v) pr Ovisi On f Or d Ef Err Ed taxati On
Consequential changes have been made to the provision for deferred taxes at 31 December 2006 as a result of writing off pre-exploration 
expenditures, reducing depletion and reflecting investment at fair value.
c) c onsolidated c ash f low statement
Cash flow statements prepared under IAS 7 presents the cash flows in three categories: operating activities, investing activities and financing 
activities, which are fewer than the categories under u K GAAP. Other than the reclassification and the movement of deposit of site restoration 
deposit from cash and cash equivalents, no other material changes were made.
Pre-licence costs were shown within ‘capital expenditure’ under u K GAAP. Since such costs are being expensed under IFRS, they have been 
classified within operating cash flows under IFRS. Purchases of software was taken under tangible fixed assets under u K GAAP have been 
reclassified to purchases of Intangible assets – others.

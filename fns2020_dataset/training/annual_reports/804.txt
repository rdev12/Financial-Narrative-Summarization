Go to www.amaramining.com to find out 
more information about our operations. Our resource base has grown to over 10 million ounces, an increase of
71% on last year, and we have demonstrated that the majority of this has
the potential to be mined economically. 
A T op 10 African Gold Mine
Prior to joining the Company, I recognised that the Yaoure Gold Project
(“Yaoure”) in Côte d’Ivoire had the potential to be much more than the small
oxide deposit many thought it was. The project had been previously
operated by Compagnie Mini ѐre d’Afrique (CMA), which had mined oxide
material from the CMA pit with an average headgrade of 3.9g/t.
Subsequently Amara acquired the project and continued to mine oxides in
the lower grade Yaoure Central pit, but drilling results showed grades in the
underlying sulphide zone of up to 3.5g/t over 30 metres. Upon becoming
Executive Chairman in April 2012, and with the support of our Group
Exploration Manager, Peter Brown, I immediately doubled the number of
drilling rigs on site and began a systematic exploration programme across
the deposit. As a result, Amara’s resources at Yaoure grew from 249,000
ounces to over six million ounces in an 18 month period, and the deposit
remains open along strike and down dip with the potential to grow further. 
It is safe to say that this has significantly exceeded my expectations.
The results of the Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) have
confirmed that not only will Yaoure deliver compelling financial returns, but
when in production it should rank as one of the top 10 largest gold mines 
in Africa. With a post-tax Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) of 32% and a 
post-tax Net Present Value (“NPV”) of US$688 million at a gold price of
US$1,250 per ounce and a discount rate of 8%, Yaoure offers average
production of 325,000 ounces per annum over a 12 year mine life. Due to
the excellent existing infrastructure, including low cost power, total cash
costs are forecast at just US$655 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs 
are US$691 per ounce.
Based upon the 8 million tonne per annum (“Mtpa”) scenario, the total
payback period for the project is 2.4 years. Importantly, the project’s
economics remain robust at significantly lower gold prices, with a post-tax
NPV of US$406 million and a post-tax IRR of 23% at a US$1,100 per
ounce gold price and an 8% discount rate.
T estimony to Yaoure’s Potential
In order to continue to drive Yaoure along the value curve, Amara
announced a placing and open offer on 21 March 2014, which raised 
£18.5 million (US$30.5 million). As a result of the placing, Amara is fully
funded to the point of delivering a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for 
Yaoure in Q1 2015. 
I was delighted that the fundraising received encouraging support from
both new and existing investors, which is testimony to Yaoure’s potential
and strengthens Amara’s shareholder base. An open offer was included as
part of the fundraising as we felt it was particularly important to give our
significant retail investor base the opportunity to participate in Amara’s
growth, as well as our institutional shareholders, in recognition for their
loyalty over the past challenging year. Any additional proceeds raised from
the open offer will be used to support the delivery of a Bankable Feasibility
Study (“BFS”).
Creating Growth for our Shareholders
The majority of the proceeds of the fundraising will be used to advance
Yaoure, with US$1.3 million allocated to expand the current in-pit resource
by targeting ‘information gaps’ in the resource area and US$8.4 million to
increase confidence in the resource by upgrading it from Inferred to the
Indicated category. Based on this drilling, I look forward to delivering two
Mineral Resource updates for the project in Q3 and Q4 2014, and with the
anticipated delivery of the PFS in Q1 2015, we plan to announce a maiden
reserve for the project. A further US$4.8 million has been allocated to
upgrade a portion of the Indicated resource to Measured, which I believe
will be an additional value driver for the Company. Following the delivery 
of the PFS, we will be well on track to completing a BFS in H2 2015. 
A Second Strong Growth Opportunity
The Baomahun Gold Project (“Baomahun”) in Sierra Leone is one of the
highest grade projects in West Africa. In June 2013 we completed the
Feasibility Study (“FS”) and demonstrated that the project is robust and
economically viable at a gold price of US$1,350 per ounce. Following the
FS, the objective of the first phase of the optimisation work was to
demonstrate that the high grade core could be exploited in a less capital
intensive manner, while retaining the long term upside potential available
from accessing the deeper resources from underground. This approach
ensures the project generates robust returns for all stakeholders, improving
the longevity of the mine. Following the placing we will commence a 
small-scale, highly targeted drilling campaign to increase Baomahun’s 
in-pit resources and continue to optimise our upfront capital estimate,
aiming to deliver the same strong returns from an open pit only scenario
and de-risking the underground targets. 
A Safe Pair of Hands
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow Board members for their hard work,
dedication and valuable guidance throughout the year. Despite difficult
market conditions, our Company has adapted well and we are now fully
funded to deliver our next major phase of growth. I look forward to
updating you over the course of 2014.

Company Overview / 03
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements
Despite the challenge of a weakening gold price, by the end of the year 
we had achieved all of these goals, while also reducing our cost base
significantly. I believe this will ensure that our Company is well-positioned
to adapt to an unpredictable market environment.
Production Strengthening in 2014
My key focus for the year was to deliver a smooth transition from the
Kalsaka Gold Mine (“Kalsaka”) to the Sega Gold Project (“Sega”). The 28%
fall in the gold price during 2013 created a number of challenges, including
reducing the mine life. While there is still a significant amount of low grade
ore at Kalsaka/Sega, it is no longer economic and accordingly a non-cash
impairment charge of US$14.7 million has been recognised against the
project’s carrying value of US$45 million.
Management took the decision to stop mining at Kalsaka in July 2013 as 
it had become unprofitable due to the combination of lower grade ore
(1.13g/t in H1 2013 compared to 1.26g/t in H1 2012) and reduced
throughput (773kt in H1 2013 compared to 815kt in H1 2012) combined
with the lower gold price.
Trucking from Sega commenced in September 2013, 16 months after the
acquisition of the project from Orezone Gold Corporation was completed.
While this is a rapid timeline from acquisition to production, the integration
of Sega occurred later than expected due to permitting delays. As
anticipated, Q4 2013 was the strongest quarter of the year for
Kalsaka/Sega as the higher grade material from Sega was realised.  
Full year production was 42,348 ounces in 2013 and we closed the year
with US$20.0 million of cash and liquid assets. Production is anticipated to
strengthen in 2014 with full year guidance of 60,000-70,000 ounces. Amara
expects to generate robust cash flow even in the current gold price
environment as the Sega open pits were re-optimised at a gold price of
US$1,100/oz in Q2 2013, reflecting the Company’s low risk approach.
A Changing Focus
Production is due to be completed at Kalsaka/Sega in Q1 2015 and I am
committed to unlocking the remaining value from the project and delivering
an efficient closure. While we are evaluating a number of opportunities to use
the heap leach plant going forwards, removing the production aspect of our
story may help to crystallise where the value of Amara is truly found: in our
growth assets.
Yaoure is one of the most exciting development assets in West Africa, with
large scale, long life, low cost production, and driving it along the value
curve is likely to deliver the best returns for our shareholders. The
opportunity exists to add significant value to the project for a relatively
small investment and I am determined not to dilute our shareholders’
interest in Yaoure by buying a small, near-term production asset that 
would require substantial management attention. Only a very compelling 
near-term production opportunity would balance this risk of dilution.
Cost Efficiency Measures Implemented
Following a year of strong investment in 2012, one of the key steps we 
took in 2013 to future proof Amara was to conduct a business review and
consequently implement cost savings across all areas of the Company. 
We achieved a 25% reduction in headcount between the 2012 year end
and the 2013 year end, which is expected to generate an annualised 
saving in excess of US$1.5 million. 
The Board accepted 15% salary cuts, with sliding scale cuts for
senior/middle management, equating to an additional annualised saving of
US$650,000, which gives a total annualised saving of over US$2.1 million.
Further cuts were implemented in general and administration (“G&A”)
expenditure, delivering a 25% saving compared to FY2012. Amara’s
strategy is to solidify its financial position and ensure the optimal use of
cash flow and this will continue throughout 2014, with further cost saving
measures continuing to be identified.
Working in Partnership with West Africa
One area we continued to prioritise was our investment in our host
countries. Having built and operated mines in Africa for the past 14 years, 
I have a thorough appreciation of the need for a company to maintain its
social licence to operate.
During the year we paid a total of US$8.2 million in tax in Burkina Faso,
including corporate tax, royalties and indirect taxation. We also contributed
directly to Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Liberia in respect of indirect
taxes paid, despite our operations not yet generating revenue. We have
continued to play an active role in community initiatives, focusing on our
three key interest areas of education, health and sustainable livelihood
development, and fortifying our partnerships with the governments and
local people of our host countries.
Despite the challenges we faced in 2013, we enter 2014 in good shape, 
as a result of the targets we’ve delivered upon, the partnerships we’ve
formed and the recent placing and open offer. I would like to thank all of 
my colleagues for their resilience, hard work and enthusiasm during what
has been a difficult year for the entire gold sector, and the Board for their
good counsel. 2014 will be another transformational year for Amara and 
we are well-positioned to deliver on our growth potential.

 Largest gold deposit in Côte d’Ivoire
Yaoure has the potential to be one of the top 10 largest gold mines in 
Africa by production. With average production of 325,000 ounces/annum
over a 12 year mine life, it outperforms the majority of other West African
development projects (see References on Inside Back Cover) delivering a
compelling IRR of 32% and a NPV of US$688 million at a gold price of
US$1,250 and a discount rate of 8%. It is the largest gold deposit in 
Côte d’Ivoire with 6.3 million ounces of resources (20Mt at 1.20g/t for
0.8Moz Indicated and 133Mt at 1.29g/t for 5.5Moz Inferred) and 
significant exploration upside potential.
The location of Yaoure is highly advantageous for developing a large-scale
gold mine due to its close proximity to the Kossou dam, which offers low-
cost hydro-electric power and abundant water. It is situated 40km from 
a dual carriageway linking the political capital of Yamoussoukro with the
commercial capital of Abidjan. As a brownfield site, the timeline from
exploration to production is expected to be minimised. Amara intends 
to utilise the excellent existing infrastructure to full effect, reducing the 
upfront capital requirement for the project.
Six Million Ounce Mineral Resource
During 2013 Yaoure’s Mineral Resources increased from 0.2 million ounces
Indicated (4.9Mt at 1.6g/t) to 6.3 million ounces as set out below,
representing an increase of 71% on Amara’s global resources.

Preliminary Economic Assessment
Based upon the updated Mineral Resource, Amara completed a PEA 
for Yaoure in Q1 2014, which confirmed that Yaoure is a compelling gold
development project. Importantly, the Project’s economics remain robust at
significantly lower gold prices, with a post-tax NPV of US$406 million and a
post-tax IRR of 23% at a US$1,100 per ounce gold price.
Key Parameters of Yaoure PEA

Ore mined Mt 94.6
Average head grade mined g/t 1.39
Waste mined Mt 492.0

T otal pre-production capital cost US$ million 408
T otal capital payback period years 2.4
T otal cash costs (including royalties) US$/oz 655
All-in sustaining costs US$/oz 691
The PEA supports the scenario of processing 8Mtpa of material from an
open pit operation to produce an average of 325,000 ounces of gold per
annum over an initial 12 year life. The metallurgy is simple and non-
refractory and the plant has been designed to process Yaoure’s substantial
sulphide resource, achieving a recovery rate of 95% using conventional
whole ore leach processing methods in a carbon-in-pulp circuit. The
project demonstrates strong economics due to the low processing cost
driven by an energy cost of 9 cents/kWh and high overall recoveries. T otal
cash costs (including royalties) are US$655 per ounce over the LOM and
all-in sustaining costs are US$691 per ounce.
Yaoure requires a plant and infrastructure capital cost of US$274 million,
with an additional US$92 million for an owner-operated mining fleet, which
has the potential to be deferred through leasing or excluded if contractor
mining is utilised, and US$42 million contingency. The total payback period
is 2.4 years and the NPV to total pre-production capital ratio is 1.68, a
significantly better outcome than many of its peers deliver.
A number of opportunities for optimisation were generated by the PEA 
and it is expected that they will further improve the project economics by
improving average head grades and reducing the overall strip ratio. They
also have the potential to decrease the upfront capital requirement. These
include selective mining of the CMA zone, staged development, process
selection, equipment optimisation, project layout and heap leach plant
relocation. Work is also on-going for 5 Mtpa and 6.5 Mtpa throughput
scenarios, which offer a lower upfront capital requirement although
production is slightly reduced, demonstrating Yaoure’s flexibility to
development at different scales. As Amara continues to move the project
towards a PFS, the Company will gain further understanding of these
scenarios to ensure the optimal path for development is understood.
Fully Funded to Delivery of PFS
The net proceeds of the placing and open offer will allow Amara to conduct
an in-fill drilling programme at Yaoure in 2014, deliver a PFS in Q1 2015,
and then subsequently upgrade a portion of the Indicated resource to the
Measured category in 2015, supporting a BFS.
The 2014 Yaoure drilling campaign is expected to be undertaken in 
two phases: 
� T o target the ‘information gaps’ within the Mineral Resource area to
increase the size of the Inferred resource
� T o upgrade the Inferred resources to the Indicated category to increase
the level of confidence in the resource
In addition, geotechnical, hydro-geological and further metallurgical test
work will be undertaken alongside further engineering studies and work 
on the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment to deliver the PFS.
As well as increasing the size of the Mineral Resource, the first phase 
of drilling has the potential to reduce the overall strip ratio of the deposit
(currently 5.2:1) by converting waste to ore in the mine plan. Amara expects
to release a Mineral Resource update following the completion of this
phase in Q3 2014. The second phase of drilling will focus on upgrading 
the Inferred resources within the US$950/oz proposed open pit to the
Indicated category by reducing the drill spacing from 100m x 100m to 
50m x 50m. Amara expects to release a second Mineral Resource update
following the completion of this phase in Q4 2014. This work will enable
Amara to deliver a PFS for the project.
In 2015, the Yaoure drilling campaign will focus on further upgrading a
portion of the Indicated resources at Yaoure to the Measured category. 
This will entail reducing the drilling spacing to 25-35m x 25-35m and will
further support a BFS for the project in H2 2015. Recovery rate through CIL plant

High Grade Deposit with Upside Potential
Baomahun is a feasibility stage gold project in central Sierra Leone. With a
high grade core and grades that strengthen at depth, the long term value of
the project is expected to be realised through a combined open pit and
underground scenario. However, Amara is focused on optimising the open
pit-only opportunity by conducting a highly targeted drilling campaign,
which aims to increase current in-pit resources and deliver the same 
strong returns through a lower risk approach.
Feasibility Study Delivered
In Q2 2013, Amara completed the FS for Baomahun, which confirmed that
the project is robust and economically viable. At a gold price of US$1,350
per ounce and an 8% discount rate, the project generates a post-tax IRR 
of 22% and a post-tax NPV of US$127 million.
Baomahun is an Archean-age deposit, with 1.21 million ounces of Probable
Reserves (23.27Mt at 1.62g/t). The resource base includes 2.24 million
ounces of Indicated resources (38.4Mt at 1.81g/t) and 0.54 million ounces
of Inferred resources (6.6Mt at 2.2g/t). It has simple, non-refractory
metallurgy and a strong recovery rate of 93.4% through a traditional
carbon-in-leach (“CIL”) plant. 
The Mineral Reserves support an open pit operation with an average
annual throughput of 2 Mtpa of ore through a CIL plant over an 11.5 year
production life. Gold production in the first year is expected to be 203,970
ounces at an average grade of 3.90g/t, generating strong cash flow through
the mining of the ore body’s high grade core. Average annual production
over the first six years is expected to be 148,550 ounces at an average
grade of 2.53g/t. T otal cash costs over the LOM are forecast to be US$799
per ounce using an owner-operator scenario, with total cash costs in year
one of US$582 per ounce.

The upfront capital cost for the project is US$151 million, with a further
US$86 million for the mining fleet and power generation plant, which could
be deferred by leasing these items. The total pre-production capital cost is
US$253 million including contingency, and the payback period for this
amount is three years.
Results of First Phase of Optimisation Work
Smaller Open Pit and Plant
In January 2014 Amara announced the results of the first phase of
optimisation work for the FS. This work focused on ‘right-sizing' the plant
to the deposit to reflect the current market conditions and the outlook for
the gold price. The desk top study demonstrated that a 1 Mtpa plant would
allow for the selective mining of the deposit’s higher grade core in a smaller
open pit and enable longer term mine feed from underground sources,
ensuring that the full potential of Baomahun’s Mineral Resource is
unlocked. Based upon this smaller scenario, the upfront capital cost is
reduced by 40% to US$90 million and the total pre-production capital cost
is reduced by 43% to US$143 million compared to the FS. 
A gold price of US$900 per ounce was used for pit optimisations and this
smaller open pit is capable of feeding a 1Mtpa plant for 10 years. Average
production remains robust, at 88,000 ounces per annum in years 1-6, and
average LOM total cash costs have decreased by 11% to US$711/oz, with
all-in sustaining cash costs expected to be US$975/oz.
At a gold price of US$1,350 per ounce which was used for the FS, the
open pit-only scenario delivers a post-tax IRR consistent with the FS at
22% and a post-tax NPV of US$80 million. In line with the current gold
price, the optimisation work was based upon a gold price of US$1,250 
per ounce, which generates a post-tax IRR of 17% and a post-tax NPV 
of US$50 million. These metrics are comparable with other similar gold
projects in West Africa, although Baomahun’s performance strengthens
significantly when an underground component to the project is introduced.
Transformational Underground Opportunity
Through the exploitation of Baomahun’s underground as well as the open
pit, there is the opportunity to extend the current 10 year LOM and boost
production in year 7 onwards. Based on the scoping study conducted by
the independent consultant Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Pty
Limited, the inclusion of material from the underground potentially
transforms Baomahun’s economics, with the post-tax IRR increasing to
25% and the post-tax NPV to US$192 million at a US$1,250 gold price.
The LOM doubles to 20 years, with an average production rate of 90,000
ounces per annum for the first 16 years. The deposit remains open at
depth, which further increases the opportunity for a stable, long-term
producing gold mine in Sierra Leone.
The underground opportunity can be further evaluated with little additional
expenditure in the near term. Due to the smaller pit shell, some of the
material previously categorised as suitable for open-pit mining within a
US$1,500 open pit will now be below the US$900 pit floor and thus could
be mined as part of the underground opportunity.
Strategy for Baomahun in 2014
There are three focuses to the on-going optimisation work for Baomahun:
expanding in-pit resources through exploration, continuing to evaluate the
underground opportunity and further reducing the upfront capital
requirement of the project.
Following a geological review, Amara is planning to use US$1.0 million 
of the proceeds of the placing to conduct a small-scale, near surface
drilling campaign. It will focus on geochemical anomalies in open pit shell
and has the potential to significantly improve the economics of an open pit
only scenario for Baomahun. It is expected to demonstrate greater
continuity of the high grade mineralisation of the deposit, increasing in-pit
resources and de-risking the project. In addition Amara will gain a more
thorough understanding of Baomahun’s underground opportunity by
generating longer term targets and evaluating the optimal place in the
orebody to transition between the open pit and the underground.  Review of Operations

Unlocking the Remaining Value
Kalsaka is a heap leach operation that has been in production since 2008
and has produced approximately 300,000 ounces during the past five
years. This small-scale production differentiated Amara from its
exploration-only peers, funding the Company’s G&A costs and supporting
exploration expenditure in the years when the gold price was stronger.
Amara is focused on unlocking the remaining value in Kalsaka/Sega
through robust cash generation in 2014 and an efficient closure, in addition
to exploring opportunities to realise the latent value of the operational team
and processing plant.
Kalsaka/Sega is located in central Burkina Faso, 150km from
Ouagadougou. The Sega deposit is 20km to the north of Kalsaka and
Amara successfully integrated the two projects during 2013 in order for
production to continue at the Kalsaka/Sega complex beyond mid-2013,
when Kalsaka’s minelife was due to end. Amara acquired the Sega deposit
from Orezone Gold Corporation in May 2012 and the Company took the
project through the permitting and construction phases in just 16 months.
Operational Overview
2013 was a difficult year for Kalsaka/Sega, with production of 42,348
ounces at a total cash cost of US$1,383 per ounce. On 2 January 2013, 
the London PM fix gold price was US$1,694 per ounce and at this level,
Kalsaka/Sega was forecast to generate strong cash flow. However, in April
2013 the gold price experienced its largest fall in a single day for 30 years
and over the course of 2013, the gold price fell by 28%, fixing at a low for
the year of US$1,192 per ounce on 28 June 2013. 
The challenge of operating in a falling gold price environment was
exacerbated by the lower grades being processed at Kalsaka, averaging
1.08g/t. Ore that would have been economic at a gold price above
US$1,500 per ounce became marginal at US$1,200 and thus Amara’s
management took the decision to halt mining at Kalsaka in July 2013. 
It had been anticipated that the transition to Sega would take place at the
time that mining ceased at Kalsaka, however due to permitting delays,
trucking commenced from Sega in mid-September 2013. 
Once the material from Sega became available, production strengthened
significantly at Kalsaka/Sega, with an 86% increase in production in Q4
2013 to 14,926 ounces, compared to Q3 2013. The average headgrade of
the Sega material stacked in Q4 was 1.77g/t, a 61% increase on the
average headgrade of the Kalsaka ore processed during the rest of the year.
In line with Amara’s low risk approach, the mine plan for Sega was re-
optimised in Q2 2013 at a gold price of US$1,100 per ounce and Amara
expects to generate robust cash flow in 2014. Full year production guidance
is 60,000-70,000 ounces at a total cash cost of US$900-1,000 per ounce.

Opportunities for Kalsaka/Sega beyond 2014
Production is expected to conclude at Kalsaka/Sega in Q1 2015. The cost
of environmental closure of the mine has been set aside in a bonded bank
account. The rehabilitation work for the site has been conducted on an on-
going basis throughout the mine’s life as mining moved from one pit to the
next, so the final phase of rehabilitation once Kalsaka/Sega’s mine life ends
is not expected to exceed the monies set aside.
Although Sega’s higher grade resources will be exhausted by the end of
2014, there remain significant lower grade resources on the Kalsaka and
Sega licence areas. These resources could be mined economically in a
higher gold price environment, however Amara is focused on higher value
opportunities in the near term. 
A small amount of gold is expected to continue to leach from the
Kalsaka/Sega leach pads throughout 2015, however Amara is now
evaluating opportunities for the plant after processing is complete. 
Heap leach plants are relatively mobile, so it could be relocated to another
oxidized gold deposit in order to maintain Amara’s status as a producer.
However, as management is focused on minimising dilution to its
shareholders’ interest in Yaoure, only a very compelling near-term
production opportunity would generate returns consummate to Yaoure.
Alternatively, the plant could be sold to strengthen Amara’s balance sheet.
Amara has two adsorption-desorption-recovery (“ADR”) plants, one at
Kalsaka/Sega and one at Yaoure, so the ADR plant at Kalsaka/Sega could
continue to process the remaining solution leaching from the Kalsaka/Sega
leach pads in 2015 and the Yaoure ADR plant could be relocated or sold
with the Kalsaka/Sega stacking and agglomeration circuit. Both options 
for the plant deliver upside for shareholders although as there is no
certainty that either scenario will be possible, Amara’s business model is
focused on generating the best value from Kalsaka/Sega in its final year 
of material production.

Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements
Amara is committed to working with the highest level of respect for the
communities and environments in which we operate, along with our
employees, while pursuing value for our shareholders. Our goal is to
achieve a socially responsible business that balances economic prosperity
with environmental stewardship and ethical business practice. T aking this
approach allows Amara to ensure that a positive and sustainable legacy 
is left beyond the lives of our mining operations.
Our Approach
Amara has had a presence in West Africa for over nine years and we are
proud to contribute to the economic growth of communities, regions and
countries to bring sustainable socio-economic benefits to the places where
we work. Our CSR programme has four key pillars, which are as follows:
� The safety and wellbeing of our employees
� The development of our employees
� Environmental responsibility
� Stakeholder relations at local, regional and national levels 
We understand that maintaining our social licence to operate is central 
to our culture of responsible mining and exploration.
During the year we paid US$8.2 million in tax and royalties to the Burkina
Faso Government, plus the indirect taxation we bring to all our host
countries in the form of payroll and other taxes. We will continue to work
with the relevant authorities in order to ensure we achieve the optimum
long-term structure for our company and all of our stakeholders across 
our host countries.
Health and Safety
Amara is committed to the highest standards of safety at each of its
operations. A comprehensive safety system is in place at the Kalsaka/Sega
mine, in accordance with OHSAS 18001: 2007, and a safety performance
indicator been incorporated within the bonus scheme at Kalsaka to
reinforce the importance of safe working practices to all staff. 
At Kalsaka, we achieved 7.8 million man-hours without a lost time injury, or
50 months, to October 2013. In late October a driver working for our mining
contractor sustained an arm fracture, ending this significant period without
an LTI. Amara has now redoubled its efforts and it remains our philosophy
that safety is the responsibility of each individual, focusing on the need for
each employee to practise a high level of safety in the workplace.
Across our assets, health initiatives were implemented to improve the
wellbeing of our employees, including the provision of anti-malaria nets 
and HIV sensitisation campaigns.
Development of our Employees
Contributing to Economic Advancement
Amara believes that the most important part of any company is its people.
Our activities provide direct and indirect employment, training and work
experience to many West Africans, as well as creating an immediate
revenue stream for the local economies, regions and Governments. At the
end of 2013, more than 95% of Amara’s employees at its operations were
West African and a high proportion of senior roles were held by West
Africans. Amara is committed to providing new employment opportunities
and assisting the economic development of Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone,
Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia. 
Training and Development
The training and development of our teams across our assets, in our offices
in West Africa and in our head office in London is an ongoing programme.
One example of this is an employee in Burkina Faso, Tiendrebeogo
Nongma Etienne, who was employed as a light vehicle driver. Amara
recognised his potential to take on more responsibility and do a more
skilled role, so he was given training to become a crane operator. 
He now works in this role at the Kalsaka/Sega gold mine. Environmental Responsibility
Amara is dedicated to minimising the environmental impact of our
operations to the reasonable practical level. We educate our employees 
in sustainable business practices and we conduct our business in
accordance with recognised industry standards and applicable
environmental laws and regulations.
Energy, water, greenhouse gases, biodiversity and land are the main
environmental areas affected by our operations. We use a number of
metrics to measure our environmental impact across these areas. As part
of overall environmental controls, we also monitor our management
processes for handling and disposing of waste and hazardous materials
used at our operations.
We assess our environmental performance through several tools including
visual inspection, auditing, data collection, inventories, measurements and
systematic observations. We use the results to implement corrective
measures and as inspiration for ways we can improve our performance 
in the future.
In 2013, we are proud to report that we did not have any 
environmental incidents.
Stakeholder Relations
Amara takes a long term view in matters relating to local communities and
our stakeholders at both regional and national level. We want to ensure a
sustainable legacy continues beyond the lives of our operations and we
have appointed country managers in each of our host countries to ensure
our support is given to the most beneficial initiatives. As a result of the
weakening gold price in 2013, Amara’s profitability was reduced in line 
with the rest of the gold sector. Therefore the importance of ensuring that
we target the initiatives that are likely to have the most significant impact 
on local people was further heightened.
We recognise that we have a responsibility to enhance the communities 
in which we operate and we see maintaining our social licence as a key
priority. The Company’s CSR mandate states that our community 
initiatives across West Africa have three key focuses:
� Education
� Healthcare
� Sustainable livelihoods
Burkina Faso
Education continued to be at the heart of Amara’s community initiatives 
in Burkina Faso in 2013.
Amara built two new classrooms at a local school and housing for teachers.
We have seen from previous initiatives that if environmental conditions are
improved for teachers, they are able to deliver a better quality of education
and local children’s educational performance is improved. 
Amara also contributed to local administration by giving financial support to
the police and mayoral team close to Kalsaka/Sega to allow them to carry
out their duties more effectively.
We believe that Amara has a responsibility to use local produce for its
camp restaurants where possible, so in line with Amara’s agricultural policy
across its assets, an agricultural project to supply Kalsaka/Sega with
vegetables, chicken and mutton was introduced during the year.

Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Sierra Leone
Amara took a three-pronged approach to stakeholder relations in Sierra
Leone, with education, healthcare and sustainable livelihood initiatives
advanced during 2013.
T eaching materials were provided to Kortuhun, Ahmadiyya and Christian
Community Primary Schools and monthly stipends were given to teachers.
Amara also funded sporting activities for two other primary schools close to
Baomahun. In addition, we established a vocational school to teach maths
and literacy to adults, with 30 local young women currently participating in
classes with four tutors from the Baomahun community. Following the
success of this vocational school, Amara is in the process of establishing 
a second literacy class in Pujehun village, 4km to the north of Baomahun.
Amara also contributed to local governance by providing financial support
to community leaders in order to motivate them to be more responsive in
resolving conflicts within the communities. T o compensate for the period of
low exploration activity on the Baomahun resource area, Amara is planning
to fund a skills training centre for local people to enable them to seek
employment in other areas.
Amara maintained its support for sustainable livelihood programmes in
2013, with our Eco-Livelihood project continuing to progress and benefit
local people. Amara funded tools and a technician to teach local people
how to maintain vegetable gardens and we built two fish ponds, with 
a third to be constructed by local people following the success of the first
two. Amara also built a drying floor for Kavorma village to minimise post-
harvest food losses and the camp agricultural plot is now supplying
Baomahun kitchen with a variety of vegetables including okra, lettuce,
maize and peppers.
Healthcare was a key priority for Amara in Sierra Leone in 2013, with
buckets and cups donated to schools to enable their pupils to access clean,
safe drinking water. In 2012 we contributed to local health efforts by erecting
a temporary shelter in Baomahun village for cholera patients and supplied
anti-cholera medication. In 2013, we made modifications to the shelter in
order for it to accommodate more patients and we made improvements to
the Baomahun clinic. T o mark World AIDs Day, Amara participated in a
charity football match and supported an awareness campaign.
Côte d’Ivoire
In early 2011 Côte d’Ivoire experienced a political crisis and during the
period of instability that followed, Amara’s planned community initiatives
were put on hold. As peace was gradually restored and exploration activity
at Yaoure accelerated, Amara began to resume its plans during late 2012
and throughout 2013.
Unemployment is a significant problem in Côte d’Ivoire, so to assist in
tackling it in the area around Yaoure, Amara recruited local young people 
to work with Amara’s geology team. 68 young people were recruited to
take part in the trenching and surveying programmes, with tasks including
clearing areas for exploration, geochemistry, mapping artisanal mining
areas and soil sampling. We also hosted site visits by geology students at
nearby Yamoussoukro University to give them insight into the workings of a
mine site and conducted educational campaigns to highlight the dangers of
artisanal mining to local people, particularly in terms of the use of cyanide
and mercury by gold washers.
Improving infrastructure continued to be a focus in Côte d’Ivoire in 2013,
with building materials donated to local people to fortify their houses and 
to build a shelter to host official ceremonies. Mattresses and beds were
also given to the policemen in Angovia village, the village closest to Yaoure,
to improve their living conditions.

Amara was not immune to the challenging market conditions, with the
Kalsaka/Sega gold mine experiencing weak grades as Kalsaka reached the
end of its mine life and exploration delivering only marginal additional
ounces in Burkina Faso. These issues have led to the recognition of an
impairment against the Kalsaka/Sega Mineral Resource. Pleasingly, neither
of Amara’s growth assets, Yaoure in Côte d’Ivoire and Baomahun in Sierra
Leone, which represent the majority of Amara’s assets, are impaired,
underlining the strong growth opportunity within the Company’s
development pipeline.
Income Statement
Group revenue dropped by US$38.9 million (43%) to US$52.4 million in
2013 due to a 29% fall in gold sold in the year aligned with a 20% fall in the
average gold price. The combination of weaker production and a weaker
gold price generated an EBITDA loss of US$1.8 million from Kalsaka/Sega,
leading to an overall EBITDA loss for the Group of US$7.6 million.
The 21% fall in production at Kalsaka/Sega to 42,348 ounces in 2013 was
due to a 13% fall in the volume of material processed off-set by a small rise
in the average grade. Processed volumes were low due to the down-time
between cessation of stacking of Kalsaka ore and the start-up at Sega.
Processed grades were weak prior to the commencement of stacking from
Sega. With the strongest grades being processed in Q4 2013 from Sega at
an average of 1.77g/t in the quarter, the shortfall in production in the year is
greater than the shortfall in gold processed due to the heap leach cycle; the
quantity of gold locked up in the heap and recovery circuit at 31 December
2013 increased by over 2,700 ounces compared to the 2012 year-end due
to the high year-end grades.
Costs at Kalsaka/Sega in 2013 rose by 37%, driven by the reduced
throughput and higher mining costs. The latter were impacted by the
increased cost of mining harder, transitional material at the end of the
Kalsaka life, together with the inclusion of haulage from the furthest pits
within the Kalsaka licence area, as well as from the Sega pits. Processing
costs have also shown a modest increase due to the costs associated with
crushing the harder Sega ore. Other operating costs in Burkina Faso also
showed a modest overall increase due to costs associated with the
commencement of Sega. Despite the loss in the year, a total of US$4.9
million of direct taxation was paid to the Burkina Faso government in 2013
as required under Burkinabe law. A taxation debtor totalling US$2.4 million
is repayable by means of offset against future profits, or on winding up of
the local company.
T otal cash costs including royalties at Kalsaka/Sega totalled US$1,383 per
ounce in 2013, a 37% increase compared to 2012, which primarily reflects
the higher mining costs and the spreading of G&A costs over a smaller total
production base. Savings in G&A costs totalling US$2.2 million were
realised in 2013 in London, off-setting the weaker operational performance.
This included savings of US$0.7 million from salary reductions of up to
15% taken by all Directors and senior staff, together with US$1.0 million 
of savings from staffing reductions.
“ 2013 was a challenging year for 
the gold sector, with a precipitous fall
in the gold price making asset
impairments and operational losses
common place. ” Financial Review
Business Review / 15
Amara Mining plc

With the weaker operational performance, an impairment charge of
US$30.4 million was recognised against the Group’s Burkina Faso assets
in 2013, including US$9.7 million against exploration opportunities that do
not carry sufficient grade for exploitation at the current gold price and a
provision totalling US$3.2 million against the low grade stockpile and gold
in process. A further US$2.6 million was written-off the old heap leach plant
in Côte d’Ivoire as with the substantial sulphide Mineral Resources unable
to be processed via heap leach it is unlikely to be utilised and accordingly
has been written-down to scrap value.
Excluding the impairment charges, Amara generated a loss attributable to
equity shareholders of US$17.1 million or 9.88 cents per share.
The 2009-2011 tax inspection in Burkina Faso was finalised during the 
year with a final settlement set at US$1.7 million, of which US$1.0 million
was paid in the year. This amount had been fully provided in the 2012

Despite delivering an EBITDA loss of US$7.6 million, the Group’s
operations generated net cash inflows of US$12.2 million in 2014 due to
the support of Kalsaka/Sega’s suppliers who assisted with the transition
from Kalsaka to Sega in a volatile gold market. With higher grades stacked
in Q4 2013, there was a significant increase in the amount of gold delivered
to the heap leach plant, which will assist in generating the funds to repay
the creditors in 2014.
In 2013 Amara continued to invest in its assets and a full analysis 
is set out below.

The most notable outcome of this investment was the 6.3 million ounce
Mineral Resource delineated at Yaoure, a project that forms the basis of
Amara’s 2014 investment plans. The outcome of the recent PEA clearly
demonstrated that Yaoure has the potential to be one of the most
compelling development properties in West Africa and in 2014 the
Company will progress the project towards the delivery of a PFS.
At Baomahun, the investment delivered a FS, which demonstrated that the
project is robust at US$1,350 per ounce. In 2014 further low cost
optimisation work and a targeted drilling programme to test the continuity
of the Mineral Resources will be undertaken.
At Kalsaka/Sega, the investment delivered a plant upgrade, which allowed
the harder Sega material to be processed from Q4 2013. Exploration
delineated a number of low grade opportunities for mine life extension but
at the current gold price these are not economic and accordingly, in 2014
investment will be significantly reduced as the asset reaches maturity.
Following the recent placing and open offer (as detailed in note 24) the
Group’s financial position has been strengthened and Amara is now fully
funded to advance its key assets to the next stage of development.

Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements
The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Principal activities 
Amara is a gold mining and exploration company with assets in 
West Africa. Further information is included in the Chairman’s Statement,
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement and Business Review.
Business review and future 871
The Business Review is presented on pages 4 to 15 of this Annual Report.
The Business Review contains certain forward-looking statements,
particularly concerning anticipated production at the Kalsaka/Sega
mine and development plans at the Baomahun and Yaoure projects. These
statements have been made by the Directors in good faith based on the
information available at the time of the approval of the Annual Report. 
By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances
that will or may occur in the future. Actual results may differ from those
expressed in such statements depending on a variety of factors such as, inter
alia, increased costs, possible variations in mineral resources, grades or
recovery rates, disruption of supplies, failure of equipment or processes to
operate as anticipated, a weaker gold market and changes in exchange rates.
Key performance indicators
The Group’s key performance indicators are monitored on a monthly basis
(and more frequently as required) and reported to the Board of Directors.
They focus on production statistics, resource and reserve updates and
exploration expenditure; these are set out in the Business Review.
Results and dividends
The Group made a consolidated loss after taxation for the year of US$52.1m
(2012: US$2.4 million profit). The Directors do not recommend the payment
of a dividend (2012: nil).
Share capital and share options
Details of the share capital of the Company are set out in note 13 to the
financial statements. Details of share options outstanding at 31 December
2013, together with options granted during the year are set out in note 20

2014 and prior to the placing of 107,058,823 shares and open offer of
up to 24,468,439 shares as detailed below.
Financial instruments
The Group’s exposure to financial risks and its policies in relation to the use
of financial instruments are explained in note 18 to the financial statements.
Events after the reporting period
On 21 March the Company announced the placing of 107,058,823 ordinary
shares of 1p at 17p together with an open offer to existing shareholder of
up to 24,468,439 additional ordinary shares of 1p also priced at 17p. In the
event of a full take up on the open offer the Company will have 351,743,216
shares in issue.
The placing and open offer was subject to shareholder approval which was
sought and approved at a General Meeting held on 11 April 2014.
Health and safety
The Group remains committed to the highest standards of health and safety.
Details are provided in the Corporate Social Responsibility review on page 11.
Corporate governance
A report on corporate governance is provided on pages 18 to 19.
Going concern
Included in the Group’s cash flow forecasts are amounts from the placing
of shares announced on 21 March and approved by shareholders on 
11 April. The receipt of the funds from the placing has yet to be received as
such receipt is subject to certain administrative tasks. However, the placing
is guaranteed by irrevocable contracts and has been approved by the
Board of Directors and the shareholders; accordingly the inclusion 
of such inflow of funds is deeded suitable for cash flow planning purposes.
Based on current performance and forecast cash flows, the Directors are
satisfied that the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet its financial
obligations as they fall due for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the
Directors have concluded that it is appropriate for the financial statements
to be prepared on a going concern basis.
Provision of information to auditor
In the case of each of the Directors who are Directors of the Company 
at the date when this report is approved:
� So far as they are individually aware, there is no relevant audit
information which the Company’s auditor is unaware of; and
� They have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
BDO LLP has confirmed its willingness to continue in office, and a
resolution for its reappointment will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. Directors’ Report

Governance / 18
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Corporate governance 
The Board acknowledges the importance of the guidelines set out in the
UK Corporate Governance Code and the Quoted Companies Alliance
(QCA) published Corporate Governance Guidelines and complies with
these so far as is appropriate having regard to the size and nature of 
the Company.
The Company has in place appropriate guidance, training and
implementation of procedures to ensure compliance with the UK Bribery Act.
Board of Directors and independence
The Company supports the concept of an effective board leading and
controlling the Company. The Board is responsible for approving Company
policy and strategy. It holds regular Board meetings and is supplied with
appropriate and timely information in order to discharge its duties. Briefing
papers are distributed to all Directors in advance of board meetings, and all
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are
followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The
articles of association provide that any Director who was not appointed or
re-appointed at one of the preceding two annual general meetings will be
subject to re-election.
The Board currently comprises eight Directors, three of whom are executive
and hold the key operational positions. The remaining non-executives bring
a breadth of experience and knowledge to assist and advise the executive
Board members. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires that small companies should
have at least two independent non-executive Directors. The Board
considers all non-executive Directors to be independent. The Chairman 
of the Board is J McGloin.
Board meetings and sub-committees
The full Board met on 12 occasions during the period with full attendance
from each Director at every Board meeting.
The Nomination committee, Audit Committee, Health, Safety and
Environment Committee, the T echnical Committee and the Remuneration
Committee all met once during the year with full attendance by Committee
members.
The Board has established appropriately constituted Audit, Remuneration,
Nomination, Health, Safety and Environment and T echnical Committees
with formally designated responsibilities.
In addition, sub-Board Committees have been convened including the
Executive Committee which includes the Group Head of Projects and
Group Head of Exploration and a Corporate Social Responsibility
Committee to be headed by P Hain.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by G Stanley, the other members being

internal control procedures, accounting procedures, accounting policies, the
appointment, independence, objectivity, terms of reference and fees of the
external auditor and other related functions as the Board may require. The
external auditor has direct access to the members of the Audit Committee,
without the presence of the executive Directors, for independent discussions. Directors’ Report

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by P Cowley, the other members
being H Faul and G Stanley. It determines the terms and conditions of
employment and annual remuneration of the executive and non-executive
Directors. It takes into consideration external data and comparative third
party remuneration and has access to professional advice outside the
Company. The key policy objectives of the Remuneration Committee in
respect of the Company’s executive Directors and other senior executives
are: (a) to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their personal
contribution to the Company’s overall performance, and (b) to ensure that
due regard is given to the interests of the Company’s shareholders and to
the financial and commercial health of the Company. Remuneration of
executive Directors comprises basic salary, discretionary bonuses,
participation in the Company’s share option schemes or other equity based
remuneration schemes, pension plan contributions and other benefits. 
The Company’s remuneration policy with regard to options and other
equity based remuneration schemes is to maintain an amount of not more
than 10 per cent of the issued share capital in options or other equity
incentives for the Company’s management and employees, which may
include the issue of new options or other equity incentives in line with any
new share issues. 
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee, which leads the process for Board
appointments and makes recommendations to the Board, is chaired by 
J McGloin, the other members being P Cowley and G Stanley. 
Health, Safety and Environment Committee
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee, which is responsible for
ensuring that the Board responsibly covers these areas, is chaired by 
P Spivey, the other members being P Cowley and H Faul. 
T echnical Committee
The T echnical Committee is responsible for providing assurance to the
Board as to the operational performance and operating risks of the
Company, with particular regard to those areas where technical
understanding is required. It is chaired by H Faul, the other members being
P Cowley and G Stanley. 
The Company takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the Directors and
relevant employees comply with the provisions of the AIM rules relating to
dealings in its securities.
Service contracts
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director are on
permanent employment contracts with notice periods of one year, one year
and six months respectively. Non-executive Directors have formal letters of
appointment setting out their duties and are three year service contracts
terminable at one month’s notice.
Relations with shareholders
The Company fully values the views of its shareholders and is committed 
to maintaining the highest standards of disclosure ensuring that all
investors and potential investors have the same access to high quality,
relevant information in an accessible and timely manner to assist them 
in making informed decisions. 
Members of the Board attempt to regularly meet with investors, brokers
and other institutions to inform them of short and long term objectives of
the Group. The AGM also enables both institutional and private investors 
to communicate with the Board and are encouraged to ask questions.
The Company operates and updates its website www.amaramining.com
regularly, uploading recent investor presentations, resource information 
and financial reports in a timely manner.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining a sound system
of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the
Company’s assets. These internal controls are designed to provide
reasonable assurance to users and stakeholders regarding the reliability 
of the Group financial statements. Inherent limitations in control systems
mean that only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance can be provided
against material misstatement or loss.
T aking account of the size and nature of the Group the Board has
implemented processes for identifying and evaluating the key operational,
financial and compliance risks facing the Group. Under the direction of the
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director, and with guidance
from the non-executive Directors, this process continues to evolve as the
Group grows in size. Where weaknesses are identified, appropriate
amendments are made to the control systems.
Details of the key risks that the Group is exposed to are set out on pages
20 and 21.
Corporate social responsibility
A review of the Group’s corporate and social responsibility values,
objectives and actions is set out on pages 10 to 13. Directors’ Report
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Governance / 20
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Risk
Operational Risk
Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk. Unexpected
events could result in damage to the Company’s property or otherwise
give rise to financial liability which could affect the ability of the Company
to continue to operate profitably.
A violation of health and safety laws or regulations could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business due to a requirement to
implement new compliance measures, shut down all or a portion of a
mine, or the loss of the right to mine.
Mining operations have inherent risks and liabilities associated with
environmental laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving. There
may be unforeseen environmental issues under existing or updated
legislation which could expose the Company to additional liabilities and
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.
Risk
Exposure to Cost Pressures
Amara is exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the purchase price of
diesel, steel and reagents used in gold production.
Amara is also subject to increases in the market prices for services and
equipment (e.g. mining contractors, drilling, tyres, vehicles etc).
Risk
Reliability of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
The Company’s stated mineral reserves and resources are estimates
based on a range of assumptions, including geological, metallurgical and
technical factors; there can be no assurance that the anticipated tonnages
or grades will be achieved.
Risk
Exploration and Development Risk
The success of the Company is dependent on the discovery and/or
acquisition of mineral reserves and mineral resources and the successful
development of mines therefrom. Significant risk exists within technical,
legal and financial aspects of the development of mines, which may have
an adverse effect on the Company’s business.
A note of the risks associated with ore reserve estimates is set out within
the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements within the accounting
policies.
Risk
Gold Price
Amara is exposed to commodity price risk as detailed in note 18 to the
financial statements. In addition, reserve calculations and LOM plans using
significantly lower gold prices could result in material write-downs of the
Company’s investments in mining properties.
Comment and mitigating actions
The Board has implemented a number of processes and discussion
forums to enable management to monitor the operational performance of
the Company's production and exploration performance. 
Health and safety and the environment are key considerations for the
Board who have made it a priority to ensure that good practices are at the
core of the Company's culture. The operational Directors receive regular
reports on any health and safety concerns by the mine and country
managers to ensure that the codes of the Company are being
implemented correctly to ensure the safety of our employees, local
communities and the environment.
Comment and mitigating actions
The Company seeks to minimise its usage of input materials. It also
monitors the commodity prices constantly and considers whether hedging
might be appropriate. No hedging was entered into during 2013.
Amara seeks to negotiate the best possible rates for all services and
products it receives, taking into account not only price, but service quality
and reliability.
Comment and mitigating actions
Amara’s mineral resources and mineral reserves are prepared either by in-
house staff or by third party consultants who have considerable
experience and are certified by appropriate bodies.
Amara’s resources are presented in accordance with NI 43-101 and the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards.
Comment and mitigating actions
The Board ensures that there is a regular dialogue with the Group
Exploration Manager and his team, together with reviewing the reporting
data to focus resources and expenditure upon key exploration and
development targets.
Comment and mitigating actions
Amara’s objective is to provide maximum exposure to the price of gold
and, as such, a policy of not hedging gold has been adopted. The
Company retains its focus on keeping operating costs as low as possible. Risk
Financing Risk
The Company requires substantial funds for exploration and development
of mineral properties. The Company may also incur major unanticipated
liabilities or expenses. The Company’s access to capital is largely
determined by its ability to compete for investor support for its projects.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the
necessary financing in a timely manner on acceptable terms to complete
its investment strategy.
Risk
Political Risk
The Company’s activities are subject to various laws and regulations
governing the mining industry. Although all activities are currently carried
out in material compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, no
assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted
or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which
could limit or curtail the Company’s current activities and development
plans and have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial
position. 
The Company’s activities are focused on West Africa and the success of
the Company will be influenced by associated legal and political risks.
Countries in the region have experienced political instability and economic
uncertainty in the past. Government policy in the countries in which the
Company operates can be unpredictable, and the institutions of
government and market economy may be unstable and subject to rapid
change, which may result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s
operations.
The renewal of exploration and exploitation licences is an area of risk given
the countries in which the Company operates. Whilst the Company has in
place legal titles (and the right to renewal) on the assets in its portfolio,
there remains a risk to the Company that changes within regimes could
put the ownership of these assets at risk.
The Company is also at risk of taxation reviews that may change, 
or apply more stringently the laws and regulations of the countries in 
which it operates.
Risk
Contractual Risk
The Company has several contractual relations that could potentially end
in dispute and legal settlement given their complexity - such examples
being the dispute with the mining contractor as disclosed in note 22.
Risk
Community Relations
A failure to adequately engage or manage relations with local communities
and stakeholders could have a direct impact on the Company’s ability to
operate at its projects.
Comment and mitigating actions
The Board regularly review the levels of discretionary spending on capital
items and exploration expenditure to ensure that there is sufficient
headroom should unexpected liabilities arise or if cash flow is reduced
through a decline in the gold price. This includes regularly updating
working capital models, reviewing actual costs against budget and
assessing potential impacts on future funding requirements and
performance targets.
Comment and mitigating actions
The Company currently has in place political risk insurance covering
expropriating acts and contingent currency inconvertibility or exchange
transfer embargo with respect to the Yaoure, Kalsaka and Baomahun
properties.
The Company actively engages the governments and policy makers to
discuss all regulatory developments applicable to the Company, in
particular in relation to taxation and the mining codes. The Company
continues to have a series of discussions with the government to resolve
outstanding disputes.
Comment and mitigating actions
The Company employs the use of contract and industry experts to ensure
that any contract entered into does not leave the Company exposed to a
potentially onerous outcome.
Comment and mitigating actions
In addition to its existing corporate social responsibility programmes, the
group is implementing a number of additional initiatives to improve and
build on local community relations, and has increased its social
management capacity.

Remuneration policy
The Company's policy is to ensure that the members of the Board are fairly remunerated with regard to responsibilities undertaken and with reference 
to comparable pay levels in the UK and in the mining industry. In addition, the Company has a flexible approach to the awarding of discretionary cash
bonuses and share options to ensure that it is able to attract, motivate and retain Directors (and senior management) of the calibre necessary to ensure 
that the Company meets its objectives.
The awarding of salary increases, bonuses and share options to Board members is reviewed and confirmed by the Remuneration Committee following
guidance from the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Responsibilities
Strategic Report
Governance / 24
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare
the group and company financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or
loss of the group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare
financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock
Exchange for companies trading securities on the AIM market. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
� state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
� prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the
financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements
are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to
the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Section 414C of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) requires that the
Company inform members as to how the Directors have performed their
duty to promote the success of the Company, by way of a Strategic
Report. Set out below are the applicable reporting requirements under the
Act for the purposes of the Strategic Report, together with guidance to
other applicable sections of the 2013 Annual Report, which are
incorporated by reference into the Company’s Strategic Report.

Approval of the Board
(Section 414D (1) of the Act)
This strategic report contains certain forward-looking statements that are
subject to the usual risk factors and uncertainties associated with the gold
exploration and production business. While the Directors believe the
expectation reflected herein to be reasonable in light of the information
available up to the time of their approval of this report, the actual outcome
may be materially different owing to factors either beyond the Group’s
control or otherwise within the Group’s control but, for example, owing to a
change of plan or strategy. Accordingly, no reliance may be placed on the
forward-looking statements.

Financial Statements / 32
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these
financial statements are set out below. These policies have been
applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical
cost basis in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the
UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of policies and reported amounts in the financial
statements. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or
complexity, or areas where assumptions or estimates are significant to 
the financial statements are disclosed in the accounting policies below. 
The financial information is presented in US Dollars. The functional currency
for Amara Mining plc (the “Company”) and all material entities in the Group
is the US Dollar. Consequently, there are no exchange differences on the
translation of subsidiaries and the currency translation reserve will 
remain frozen.
The Group has chosen to present its financial statements in US Dollars as 
it is the currency most-relevant to the shareholders given the nature of the
Group’s activities.
A separate statement of comprehensive income for the parent company
has not been presented as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act
2006. The parent company made a loss of US$41,517,000 (2012:
US$7,263,000 profit). 
Nature of business and going concern
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in
England. The address of the registered office is 4th Floor, 29-30 Cornhill,
London, EC3V 3NF .
The Group is involved in the acquisition, exploration, development and
operation of gold mines and deposits in West Africa. 
The Directors regularly review cashflow forecasts to determine whether 
the Group has sufficient cash reserves to meet future working capital
requirements, progress its exploration projects and take advantage of
business opportunities that may arise. The Group manages its treasury
function to ensure that cash is primarily held in politically stable countries.
This minimises the risk of political events preventing the Group from
continuing to make payments required for the Group’s operations 
to continue.
Further information regarding the Group’s financing arrangements is set 
out in notes 17 and 18 to the financial statements.
Included in the Group’s cash flow forecasts are amounts from the
placement of shares announced on 21 March 2014 and approved by
shareholders on 11 April 2014. The receipt of the funds from the placement
has yet to be received as such receipt is subject to certain administrative
tasks. However, the placement is guaranteed by irrevocable contracts and
has been approved by the Board of Directors and the shareholders;
accordingly the inclusion of such inflow of funds is deeded suitable for cash
flow planning purposes.
Based on current performance and forecast cash flows the Directors are
satisfied that the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet its financial
obligations as they fall due for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the
Directors have concluded that it is appropriate for the financial statements
to be prepared on a going concern basis.
Adoption of standards effective in 2013
No material changes to accounting policies arose as a result of new
standards applied by the Group from 1 January 2013.
Issued IFRS that are not yet effective
Any standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet
effective, and that are available for early application, have not been applied
by the Group in these financial statements. IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial
Statements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities is effective
for periods commencing 1 January 2014 and may impact upon the level of
disclosure regarding the Group’s non-controlling interests.
The Group does not expect other pronouncements to have a material
impact upon the Group’s primary statements and disclosure requirements.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
for the year ended 31 December 2013
Financial Statements / 33
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements
of the Company and enterprises controlled by the Company (its
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The excess of cost of
acquisition over the fair values of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets
acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any excess of the fair value of assets
acquired over the cost of acquisition is recognised directly in profit or loss.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition
of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are initially measured at fair value at acquisition date.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used
by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, and unrealised gains on transactions
between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the
equity attributable to equity owners of the parent company. Non-controlling
shareholders’ interest may initially be measured either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is
made on each acquisition individually.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests
is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling
interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. T otal comprehensive
income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions and balances
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the
appropriate Group company are translated at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the date of each statement 
of financial position, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the rates
prevailing on the relevant date. Gains and losses arising on translation 
are included in profit or loss for the year.
Translation of foreign operations
On 1 January 2011 the US Dollar was adopted as the functional currency
for all material entities in the Group. Consequently, there are no exchange
differences on the translation of subsidiaries and the currency translation
reserve will remain frozen as at the 31 December 2010 balance.
Intangible assets
Deferred exploration and evaluation costs
All costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal right to undertake exploration
and evaluation activities on a project are written off as incurred.
All costs associated with mineral exploration and investments are
capitalised on a project by project basis, pending determination of the
feasibility of the project. Costs incurred include appropriate technical and
administrative expenses. If an exploration project is successful, the related
costs will be transferred to mining assets and amortised over the estimated
life of the mineral reserves (as reported in accordance with Canadian
National Instrument 43-101) on a unit of production basis. Where a project
is relinquished, abandoned, or is considered to be of no further commercial
value to the Group, the related costs are written off. 
The recoverability of deferred exploration costs is dependent upon the
discovery of economically recoverable ore reserves, continuing compliance
with the terms of relevant agreements, the ability of the Group to obtain
necessary financing to complete the development of the ore reserves and
future profitable production or proceeds from the disposal thereof.
Mining and exploration licences
The mining licences were originally measured at the fair value of the shares
issued to non-controlling interests in return for the legal rights conferred by
the mining licences, based on the net present value of cash flows expected
to arise from the related mining operations. Mining licences are amortised
over the estimated life of the mineral reserves on a unit of production basis,
or the life of the licence, whichever is shorter. 
Property, plant and equipment
Mining and development costs
Mining and development costs include appropriate deferred exploration
and evaluation costs transferred on development of an exploration
property. Before reclassification, such costs are assessed for impairment,
with any impairment loss recognised in profit or loss for the year.
All subsequent development costs are capitalised, including all costs
incurred during the commissioning of the project that are directly related 
to that operation. Any revenues generated during this period are treated 
as a contribution against those costs and credited against mining and
development costs. At the end of the commissioning phase, when the mine
is capable of substantially operating in the manner intended by
management, capitalisation ceases and the mining assets are amortised
over the estimated life of the mineral reserves on a unit of production basis.
Future forecast capital expenditure is included in the unit of production
depreciation calculation.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
for the year ended 31 December 2013
Financial Statements / 34
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful life of the assets as follows:
� Office equipment, fixtures and fittings 33%
� Computers 33%
� Motor vehicles 33%
Residual values, remaining useful lives and depreciation methods are
reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. Assets in the course of
construction are not depreciated until such time that the construction 
is considered complete.
Gains or losses on disposal are included in profit or loss for the year.
Stripping costs
Stripping costs incurred in order to provide initial access to the ore body
are capitalised as mine development costs.
Stripping costs incurred during the production stage of a pit are accounted
for as an expense to the income statement during the period that the
stripping costs were incurred, unless these costs provide long term future
economic benefit. Production phase stripping costs generate a future
economic benefit when the related stripping activity: (i) provides access 
to ore to be mined in a future period; (ii) increases the fair value of the mine
as access to future mineral reserves becomes less costly; (iii) increases the
productive capacity or extends the productive life of the mine. Stripping
costs that provide such future economic benefits are allocated to those
specific reserves and depreciated over its life.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered impairment. Prior to
carrying out of impairment reviews, the significant cash generating units are
assessed to determine whether they should be reviewed under the
requirements of IFRS 6 - Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral
Resources or IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. Such determination is by
reference to the stage of development of the project and the level of
reliability and surety of information used in calculating value in use or fair
value less costs to sell.
Impairment reviews performed under IFRS 6 are carried out on a project 
by project basis, with each project representing a potential single cash
generating unit. An impairment review is undertaken when indicators of
impairment arise; typically when one of the following circumstances applies:
i. sufficient data exists that render the resource uneconomic and unlikely
to be developed 
ii. title to the asset is compromised
iii. budgeted or planned expenditure is not expected in the foreseeable
future 
iv. insufficient discovery of commercially viable resources leading to the
discontinuation of activities
Impairment reviews performed under IAS 36 are carried out when there is
an indication that the carrying value may be impaired. Such key indicators
(though not exhaustive) to the industry include:
i. a significant deterioration in the spot price of gold
ii. a significant increase in production costs
iii. a significant revision to, and reduction in, the life of mine plan
If any indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset
is estimated, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in
use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not
been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or
cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Such
impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or 
loss for the year.
Inventories
Inventories comprise gold produced, gold in process, ore stockpiles,
consumables and spares and are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. The cost of gold produced, gold in process and ore
stockpiles is calculated on a first in first out basis and includes all costs
directly incurred up to the relevant point of the process such as mining
costs and processing costs, but exclude other operating costs such as
general mine or administration costs. Net realisable value is determined
with reference to current market prices.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s
and Group’s balance sheet when the Company and Group has become 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are initially
measured at fair value, except for financial assets at fair value through profit
or loss, which are initially measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs.
Other receivables
Other receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal
value as reduced by appropriate provisions for irrecoverable amounts. 
Amounts due from subsidiaries are recorded at amortised cost, less
provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with
banks, and other short term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less provisions for
impairment.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the
substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Financial liabilities include bank loans and overdrafts which are recognised
initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with
any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings on
an effective interest basis.

Financial Statements / 35
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Financial instruments (continued)
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs. Where equity instruments are issued as part
of an acquisition they are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating
the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense
over the relevant period.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of
the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in
which they are incurred.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss comprise
derivative financial instruments. Subsequent to initial recognition financial
assets at fair value through profit and loss are stated at fair value.
Movements in fair values are recognised in profit or loss, unless they relate
to derivatives designated and effective as hedging instruments, in which
event, the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature
of the hedging relationship. The Group does not currently have any such
hedging instruments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as 
a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of
economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs
An obligation to incur decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs occurs
when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or on-
going production of a mining property. Costs are estimated on the basis 
of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular formal review.
Such costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation
work, discounted to their net present value, are provided and capitalised
within mining and development costs at the start of each project, as soon
as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These decommissioning costs
are charged against profits over the life of the mine, through depreciation 
of the asset and unwinding or amortisation of the discount on the provision.
Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding of the
discount is included as financing costs. Changes in the measurement of 
a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation
work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the
current period. 
The costs for restoration of site damage created on an on-going basis
during production are provided for at their net present values and charged
against operating profits as extraction progresses. Changes in the
measurement of a liability relating to site damage created during production
are charged against operating profit.
Share-based payments
The fair value of equity settled share based payments are measured at
grant date using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate
of shares that will eventually vest. Details of the inputs to the model are
given in note 20.
Revenue recognition
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of gold. Revenue arising from
gold sales under these contracts is recognised when the price is
determinable, the product has been delivered in accordance with the terms
of the contract, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably
assured.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under
operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over
the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an
incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line
basis over the lease term.
T axation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is
recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In
this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity, respectively.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences
at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax is
determined using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax liability
is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences,
except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet
date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that
future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally
enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current
income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable
entity and the same taxation authority.

Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Some of the accounting policies require the application of significant
judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for
calculating financial estimates.
By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of
uncertainty. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year are discussed below.
Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for and (in the
case of capitalised decommissioning costs) amortise the estimated costs
for decommissioning and site rehabilitation over the life of the mine. The
ultimate cost of decommissioning and site rehabilitation is uncertain and
cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to
relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques
or experience at other mine sites. The expected timing and extent of
expenditure can also change, for example in response to changes in 
ore reserves or processing levels. As a result, there could be significant
adjustments to the provisions established which could affect future
financial results.
Ore reserves estimates
The Group reports its estimated ore reserves in accordance with Canadian
National Instrument 43-101. Mining assets are amortised over the
estimated life of the mineral reserves on a unit of production basis. 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, 
and assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation may change
when new information becomes available. These include assumptions as
to grade estimates and cut-off grades, recovery rates, commodity prices,
exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and reclamation
costs and discount rates. The actual volume of ore extracted and any
changes in these assumptions could affect prospective depreciation rates
and carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
Impairment
In undertaking an impairment review for the operating mines or advanced
exploration projects a technical economic model is prepared which includes
full details of the mining schedule, head grade, recoverability, strip ratios of
waste to ore, consumables used and operating costs. From this information
the amount of gold production is calculated and revenues estimated.
Operating costs, including royalties and refining charges are then entered
and a monthly cash flow is produced, which is used to calculate the net
present value of the pre-tax free cash flow from the operation. This net
present value is then compared to the carrying value of the operation on 
the balance sheet and an assessment is made regarding impairment.
Should any of the key parameters differ from the assumptions contained
within the technical economic model, such as tonnes of ore mined, grade
of ore mined, recovery profile or gold price, the net present value will be
affected either positively or negatively. If the impact is negative, an
impairment charge may be required that has not been recognised in 
these financial statements.
In some cases using a technical economic model to provide a value in use
calculation is not appropriate or possible. In these situations impairment
reviews are carried out by reference to fair value less cost to sell. This is
achieved by reference to a review of the economic value per ounce of
resource against comparable transactions and the market value of other
gold companies to assess if the fair value less cost to sell supports the
carrying value.
Valuation of mining licences 
The valuation of mining licences included in these financial statements
reflect the shares issued to non-controlling interests in exchange for the
licences. The valuation was based on the net present values expected 
to arise from the related mining assets. These cash flows are subject to
numerous uncertainties which may affect the valuation of the licences. 
Inventories
Valuations of gold in stockpiles and gold in process require estimations of
the amount of gold contained in, and recovery rates from, the various work
in progress gold circuits. These estimations are based on analysis of
samples and prior experience. Judgement is also required regarding 
the timing of utilisation of stockpiles and the gold price to be applied in
calculating net realisable value.
T axes receivable
Given the uncertainties relating to the fiscal regimes, the Group has had 
to apply judgement in determining the value and timing of amounts that will
be recovered with respect to indirect and direct taxes owing to the Group 
in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. The amounts reflected in the financial
statements are the Directors’ best estimate of the recovery of these
amounts.
T ax assessment
The fiscal regimes under which the Group operates are often complex and
are subject to changes which may be over and above the fiscal stability
agreements the Group has in place. The operating companies in Burkina
Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone have regular detailed and stringent tax
assessments that can give rise to additional liabilities as a result of errors
made or corrections and changes to taxation law.
Following completion of a tax assessment, management carries out
rigorous reviews of the findings of the assessment in conjunction with local
and international advisers to conclude on the veracity and quantum of any
findings. Based on these reviews an initial provision may be made should it
be considered that such liabilities (or assets) meet the recognition criteria 
of a provision.
Litigation and contractual disputes
As noted in the principal risks section the Group has several contractual
relations that could potentially end in dispute and legal settlement given
their complexity. In the event of a dispute arising the Group employs
internal and external contract experts to provide an assessment of the
quantum of any likely settlement and whether a provision is required.

Operating segments have been identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief
operating decision maker. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered by management to be the Board of Directors. The operating segments
included in internal reports are determined on the basis of their significance to the Group. In particular, operating mines are reported as separate segments
together with exploration projects that have significant capitalised expenditure. An analysis of the Group’s business segments is set out below.

The segmental result reported represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and excludes share option charges, which is
the measure of segmental profit regularly reported to the board of Directors. The accounting policies of the reporting segments are different from the
Group’s accounting policies as follows:
� Pre-commissioning income and expenditure at operating mines is not capitalised in the segmental results.
� Income is accrued for gold bullion on hand at the period end in segmental results and, accordingly, no stock is recognised for this item.
� The depreciation charge against segmental assets is based on a different total asset cost compared to the statutory accounts due to the fact that
income and expenditure is not capitalised during the commissioning period. In addition, the total asset cost is depreciated from the commencement 
of mining operations.

Deferred tax liability
Other timing differences - 94
Deferred tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements are in respect of the Group’s Kalsaka gold mine in Burkina Faso. They represent timing
differences between the local tax bases and accounting policies and those present in the Group financial statements under IFRS. The main differences
being income recognition and depreciation in advance of taxable benefits.
At 31 December 2013 the subsidiary operating the Kalsaka gold mine in Burkina Faso had distributable reserves totalling $19.2m (2012: $14.7m). In the
event of a dividend distribution income tax totalling US$1m (2012: US$0.7m) would be payable. No provision has been made for this amount as Amara
Mining plc has control over the timing of any distribution and no payment is likely in the foreseeable future.
Burkinabe law requires the payment on account of corporation tax based on the prior year tax charge. Payments totalling US$2.8m have been made on
account during 2013 in relation to the tax year ended 31 December 2013. As no profit was made in Burkina this amount is owed back to the Burkinabe
subsidiary and can be recovered against future profits or on closure of the Company. This amount is shown as a non-current asset due to timing of
expected receipt.

Included above is an amount of US$80.4 million in relation to the Baomahun Gold Project. A further US$5.3m is included within Property Plant and
Equipment in Note 9 relating to Baomahun. These amounts are recoverable through the exploitation or sale of the project. In order to recover this amount
through exploitation significant additional funds would be required to construct an operating mine. Financing risk is discussed in the Principal Risks and
Uncertainties on page 20.
Also included above is US$29.1m in relation to the Yaoure Gold project. A further US$0.7m is included in property, plant and equipment in note 9 relating 
to Yaoure. Yaoure faces similar risks to those described above for Baomahun.

Impairment reviews
In accordance with IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets, the group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment of its assets at the end of each
reporting period. Due to the reduction in the spot price of gold during 2013 impairment reviews were carried out on the Group’s main cash generating units
(CGU). Further to these reviews an impairment charge was recognised in respect of the Kalsaka/Sega CGU.
Kalsaka/Sega
The reduction in the price of gold led to the decision in 2013 to re-optimise the Sega gold resource using lower priced pit-shells. The revised mine schedule
estimated less gold production and a shorter mine life which results in a reduced recoverable amount. Accordingly, an impairment charge totalling
US$14.7m has been recognised.
The recoverable amount was calculated by reference to value in use - using a discounted cash flow model on the re-optimised mine plan. Given the relative
short-term life (estimated 12 months) of the mine a gold price of US$1,300 and a discount rate of 5% were deemed appropriate. The table below presents
reasonably possible changes to key assumptions in the value in use calculation:
US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000
Gold price sensitivity +/(-) US$(200)/oz US$(100)/oz US$100/oz US$200/oz
Impact on impairment charge (10,869) (5,435) 5,435 10,869
Gold production sensitivity +/(-) (20)% (10)% 10% 20%
Impact on impairment charge (14,066) (7,033) 7,033 14,066
The relative short-term nature of the mine means that the value in use calculation is insensitive to changes in production costs or the discount rate.
A further impairment totalling US$2.8m against the ZR reserve at Kalsaka, which was transferred to mine development on 31 December 2012, 
was recognised to reflect that this ore body will not be mined in the lower gold price environment.

Yaoure - residual plant impairment
A detailed review of the carrying value of the residual heap leach plant equipment was performed by reference to resale value. An impairment charge
totalling US$2.6m was recognised against this equipment.
Included in the residual mining, development and associated property, plant and equipment cost is US$4.2m relating to the Yaoure resource that was not
exploited prior to the cessation of the heap leach activities in 2011. This amount has been transferred back to deferred exploration and evaluation costs.

Share premium
The share premium account represents the excess cash received on the issue of new shares for a premium on the nominal value. Only those costs
specifically associated with those share issues are debited to the account.
Merger reserve
The acquisition by the Company of Cluff Gold (UK) Limited in November 2004 was accounted for in accordance with the merger accounting principles set out in
UK Financial Reporting Standard 6 and the Companies Act 1985, which continue under the Companies Act 2006, whereby the consolidated financial statements
were presented as if the business previously carried out through Cluff Gold (UK) Limited had always been owned and controlled by the Company. The transitional
requirements of IFRS1 allowed prospective application of IFRS3 for all business combinations subsequent to the transition date (1 January 2006). Accordingly this
acquisition was not re-stated in accordance with that standard. During 2008 the Company acquired Winston Mining Limited. The Company has claimed merger
relief in respect of this acquisition and accordingly the premium arising on the issue of shares has been credited to the merger reserve.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of operations that do not have 
a US Dollars functional currency. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation
differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
On 1 January 2011 the US Dollar was adopted as the functional currency for all entities in the Group. Consequently, there are no exchange differences on
the translation of subsidiaries and the currency translation reserve will remain frozen as at the 31 December 2010 balance. A translation reserve exists in
respect of the parent company because prior to 1 January 2011 the functional currency adopted was Sterling and the presentational currency was US
Dollar. The translation reserve of the parent company will also remain frozen at the 31 December 2010 balance.

which is also subject to regular review. 
The timing of the utilisation of the provision is subjective and dependent upon a number of factors around the closure of the mines. Based on current
estimations the provision is expected to be utilised within one to five years. The discount factor applied does not result in a material difference and
consequently has not been included.

The loan was drawn in September 2012 and is secured by way of a mortgage over the shares of Amara Mining (Burkina) Limited (formerly Cluff Mining
(West Africa) Limited).
The loan is repayable in equal monthly instalments from September 2013 until completion of the repayments in August 2014. There have been no defaults
or breaches of interest or capital payment terms during the period.
At 31 December 2013 payments to a small number of suppliers have been delayed under agreed payment plans. This represents a technical breach of the
Samsung loan facility that would allow Samsung to demand immediate repayment of the loan, although no such requirement has been made by Samsung.
As set out in note 24, subsequent to the year end the Company has announced a placing to raise additional funds which will allow all monies due to be
repaid as they fall due.
Facility fees have been prepaid and are being amortised over the life of the loan.
The loan bears interest at 2.5% plus three months US Dollar LIBOR, which represents a floating interest rate risk to the Group, and is payable monthly. 
In addition, the loan agreement provides for the lender to be delivered 1,929 ounces of gold each month for the period of the loan at a discount of 2.25% 
to the London Bullion Market Association PM fix on the monthly price fixing date. This notional interest charge is subject to commodity price risk and is
considered to be an embedded derivative as its economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract. However, the fair value of the
embedded derivative has been calculated by management and is considered immaterial and consequently is not shown separately from the host contract.

Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements 18 Financial instruments and risk management
Categorisation and fair value of financial instruments
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. In addition the Company’s financial assets include
amounts due from subsidiaries. All of the Group’s and Company’s financial assets are classified as loans and receivables. The Group’s and Company’s
financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings. All of the Group’s and Company’s financial liabilities are measured at amortised 
cost. The taxation debtors as described in note 11 are not financial instruments as defined by IAS 32. These amounts have been included within the below
disclosures in respect of foreign exchange and credit risk as the Directors believe that the exposure of the Group to these financial risks in respect of these
assets is significant.
It is the Directors’ opinion that the carrying value of all of the Group’s and Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities approximates their fair value.
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks. A risk management programme has been established to protect the Group against the
potential adverse effects of these financial risks. There has been no significant change in these financial risks in the year other than in relation to interest 
rate risk as a result of the new borrowing facility.
The principal financial risks relate to foreign currency risk, commodity price risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
a) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment or recognised asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign
currency rates. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the following:
(i) Transactional exposure relating to operating costs and capital expenditure incurred in currencies other than US dollars, 
the functional currency of operations.
(ii) Translation exposures relating to monetary assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term investment balances, 
held in currencies other than US dollars.
The table below shows the currency profile of cash and cash equivalents:

Other 24 471 14 366
11,372 31,810 5,226 26,238
The Group also enters into transactions denominated in currencies other than US dollars. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises where a
company holds monetary assets and liabilities in a currency other than US dollars. The following table shows the currency profile of the net monetary
assets and liabilities of the Group:
2013 2012

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013
Financial Statements / 48
Amara Mining plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 A 20% change represents management’s assessment of the reasonable possible exposure given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility
observed both on a historical basis and market expectations for future movement.
In general, the Group does not enter into derivatives to manage these currency risks. Details of the impact on foreign exchange movement in the year are
shown in notes 2, 4 and 5. The Board frequently reviews the policy on currency translation risk in order to minimise translation exposure.
The Directors do not consider the Company to be at significant risk from currency fluctuations due to the low level of assets and liabilities held in currencies
other than the functional currency.
b) Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as its revenues are derived from contracts with its physical off-take partners at prices determined by
reference to the market price of gold at the delivery date. The Group is also exposed to fluctuations in the price of consumables, such as fuel, cement
and cyanide. The Group does not currently hold any gold future positions as a hedge against gold price volatility, or other derivatives as a hedge
against other commodity price fluctuations. The Board regularly reviews this matter. The Group occasionally makes forward sales on gold poured - this
risk is not deemed to be material as the sales are only at most a week in advance.
c) Liquidity risk
Management regularly review cash flow forecasts to determine whether the Group has sufficient cash reserves to meet future working capital
requirements and to take advantage of business opportunities. 
The table below sets out the maturity profile of financial liabilities as at 31 December 2013:
2013 2012 2013 2012
Group Group Company Company
US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000
Due in less than one month 16,528 8,010 818 257
Due between one and three months 19,831 4,538 162 468
Borrowings due < 1 year 13,332 10,000 13,332 10,000
Borrowings due > 1 year - 10,000 - 10,000
49,691 32,548 14,312 20,725
d) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of direct and indirect taxes owing to the Group in West Africa, including taxes recoverable of
US$5,778,000 (2012: US$2,460,000) in Burkina Faso and US$210,000 (2012: US$1,352,000) in Côte d’Ivoire. In 2012 the Directors included an
impairment provision against the taxation debtor due to the slow moving nature of the amounts in accordance with their best estimate of the recovery
of these amounts totalling US$310,000 in Burkina Faso. Due to stronger recovery in 2013 no impairment provision has been recognised at 
31 December 2013.
Recovery of indirect taxes in Côte d’Ivoire has significantly improved following the change of government in 2012 and the majority of the taxation
receivable has now been recovered. The remaining unprovided balance has been treated as due within one year.
The Group and the Company are also exposed to credit risk on their cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, the total of which
represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. 
The Company is exposed to credit risk in respect of the loans recoverable from other Group companies. Details of these loans, the repayment terms
thereof, and amounts provided against these at 31 December 2013 are set out in note 21.
e) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market
interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from interest bearing financial assets and liabilities that are used by the Company. Interest bearing assets
comprise trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents which are considered to be short-term liquid assets. Interest rate risk arises primarily from
borrowings issued at floating interest rates which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. It is the Group’s policy to settle trade payables
within the credit terms allowed and the Group does not therefore incur interest on overdue balances. 
No sensitivity analysis has been disclosed as management does not consider any reasonably possible fluctuation in interest rates to be sufficiently
material to disclose.
f) Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and provide access to adequate funding
for its exploration and development projects, so that it can provide adequate returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. 
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the debt:equity ratio, based on external debt divided by total equity, and on its ability to service its debt. 
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic conditions and risk characteristics of the
underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may issue new shares, draw down debt, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group will only commit to drawing down debt if forecast cashflows are deemed to be sufficient to service that debt and other financial obligations.

20 Share based payment
The Group operates a share option plan under which employees, consultants and advisers have been granted options to subscribe for ordinary shares. 
All options are share settled. The number and weighted average exercise price of share options are as follows:

Exercisable at 31 December 6,480,000 67.7 3,943,000 65.4
The options outstanding at 31 December 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.1 years (2012: 7.1 years).
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted. This estimate
is based on a Black-Scholes model which is considered most appropriate considering the effects of the vesting conditions, expected exercise period and
the payment of dividends by the Company. 
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model for options granted in the year were as follows:
2013 2012
Weighted average share price 60.0p 65.6p
Weighted average exercise price 69.8p 65.1p
Expected volatility 0.42 0.43
Expected life 3.5 3.5
Risk free rate 1% 1%
Expected dividends - -
Fair value per option 15.4p 21.2p
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous year. The expected life used in the
model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
No options were exercised in 2013. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for options exercised in 2012 was 57.8p.

Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements 22 Contingent liabilities
Contract dispute
In February 2011 the Company received a proposal for additional costs sustained by the mining contractor at the Yaoure Mine totalling US$9.2m. 
An updated claim was made in June 2011 totalling a further US$5.4m. A further claim for additional charges and interest was made in December 2012
taking the total claim to US$22.9m. Whilst the situation remains unresolved, the Company has received external advice that confirms that the current
provision of US$1.0m (included in accruals) is, in the opinion of the Directors, the maximum payable under the terms of the contract.
The terms of the contract clearly state that the rates set out therein shall apply regardless of the difficulty in performing the works under the contract, 
such that the majority of the additional costs claimed cannot be recovered under the contract.
23 Business combination
On 25 November 2013 the company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of AUMJ Limited, a dormant holding company incorporated in Jersey, 
from Amlib Holdings plc. AUMJ Limited is the 100% shareholder of Amlib Drilling Services (Liberia) Inc. (ADSL) a company incorporated in Liberia which
was included in the acquisition.
ADSL is a drilling company based in Monrovia, Liberia and the acquisition will enable the company to utilise ADSL’s drill assets, including three fully
operational diamond drill rigs. In addition, ADSL holds the exploration rights to three licence tenements in Liberia.
Consideration totalled US$10.8m and was settled by the issuance of 51,846,782 ordinary shares of 1p:
Fair value of consideration US$000
51,846,782 ordinary shares of 1p of Amara Mining plc 10,784
The fair value of the shares issued was measured using the closing market price on the date of acquisition.

The fair value of consideration is considered to be the same as the fair value of the assets acquired.
A deferred tax asset totalling US$196,000 has not been recognised in respect of the fair value adjustments as it is unclear when they may be utilised.
24 Events after the reporting period
On 21 March the Company announced the placing of 107,058,823 ordinary shares of 1p at 17p together with an open offer to existing shareholder of up to
24,468,439 additional ordinary shares of 1p also priced at 17p. The Company received valid acceptances in respect of 1,705,050 open offer shares so the
Company has 328,979,827 shares in issue.
The placing and open offer was subject to shareholder approval which was sought and received at the General Meeting held on 11 April 2014.

Notes to Mineral Resource tables (page 5)
1. The effective date of the Yaoure Mineral Resource estimate is 11 December 2013, prepared by Mario E Rossi, GeoSystems International, Inc. 
2. The gold price used in the Mineral Resource estimate is US$1,500/oz assuming an open pit mining scenario. Oxides are being mined assuming Heap Leach
economics, Sulphides assuming Flotation economics. Pit slopes are 35º in oxide, 46º in sulphide. Recoveries have been assumed at 90%
3. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability
4. There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political or other relevant issues that may materially
affect the resource estimates
5. T otals and average grades are subject to rounding to the appropriate precision and some columns or rows may not compute exactly as shown
6. The stated resources include dilution in the block model that relates to the level of low selectivity envisioned in an open pit operation, assuming 10m bench
heights. No additional operational or mining dilution or ore loss has been incorporated
7. The 94.6 Mt of material scheduled for the financial evaluation contains a difference in rounding (of less than 1%) resulting from the different software
packages and topography utilised for the relevant stages
Baomahun
Detailed geology and other exploration information can be found in the Company’s report “T echnical Review, Mineral Resource Estimate for the Baomahun Gold
Exploration Project, Sierra Leone” dated 03 January 2013, made available on the Company’s website and on SEDAR.
Notes to Mineral Resources and Reserves (page 7)
1. CIM definitions were used for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
2. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability
3. A cut-off grade of 0.5g/t was applied within a US$1,500/oz open pit shell and a 2.0g/t cut-off for Mineral Resources suitable for underground mining. 
The resources suitable for underground mining are not included in the FS. The Mineral Reserve is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au at a gold price 
  of US$1,100/oz
4. The Mineral Resource is inclusive of the Mineral Reserve. The Mineral Reserve was estimated by construction of a block model within constraining
wireframes and based on Indicated Resources
5. Mining dilution of 5% was added to the Mineral Reserve
6. The Mineral Reserves were estimated based on the NI 43-101 Mineral Resources, both effective as of 19 November 2012
7. A 93.4% metallurgical gold recovery was used for the Mineral Reserve
8. Due to rounding, some columns or rows may not add up exactly to the computed totals

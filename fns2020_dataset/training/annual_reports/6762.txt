ANNUAL REPORT 2012 6
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Despite a slower than expected start to the year, your company has delivered a 
satisfactory full year result, helped by a combination of internal cost control measures and 
an encouraging increase in activity in the second half. We have also made good progress 
in delivering our strategic objectives to diversify the earnings of your company and to 
make us more resilient in the face of on-going macroeconomic difﬁculties.
Headline revenues were ﬂat year on year, with approximately 55% of total sales in the second 
half. Due to a change to the product mix and the lower volumes in the ﬁrst quarter, there was 
a reduction in adjusted proﬁt before tax. We continued to focus on cash generation resulting 
in reduced net debt at the year end. Our banking facilities remain committed until April 2015.
Signiﬁcant progress was made in the year towards our strategic aim of broadening our product 
offerings and diversifying our markets. We are investing in new capabilities and have 
strengthened our management team considerably, to provide signiﬁcantly higher value 
sub-systems, rather than just components, for our customers. In 2011 we acquired EM4 and 
Crystal Technology; both businesses have now been fully integrated and are starting to deliver 
opportunities, not only by strengthening our position and expertise in our chosen markets, 
but also through cross selling value added products, particularly in the defence market.
During the year, we undertook a programme of rationalising some of our facilities. We will 
continue to look for opportunities to make the business more efﬁcient.
As we start our new ﬁnancial year, uncertainty continues in world markets. In Europe, the 
Eurozone difﬁculties are affecting both Government and other spending. In the US, the “ﬁscal 
cliff” remains which, if not resolved, will result in signiﬁcantly reduced Government spending 
impacting defence expenditure in particular. Whilst your company relies on a tiny part of 
these budgets and is focused on areas where expenditure is least likely to be reduced, the 
Group is not immune to tightening ﬁscal measures. As a result visibility is limited but we 
begin the new ﬁnancial year with a number of encouraging opportunities, as a more 
resilient Group and with a broader range of products.
At the end of October, Mr Jan Melles, one of Gooch & Housego’s Non-executive Directors, 
stepped down from the Board after 15 years. The Directors wish to thank Jan for his constructive 
advice and contribution during his tenure. I am pleased to welcome to the Board, Dr Peter 
Bordui and Mr Mark Webster who bring with them important sector experience. The Board 
and I would also like to thank all our valued employees for their important contributions to 
the success of the company during the year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Chief 
Executive 
Ofﬁcer’s 
Statement
2012
For Gooch & Housego, 2012 was a year in which we made good progress in executing 
our strategy of establishing a more diversiﬁed, resilient and broadly-based business 
which enabled us to deliver results in line with our revised expectations despite a 
difﬁcult trading environment.
After a slower than expected start to the year, we saw a steady recovery in the second 
quarter and experienced sustained demand for our products and services throughout the 
second half of the year. This variability, exempliﬁed by a two fold increase in order intake 
between the ﬁrst and third quarters, presented signiﬁcant challenges for our manufacturing 
operations. Despite this we were able to achieve revenues only marginally lower than 
those of 2011, which was a record year for the company. Margins were impacted by the 
changing product mix, with lower, but more sustainable, levels of Q-switch sales in 2012 
compared to the year ended 30 September 2011.
Trading conditions at the start of the 2012 ﬁnancial year were challenging as adverse 
macro-economic factors together with a down turn in the semiconductor equipment and 
microelectronics sectors combined to create a difﬁcult business environment in our Industrial 
sector. In the Aerospace and Defence sector there were delays in placing a number of 
large contracts, which despite subsequently being awarded later in the year, combined 
with the business dynamics of our Industrial sector to create a difﬁcult ﬁrst quarter.
The second half of the 2012 ﬁnancial year was characterised by generally favourable 
market conditions. In the Industrial sector, the recovery experienced during the second 
quarter was followed by steady demand throughout the ﬁnal six months. Although there 
was probably a degree of restocking, the market has been reasonably measured without 
the ﬂuctuations experienced in the past. In the Aerospace and Defence sector, as reported 
in July, we received a number of previously delayed orders some of which were for the 
supply of higher-value sub-system products against what are forecast to be longer term 
programmes, in line with our strategic objectives.
We have made good progress with our strategy of diversiﬁcation into new markets and 
the move to sub-system products, evidenced by the reduction of Q-switch revenue 
contribution from 21% in 2011 to 14% this ﬁnancial year, on broadly ﬂat total Group 
revenues year on year. At this level of sales the Q-switch is close to the long term average 
in absolute revenue terms.
Having consolidated our leadership positions in core technologies and markets with the 
two acquisitions made in 2011, Gooch & Housego was ready to take the next step in 
2012. By leveraging our portfolio of world-class photonic products we have already 
demonstrated our ability to move up the value-chain into sub-system and system level 
products, especially in Aerospace and Defence and Life Sciences applications. The next 
step is to accelerate this process as we make the transition from components supplier to 
solutions provider.
Through the provision of design and engineering services that feed into highly vertically 
integrated manufacturing, Gooch & Housego aims to deliver sustained growth even in 
times of reduced economic activity. As an example, our largest contract in 2012 was the 
second phase of a design and engineering project that is forecast to transition to the 
manufacturing phase from 2014. While contracts of this type are still the exception today, 
we are engaged at an early stage in an increasing number of such programmes and we 
believe that they will account for more than half our revenues within ﬁve years. 
To achieve this will require fundamental changes throughout the business. The ﬁrst of 
these changes were implemented in 2012 with the appointment of a Chief Technology 
Ofﬁcer (CTO) and the creation of a business development team focused on the Aerospace 
and Defence sector. The CTO position was created in order to bring all research and 
development (R&D) and engineering functions across nine locations under common 
leadership to ensure that their focus and priorities are fully aligned with the Company’s 
strategic objectives. We were fortunate to be able to recruit Dr Murray Reed, a highly 
experienced and commercially focused photonics technologist for this key role. The 
Aerospace and Defence business development team was established to develop enhanced 
sector expertise in order to engage at a higher level with “tier 1” defence contractors on 
complex, high-value, sub-system and system level programmes. The Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer (CEO) of EM4, Inc., acquired by Gooch & Housego in 2011, has been appointed to  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
head up this team, and a new General Manager has been recruited (from 
the Aerospace and Defence sector) to run our operations in Boston.
Our initiatives to drive organic growth via re-focused R&D and engineering 
are already bringing a new focus to our most important product development 
initiatives. An example is our development of diagnostic systems for 
screening applications. We have recently appointed a senior executive with 
extensive experience in the life sciences and diagnostics sectors to lead the 
commercialisation of the technology. In parallel, we are engaging additional 
hospital research laboratory partners to accelerate our initial trials.
Looking forward, we will be exploring opportunities to strengthen further 
our capabilities in optical, mechanical, electronic, ﬁrmware and software 
design and engineering, as well as project management expertise, to 
support our strategy of moving up the value-chain.  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

Scientiﬁc
Research
APPLICATIONS, PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
Nuclear fusion research and energy laser technology is being used to recreate the 
conditions found in the core of the sun. At these temperatures and pressures isotopes of 
hydrogen fuse to form helium and in doing so release huge amounts of energy – the 
energy that powers the sun and stars. One of the most exciting potential applications of 
this research is using laser fusion to provide limitless quantities of clean, carbon-free 
energy to meet the world’s growing needs. The products supplied into this market utilise 
a wide range of the Company’s technologies including crystal growth, precision optics, 
thin-ﬁlm coatings and ﬁbre optics. Gooch & Housego supplies many of the world’s leading 
nuclear fusion energy research facilities. Gooch & Housego is sole supplier of many critical 
optical components used in the world’s most powerful laser system at the National 
Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Instrumentation for applications in agricultural, solar, marine and industrial research. An 
example of an industrial research application is the development of Light Emitting Diode 
(LED) illumination systems. Instrumentation products are supplied from our Orlando facility 
and include photometers, radiometers, spectroradiometers and their associated calibration 
services. The customer base ranges from universities and research institutes to 
Government agencies and national standards laboratories.
Growth Strategy
•  To maintain and develop the business’s capabilities in crystal growth and ultra precision 
optics for nuclear fusion research & energy. If NIF fulﬁls its research objectives in the next 
12 months it could pave the way for two further facilities in the US (LIFE) and Europe 
(HiPER) whose objective is to demonstrate the viability of the technology for large scale 
power generation. Gooch & Housego has participated in preparatory analyses and would 
expect to be a major supplier to these projects.
•  • University research and “Big Science” projects… Gooch & Housego is the custodian of 
some of the world’s most advanced optical technologies. It is not therefore surprising 
that there is a constant and signiﬁcant demand for such products and technologies from 
some of the world’s foremost universities and research institutes. The products supplied 
into this market span the complete breadth of the Company’s technology portfolio. Many 
of Gooch & Housego’s current products have evolved from early stage collaborations 
with universities and it is an area the Company continues to focus on.
•  The Company continues to invest in R&D to develop and commercialise the next 
generation of Instrumentation products.
A FOCUS ON…

NON GAAP MEASURES
The Company uses a number of non GAAP measures which are shown in the table above and 
in the segmental analysis. These measures are used to illustrate the impact of non-recurring 
and non-trading items on the Company’s ﬁnancial results. These are the impact of the 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition costs, the one off gain resulting from 
the write back of the 2011 acquisition of EM4 earn-out provision, the impairment of 
goodwill, costs associated with restructuring activities and debt reﬁnancing and the one 
off impact associated with the recognition of deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company 
uses the term EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation). 
This is a commonly used measure of operating performance and cash ﬂow.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Industrial
Our Industrial business fell marginally during the year, with revenues of £35.8m, compared 
with £36.3m last year. Much lower year-on-year sales of Q-switches for industrial applications 
were offset by a full year of trading from our Crystal Technology acquisition and strong 
performances in our Sensing and Semiconductor sub-markets within the Industrial sector. 
During the year the Company consolidated its electronics capabilities into other existing 
facilities and closed its site in Norderstedt, Germany. Operating proﬁt for this sector was 
32% lower at £6.6m, compared with £9.6m last year, reﬂecting a change in product mix. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 19
Aerospace and Defence
Our Aerospace and Defence business saw revenue consistent with last year at £15.4m 
(2011: £15.4m). Following a slow start to the year in this sector as a result of delays in 
the receipt of defence related contracts, order intake picked up as the year progressed, 
with many delayed contracts being awarded.  Operating margins in this sector fell during 
the year due to investment in people and capabilities in our EM4 business. 
Life Sciences
Gooch & Housego consolidated its presence in the Life Sciences sector in 2012 with revenues of 
£5.7m (2011: £5.7m). Operating margin improved, reﬂecting a maturity in our manufacturing 
processes. Our optical coherence tomography (OCT) sub-assembly products still lead the 
world in this market segment, producing a 10% growth rate in 2012. Our development of 
hyperspectral imaging systems for applications in diagnostics and microscopy continues to 
make encouraging progress.
Scientiﬁc Research
Our activities in the Scientiﬁc Research market are dominated by a small number of large, 
long term programmes. This market saw some modest growth in 2012, and is a focus for 
our business development activities going forward as we seek to engage with a wider 
range of “big science” projects. 
PERFORMANCE OF PRIOR YEAR ACQUISITIONS
Following the acquisition of EM4 in January 2011, the Group has invested in people and 
equipment at this site to support its signiﬁcant potential and to replicate the Group’s ﬁbre 
optic capabilities in Europe and the US in order to meet the requirements of the Aerospace 
and Defence markets in these regions. This replication process is now well progressed, with 
the ﬁrst passive fused components made in Boston currently proceeding through internal 
qualiﬁcation. As an illustration of the strategic beneﬁts of the acquisition, during 2012 Gooch 
& Housego established a leading position in the supply of space qualiﬁed lasers for applications 
in the growing market for satellite optical communications systems.
This acquisition is now fully integrated into the Group’s Information Technology (IT) and 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and in the year to 30 September 2012 EM4 
contributed $1.1m in EBITDA.
The acquisition of Crystal Technology, a manufacturer of acousto-optic and electro-optic 
devices and a grower of optical crystals, was completed at the end of March 2011. Crystal 
Technology is also now fully integrated into the Group’s IT and ERP systems and since 
acquisition has contributed $5.4m in EBITDA.
Following the acquisition, the decision was made to integrate Crystal Technology’s crystal 
growth facility into the Group’s main crystal Growth facility in Cleveland, Ohio. This process 
was completed in 2012 with all of the Group’s crystal growth capabilities now being housed 
in one purpose built facility. Consolidating the Group’s optical crystal growth has enabled Gooch 
& Housego to beneﬁt from a concentration of expertise and operational economies of scale.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
Gooch & Housego continues to invest in R&D in all areas of the business and regards this as 
fundamental to the continued growth of the company. Gooch & Housego developed and 
launched a number of new products in 2012 including a next generation hyperspectral 
imaging system, the HSi-440C, with real-time spectral unmixing, aimed at medical researchers, 
the EM655 integrated RF-over-ﬁbre transmitter module, and a line of high-power ﬁber-in, 
ﬁber-out (FIFO) isolators for the pulsed ﬁber laser market. Moreover, the acquisitions made in 
2011 have enhanced the technical capabilities of the Group as a whole, with the introduction 
of lithium niobate and tellurium dioxide crystal growth and laser welding technologies. The 
appointment of a CTO and the reorganisation of our R&D and engineering teams during 2012 
have substantially strengthened Gooch & Housego’s capabilities and will improve the return 
on our R&D expenditure going forward.
Gross expenditure on R&D in the year to 30 September 2012 was £4.3m (2011: £3.7m), 
which represented 7.0% of revenue (2011: 6.1%).  
FINANCIAL  AND OPERATING REVIEW

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIS)
The Group’s objective is to deliver sustainable, long-term growth in revenue and proﬁts. This 
is to be achieved through the execution of the Board’s strategies of market diversiﬁcation, 
the continued investment in R&D to support organic growth, the acquisition of strategically 
complementary businesses and the on-going drive to move up the value chain.
In striving to achieve these strategic objectives, the main ﬁnancial performance measures 
monitored by the Board are: - 
Total revenue growth 2012 2011 2010
At actual exchange rates 0% 37% 23%
At constant exchange rates (1%) 40% 23%
The Board is focused on delivering revenue growth by investing both organically and 
through acquisitions. Weak growth in 2012 reﬂects the difﬁcult trading conditions in the 
ﬁrst quarter of this ﬁnancial year when compared to the record Q switch sales in 2011.
Target market revenue growth 2012 2011 2010
Aerospace and Defence (£m) 15.4 15.4 11.3
Life Sciences (£m) 5.7 5.7 4.9
The Group’s target markets of Aerospace and Defence and Life Science provide a route to 
sustainable growth, and a more diversiﬁed revenue base. These markets also provided 
signiﬁcant opportunities for Gooch & Housego to migrate up the value-chain from materials 
and components to higher value sub-assemblies, modules and systems in response to the 
trend for our larger customers to outsource increasingly complex parts of their business. Whilst 
the evidence of progress to date is limited in our ﬁnancial results, Gooch & Housego made 
considerable progress in the year both in terms of how it addresses its customers, through 
the establishment of a dedicated Aerospace and Defence business development organisation 
and how it addresses its geographic markets, through its technology replication programmes.
Net debt analysis 2012 2011 2010
Net debt (£m) 0.3 1.8 5.2
In order to balance business risk with the investment needs of the Company, Gooch & Housego 
closely monitors and manages its net debt. This year net debt has again fallen signiﬁcantly, 
putting the business in a strong position both in terms of headroom for further investment 
and from the perspective of managing its business risk.
Earnings per share 2012 2011 2010
Adjusted basic earnings per share (pence) 26.4 36.0 22.5
Includes the dilutive effect of the current Value Creation Plan based upon the year end share 
price of £4.35 per share.
BALANCE SHEET
The Group spent a total of £3.4m on property, plant and equipment during the year  
(2011: £2.8m).
Following the acquisition of Crystal Technology LLC on 31 March 2011, Gooch & Housego 
took the strategic decision to consolidate its three crystal growth operations into a single, 
state-of–the-art facility at the main Cleveland site, thereby establishing a centre of 
excellence for crystal growth and enabling the Company to beneﬁt from economies of scale. 
This necessitated the relocation of crystal growth operations from the Crystal Technology 
facility in Palo Alto, California and from the Group’s secondary growth facility in Cleveland.
As at 30 September 2012, the new facility had been completed and all of the Crystal 
Technology crystal growth had been transferred to Cleveland. During the year £1.1m was 
capitalised as part of this project.
A £0.5m investment was also made in the Group’s ﬁbre optic technology replication 
programmes. These programmes will enable the business to better address the geographically 
distinct Aerospace and Defence markets of Europe and the US.
The Group has invested in working capital during the year.  Inventories have increased by 
£1.5m, as the Group has sought to ensure adequate stock to meet customer requirements 
for shorter lead times and secure strategically important supplies of key components. At 30 
September 2012, inventories were £12.8m compared with £11.3m at 30 September 2011.

FINANCIAL  AND OPERATING REVIEW GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 21
In the year ended 30 September 2012 Gooch & Housego generated net cash from 
operating activities of £8.9m, compared to £11.9m in 2011.  
On 26 March 2012, Gooch & Housego paid $3.25m as the ﬁnal tranche of the deferred 
consideration in respect of its 2011 Crystal Technology acquisition. There is no more deferred 
consideration to pay in respect of our previous acquisitions.
Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts as at 30 September 2012 amounted to a 
positive cash position of £9.2m (2011: £11.3m). This compares to £5.7m at the half year.
Net debt reduced from £1.9m at 30 September 2011 to £0.3m at 30 September 2012, a 
reduction of 83%. The movement in net debt is outlined in the table below.

Gooch & Housego’s bank is The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. The Company’s facilities comprise 
an $18 million US Dollar denominated term loan (of which $11.3m is still outstanding), a 
£3.1 million Sterling denominated term loan (of which £2.4m is still outstanding), an $8 
million revolving credit facility (drawn to $4 million as at 30 September 2012) and an undrawn 
capital expenditure facility of $8 million. All facilities are committed until April 2015, 
subject to certain covenant provisions.
ORDER BOOK
As at 30 September 2012, the Group order book stood at £24.9m, compared to £28.5m at 
the end of the 2011 ﬁnancial year, a 13% fall. On a like for like basis, excluding the impact 
of foreign exchange, the order book is 11% lower. Book to bill ratios for the business as a 
whole were 1.01 times (six month rolling average) as at 30 September 2012, compared to 
0.9 times for the same period last year. This is a reﬂection of the strong order performance 
over the last six months of the 2012 ﬁnancial year in which £33.3m of orders were booked.
STAFF
The Group workforce fell from 623 at 30 September 2011 to 588 at the end of September 
2012, a fall of 35. This is a net fall and therefore reﬂects both the reductions in stafﬁng 
resulting from the work the business has done in integration & rationalisation of sites and 
processes; and the additional investment that the business has made in engineering, business 
development and senior management. Most notably this has been demonstrated through 
the appointment of a Chief Technology Ofﬁcer, to drive organic new product development, 
and through the creation of a dedicated Aerospace and Defence business development team 
with the sector specialisation necessary to further exploit the potential for Gooch & Housego 
in this complex market. We would like to welcome them all to Gooch & Housego.
PROSPECTS
The global economic headwinds cause obvious uncertainty for the business as we move 
into 2012. Whilst not immune to the overall global economy, the Board believe that the 
Company is in robust health and, with a strong cash position, appropriate committed 
banking facilities and a broader spread of revenues, has increased its ability to withstand a 
 potential downturn.
In the context of the current economic conditions, Gooch & Housego’s strategy of focussing 
on organic growth in 2012 is considered to be appropriate. We aim to deliver growth 
through the commercialisation of long-term research and development projects, through the 
launch of innovative new products and by leveraging the position we have now established 
in the Aerospace and Defence sector to increase our participation in long-term programmes.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report together with the audited consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements for the year ended 30 September 2012.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS
Gooch & Housego is a manufacturer of acousto-optic, electro-optic and ﬁbre-optic devices, 
precision optical components, crystals, optical instruments and imaging systems.
A review of the development and performance of the Group during the year is set out in the 
Financial Highlights on page 2 and in the Financial and Operating Review on pages 18 to 21. 
An outline of the business’s strategy and the Group’s progress in the year towards these 
strategies is given on page 22. Finally an analysis of the segmental information by market 
sector is given on pages 10 to 16.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
•  Retention of key personnel – The Group recognises the importance of retaining and 
developing its highly skilled management team and workforce in order to achieve its 
strategic objectives. As a result, the Group has and continues to establish development 
and reward schemes to encourage individuals to play a long term role in the future 
development of the Group.
•  Future trading levels and order book – Gooch & Housego PLC has seen a rapid growth 
in its business in recent years. Through its strategies of market diversiﬁcation and moving 
up the value chain, the Group seeks to provide routes to new markets and reduce the 
dependence on any one market sector. However, the continued growth in the business is 
difﬁcult to predict.
•  Financing – As at 30 September 2012 gearing was 0.6% (2011: 3.4%). The level of debt 
is considered to be appropriate and serviceable. The Group operates within certain banking 
covenants which it has reported under and complied with during the ﬁnancial year. The 
Group undertakes detailed and regular ﬁnancial planning and forecasting reviews to 
minimise any ﬁnancial risk due to changing market conditions.
•  Research and Development – The Group invests heavily in research and development, 
to develop new products and maintain the long term growth of Gooch & Housego. The 
development of new processes and products involves risks such as development 
timescales, which may take longer than originally forecast and hence involve more cost. 
There are also technical risks associated with development programmes that mean 
original expected results are not delivered. Expenditure is only capitalised once the 
commercial and technical feasibility of a product is proven. These risks are minimised by 
operating managed research and development programmes which are reviewed against 
cost and technical progress expectations.
KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (“KPIs”)
The Group uses a selection of KPIs to monitor and review the performance of the business.  
These are detailed from page 20 of the Financial and Operating Review.
DIVIDENDS
During the year ended 30 September 2012 a ﬁnal dividend of 3.0p per share was paid for 
the previous ﬁnancial year, the ﬁnal 2010 dividend of 2.0p per share was paid in the year 
ended 30 September 2011.. A further interim dividend of 2.0p per share was paid for the 
half year ended 31 March 2012 (2011: 2.0p).
For the year ended 30 September 2012, the Directors propose that a ﬁnal dividend of 3.2p

TREASURY POLICIES
The Group’s treasury policies are designed to manage ﬁnancial risk to the Group that arises 
from operating in a number of foreign currencies and to maximise interest income on cash 
deposits, whilst maintaining the security of these deposits. As an international group of 
companies, the main exposure is in respect of foreign currency risk on the trading transactions 
undertaken by group companies and on the translation of the net assets of overseas 
subsidiaries. This exposure is principally to the US dollar.
Monthly cash management reporting and forecasting is in place to facilitate management 
of this currency risk. The operations of group treasury take place at head ofﬁce.
All balances not immediately required for group operations are placed on short-term 
deposit with leading international highly rated ﬁnancial institutions.
At a transactional level, the Group seeks to offset its exposure to foreign exchange 
movements by contracting with signiﬁcant supply partners in US Dollars and undertakes 
regular ﬁnancial reviews to assess whether it would be appropriate for the Group to enter 
into currency hedging contracts to mitigate the currency risk. During the year there were 
no forward contracts in place.
At a translational level, the Group has structured the majority of its borrowings in US 
Dollars, which acts as a hedge of a net investment against its US Dollar denominated 
companies within the Group.
QUALITY
The Group prides itself on the highest standards of product quality and customer 
satisfaction. In doing this, it recognises that a failure to maintain such standards would be 
detrimental to its future trading performance. As a result, an ongoing emphasis is placed 
on quality control and customer communication.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group has a continuing commitment to a high level of research and development. This 
commitment is to actively develop new technologies and capabilities that will become a key 
part of the Group’s future product portfolio and revenues.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY AND PRACTICE
It is the Group’s policy to comply with the payment terms agreed with suppliers providing it 
is satisﬁed that the supplier has provided the goods and services in accordance with agreed  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 29
terms and conditions. Trade payables outstanding at 30 September 2012 represent 56 days 
as a proportion of the total amount invoiced by suppliers during the year (2011: 53).
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
The Directors have the beneﬁt of an indemnity which is a qualifying third party indemnity 
provision as deﬁned by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force 
throughout the last ﬁnancial year and is currently in force. The Company also purchased and 
maintained throughout the ﬁnancial year Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ liability insurance in respect 
of itself and its Directors
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
The Group is committed to including all employees in the performance and development of 
the business. An established employee appraisal and reward scheme is in operation and 
employees are appraised regularly with relevant development support provided by the Group.
The Group attaches considerable importance to informing and involving its employees on 
matters which concern them and in the achievement of its business objectives. The Group 
has a formal employee communication plan involving regular meetings between 
management and employees and the provision of a comprehensive employee handbook.
EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS
The Group is committed to employment policies, which follow best practice, based on equal 
opportunities for all employees, irrespective of sex, race, colour, disability or marital status. 
Full and fair consideration is given to applications for employment from disabled persons, 
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Employees who become disabled 
during their working life will be retained in employment wherever possible and will be 
provided help with any necessary rehabilitation and retraining. The Group is prepared to 
modify procedures or equipment, wherever this is practicable, so that full use can be made 
of an individual’s abilities.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board recognises the importance of good corporate governance and has put in place 
procedures it considers appropriate.  
The Board currently comprises three executive and four non-executive Directors. The directors 
holding ofﬁce during the period of this report and their biographies are detailed from page 
24 of this report and are also available on our website; www.goochandhousego.com
The Board focuses on formulation of strategy, management of effective business controls and 
review of business performance. The Board is speciﬁcally responsible for the approval of 
annual and interim results and interim management statements, acquisitions and disposals, 
major capital expenditure, borrowings, director and company secretary appointments and 
removals, any material litigation, strategic forecasting and major development projects.
A framework of delegated authorities is in place that details the structure of delegation 
below Board level and includes matters reserved to the Board.
All the non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent in character 
and judgement. Two non-executive Directors (Dr Eugene Arthurs and Jan Melles) had served 
as non-executive Directors for more than nine years. Dr Eugene Arthurs retired from the 
Board on 22 February 2012 and Jan Melles retired from the Board on 5 October 2012. On 
the 22 February 2012 the Board appointed two new independent non-executive Directors, 
Dr Peter Bordui & Mr Mark Webster.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association all directors will retire at the 
Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The Board has three formally constituted committees, the Audit committee, the Remuneration 
committee and the Nomination committee.
The Audit Committee, which consists of all four non-executive Directors, is responsible for 
ensuring that the ﬁnancial performance of the Group is properly monitored, controlled and 
reported. This committee is chaired by Paul Heal, who in the opinion of the Directors has 
recent and relevant experience to fulﬁl this role, having been a partner with the audit ﬁrm, PwC

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
until the end of 2007. The Committee has met with the external auditors on three occasions 
during the year, together with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, to 
review matters relating to the ﬁnancial statements and internal ﬁnancial control systems.  
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making the recommendation on the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of external auditors, which the Board puts to the 
shareholders for approval at the AGM. It keeps under review the scope and results of the 
audit, its cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the auditors. The 
committee regards it most cost effective to use the auditors for tax advice and compliance 
since this requires an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Group’s business.
The Remuneration Committee consists of all four of the non-executive Directors. This committee 
is chaired by Paul Heal. It has met twice during the year and a summary of the Committee’s 
report is on pages 32 to 33.
The Nomination Committee comprises all four non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer. This committee is chaired by Dr Julian Blogh. The Nomination Committee meets as 
required during the year. The Nomination Committee determines the structure and 
members of the Board and plans for the orderly succession of new directors to the Board. 
Board and committee membership and attendance record is presented in the following table.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
ﬁnancial control. The system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatements and losses.
There are deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation of authorities. There are also internal 
ﬁnancial controls in existence which are centrally maintained and documented and provide 
reasonable assurance of the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability 
of ﬁnancial information used within the business.
The Group does not have an internal audit department, but senior ﬁnance staff perform a 
formal, annual review of all the sites’ internal controls.
Annual budgets are prepared for each company. Financial and operational reports enable the 
Board to compare performance against budget and to take action where appropriate.
During the year the Group implemented a new risk management policy, which is reviewed 
on a regular basis. Gooch & Housego has also developed and published its policies in 
relation to the Bribery Act and fraud.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
The policy of the Group is to meet the statutory environmental requirements placed upon 
it and to apply good environmental practice in its operations while recognising that it is 
contractually obliged to meet its customer requirements.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Images courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 31
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. 
Under that law the directors have prepared the group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and 
the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they 
are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the 
company and of the proﬁt or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the group and parent company ﬁnancial statements respectively;
•  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to 
show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the ﬁnancial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
and Group’s auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken in his duty as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s and Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
GOING CONCERN
Based on Management’s operating projections and cash ﬂow forecasts, the Directors believe 
that the Group will generate sufﬁcient cash and have access to working capital facilities to 
enable it to meet its funding requirements for at least the next 12 months and comply 
with its banking covenants 
Accordingly, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the 
ﬁnancial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company and the 
Group will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

ANNUAL REPORT 2012 32
The Remuneration Committee members at the date of signing the ﬁnancial statements were Mr P Heal (Chair), Dr J Blogh, Dr P Bordui and Mr M Webster.  
Dr E G Arthurs resigned from the committee in February 2012 followed by Mr J Melles in October 2012.  
Although not a member of the committee, Gareth Jones submits a report and is usually requested to present the report to the committee. After presenting 
the report he withdraws from the meeting and does not participate in the decision making or voting processes. 
POLICY ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
It is an objective of the Group to attract and retain Directors of high calibre and reward them in a way which encourages the creation of value for 
shareholders. The Committee undertakes the determination of executive Directors’ annual remuneration packages and these are reviewed with effect 
from 1 October each year. No executive Director plays a part in the discussion about their remuneration.
Executive Directors are paid a basic salary together with annual bonus payments based on the achievement of Group proﬁtability targets. In addition, 
executive Directors participate in a share option scheme and receive beneﬁts in kind, including medical expenses and insurance. 
Non-executive directors are paid a fee to attend board meetings and to serve as members of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees.  
Further payments may be made in respect of additional services provided at the request of the Company, during the year Dr Peter Bordui received 
£11,680 (2011: £Nil). No such payments were made during the previous year.
DIRECTORS’ PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
During the year the Company contributed to a money purchase pension scheme on behalf of the executive Directors. The number of Directors who are accruing 
beneﬁts under a pension scheme is 3 (2011: 3). Contributions to a scheme on behalf of continuing Directors amount to 8% of the Director’s basic salary.
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
Gareth Jones currently has a rolling service contract terminable on six months’ notice. Terry Scribbins and Andrew Boteler also have rolling service 
contracts that are subject to six months’ notice. The Chairman and non-executive Directors do not have contracts of service.

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
POLICY
The Board believes that a share based incentive scheme is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests of shareholders and 
executive Directors. The policy is to make periodic grants of share options under appropriate schemes in place at the time of grant.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Remuneration Committee Report GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 33
At 30 September 2012 Gooch & Housego had two active share based incentive schemes and one other which is dormant. These are detailed below:
GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC 2004 COMPANY SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme (the “2004 Scheme”) had two grants of share options, on 23 July 2004, and on 8 December 
2005. These share option awards were to three executive Directors and four senior employees. No further awards have been made under the 2004 Scheme. 
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
The director’s share options may be exercised on the achievement of certain ﬁnancial performance criteria. 50% of each allocation of options may be 
exercised from the earliest exercise date if the earnings per share ﬁgure for the Group, based on the most recent audited annual ﬁnancial statements, has 
improved by a rate equivalent to the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3%. The remaining 50% of each allocation of options may be exercised 
from the earliest exercise date if the earnings per share ﬁgure for the Group, based on the most recent audited ﬁnancial statements, have improved by a 
rate equivalent to the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 6%.
Senior employees’ share options also have performance criteria attached and can only be exercised if these conditions are met. Details of the performance 
criteria are given in Note 27 of the ﬁnancial statements.

GOOCH & HOUSEGO 2010 VALUE CREATION PLAN
On 7 January 2010, the Company introduced a Value Creation Plan (the “2010 VCP”) as a replacement to the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2007 
LTIP). The 2010 VCP has become the primary equity incentive vehicle to retain and incentivise key employees in the company and align their interests 
with those of shareholders.
Under the 2010 VCP , key employees were granted a one-off award of units from an agreed total. These units had no intrinsic value on grant but give 
participants an opportunity to be awarded Company shares proportionate to the value created for shareholders above the threshold value at the third 
anniversary of the plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, on the third anniversary, being 7 January 2013 value created during the life of the plan, over and above a pre-
determined threshold value based on a share price of £2.00, has been calculated. A share of that value (approximately 12%) will be distributed amongst 
the participating members of senior management of the Group in the form of nil-cost share options (UK participants) and share awards (US participants).  
Half of the awards made are exercisable immediately and the balance after twelve months, subject to certain conditions.
Details of the award are as follows;-
Total number of market value Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) share options awarded:   158,936 
Total number of nil-cost share options and share awarded:     1,380,566
In terms of dilutive effect, in aggregate these awards amount to 7% of the current issued share capital, although, as mentioned above, half the awards 
are not exercisable for twelve months.
Aggregate awards made to Directors of the Group are as follows:-
G C W Jones 19,867 CSOP share options  450,747 Nil-cost share options
T Scribbins 19,867 CSOP share options 265,296 Nil-cost share options
A N Boteler 19,867 CSOP share options 265,296 Nil-cost share options
During the year to 30 September 2012 £471,000 (2011: £471,000) was charged to the income statement in respect of the IFRS 2 share based payments 
charge (valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model) and £370,000 (2011: £150,000) in respect of accrued employers national insurance 
contributions, based on a year end share price of £4.35 (2011: £3.70).
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 34
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT to the Members of Gooch & Housego PLC
We have audited the group annual report and ﬁnancial statements of Gooch 
& Housego PLC for the year ended 30 September 2012 which comprise the 
Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Group Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set 
out on pages 30 and 31, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that 
the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the 
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the group ﬁnancial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 
September 2011 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
ﬁnancial year for which the group ﬁnancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the group ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not 
made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements 
of Gooch & Housego PLC for the year ended 30 September 2012.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2012
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Gooch & Housego PLC (the ”Company”) is incorporated and domiciled in 
the United Kingdom. The Company is listed on the Alternative Investment 
Market (“AIM Market”) of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the 
registered ofﬁce of the Company is given on page 1.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the year ended 
30 September 2012 comprise the Company, Gooch & Housego PLC, and 
its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). A listing of the 
Company’s major subsidiaries is set out on page 61.
The Group is a manufacturer of specialist optoelectronic components, materials 
and systems and specialist instrumentation and life sciences devices. The 
Group has facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States.
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modiﬁed by ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) at fair value and in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union 
and interpretations in issue at 30 September 2012, and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with IFRS.  
3 APPLICATION OF IFRS
Adoption of new standards
During the current reporting period there were no new standards or 
amendments which had a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
In addition, standards or amendments issued but not yet effective are 
not expected to have a material impact on the net assets of the Group. 
However, the Group is closely monitoring the IASB projects on contract 
revenue recognition and the lease accounting overhaul as they could 
potentially have a material impact on the Group’s results.
4 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
ﬁnancial statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently 
applied to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. 
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and 
operating policies of the entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable 
or convertible are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of 
subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of a business combination is measured as the 
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, the fair value of contingent 
or deferred consideration and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 
exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are charged to the 
income statement. The excess of the costs of a business combination over the fair 
value of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of 
a business combination is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Should 
the fair value of contingent or deferred consideration vary from the actual value 
on settlement date, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between 
Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated but 
considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a grouping of operations engaged in providing 
products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different 
from those of other business segments. A market segment is engaged in 
providing products or services within a particular economic environment 
that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of 
segments operating in other economic environments.
The chief operating decision maker in determining a business or operating 
segment is the Board of Directors.
Foreign currency translation
a.  Functional and presentational currency
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, 
which is the Group’s presentational currency. Items included in the 
ﬁnancial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (the “functional currency”). 
b.  Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into an entity’s functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at balance sheet exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as 
qualifying cash ﬂow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
c.  Subsidiaries
The results and ﬁnancial position of subsidiaries that have a functional 
currency different from the presentational currency are translated into the 
presentational currency as follows: 
•  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at 
the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
•  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at 
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at 
the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
•  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of 
the net investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken 
to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of 
or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised 
in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. 
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items.
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work in progress. 
Certain plant used in the manufacturing process which is constructed from 
precious metals is not depreciated. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 41
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2012
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to 
allocate their cost over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
• Freehold buildings         2-3% Straight line
• Leasehold property over term of lease Straight line
• Plant and machinery  10-20% Straight line
•  Fixtures, ﬁttings and 
computer hardware 10-33% Straight line
• Motor vehicles 25% Reducing balance
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Where an asset’s carrying amount 
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, the asset’s carrying 
amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
or an asset’s value in use.
Intangible assets
a.  Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over 
the fair value of the net identiﬁable assets of the acquired business. Goodwill 
arising from business combinations is included in ‘intangible assets’. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. The impairment testing requires an estimation of the ‘value 
in use’ of the Cash-generating unit (the “CGU”) to which goodwill is allocated 
using appropriately discounted cash ﬂow projections. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately as an expense to the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing a CGU is deﬁned as either a business 
segment or an operating entity, as appropriate. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount 
of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
b.  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
Internally incurred costs associated with the ﬁling and perfection 
of patents and trademarks are capitalised and carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight 
line method to allocate the cost over their useful economic lives and are 
charged to Research and Development costs in the income statement.
Acquired patents, trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost. 
Patents, trademarks and licences have a ﬁnite useful life and are carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight line method to allocate the cost over their useful economic lives.
c.  Computer software
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software 
programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the development of identiﬁable and 
unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably  
generate economic beneﬁts exceeding costs beyond one year, are capitalised 
and recognised as intangible assets. Costs include the software development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. 
Acquired computer software and licences are capitalised on the basis of 
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the speciﬁc software. 
Capitalised software costs are amortised using the straight line method 
over their estimated useful lives of up to 5 years and charged to 
Administration costs in the income statement.
d.  Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining 
new scientiﬁc or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised as 
an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and 
technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to 
complete the development has been taken and resources made available, 
are capitalised. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, 
direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Development costs are amortised 
using the straight line method over their estimated useful life which is 
typically 7 years and are charged to Research and Development costs in 
the income statement.
e.  Acquired intangibles
Other acquired intangible assets are stated at fair value less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. 
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on the differing 
natures of each of the intangible assets acquired. Amortisation is charged 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.
• Customer relationships     up to 3 years
• Brand names      up to 3 years
• Acquired patents, trademarks and licences    up to 3 years
Government grants
Government grants are accounted for on an accruals basis. Grants are 
credited to the income statement over the life of the project. Where 
grants are used to fund the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, 
the grant is initially credited to deferred income then credited to the 
income statement over the estimated economic life of the asset.
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether an asset may be 
impaired. If any such indicator exists, the Group tests for impairment by 
estimating the recoverable amount which is the higher of the value in 
use and the fair value less costs to sell. If the recoverable amount is less 
than the carrying value of the asset, the asset is impaired and the carrying 
value is reduced to its recoverable amount. In addition to this, assets with 
indeﬁnite lives are tested for impairment annually.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except those with maturities greater than 12 
months from the balance sheet date. These are classiﬁed as non-current 
assets. Loans and receivables are classiﬁed as trade and other receivables 
in the balance sheet.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net 
realisable value. The cost of ﬁnished goods and work in progress comprises 
design costs, raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related 
production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes 
borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Long-term contract balances included in work in progress comprise costs 
incurred on long-term contracts, net of any amounts transferred to trading 
expenditure, after deducting foreseeable losses and related payments 
on account. Costs include all direct material and labour costs incurred in  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 42
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2012
bringing a contract to its state of completion at the year end. Provisions for 
estimated losses on contracts are made in the period in which such losses 
are foreseen. Long term contract balances do not include attributable 
proﬁt. The amount by which customer billings exceed the revenue 
recognised on a contract is shown as a payment on account.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the receivables. Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial 
difﬁculties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy 
or ﬁnancial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more 
than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable 
may be impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted 
at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss 
is recognised in the income statement within ‘Administration costs’’. When a 
trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account 
for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited against ‘Administration costs’ in the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with 
banks with original maturities of three months or less, and the drawn down 
balance of the $8m Revolving Credit Facility. The drawn down balance of the 
$8m Revolving Credit Facility is shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
in the balance sheet.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset the borrowing costs are 
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Borrowing costs are classiﬁed as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
that a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their 
fair value. The Group documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item and, on a periodic basis, assesses 
whether the hedge is effective.
The fair value of the ﬁnancial instrument used for hedging purposes is 
disclosed in Note 30. Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders 
equity is disclosed in Note 26.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are 
designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in equity.
Taxation
Income tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year 
using rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax 
payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for, if it 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other 
than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised 
or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income and equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and equity.
In the UK and US, the Company is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts 
treated as compensation on exercise of certain employee share options 
under each jurisdiction’s tax rules. As explained under “Share options” 
below, a compensation expense is recorded in the Company’s income 
statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of 
the relevant options. As there is a temporary difference between the 
accounting and tax bases, a deferred income tax asset is recorded. The 
deferred income tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated 
amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based on the 
Company’s share price at the balance sheet date) with the cumulative 
amount of the compensation recorded in the income statement. If the 
amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount 
of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded 
directly in equity, against retained earnings.
Employee beneﬁts
a. Pension obligations
The Group operates money purchase pension schemes for UK employees 
and Section 401(k) plans for US employees. The Group pays contributions 
to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are recognised as an employee beneﬁt expense in 
the income statement when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
the future payments is available.  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 43
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2012
b.  Proﬁt share and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and proﬁt-
sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the proﬁt 
attributable to the Group’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The 
Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there 
is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
c.  Share options
The Group operates two active share option schemes and one dormant 
scheme. In accordance with IFRS 2 the fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an 
expense in the income statement. The total amount to be expensed 
over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of 
the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, proﬁtability targets). Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to vest. 
Employer’s National Insurance in the United Kingdom and equivalent taxes 
in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options. 
In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated as a cash-settled transaction. A  
provision is made, calculated using the fair value of the Company’s shares at 
the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options. 
At each balance sheet date, for awards with non market vesting conditions, 
the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected 
to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, 
in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The fair 
value of the options under the 2004 Gooch & Housego PLC Company Share 
Option Scheme was determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. The fair value of the options under the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value 
Creation Plan was determined by using the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an 
outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the 
amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that 
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks speciﬁc to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Leases
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of an asset are treated as a ﬁnance lease. Assets held under a ﬁnance 
lease are capitalised at their fair value at the inception of the lease and 
depreciated over the estimated useful economic life of the asset or lease 
term if shorter.
Finance charges are associated with the ﬁnance lease are expensed in 
proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases. Operating lease rentals 
are expensed in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of 
the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, 
rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be 
reliably measured, it is probable that future economic beneﬁts will ﬂow 
to the entity and when speciﬁc criteria have been met for each of the 
Group’s activities as described below. The amount of revenue is not 
considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the 
sale have been resolved.
a.  Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying 
sale have been transferred to the customer, and when collectability of 
the related receivable is reasonably assured. Depending on the terms of 
business, this occurs either on the dispatch/delivery of the goods supplied 
or on acceptance by the customer.
b.  Long-term contracts
Two companies within the Group (Cleveland and EM4) have a number of 
long-term contracts in place. Revenue is recognised on these by reference 
to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet 
date. Revenue and proﬁts are determined by estimating the outcome of 
the contract and determining the costs and proﬁt attributable to the stage 
of completion.
Where the outcome of the contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract 
costs are recognised as an expense when incurred and revenue is recognised 
to the extent of the costs incurred that are expected to be recoverable. In 
both cases, any expected contract loss is recognised immediately.
Revenue from long-term contracts recognised in the year ended 30 
September 2012 was £3,667,000 (2011: £1,779,000).
c.  Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as 
a liability in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
5 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk management
Management considers capital as equity, as shown in the Group balance 
sheet, excluding net debt.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the 
Group’s ability 
• to continue as a going concern, 
•  to provide returns for shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders 
and 
• to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Board is satisﬁed that these objectives have been met during the year. 
Actions taken during the year to achieve these objectives are outlined in 
the Chief Executive’s Review.  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 44
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2012
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may
• adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
• return capital to shareholders,
• issue new shares,
• sell assets to reduce debt and
• vary the level of debt ﬁnancing.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the 
basis of the debt to equity ratio. 
A summary of the Company’s debt to equity ratio at 30 September is set 
out below:
   Note 2012  2011
    £000  £000
Total borrowings 22 12,035  15,697
Less: cash and cash equivalents 20 (11,712)  (13,844)
Net borrowings  323  1,853
    
Total equity  58,566  54,100
Debt to equity ratio  0.6%  3.4%
The decrease in the debt to equity ratio during 2012 resulted primarily as 
a result of the repayment of bank borrowings and the positive cashﬂow 
achieved through the Group’s strong trading performance.
While the Group’s debt to equity ratio is consistently monitored, changes 
in the Group’s need for capital and the selection of the source and funding 
of capital are assessed against a number of criteria which may have a 
direct effect on the Group debt to equity ratio. 
The Group’s capital needs include, but are not solely limited to, its
• investment in non-current assets;
• investment in working capital; and
• acquisition of businesses, technologies and other intangible assets.
 
The criteria against which the Group’s capital needs are assessed include, 
but are not limited to, 
• availability of and cost of debt ﬁnancing;
• ability to raise equity ﬁnancing at an acceptable share price; and
• ratio of debt to equity. 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk 
(including currency risk and cash ﬂow interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. Where considered 
appropriate, the Company will use derivative ﬁnancial instruments to 
hedge risk exposures during the year.
i. Market risk
a. Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange 
risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the 
US Dollar. 
Foreign exchange risk arises from 
• future commercial transactions;
• recognised assets and liabilities; and
• net investments in foreign operations.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets 
are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. 
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign 
operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the 
relevant foreign currencies. 
No ﬁnancial derivatives have been entered into to manage foreign 
exchange exposure.
As a signiﬁcant amount of the Group’s proﬁt is earned by its US subsidiaries, 
the Group’s proﬁt is sensitive to movements in the US Dollar exchange rate. 
If the average US Dollar exchange rate for the year had been consistent 
with the closing exchange rate at 30 September 2011, with all other 
variables constant, post tax proﬁts for the year would have been £25,000 
higher (2011: £167,000 higher) as a result of the translation in US Dollars.   
Equity is more sensitive to movement in the US Dollar exchange rate as 
a signiﬁcant amount of the Group’s net assets are held in the Group’s US 
subsidiaries. If the US Dollar weakened by 10% against Pound Sterling with 
all other variables held constant, the net assets of the Group would be 
£3,099,000 lower (2011: £3,334,000 lower). If the US Dollar strengthened by 
10% against Pound Sterling with all other variables held constant, the net 
assets of the Group would be £3,787,000 higher (2011: £4,074,000 higher).
b. Cash ﬂow interest rate risk
The Group has cash balances of £11.7m which are held in interest bearing 
current accounts. The Group’s income and operating cash ﬂows are 
substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from its long term borrowings and 
revolving credit facility. A 1% increase in the cost of borrowing would have 
resulted in an annualised increase in interest expense of £38,000 (2011: 
£43,000) had the Group’s borrowings been in place throughout the year.
Borrowings issued at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash ﬂow 
interest rate risk. The Group uses an interest rate swap to hedge a proportion 
of the interest rate risk. During 2011 and 2012, the Group’s borrowings at 
variable interest rates were denominated in Pound Sterling and US Dollars as 
detailed in Note 22.
ii. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a customer or 
counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. It arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables.
a. Trade and other receivables
The management of credit risk exposure is the responsibility of each 
business unit which has credit policies in place to mitigate the risk. The 
credit policies seek to verify a customer’s credit worthiness prior to trading 
and maintain the level of trading within agreed credit limits. Changes to 
credit limits require authorisation in accordance with internal control policies.
The Group is exposed to concentration of credit risk. The Group’s top 10 
customers in 2012 accounted for 32% of the Group’s revenue (2011: 33%).  
No individual customer made up more than 6% of revenue (2011: 6%).
The Group’s trade receivables are analysed in note 19.
b. Cash
Cash is held in current and deposit accounts with ﬁnancial institutions 
which have credit ratings of A+ or greater. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 45
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2012
iii. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial 
obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to achieve a balance between 
certainty of funding and a ﬂexible, cost effective borrowing structure.
The Company’s facilities comprise an $18 million US Dollar denominated term 
loan of which $11.3m is still outstanding (2011: $15.8m), a £3.1 million Sterling 
denominated term loan of which £2.4m is still outstanding (2011: £2.9m), an 
$8 million revolving credit facility (drawn to $4 million at both 30 September 
2012 and 30 September 2011) and an undrawn capital expenditure facility 
of $8 million. These are analysed in Notes 22 and 29. All facilities are 
committed until April 2015, subject to certain covenant provisions.
The Group aims to ensure that there are sufﬁcient funds or credit lines 
available to supplement cash ﬂows generated from trading to meet 
known obligations in the next twelve months.
6 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) requires the Directors to make critical 
accounting estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
in the ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates 
and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting 
accounting estimates will on occasions fail to equal actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have signiﬁcant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next ﬁnancial year are outlined below.
 
Going Concern
The Directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability to 
continue to trade as a going concern. In making this assessment the Directors 
make critical estimates and judgements in respect of expected future 
revenues, costs, investment requirements and debt servicing obligations. 
The Directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded 
that it is appropriate to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements on a going 
concern basis. The two main considerations were as follows:
•  Group cash ﬂow – During the year ended 30 September 2012, the Group 
was highly cash generative due to a strong trading performance. The 
Group expects to continue generating cash from operating activities. 
 
The Group investment in property, plant and equipment for the year 
ended 30 September 2012 has increased over the previous ﬁnancial 
year. This investment is expected to continue into the next ﬁnancial year.
•  Bank Facilities – The Group maintains a regular and ongoing constructive 
dialogue with its bankers and keeps them advised of Group developments 
and progress against its business plan. The Royal Bank of Scotland plc 
has committed signiﬁcant facilities to the Group which is available 
through April 2015. 
 
At 30 September 2012, the Group had available cash resources, based 
on translating the revolving credit facility at the closing exchange rate for 
the US Dollar to Pound Sterling, of £14.2m (2011: £16.4m).
Revenue recognition
Revenue from long term contracts is recognised on a percentage-of-
completion method basis. Use of this method requires an estimation of the 
total project resource requirement and also an estimation of the cost to 
complete and the assessment of potential losses on uncompleted contracts.
Provisions for income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.  Signiﬁcant 
judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income 
taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate 
tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.  
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.  Where the ﬁnal 
tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were 
initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred 
income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. This requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the Cash Generating Units (the “CGUs”) 
to which goodwill is allocated. As set out in Note 17, estimating the value 
in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash 
ﬂows from the CGUs and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present values of those cash ﬂows.
Provision for impairment of trade receivables
The Group assesses trade receivables for impairment which requires an 
estimation of the likelihood of payment forfeiture by customers. In making 
this assessment, the Directors will consider the payment history of the 
customer as well as the customer’s future viability.
Inventory provision
The Group continually monitors and assesses the provision for old and slow 
moving inventory. Factors considered by the Directors include the expected 
future usage and the potential obsolescence and deterioration of the Inventory .
Warranty provision
The Group monitors and assesses its warranty provision requirement 
on a continuing basis. In addition to considering historical repair and 
replacement costs, the Directors will also assess expected changes in 
future costs based on current information.
 
Share options
The Company has two active share option schemes and one dormant 
scheme. In accordance with IFRS 2, share options are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined is then expensed 
in the Group income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting 
period, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the 
options under the 2004 Gooch & Housego PLC Company Share Option 
Scheme was measured by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  
The fair value of the options under the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value 
Creation Plan was measured by using the Monte Carlo option pricing 
model. The valuation of share options requires several judgements to 
be made in respect of the number of options that are expected to be 
exercised. Details of the assumptions included in the valuation of options 
are disclosed in Note 27. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

Factors affecting the future tax charge
Overseas tax losses of £1.8m (2011: £2.2m) and UK tax losses of £0.9m (2011: £0.9m) are available to offset against future proﬁts of the Group. The utilisation 
of these losses is not sufﬁciently certain to recognise a deferred tax asset.
The Finance Act 2011 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.  In his Budget speech 
on 21 March 2012 the Chancellor announced a further reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012. This further reduction 
was enacted under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 on 26 March 2012.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 has been included in the Finance Act 2012 and substantively 
enacted on 17 July 2012. Accordingly, the net deferred tax asset has been recognised at 23% resulting in a decrease in the Group’s net deferred tax asset 
and a charge to the statement of comprehensive income of £54,000.
The proposed further reduction in the rate of corporation tax by 2% to 21% from 1 April 2014 has not yet been substantively enacted. Therefore, this rate 
change has not been recognised in these ﬁnancial statements.

15 EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of earnings per 20p Ordinary Share is based on the proﬁt for the year using as a divisor the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in 
issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares for the year ended 30 September is given below:
        2012 2011
Number of shares used for basic earnings per share     21,860,241 21,162,500

Number of shares used for dilutive earnings per share     23,392,234 22,357,268
A reconciliation of the earnings used in the earnings per share calculation is set out below:
      2012  2011

Goodwill is allocated according to each operating entity as follows; Cleveland (£2.1m), Melbourne (£1.8m), Norderstedt (£0.1m), Ilminster (£0.6m), New 
Jersey (£0.6m), Torquay (£1.3m), Moorpark (£5.1m) and EM4 (£5.8m).  
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment testing requires an estimation of the 
‘value in use’ of the CGU. The value in use calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow projections based on the latest projections approved by the Board for year 
one. For the purposes of the impairment review, the following key assumptions were made in respect of the cash ﬂows beyond year one:
• 42% Projected gross proﬁt margin
• 5% Average growth in EBITDA to 2015, 3% thereafter
• 15% Weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash ﬂow
The projected gross proﬁt margin and average growth is based on past performance and the Directors’ expectations for the foreseeable future. Based on 
this calculation of the value in use, no impairment of goodwill has arisen during the year ended 30 September 2012.
At the 30 September 2011 as part of its bi-annual review of the carrying value of goodwill, the Board took the decision to impair the goodwill of the 
General Optics acquisition. General Optics, now referred to as Gooch & Housego Moorpark, was acquired in October 2008 for a consideration of $21m and, 
prior to the impairment, the carrying value of the associated goodwill was £7.1m.   GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

Overseas tax losses of £1.8m (2011: £2.2m) and UK tax losses of £0.9m (2011: £0.9m) are available to offset against future proﬁts of the Group. The 
Group has not recognised a deferred income tax asset of £0.6m (2011: £0.9m) in respect of these losses due to uncertainty as to whether they would be 
utilised within the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax asset to be recovered within 12 months is expected to be £719.000. The amount of deferred tax liability to be settled within 
12 months is expected to be £118,000.
No deferred tax has been provided in relation to unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries on the basis that no incremental tax charge is currently 
anticipated to arise upon remittance of these earnings to the UK.

27 SHARE OPTIONS
The Company operates two active share option schemes, the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme (the “2004 Scheme”) and the 
Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan (the “2010 VCP”), which grant share options to certain employees. A third scheme, the Gooch & Housego 2007 
Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2007 LTIP”), is dormant.
The Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme
Under the 2004 Scheme, the Company has ceased granting share options. Options under this scheme are granted at market price on the date of grant with 
a ﬁxed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of the grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years and is 
subject to continued employment.
At 30 September 2012, four senior employees within the Group have 444,077 share options outstanding relating to the 2004 Scheme. These options 
are subject to speciﬁc performance criteria, namely that their subsidiary audited pre-tax proﬁts for the relevant year will be at least US$500,000 and the 
subsidiary pre-tax proﬁts will be not less than 95% of the agreed budget. The remuneration report details the executive Directors’ share options and the 
performance criteria which are needed to be met for them to exercise their options. 
The options under the 2004 Scheme were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per option and the assumptions used in the 
calculations are as follows:
Grant date      8 Dec 2005 23 Jul 2004
Share price at grant date      272.5p 133.5p
Exercise price      272.5p 133.5p

Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield     1.49% 1.49%
Fair value per option      98.4p 66.1p
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The 
expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent 
with the assumed option life. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

criteria. The remuneration report details the performance criteria. Under the plan, key employees are granted a one-off award of units from an agreed 
total. Three executive Directors have been awarded 44 units out of the total pool of 64 units and eight key employees hold the remaining 20 units.
The 2010 VCP was valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility of 73.5% used in the model is based on the historical 
volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to 7 January 2010. The risk free rate of 2.1% was used. The total fair value of all the 
units granted to the participants in the 2010 VCP was £1,614,640. 
The Gooch & Housego 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan
The 2007 LTIP has been replaced by the 2010 VCP .  The share options granted under the 2007 LTIP have been surrendered by the participants and the 
scheme is now dormant.

29 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise an interest rate swap, bank borrowings, cash at bank, ﬁnance leases and various items such as trade 
receivables and trade payables that directly arise from its operations. The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  
The Board’s policy on these risks is set out in the Directors’ Report.
Operations are ﬁnanced through a mixture of retained proﬁts, cash reserves, bank borrowings and ﬁnance leases. Other than ﬁnance leases the Board’s 
policy is to use variable rate borrowings whenever possible. Short-term funding ﬂexibility is achieved through the Group’s $8.0m revolving credit facility.
The currency proﬁle for the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are set out below.

Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set 
out on pages 30 and 31, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with

to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the annual report and ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the parent company ﬁnancial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 
September 2012;

Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or 
•  the parent company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.

Company Balance Sheet
As at 30 September 2012 GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2012 60
NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET for the year ended 30 September 2012
1 COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain ﬁxed 
assets and have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and the Companies Act 2006.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied over the period reported.
Pension schemes
The Company operates a money purchase pension scheme for Directors and staff. The assets of the scheme are held in separately administered funds. The 
pension charge represents contributions payable to the funds during the year.  Expenses under the plan are charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
Share options
The Company operates two active share option plans which grant share options to key employees and one dormant scheme. These plans are subject to 
both market and non-market related vesting conditions. Option grants are measured at fair value which is then charged to the proﬁt and loss account on 
a straight line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reﬂect expected and actual forfeiture during the vesting period due to failure to 
satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Gooch 
& Housego PLC 2004 Share Option Scheme and the Monte Carlo option pricing model for the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an 
increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
which arise on the settlement of transactions and on the translation of other monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the proﬁt and loss account.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost or valuation of the ﬁxed 
assets, over their useful lives, at the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings  2-3% Straight line
Plant and machinery  10-20% Straight line
Fixtures, ﬁttings and computers 10-33% Straight line
Capitalised software and licenses 25-33% Straight line
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work in progress.
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Where overseas borrowing is required to ﬁnance the investment in overseas 
subsidiaries, the investment is retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences.  Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is more likely than not. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
Financial liabilities
Finance costs associated with ﬁnancial liabilities are charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the life of the instrument.  Issue costs are accounted for as 
a deduction against the gross borrowings received and are amortised over the life of the instrument.
Financial instruments
The Company has not used derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge its exposure to currency risk. It has entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its 
exposure to interest rate movements. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to this swap. Amounts receivable or payable in respect of this derivative 
are recognised to interest expense over the period of the contract.  Changes in the derivative’s fair value are not recognised. Further details are given in Note 11. 
Leases
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as a ﬁnance lease. Assets held under a ﬁnance lease 
are capitalised at their fair value at the inception of the lease and depreciated over the estimated useful economic life of the asset or lease term if 
shorter. Finance charges associated with the ﬁnance lease are expensed in proportion to the capital amount outstanding. All other leases are classiﬁed as 
operating leases. Operating lease rentals are expensed in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
2 COMPANY PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
Gooch & Housego PLC has taken advantage of section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own proﬁt and loss account in these 
ﬁnancial statements. The Company’s loss after tax was £2,007,240 (2011: £2,590,000). 
Fees payable to the Company auditor for the year amounted to £15,800 (2011: £15,400). GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

15 SHARE OPTIONS
The Company operates two active share option schemes, the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme (the “2004 Scheme”) and the 
Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan (the “2010 VCP”), which grant share options to certain employees.  A third scheme, the Gooch & Housego 
2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2007 LTIP”), is dormant.
The Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme
Under the 2004 Scheme, the Company has ceased granting share options. Options under this scheme are granted at market price on the date of grant 
with a ﬁxed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of the grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years and 
is subject to continued employment.
At 30 September 2012, four senior employees within the Group have 444,077 share options outstanding relating to the 2004 Scheme. These options 
are subject to speciﬁc performance criteria, namely that their subsidiary audited pre-tax proﬁts for the relevant year will be at least US$500,000 and the 
subsidiary pre-tax proﬁts will be not less than 95% of the agreed budget. The remuneration report details the executive Directors’ share options and the 
performance criteria which are needed to be met for them to exercise their options.  
The options under the 2004 Scheme were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per option and the assumptions used in the 
calculations are as follows:
Grant date      8 Dec 2005 23 Jul 2004
Share price at grant date      272.5p 133.5p
Exercise price      272.5p 133.5p
Number of employees      2 5
Shares under option      250,000 1,313,275
Vesting period (years)      1-4 1-4
Expected volatility      38.1% 56.7%
Option life (years)      10 10
Expected life (years)      5.5 5.5
Risk free rate      4.23% 4.99%
Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield     1.49% 1.49%
Fair value per option      98.4p 66.1p
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. 
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term 
consistent with the assumed option life.
The Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan
Under the 2010 VCP , the amount of options granted will not be determined until the end of the plan’s three year term and meeting the performance 
criteria. The remuneration report details the performance criteria. Under the plan, key employees are granted a one-off award of units from an agreed 
total. Three executive Directors have been awarded 44 units out of the total pool of 64 units and eight key employees hold the remaining 20 units.
The 2010 VCP was valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility of 73.5% used in the model is based on the historical 
volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to 7 January 2010. The risk free rate of 2.1% was used. The total fair value of all the 
units granted to the participants in the 2010 VCP was £1,614,640.    GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

The 2007 LTIP has been replaced by the 2010 VCP . The share options granted under the 2007 LTIP have been surrendered by the participants and the 
scheme is now dormant.

On 7 January 2013, 1,539,502 share options were granted to directors and employees under the Group’s Value Creation Plan (VCP). In terms of dilutive effect, in

By order of the Board 
Andrew Boteler
Director and Company Secretary   24 January 2013
Registered Ofﬁce: Dowlish Ford, Ilminster, Somerset TA19 0PF 
Registered Number: 526832
Notes: 
1  Resolutions 1 to 13 (inclusive) are proposed as Ordinary Resolutions. 
This means that for those resolutions to be passed, more than half of 
the votes cast on such resolutions must be in favour of such resolutions. 
Resolutions 14 and 15 are proposed as Special Resolutions. This means 
that for those resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the 
votes cast on such resolutions must be in favour of such resolutions.
2  Resolution 13 is proposed as an Ordinary Resolution for the following 
reasons. In accordance with the terms of the Gooch & Housego 2009 
Value Creation Plan and as disclosed in the Remuneration Committee 
Report contained in each of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 Annual Reports of 
the Company, the Company has awarded nil cost options to its Executive 
Directors and certain senior managers. The Value Creation Plan matured 
on 7 January 2013 and accordingly the participants in the Plan are now 
entitled to exercise half of their nil cost options or US restricted shares and 
will become entitled to exercise the other half of such entitlement in 2014. 
In order to facilitate such exercise, the Company is seeking authority to 
capitalise up to an aggregate of £276,113.20 of its reserves in order to 
pay up the par value of the shares over which nil cost options and US 
restricted shares are exercised, being up to 1,380,566 ordinary shares of 
£0.20 each. As the Company has already issued a number of ordinary 
shares of £0.20 each on an unpaid basis pursuant to the exercise of a 
small number of nil cost options prior to the date of the meeting, the 
Company is also seeking to ratify those issues of shares which will be 
paid up by means of the capitalisation for which authorisation is sought. 
3  A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to 
appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of the member’s 
rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting (or any adjournment of 
the meeting). A proxy need not be a member of the Company. If a 
member appoints more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, each 
proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that member. 
4  To appoint as a proxy a person other than the Chairman of the meeting, a 
member must insert the proxy’s full name in the box on the proxy form. 
If a member signs and returns a proxy form with no name in the box, the 
Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be the member’s proxy. Where 
a member appoints as a proxy someone other than the Chairman, the 
member is responsible for ensuring that the proxy attends the meeting and 
is aware of the member’s voting intentions. If a member wishes a proxy 
to make any comments on the member’s behalf, the member will need 
to appoint someone other than the Chairman and give them the 
relevant instructions directly.  
5  A member which is a corporation is entitled to appoint one or more 
corporate representatives to exercise the same powers on behalf of the 
corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual 
member. If a member which is a corporation appoints more than one 
corporate representative in relation to the meeting (or any adjournment 
of the meeting), each such corporate representative shall be entitled to 
exercise the same powers on behalf of that corporation as that corporation 
could exercise if it were an individual member, provided that if such persons 
purport to exercise those powers the same way, those powers shall be 
treated as exercised in that way, but if those persons purport to exercise 
those powers in different ways, those powers shall be treated as not 
exercised. In the case of a member which is a corporation, the proxy form 
must be executed under the corporation’s common seal or signed on its 
behalf by a duly authorised ofﬁcer of the corporation or an attorney for 
the corporation.
6  A form of proxy is enclosed. To be valid, the form of proxy (and any 
power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed) 
must by duly completed and signed and deposited at the ofﬁce of the 
Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars Limited, Freepost RSBH-UXKS-LRBC, 
PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 
hours before the time for holding the meeting (or any adjournment of the 
meeting). Completion of a form of proxy does not preclude a member 
from attending and voting in person at the meeting if (s)he so wishes.
7  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001, 
the Company speciﬁes that only those members entered in the 
Company’s register of members at 6.00 pm on 25 February 2013 shall 
be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of 
shares registered in their names at that time. Changes in the Company’s 
register of members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the 
rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting. If the meeting is 
adjourned, the time which is 48 hours (disregarding any part of a day 
which is not a working day) before the time ﬁxed for the adjourned 
meeting shall apply for the purpose of determining the entitlement of 
members to attend and vote at the adjourned meeting.
8  To appoint a proxy or to give or amend an instruction to a previously 
appointed proxy via the CREST system, the CREST message must be received 
by the issuer’s agent by 11.00 a.m. on 25 February 2013. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message. After this time 
any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the proxy by other means. CREST Personal Members or 
other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST Members who have 
appointed voting service provider(s) should contact their CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s) for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST. 
For further information on CREST procedures, limitations and system timings 
please refer to the CREST Manual. The Company or its Registrars may treat 
as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST in the circumstances set out 
in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001. 
In any case your Form of Proxy must be received by the Company’s 
Registrars by no later than 11.00 a.m. on 25 February 2013.
9  Copies of Directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment and the 
rules of the Company Share Option Schemes will be available for inspection 
at the registered ofﬁce of the Company from the date of this Notice of 
AGM until the date of the meeting during normal business hours, and at 
the place of the meeting from 10.45 a.m. until its conclusion. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

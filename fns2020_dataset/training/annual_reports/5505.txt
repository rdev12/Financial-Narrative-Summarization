How does your team
ma e a di erence While many companies take a 
sequential approach to project 
execution, we often progress 
projects in parallel – and can do 
so because of our nimbleness and 
speed of reaction.
One of the distinctive features of 
EnQuest is that we don’t have to 
work through many layers of the 
business to reach decision makers. 
Things can be made to happen 
quickly and ef ciently.
From a career perspective, our 
prospective growth means team 
members can remain in a post 
or working discipline they enjoy, 
but nevertheless develop their 
responsibilities and capabilities 
as the business grows.

BUSINESS REVIEW
–FIELD LIFE EXTENSIONS
Thistle is a prime example of how 
we are able to recover more oil from 
mature assets through a combination of 
innovative ways of working and technical 
expertise. It demonstrates what EnQuest 
does best and underlines our long term 
commitment to the North Sea.
EnQuest’s commitment to investing in mature infrastructure 
to realise untapped production potential is exempli ed 
by its Thistle Late Life Extension LL project. This large 
scale programme extends the eld life and realises reserves. 
 roduction from Thistle, which was installed in 1976, had been 
in decline before EnQuest instigated this multi-faceted 
revitalisation project.
The rst phase was a successful rig reactivation project and 
the subsequent drilling of ve new wells, resulting in a rise in 
production levels not seen since the 1990s. Drilling operations 
were not only characterised by ef ciency and excellent results, 
but by exceptional safety performance the team recorded ve 
years free of any lost time incidents LTIs .
The subsequent stages of Thistle LL involve a programme 
of coordinated enhancements to the infrastructure and to key 
systems. The rst major element of this programme saw the 
successful installation of a new power generation turbine and 
local equipment room, signi cantly enhancing power supply in 
terms of capacity and reliability. The installation and heavy lift 
required careful planning and was awlessly executed by a team 
who demonstrated many EnQuest values, such as agility, 
collaboration and creativity.
Other elements of the programme include a process 
simpli cation exercise to create a t-for-purpose plant 
environment, a new process control and safety system, 
topsides integrity work, and structure focused workscopes 
to maintain the jacket integrity of the asset. The latter stages 
of the programme were signi cantly bolstered in early 201 
when it was announced that EnQuest had secured a brown eld 
tax allowance in support of its plans to maximise recovery from 
Thistle. EnQuest is among the rst operators to secure the 
allowance, which is one of a series of UK Government measures 
aimed at stimulating growth in the North Sea, and enables the 
business to commit fully to a new phase of investment.

Why has this project been 
so successful to date From the outset, we sought to 
engage everyone involved in 
dialogue about how we could 
make Thistle better – how we 
could recover those extra barrels.
We knew the principles: we needed 
people to share the vision, we 
needed the processes, and we 
needed to create a cycle of policy 
setting and practical improvements 
to drive change. Once those were 
established, we knew operational 
excellence would emerge.

How will Thistle bene t 
from the LLX (late life 
extension) upgrades When feasibility studies originally 
identi ed that Thistle’s eld life could 
be extended by a further 15 years or 
more, EnQuest was quick to seize on 
this substantial opportunity to add 
value and to recognise its potential 
for other maturing elds. 
The Thistle LLX upgrades 
enhance asset integrity and allow 
for the further safe extraction 
of hydrocarbons. This project 
demonstrates EnQuest’s continued 
belief in the future of the North Sea.

–MARGINAL FIELD SOLUTIONS
Alma/Galia is not only creating a new 
lease of life for what was the  North 
Sea’s rst producing eld, but the 
project exempli es the ability of 
EnQuest’s people to formulate strong 
economic solutions for mature assets.
Alma/Galia is EnQuest’s rst new hub. It re ects our focus on 
identifying new opportunities in mature assets and creating a 
technology led solution to maximise recovery. The past year has 
seen the key elements of the project remain on track and we 
continue to anticipate rst oil in Q4 of 201 . This agship project 
is revitalising the UK North Sea’s rst producing eld, formerly 
known as Argyll.
EnQuest’s distinctive project execution model is being deployed 
for Alma/Galia. This integrated project team approach is 
designed to achieve optimum ef ciency and performance 
across all areas of the project. The execution team possesses 
extensive experience as well as in-depth skills across the 
subsurface and development disciplines.
Towards the end of 2012, signi cant milestones were reached 
on the subsea installation elements of Alma/Galia. Speci cally, 
pipeline works authorisations have been approved, subsea 
trenching operations were completed, and owlines were laid 
between the two elds and the EnQuest roducer Floating 
 roduction, Storage and Of oading vessel F SO location. 
The mooring installation contract was awarded and equipment 
factory accepting testing programmes also commenced.

Why did you re-use an

may have looked at the Uisge Gorm 
(the name of the vessel before it 
became the EnQuest Producer) 
and considered it to be at the end 
of its useful life, that wasn’t the case 
with us.
Having completed a similar process 
with the Northern Producer in the

The EnQuest roducer 
re- t in Hamburg
The infrastructure will feature six producing wells on Alma and 
one producer on Galia, tied back to the EnQuest roducer which 
is currently in the port of Hamburg, Germany, undergoing major 
modi cation and life extension work. The Hamburg team are 
leading this modi cation programme, which includes upgrade 
work on the swivel, hull strengthening, and the refurbishment of 
all facilities and systems.
During 2012 the Kuwait Foreign etroleum Exploration 
Company KUF EC became a partner in Alma/Galia, acquiring 
a 5% interest. The farm out agreement brings further technical 
and nancial strength to the project. In early 201 the EnQuest 
Board also approved an increase in the scope and speci cation 
of the project, with the objective of extending eld life, 
optimising costs and enabling a potential second phase 
development. These changes are expected to extend the F SO 
vessel life materially to up to 15 years , and to add additional 
wells in any second development phase.

–NEW DEVELOPMENTS
The raken project illustrates our ability 
to identify new opportunities and quickly 
create an innovative development 
environment to exploit them with 
maximum ef ciency . With an anticipated 
production life of 25 years, it is set to 
become core to our long term production.
THE KRAKEN
DISC O VER Y
EnQuest direct workforce at the end of 2012 approximately
500
As EnQuest increased its interest in the Kraken discovery during 
2012 and assumed operatorship, we took pivotal steps to 
establish a robust foundation for the project. A proven EnQuest 
execution model has been applied to take forward one of the 
largest current development projects in the North Sea. The Field 
Development lan FD for Kraken is scheduled for submission 
in the second quarter of 201 .
A series of acquisitions during 2012, saw the Company build a 60% 
interest in this opportunity in the East Shetland Basin, a eld which 
was rst discovered in the 1980s. We became operator upon the 
completion of the last of those deals in September. The proposed 
development concept is essentially that of a conventional rather 
than a heavy oil type of development.
In 2012 the project team was intensely focused on the concept 
selection phase of the project, ahead of FD submission. The main 
phases of subsea installation are expected to begin in early 2015, 
with rst oil from the eld targeted in 2016, subject to FD approval.
A dedicated Kraken team was formed at the early stages of the 
project, an integrated group comprising of professionals with skills 
and experience from across the spectrum of industry disciplines.

How important is the 
team dynamic to a project

 raken project is dependent on the 
execution of the development as a 
whole. For this to be achieved, the 
team needs to be able to interface 
and understand the implication of 
each stream of work on the rest of 
the development.
It is important that all team members 
are comfortable to freely discuss and 
achieve a common understanding of 
what is right for raken, and the 
working environment at EnQuest 
allows for this.

Overview
EnQuest delivered on plan in 2012, with 
production of 22,802 Boepd. In each 
of the three years since EnQuest’s 
inception, we have reported good 
results. Across those three years we 
have generated a total of $1,517 .9 million 
of cash ow from operations, with 
production up 68% and an overall 
reserves replacement ratio of 300%. 
Dr James Buckee
Chairman
This performance is well ahead 
of our long term target of an 
average of 10% per annum 
growth in production and 
reserves, and re ects the 
successful implementation 
of our development and 
production strategy.
EnQuest’s technical, 
operational and execution 
capabilities have continued 
to grow during the year , 
particularly with the signi cant 
progress on the Alma/Galia 
development and the rapid 
assimilation of Kraken.

 Annual Report 2012
Market conditions
In 2012, EnQuest’s average realised oil price, net of hedging, was 
 111.6 per barrel, up from 107.6 per barrel in 2011. It is now two 
years since the Brent oil price last averaged below 100 per barrel 
and market oil price expectations remain high. Whilst we also 
continue to be positive on the longer term outlook for oil prices, 
we nonetheless take a prudent approach in the assumptions we 
use for business appraisal and planning purposes.
In both 2011 and 2012, EnQuest and the rest of the industry actively 
engaged with the UK Government, seeking improvements in the 
 scal structure of the UK North Sea to encourage investment. 
The improved allowances in the March 2012 UK Budget were 
encouraging. These were followed in the autumn by welcome 
new allowances for brown eld projects, in support of investment 
in mature oil elds. These new allowances are positive for EnQuest 
as it seeks to extend eld lives and to sustain investment in mature 
North Sea elds, such as Thistle and Heather. The investment this 
creates safeguards existing jobs and supports the creation of new 
jobs across the energy supply chain, it also partially restores the 
momentum lost by the initial tax increase.
EnQuest was also encouraged by recent UK Government 
measures aimed at providing certainty on the availability of tax 
relief on decommissioning costs, which should have the effect 
of increasing investment in the UK North Sea and extending the 
productive life of the UK’s oil and gas reserves. Greater certainty 
on decommissioning tax relief can be more reliably factored into 
investment decisions and commercial decommissioning security 
arrangements and should therefore stimulate new commercial 
activity across the UK Continental Shelf. This will also help to 
facilitate the sale of assets to companies most suited to invest in 
them and EnQuest is in a very good position to take advantage 
of these developments.
The EnQuest strategy and business model
The implementation of EnQuest’s strategy is proving its potential 
to create value. We believe that EnQuest’s development and 
production focused model can provide consistent returns over 
the production lifecycle, in contrast to the more speculative 
nature of frontier exploration. EnQuest realises value from oil eld 
development and production opportunities by targeting maturing 
assets and undeveloped elds. We exercise a high level of control 
over developments, as a result of having a majority working 
interest and being the eld operator. We believe that its capabilities 
differentiate EnQuest; with the levels of expertise we maintain 
in-house, EnQuest’s teams can achieve high levels of collaboration, 
continuity and accumulated shared knowledge.
EnQuest focuses on hubs, utilising three main approaches. 
Firstly, we extend eld lives by upgrading facilities, utilising 
modern technology. This includes deployment of subsurface 
expertise and skill, and modern seismic, to identify the well 
targets and then execute in ll drilling programmes. This extends 
oil eld asset lives. We have already proved this model at Thistle. 
Daily production levels have increased from lows which were 
approaching 2,000 Boepd in 2005, to over 8,000 Boepd at the 
end of 2012, which are the highest levels achieved since the late 
1990s. We have plans to invest further in Thistle, these have 
been facilitated by the new brown eld tax allowances. We are 
also investing in Heather, where we are upgrading the drilling rig 
to enable us to drill wells for the rst time since 2006. 
Marginal eld solutions are another important leg of EnQuest’s 
value creation model. We target dormant or undeveloped elds, 
that may have been too small in scale for the majors. We use a 
 exible approach and develop new solutions, redesigning and 
upgrading old facilities and using existing infrastructure. The 
EnQuest team achieved this at the Don elds and is now using a 
similar approach at Alma/Galia, with rst oil due onstream in Q4 
201 , less than three years after we secured the licence.
EnQuest’s third value creation leg is through new developments. 
We acquire interests in assets which may have been thought 
technically or nancially too challenging for others and then 
deploy EnQuest’s capabilities, to commercialise and develop 
discoveries. After Alma/Galia the new development of the 
Kraken discovery is our current focus, this would be EnQuest’s 
 fth hub.
The EnQuest Board
In August 2012, I was delighted to welcome Dr hilip Nolan to 
the Board, as a new Non-Executive Director. hil’s wealth of both 
technical and management expertise makes him a valuable 
addition to the Board as EnQuest continues to develop and 
execute its strategy.
After the assembly of an effective operations team in Aberdeen 
and the successful implementation of EnQuest’s strategy in its 
critical rst years, in November 2012, Nigel Hares decided that 
he was planning to reduce the amount of time dedicated to 
EnQuest to be balanced by more time spent on personal affairs.
Nigel therefore stood down from the Board and now advises on 
future strategy and development. Operations have continued to 
be managed by David Heslop, General Manager UKCS and his 
team. Amjad Bseisu, the rest of the Board and I are very grateful 
to Nigel for the excellent contribution he has made to EnQuest 
and we look forward to continuing to work closely with him.
EnQuest is its people. I believe that their technical knowledge 
and capability, their experience and passionate commitment 
are EnQuest’s most important assets. Although the organisation 
has grown considerably in size, it continues to retain the agility 
essential to take full advantage of new opportunities. The Board 
and I would like to thank our workforce for another year of 
delivery of good results and for putting in place the building 
blocks for the next stages of EnQuest’s growth.
Delivering sustainable growth
EnQuest is proving that it can deliver sustainable growth 
through increasing production and reserves. Whilst the UK 
North Sea will continue to be our main focus, there are also 
potential opportunities to pursue EnQuest’s strategy outside 
the UK. We have taken our rst steps internationally, in Norway 
and Malaysia. We will retain a focused approach to our 
international expansion.

REPORT
Delivering on target in 2012
EnQuest executed well in 2012 with 
production of 22,802 Boepd, which 
was above the mid-point of our 
guidance range. This was due to a 
successful 14 well drilling programme 
in 2012, including ve production wells 
brought onstream. In the three years 
since our inception, we have built a 
strong technically focused organisation 
that has generated signi cant levels of 
production and cash ow.
Amjad Bseisu
Chief Executive
In 2012, cash ow generated 
from operations was 59 .9 
million and EBITDA was 
 626.2 million. A net .7% 
increase in the average realised 
oil price helped EnQuest to 
achieve a pro t before tax and 
net nance costs of 405.1 
million, .8% up on 2011.

 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
Audited net 2 reserves at the end of 2012 were 128.5 MMboe, 
an increase of 11.5% on 2011, even with the farm out of Alma/
Galia. EnQuest achieved a strong reserves replacement ratio of 
262.2% in 2012. This reserves growth re ects positive increases 
at our existing producing elds, as well as reserves relating to 
our 20% direct interest in Kraken.
Execution of the Alma/Galia development made signi cant 
progress, with the successful batch drilling of six wells and 
with the modi cations to the EnQuest roducer vessel well 
underway. A major proportion of the subsea infrastructure work 
was successfully carried out during 2012. The farm out of 5% of 
Alma/Galia was also achieved during the year, recognising the 
signi cant value being generated by the project.
In 2012, EnQuest acquired 60% of the Kraken discovery; 
potentially one of the largest new oil eld developments in the 
UK North Sea since Buzzard. EnQuest took over as operator in 
September 2012 and has deployed the same integrated project 
development capabilities utilised on Alma/Galia. The submission 
of the Kraken Field Development lan FD ’ is expected in 
Q2 201 .
EnQuest’s strategy
EnQuest’s development and production focused strategy 
continues to be implemented successfully; reserves and 
production growth have been delivered above target. rogress 
on the Alma/Galia development and on the new Kraken 
development is demonstrating our ability to execute and to 
bring new elds onstream. The farm out of 5% of Alma/Galia, 
with the 175.9 million gain on disposal that it generated, was 
material evidence of EnQuest’s success in turning opportunities 
into value; both the Alma/Galia and the Kraken projects 
demonstrate that EnQuest is increasingly a natural partner of 
choice for major integrated development projects in the UK 
North Sea.
The UK North Sea continues to have very signi cant 
opportunities, with over 00 undeveloped elds remaining. 
In 2012, EnQuest also announced its rst steps outside the UK 
North Sea. EnQuest has prequali ed as an operator in Norway. 
We have also established a presence in Malaysia. We acquired 
NIO etroleum Sabah Limited, which owns 42.5% in Blocks 
SB 07 and SB 08 offshore Sabah. The opportunity for EnQuest 
in Malaysia is similar to the UK North Sea, where EnQuest can 
establish development solutions for existing discoveries as well 
as taking over mature elds no longer material for the major 
oil companies.
Our Company our people
The breadth and depth of EnQuest’s teams, their proven skills 
in engineering, subsurface, execution and operations, their 
leadership in innovative integrated developments, are all key to 
our success. articularly critical is EnQuest’s in-house ability to 
understand the subsurface and to be able to integrate this fully 
with all the required facilities elements. EnQuest seeks to be the 
operator of its developments and elds; through operatorship 
and majority working interests, we exercise a level of control 
which allows us to take full advantage of our technical skills and 
operational scale.
By the end of 2012, EnQuest’s direct workforce had grown to 
approximately 500 people, in excess of four times the level at 
the time of our I O. As an integral part of EnQuest’s recent 
establishment of a presence in both Norway and Malaysia, we 
now have small experienced senior teams in place in Stavanger 
and in Kuala Lumpur. 
Health safety environment and assurance ( HSE A’)
HSE&A is our top priority and HSE&A is deeply embedded in 
our culture and values. It is the most critical aspect of how we 
manage the business, with regard to our people themselves and 
to our installations and the environment in which we operate. 
Exhibiting leadership in safety is key and we seek continuous 
improvement in our HSE&A performance.
Good levels of performance in HSE&A have continued, with 
EnQuest achieving top quartile performance in several of key 
HSE&A K Is. This included a ve year Lost Time Incident free 
 LTI’ free milestone for the Thistle drill rig, particularly impressive 
given its high level of activity. EnQuest also achieved a signi cant 
reduction in hydrocarbon releases across our assets.
Operations
EnQuest drilled 14 wells in 2012, successfully delivering the Thistle 
and Dons drilling programmes, together with the subsequent 
increase in production. In addition, EnQuest successfully 
progressed the installation of the new turbine power generator on 
Thistle which will deliver the power generation capability to sustain 
high levels of water injection uptime.
The Alma/Galia development
In 2012, EnQuest received the approval of the Department 
of Energy and Climate Change DECC’ for the Alma and 
Galia developments. EnQuest secured Alma/Galia through 
the 26th Licensing Round in 2010, extending the life of the 
 rst North Sea oil eld to come into production.

In February 201 , EnQuest announced an increase in reserves 
and also in the scope and speci cation of the Alma/Galia 
development. The additional scope extends the eld life, 
optimises operating costs and enables a potential second 
phase of development. Gross project capital expenditure 
is now approximately 1. billion, including contingency. 
These changes should extend the life of the F SO vessel, 
to up to 15 years, and will allow additional wells in any second 
development phase. With the extended eld life, the gross 
 eld 2 reserves are increased from 29 MMboe to 4 MMboe. 
This relates only to the existing rst phase of development. 
The net effect of the capital cost increases, the bene t of the 
reserves increase and the operational improvements to the 
project, is a positive increase in the net present value overall; 
the improvements also create the potential for additional 
reserves and value in a potential second phase. We remain 
on track for rst oil in Q4 201 . 
Kraken – a major development in the North Sea
In 2012, EnQuest acquired the right to 60% of the Kraken 
oil discovery and became the operator of the proposed 
development. We are enthusiastic about Kraken, and anticipate 
it becoming a key part of EnQuest’s asset base.
Kraken is anticipated to have a long eld life and therefore a 
production pro le that complements shorter life elds such as 
the Don elds and Alma/Galia. Along with Alma/Galia, Kraken 
should help to secure EnQuest’s medium term production and 
reserves growth.
EnQuest’s execution team is leading the development, utilising 
its integrated project development capabilities. FD submission 
is expected in Q2 201 and rst oil is targeted in 2016.
Near eld and low cost exploration and appraisal
EnQuest’s exploration and appraisal strategy is focused on low 
cost and near eld opportunities. In 2012 EnQuest participated 
in two such wells. One was Tryfan, a non-operated well which 
had signi cant potential, but proved to be uncommercial. As 
anticipated, the Kildrummy appraisal well results showed an oil 
column which was thicker than previously discovered in that 
 eld. Analysis of the commerciality of various potential 
Kildrummy development options is ongoing.
Business development
In 2012, EnQuest further consolidated its existing asset positions 
and built new ones. Operated oil eld development asset 
opportunities in the UKCS require signi cant skills and capabilities 
as well as nancial strength. EnQuest is selective and rigorous in 
its approach, always starting with the fundamentally important 
subsurface analysis, which is carried out in-house.
In Q1 2012, we agreed the acquisition of a further 18.5% working 
interest in West Don, increasing our interest to a majority 6 .45%. 
During H1 2012, in three separate tranches, we agreed the 
acquisition of an aggregate interest of 60% in the Kraken oil 
discovery, the rst tranche for a xed sum and the second two 
tranches via development carries. During 2012 EnQuest also 
increased its interest in the Kildrummy discovery from 40% to 60%.
–CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REPORT CONTINUED 19
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
EnQuest has continued to build its interest in the Cairngorm 
discovery; having acquired 100% of Block 16/2b of Cairngorm 
through the acquisition of Stratic Energy Corporation in 2010. 
We successfully applied for 50% of Block 16/ d, in the UK’s 26th 
Licensing Round and in December 2012, EnQuest took on the 
ownership of the whole of the Cairngorm discovery. This was 
achieved by completing the acquisition of the remaining 50% 
of Block 16/ d through a swap arrangement in exchange for 
non-core assets which EnQuest owned in Holland.
EnQuest also agreed a small disposal in December 2012, selling 
a Dutch asset, licence 8 Horizon West , to Van Dyke Energy 
for a  million initial cash consideration, plus  million 
contingent on future production.
Finally, in October 2012, EnQuest was pleased to have been 
offered 11 licences in the UK’s 27th Licensing Round.
Another strong nancial performance
In 2012, EBITDA was again strong at 626.2 million, a similar level 
to the 629.1 million generated in 2011. This re ected the .7% 
year on year increase in the realised oil price and also the .5% 
expected decline in production. Underlying operational 
performance was strong.
EnQuest continues to have a strong balance sheet, ending the 
year with an 89.9 million positive net cash position. Capital 
expenditure on property, plant and equipment oil and gas assets 
was 802.9 million in 2012. Capital investment on bringing Alma/
Galia towards rst oil in Q4 201 , amounted to 421. million, 
including 86.7 million in relation to the carry element of the 
project. The 184. million 2012 investment programme at 
Thistle contributed to the 48.2% increase in its production during 
2012. Other elements of the 2012 capex programme included; 
 54.0 million at Heather/Broom, 128.8 million on the Don and 
Conrie elds, and 26.0 million on preparatory work at Kraken.
The unit cost of sales production and transportation was 
 2. per Boe in 2012, similar to the 1.9 per Boe in 2011, despite 
the impact of reduced production, higher oil prices and general 
upward pressure on market levels of operating costs. This good 
result re ects EnQuest’s focus on control of costs.
2013 highlights so far
In anuary 201 , EnQuest announced that it had agreed to acquire 
an 8% non-operated interest in the producing Alba oil eld, in the 
UK North Sea, adding reserves and producing barrels and further 
diversifying EnQuest’s asset base. This transaction completed in 
late March 201 .
Tell us why the Heather 
return to drilling project is 
such a milestone for the 
platform
2013 marks the 40th anniversary of 
the discovery of the Heather eld 
and 35 years of production. Twice in 
her life Heather faced the prospect 
of decommissioning, and EnQuest’s 
Return to Drilling (R2D2) project is 
designed to extend eld life to 
around 2030.
The prime objective of the upgrade 
project is to provide an enhanced 
drilling facility in preparation for a 
comprehensive drilling programme, 
and the team has already identi ed 
many innovative project solutions.
Work is still to be completed, but 
great progress has been made so far 
thanks to the teamwork, creativity 
and collaboration shown by EnQuest 
and our core contractors.

Annual Report 2012
BUSINESS REVIEW
In Q1 201 , EnQuest successfully raised 145 million from the 
issue of a retail bond, with a 5.5% coupon and a 2022 maturity. 
We were pleased, both to have been the rst oil company to 
launch a retail bond on the London Stock Exchange’s Order 
Book for Retail Bonds and also that the issue was one of the 
largest raised in the market. This bond allows EnQuest to 
diversify its funding base and extend the tenor of its borrowings 
and complements our already strong balance sheet.
In Q1 201 , EnQuest also sanctioned the next phase of the 
Thistle life extension project, facilitated by its quali cation for 
the brown eld allowance programme, announced by the UK 
Government late in 2012. Thistle is a prime example of how 
EnQuest is able to recover more oil from maturing assets 
through a combination of innovation and technical expertise. 
Outlook for 2013 and beyond
Average production guidance for the full year 201 is between 
22,000 Boepd and 27,000 Boepd, as approximately 1,000 
Boepd has been lost, primarily due to third party shutdowns 
of the Brent pipeline in Q1 201 . In addition to rst oil from  
Alma/Galia, production improvements will come from three 
production wells in our existing producing elds; one new 
production well on Don Southwest, one well coming back 
onstream as a result of a workover on Heather, and another new 
well on Thistle. In total in 201 , EnQuest plans to deliver 12 wells. 
This includes three exploration/appraisal wells, with one each at 
both Cairngorm and Kraken and a further exploration/appraisal 
well is expected to be drilled in Malaysia in late 201 .
Why are you considering 
potential opportunities 
in Norway Entering the Norwegian market is a 
sensible step for EnQuest as it seeks 
to expand internationally. The geology 
in the Norwegian North Sea is very 
similar to that in the U CS. The 
extensive skill set we have within the 
Company is transferable and we 
already have a small team working out 
of Stavanger.
Norway provides an ideal opportunity 
to replicate our existing business 
model of targeting undeveloped 
assets with near eld appraisal and 
exploration prospects.

 Annual Report 2012
EnQuest’s total investment programme in 201 , prior to 
regulatory approval of the Kraken FD , is expected to be 
approximately 750 million, with around 50 million to be 
invested in the Alma/Galia development. In addition to the wells 
programme and the Alma/Galia development work, other major 
projects will also contribute to reserves and production in 201 
and will provide a foundation for future reserves and production 
growth. At Thistle, these include the next phase of the late life 
extension project and the delivery of a secure new power supply 
through the completion and commissioning of the new 0 MW 
gas turbine generator. In Q 201 , following the successful rig 
reactivation programme, Heather will return to drilling for the 
 rst time since 2006.
We continue to target submission of the Kraken FD in Q2 201 . 
 re-development expenditure of around 75 million for Kraken 
is included in the Group’s 201 investment programme of 750 
million; this pre-development expenditure includes the costs of 
the Kraken appraisal well, being drilled to provide additional data 
for the main development. The 201 Kraken expenditure will 
depend on phasing, particularly near to the year end, as well 
as potential spending on long lead items.

At the end of 2012, including the licences it was offered in the 
UK 27th Licensing Round, EnQuest had 9 production licences 
covering 55 blocks or part blocks, up from 22 production licences 
at the end of 2011. In addition to the current producing elds, 
EnQuest is actively considering new development proposals on 
at least three of its other licences. EnQuest has a strong discovery 
portfolio within its existing asset base and anticipates it will further 
consolidate these positions and continue to build new ones. 
EnQuest’s net 2 reserves at the start of 201 have a life of over 
15 years, extending to over 25 years if Kraken contingent resources 
can be converted into reserves.
With our centre of excellence and capability in Aberdeen, 
we will continue to take advantage of EnQuest’s integrated 
appraisal, development and operations model, both on 
our existing asset base and on new basins with mature and 
undeveloped eld potential.

–RISKS AND
UNCERT AINTIES
Management of risks and uncertainties
The Board has articulated EnQuest’s strategy to deliver 
shareholder value by:
 ■ exploiting its hydrocarbon reserves
 ■ commercialising and developing discoveries
 ■ converting its contingent resources into reserves and
 ■ pursuing selective acquisitions
Risk Mitigation
Health Safety and Environment (HSE)
Oil and gas development, production and 
exploration activities are complex and HSE 
risks cover many areas including operational 
safety, personal health and safety, 
compliance with regulatory requirements 
and potential environmental harm.
The Group maintains, in conjunction with its core contractors, a comprehensive programme of 
health, safety, environmental, asset integrity and assurance activities and has implemented a 
continuous improvement programme, promoting a culture of transparency in relation to HSE 
matters. The Group has established a Corporate HSE Committee which meets quarterly. HSE 
performance is discussed at each Board meeting.
The Group has also taken over as duty holder on its producing assets and strengthened its 
operating capability accordingly.
In addition, the Group has a positive, transparent relationship with the UK Health and Safety Executive.
Production
The Group’s production is critical to its 
success and is subject to a variety of risks 
including subsurface uncertainties, operating 
in a dif cult environment with mature 
equipment and potential for signi cant 
unexpected shutdowns and unplanned 
expenditure to occur.
The Group’s programme of asset integrity and assurance activities provides leading indicators of 
signi cant potential issues which may result in unplanned shutdowns or which may in other 
respects have the potential to undermine asset availability and uptime. The Group continually 
assesses the condition of its assets and operates extensive maintenance and inspection 
procedures designed to minimise the risk of unplanned shutdowns and expenditure. The Group 
monitors both leading and lagging K Is in relation to its maintenance activities and liaises closely 
with its downstream operators to minimise pipeline and terminal production impacts.
Lower than expected reservoir 
performance may have a material impact 
on the Group’s results.
Life of asset production pro les are audited by independent reserves auditors. The Group also 
undertakes regular internal peer reviews. The Group’s forecasts of production are risked to 
re ect appropriate production risks.
The Group’s delivery infrastructure on 
the UKCS is dependent on the Sullom 
Voe Terminal.
The Sullom Voe Terminal has a good safety record and its safety and operational performance 
levels are regularly monitored and challenged by the Group and other Terminal owners and users 
to ensure that operational integrity is maintained.
Project Execution
The Group’s success will be dependent upon 
bringing new developments to production 
on budget and on schedule. The Alma/Galia 
development is the Group’s rst since 
inception and it involves signi cant capital 
expenditure. To be successful, the Group 
must ensure that project implementation is 
both timely and on budget. Failure to do so 
may have a material negative impact on the 
Group’s performance.
The Group has project teams which are responsible for the planning and execution of such new 
projects with a dedicated team for each development. The Group has detailed controls, systems and 
monitoring processes in place to ensure that deadlines are met, costs are controlled and that design 
concepts and Field Development lans are adhered to and implemented. These are modi ed when 
the circumstances require, but only through a controlled management of change process and with 
the necessary internal and external authorisation and communication. EnQuest ensures that 
responsibility for delivering time critical supplier obligations and lead times are fully understood, 
acknowledged and proactively managed by the most senior levels within supplier organisations.
The Alma/Galia development is progressing towards conclusion and all major contracts for 
supply are procured and in place. In February 201 , EnQuest announced it had approved 
additional project scope with the objectives of extending the eld life, optimising operating costs 
and enabling a potential second phase development. Drilling, subsea construction and F SO 
conversion are all currently in progress.
Reserve Replacement
Failure to develop its contingent and 
prospective resources or secure new 
licences and/or asset acquisitions and realise 
their expected value.
The Group puts a strong emphasis on subsurface analysis and employs industry leading 
professionals. The Group continues to recruit in a variety of technical positions which enable it 
to manage existing assets and evaluate the acquisition of new assets and licences. All analysis 
is subject to internal, and where appropriate, external peer review. All reserves are currently 
externally audited by a Competent erson. In addition, EnQuest has an active Business 
Development team both in the UK and internationally developing a range of opportunities.
In pursuit of this strategy, EnQuest has to face and manage 
a variety of risks. As a result, the Board has established a risk 
management framework, embedding the principles of effective 
risk management throughout the business.
Key business risks
The Group’s principal risks could lead to a signi cant loss of 
reputation or could prevent the business from executing its 
strategy and creating value for shareholders. These risks, along 
with mitigating actions are set out below: 23
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
Risk Mitigation
Financial
Inability to fund appraisal and development 
work programmes.
The Group has secured appropriate bank facilities and has recently issued a retail bond both 
of which can be used to fund its development activities. This funding is supported by operating 
cash in ow from the Group’s producing assets. The Group reviews its cash ow requirements 
on an ongoing basis to ensure it has suitable resources for its needs.
Human Resources
The Group’s success is dependent upon its 
ability to attract and retain key personnel.
The Group monitors its employee value proposition to support the recruitment and retention 
of technical, commercial and professional personnel, used in identifying and executing its 
principal activities. Speci cally, the Group regularly monitors the employment market to provide 
remuneration packages, bonus plans and long term share-based incentive plans targeted to 
incentivise performance and commitment to the Group.
To enable the Company to meet its growth aspirations, the Group is undertaking a number 
of human resource initiatives. These are part of the overall people and organisation strategy 
and have speci c themes relating to organisation, people, performance and culture. Senior 
management succession planning and development are Board level priorities. There continues 
to be a signi cant level of resourcing activity and robust recruitment and selection strategies 
and processes are in place. EnQuest’s experienced HR department will continue to seek to 
recruit in line with current workforce plans and forecasts.
The Group also maintains market competitive contracts with key suppliers to support the 
execution of work where the necessary skills do not exist within the Group’s employee base.
Finally, the Group is developing its international presence and is currently building expertise and 
capability in those jurisdictions.
Reputation
The reputational and commercial exposures 
to a major offshore incident are signi cant.
Operational activities are conducted in accordance with approved policies, standards and 
procedures. Interface agreements are agreed with all core contractors.
The Group undertakes regular audit activities to provide assurance on compliance with 
established policies, standards and procedures.
Oil Price
A material decline in oil and gas prices may 
adversely affect the Group’s results of 
operations and nancial condition.
The Group monitors oil price sensitivity relative to its capital commitments and has a policy which 
allows hedging of up to 50% of its production.
In order to develop its resources, the Group needs to be able to fund substantial levels of investment. 
The Group will therefore regularly review and implement suitable policies to hedge against the 
possible negative funding impacts of changes in oil prices.
Political and Fiscal
Changes in the political, regulatory or scal 
environment affecting the Group’s ability to 
deliver its strategy.
It is dif cult for the Group to predict the timing or severity of such changes. However, through Oil 
& Gas UK and other industry associations the Group does engage with Government and other 
appropriate organisations in order to ensure the Group is kept abreast of expected potential 
changes and takes an active role in making appropriate representations.
At a more operational level, the Group has procedures to identify impending changes in relevant 
regulations to ensure legislative compliance.
Joint Venture Partners
Failure by joint venture parties to fund their 
obligations.
The Group operates regular cash call and billing arrangements with its co-venturers to mitigate 
the Group’s credit exposure at any one point in time and keeps in regular dialogue with each 
of these parties to ensure payment. Risk of default is mitigated by joint operating agreements 
allowing the Group to take over any defaulting party’s share in an operated asset.
Dependence on other parties where the 
Group is not the operator.
The Group generally prefers to be the operator. The Group maintains regular dialogue with 
its partners to ensure alignment of interests and to maximise the value of joint venture assets.
Competition
The Group operates in a competitive 
environment across many areas including 
the acquisition of oil and gas assets, the 
marketing of oil and gas, the procurement of 
oil and gas services and access to human 
resources.
The Group has a strong balance sheet which puts it in a favourable position to be able to 
compete effectively and move quickly when looking to acquire assets.
The Group also has strong technical and business development capabilities to ensure it is well 
positioned to identify potential acquisition opportunities.
The Group has good relations with oil and gas service providers and constantly keeps the market 
under review.
Human resources are key to the Group’s success and programmes outlined above are in place 
to ensure it can attract and retain key personnel.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24

Operational highlights of the year also included the safe and 
effective installation of the new gas turbine generator and 
local equipment room on Thistle; facilities with a weight of 
approximately 00 tonnes. The detailed design work for the 
next phase of the life extension project on Thistle was delivered 
and work was undertaken to improve water injection capability 
at Thistle. Another important operational achievement was the 
improvement in gas compression capability at Heather in H2 
2012. The drilling programme at Heather will now start in the 
second half of the year after the drilling team completes the nal 
well in the current phase on Thistle. Cost performance for all the 
work performed by the two semi-submersible rigs on contract 
was enhanced by the commitment to long term contracts in 
2011 and 2012 at very competitive rates. Across all our sites 
in 2011 and 2012, EnQuest has now delivered approximately 
 100 million of brown eld workscope, demonstrating the 
commitment and capability in managing mature assets in the 
North Sea.
In H1 2012, as a natural evolution of its integrated approach to 
operations management, EnQuest commenced the transition to 
become the duty holder on its UK operations. The duty holder is 
responsible for the safe operation of offshore installations. The 
transition process has been smooth to date and bringing these 
skills fully in-house will allow EnQuest to develop further its 
operational capability. Taking over duty holdership will facilitate 
future growth through the resulting increased direct control, 
helping to improve operational, production and cost ef ciency. 
EnQuest plans to take on direct duty holder responsibilities on 
27 March 201 .
Safety is the priority across all of EnQuest’s operations and 2012 
was a good year against our HSE&A performance metrics. We 
had a successful HSE offshore inspection on Thistle and the 
Thistle HSE safety case was also approved. We therefore believe 
EnQuest is increasingly being recognised as a leader in the 
safety management of life extension activity on aging facilities. 
The HSE safety case approvals were critical elements of 
EnQuest’s preparation for its transfer to duty holdership. 
We recently achieved a half a million man hours LTI free at the 
Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg, where the EnQuest roducer 
F SO is being modi ed and refurbished. In recognition of this 
safety achievement, a donation was made to a community 
charity in the Hamburg area.
1  In February 201 , EnQuest 
announced that it had agreed to 
acquire an 8% non-operated interest 
in the Alba producing oil eld.

2012
 roduction at Thistle/Deveron achieved a net 8,058 Boepd 
in 2012, up 48.2% on 2011. Base oil production increased 
over 2011 and was better than expected due to more reliable 
power and enhanced water injection rates, supplemented 
with oil production from three installed electrical submersible 
pumps ES s’ .
Two new wells were completed during the year. The Deveron 1 
ES well now A58/0 was completed in Q1 2012 and started 
production in Q2 2012, with productivity at the upper end of the 
pre-drill estimate. Drilling on the new A59/45 a sidetrack of well 
A46/45 to Area 6 was completed in late September and the 
third Thistle ES came onstream in October 2012.
There were three workovers in 2012, all of which achieved their 
objectives; including two water injection workovers, both of 
which successfully increased water injection capacity and 
achieved better target injection support within the reservoir.
In H2 2012 the new power generator was lifted onto the Thistle 
platform, ahead of planned testing at the end of 2012.
Following a successful wireline intervention, the Thistle A27/17 
injection well came back online in mid December, helping to 
increase year end production levels.
The offshore drilling team on Thistle achieved a major industry 
safety milestone during the period, with ve years of operation 
without an LTI. The facility also completed a successful 
regulatory ageing life extension audit.

In February 201 , EnQuest announced that it had sanctioned 
the next phase of the Thistle life extension project, facilitated 
by its quali cation for the brown eld allowance programme 
announced by the UK Government at the end of 2012. EnQuest’s 
investment in Thistle so far has included facilities and integrity 
systems upgrades, a major rig reactivation programme and 
drilling of six wells, and has resulted in signi cantly increased 
production. EnQuest is now implementing a technology led 
work programme to simplify and streamline processes and 
to improve production and injection reliability and platform 
integrity. We anticipate over the medium term this will allow 
cost reductions on the platform.
In Q1 201 , a workover of the A5 /60 injector well was 
successfully carried out, along with the successful start of the 
new power turbine generator. In Q2 201 , a new production well 
is planned in the West Fault Block. 27

 roduction at the Don and Conrie elds achieved a net 10,992 
Boepd in 2012, down 1 .9% on 2011. The year on year decline was 
expected and was due mainly to the decline in production from 
the S5 well, which was drilled and brought onstream in 2010. 
Overall an extensive drilling and intervention programme in the 
Dons area was successfully completed on time and on budget 
in 2012.
In 2012, four wells were drilled in the Don elds. The sidetrack of 
Don Southwest well S1 to the updip horst’ area of the eld now 
designated well S11 came online in July with a good initial rate 
on prognosis at 15,000 Boepd. Also at Don Southwest, S10 
came onstream in Q4 2012, with an initial rate which was in line 
with expectations.
West Don well W2 had been shut in pending abandonment 
since an unsuccessful workover in 2010. Operations to abandon 
the well were completed during September 2012 and then 
an up-dip sidetrack of well W2 now designated well W5

Background
These elds, previously called Argyll and Duncan, were awarded 
to EnQuest in the 26th Licensing Round in early 2011.
In Q4 2011, EnQuest sanctioned a redevelopment project 
with nine wells, initially set to recover a gross 29 MMboe of 2 
reserves. Having begun with a 100% working interest in the 
development, EnQuest farmed out 5% to KUF EC. First 
production is anticipated in Q4 201 , at a net peak rate of over 
1 ,000 Boepd.
2012
In 2012, DECC approved the FD s for both the Alma and Galia 
 elds. EnQuest executed well on its development of its new 
Alma/Galia hub, and nished the year on track for rst oil in 
Q4 201 .
Six wells were successfully batch drilled on Alma in 2012, they 
were then suspended pending further drilling and the installation 
of completions. Six wells were batch drilled in 2012 K1 to K6 , of 
the six, the three that were through the reservoir section at the 
year end were all at or better than prognosis.
In 2012, the key elements of the project execution required to 
deliver rst oil in Q4 201 proceeded on schedule. Modi cation 
of the oating production storage and of oading F SO’ 
vessel in Hamburg continued with the rst dry dock related 
work nearing completion as planned; destruct work was 
completed, the refurbishment of the ship systems was well 
underway and the turret had been reinstalled. The topsides 
design for the F SO was nalised around the 2012 year end.

 ■ Net peak production to be in excess of 1 ,000 Boepd
Other key elements of the project also proceeded well, with a 
major proportion of the subsea infrastructure work successfully 
carried out by the year end. ipeline works authorisations 
were approved for both the Alma and Galia elds and subsea 
trenching operations were completed. Subsea owlines were 
laid between Alma/Galia and the F SO location, along with the 
umbilical between Alma and Galia. Riser clump weights were 
also installed. The mooring installation contract was awarded, 
as was the pile fabrication sub-contract.
2013
In February 201 , EnQuest announced an increase in the scope 
and speci cation of the Alma/Galia project with the objective of 
extending the eld life, optimising operating costs and enabling 
a potential second phase of development. These improvements 
add swivel capacity and extend vessel and project life. EnQuest 
is incurring costs relating to compliance with recent UKCS 
marine code changes, which require upgrades to the mooring 
system and strengthening of the swivel and vessel hull. 
The Alma/Galia drilling programme continues in 201 . Three of 
the Alma production wells batch drilled in 2012 will be completed 
in 201 . A new injection well will also be drilled on Alma. EnQuest 
anticipates sail away’ of the F SO in Q 201 , ahead of rst oil in 
Q4 201 .

The Kraken Development
In 2012, EnQuest acquired a 60% interest in the Kraken 
discovery and in H2 2012 EnQuest became the operator of 
the new development. Kraken is a large heavy oil accumulation 
in the UK North Sea, located in the East Shetland Basin, to 
the west of the North Viking Graben. It is being progressed to 
development following earlier appraisal well tests, the successful 
results of which de-risked the project prior to EnQuest’s 
acquisition of its working interests.
The new development remains on track for submission of 
the FD in Q2 201 , and subject to the anticipated regulatory 
approvals, for rst oil in 2016. The Kraken Environmental 
Statement was submitted in Q1 201 and the DECC consultation 
process commenced. Following submission of the FD and 
con rmation of all the details that are a pre-requisite for that 
submission, EnQuest will then provide comprehensive updated 
detailed information on this project. In 201 , an appraisal well will 
be drilled at Kraken, in order to provide additional data for the 
 eld development.
Crathes/Scolty
Options for a proposed Crathes/Scolty development are being 
analysed, with a number of potential hosts under consideration. 
In order to accommodate the time required for this ongoing 
analysis, a licence extension is being sought and is anticipated.
Kildrummy
The results of the H2 2012 Kildrummy appraisal well showed an 
oil column which was thicker than previously discovered in that 
 eld, although not as thick as had been anticipated. A range of 
development options continues to be evaluated.
Cairngorm
Cairngorm is a basement opportunity, with potential. An appraisal 
well is to be drilled in 201 .

Development studies at Crawford/ orter continue; the result 
of further drilling in the vicinity will be factored into project 
sanction decisions. Combining Crawford/ orter with other 
adjacent projects may produce a more economically attractive 
alternative than a stand-alone project. EnQuest therefore no 
longer recognises 2 reserves for Crawford/ orter.
Malaysia
In H2 2012, EnQuest acquired a 42.5% interest in Blocks SB 07 
and SB 08 offshore in Sabah, Malaysia; with one near eld 
appraisal opportunity at the oil discovery in Bambazon and 
 ve prospects. The partners on the Sabah blocks are Lundin 
 etroleum and ETRONAS Carigali. EnQuest also acquired 
an of ce base in Kuala Lumpur and a small management team 
with extensive experience in South East Asia. An exploration/
appraisal well is expected to be drilled in the area in H2 201 . 31

in 2012 re ects good operational 
performance and a period of signi cant 
capital investment in growth projects 
throughout the year .

In the year ended 1 December 
2012, the Brent crude oil price 
averaged 111.7 per barrel 
broadly the same as 111.4 per 
barrel average for 2011. As 
anticipated, total production 
volumes were .5% lower for 
the 12 months to 1 December 
2012 and this, together with 
a net under-lift position at 
 1 December 2012, resulted 
in revenues for the year of 
 890 million compared with 
 9 6 million in 2011. 33

Intangible impairments and write-offs 13.1 7.0
EBITDA 626.2 629.1
EBITDA for the 12 months ended 1 December 2012 was 626.2 
million compared with 629.1 million in 2011. The lower EBITDA 
is due to lower production volumes partially offset by lower 
intangible impairments and write-offs, lower operating costs, 
tariffs and transportation costs in 2012 and higher oil collar 
hedging costs in 2011.
The Group entered 201 with 89.9 million net cash. Strong 
ongoing operating cash ows from its existing portfolio of assets 
and a new credit facility have been used to fund a signi cant capital 
investment programme. In March 2012, the Group established a 
new multi-currency revolving credit facility of up to 900 million 
with seven banks. Initially 525 million was committed and the 
further amounts will be available depending on oil reserves, 
including increases resulting from acquisitions. The new facility 
replaced the previous 280 million facility which expired in March 
2012. In Q1 201 , EnQuest successfully raised 145 million from 
the issue of a retail bond, with a 5.5% coupon and a 2022 maturity. 
This bond allows EnQuest to diversify its funding base and 
complements the already strong balance sheet.
Income Statement
Production and revenue
 roduction levels, on a working interest basis, for the 12 months 
to 1 December 2012 averaged 22,802 Boepd compared with 
2 ,698 Boepd in 2011. The decrease in production was expected 
and due mainly to lower volumes on the Don elds and Heather 
and Broom, offset by higher volumes from Thistle. roduction in 
the Don elds was lower mainly due to the decline in production 
from the S5 well. This was partially offset by a full year’s 
production from S8Z and the new S10 and S11 wells and W5 
sidetrack as well as the acquisition of an additional 18.5% in West 
Don. Heather and Broom production was lower than 2011 due to 
natural eld decline, a planned shutdown on Heather and by the 
unscheduled third party related closure in Q2 2012 of the Ninian 
 ipeline System. Thistle volumes were higher due to the two 
new wells that came into production during the year.
The Group’s blended average realised price per barrel of oil sold 
was 111.6 for the 12 months to 1 December 2012, broadly in line 
with the 111.8 per barrel excluding oil collar hedging costs 107.6 
per barrel including oil collar hedging costs for 2011. This is 
consistent with average oil prices for 2012 and 2011. Revenue is 
predominantly derived from crude oil sales and for the 12 months 
ended 1 December 2012 crude oil sales were 879. million 
compared with 960.4 million in 2011. The reduction in revenue 
is due to lower production and an under-lift in the year of 24.4 
million compared with an over-lift of 14.6 million in 2011.
Operating costs
Cost of sales comprises cost of operations, tariff and 
transportation expenses, change in lifting position, inventory 
movement and depletion of oil and gas assets. Cost of sales for 
the Group pre-exceptionals and depletion of fair value 
adjustments were as follows:

– Depletion of oil and gas properties 24.7 2 .2

Cost of sales pre-exceptionals and depletion of fair value 
adjustments was 448.2 million for the year ended 1 December 
2012 compared with 491.8 million in 2011. The decrease of 4 .6 
million is mainly due to the 9.0 million change in lifting position 
from a net over-lift in 2011 to a net under-lift at 1 December 
2012, together with a decrease in operating costs.
The Group’s operating costs comprise cost of operations and 
tariff and transportation expenses which were 269.5 million for 
the year ended 1 December 2012 compared with 276.1 million 
in 2011. The decrease in operating costs was due to shutdowns 
and major works on Thistle in 2011 and the S2 well intervention 
on Don Southwest in 2011. This was offset by a full planned 
shutdown on Heather and the W1 well intervention on West Don, 
together with lower tariff and transportation costs due to lower 
production volumes in the year ended 1 December 2012 
compared with 2011. The increase in the Group’s average unit 
production and transportation cost of 0.4 per Boe for the 
year ended 1 December 2012 compared with 2011 is primarily 
attributable to the lower levels of production in the Don elds 
and Heather and Broom.
The Group’s depletion expense per Boe for the year is broadly 
consistent with the previous year with an increase of 1.5 per 
Boe 6% . The primary reason for this is higher estimates of the 
future capital expenditure requirement on the Don elds.
The Group’s change in lifting position was 24.4 million income 
for the year ended 1 December 2012, compared with expense 
of 14.6 million in 2011. The net under-lift during 2012 has arisen 
due to an under-lift balance at 1 December 2012 of 9. million 
mainly in the Don elds combined with the reversal of the 
over-lift of 15.1 million at the end of 2011 mainly in the Thistle 
and Broom elds.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Exploration and evaluation expenses
Exploration and evaluation expenses were 2 .2 million in the 
year ended 1 December 2012, compared with 7.0 million 
reported in the previous year. The expenses in 2012 primarily 
relate to the costs of Norway licence applications and the 
UK 27th Licensing Round, the cost write-off associated with 
the Juniper, Gorse and ilot licences following a decision 
to relinquish these licences and the cost of the unsuccessful 
Tryfan exploration well.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were 6.7 million in the 
year ended 1 December 2012 compared with 1 .8 million 
reported in the previous year. The expenses primarily relate to 
the Group’s general management and business development 
expenses net of recharges to joint venture partners. The 
decrease in general and administrative expenses of 7.1 million 
re ects the increasing number of joint ventures which are 
subject to such recharges.
Other income and other expenses
Other income includes monies received from a third party as 
compensation for the termination of a business development 
transaction. Other expenses includes net foreign exchange 
losses of 5.5 million and expenses related to the ineffectiveness 
of foreign currency contracts designated as hedges of 2.9 
million in the year ended 1 December 2012.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year of 126.4 million excluding 
exceptional items, represents an effective tax rate of % 
compared with 64% in the previous year. The decrease in the 
Group’s effective tax rate for the year is mainly due to the 
bene t provided by leasing arrangements, the increase in the 
ring fence expenditure supplement and prior year deferred tax 
adjustments. artially offsetting these decreases, in July 2012, 
the Finance Act 2012 brought in a restriction on the tax relief 
available on decommissioning expenditure incurred on or after 
21 March 2012 to 50% which has resulted in an increase in the tax 
charge of .9 million.
Exceptional items and depletion of fair value uplift
Exceptional income totalling 17.4 million before tax has been 
disclosed separately in the year ended 1 December 2012 
relating to:
 ■ a 175.9 million gain on disposal of 5% of the Alma/Galia 
development through the farm out and cost carry agreement 
with KUF EC; 
 ■ a 14 .9 million impairment of the Heather and Broom hub 
following a delay in phasing of production, particularly to allow 
the drilling of the West Fault Block well at Thistle in 201 and 
an increase in estimated capital expenditure associated with 
the eld life extension programme. The Heather and Broom 
hub inherited a high net book value of 42 million, re ecting 
the fair value uplift when Lundin acquired the Heather and 
Broom assets prior to the formation of EnQuest; and 
 ■ a non-cash impairment of 4.4 million in relation to the 
valuation of the Group’s shareholding in Ascent Resources plc.
In addition, a one off deferred tax adjustment of 10.4 million 
in respect of the restriction on the tax relief available on 
decommissioning expenditure on UK oil and gas offshore 
activities has been reported as an exceptional item.
Additional depletion costs of 10. million have resulted from 
the fair value uplift of the Dons oil and gas assets on acquisition 
at I O and are reported as a fair value adjustment.
Finance costs
Finance costs of 21.2 million include 0.7 million of loan interest 
payable, 10.1 million unwinding of discount on decommissioning 
provisions, a non-cash unrealised loss of 2.1 million on the 
marked-to-market of the Group’s 2012 oil collars which are deemed 
ineffective for hedge accounting purposes. Other nancial 
expenses are primarily commitment and arrangement fees relating 
to the new bank facilities and letter of credit fees. The Group 
capitalised 0.4 million for the year ended 1 December 2012 in 
relation to the interest payable on borrowing costs on its capital 
development projects.
Finance income
Finance income of 2.2 million includes 0.7 million of bank 
interest receivable, a non-cash unrealised gain of 0.9 million 
on the marked-to-market of the Group’s 201 oil collars which 
are deemed ineffective for hedge accounting purposes and 
 0.5 million unwinding of discount on the nancial asset created 
as part of the consideration for the farm out of the Alma/Galia 
development to KUF EC.

 Annual Report 2012
Earnings per share
The Group’s reported basic earnings per share were 46.2 cents 
for the year ended 1 December 2012 compared with 7.6 cents 
in 2011. The increase of 8.6 cents is attributable to an increase 
in gross pro t, a lower effective income tax rate in the year 
ended 1 December 2012 compared with the previous year, 
together with the exceptional gain on the disposal of xed 
assets. This was partially offset by the impairment of the Heather 
and Broom hub. The Group’s reported basic earnings per share 
excluding exceptional items were .1 cents for the year ended 
 1 December 2012 compared with 17.0 cents in 2011. The increase 
of 16.1 cents is mainly attributable to the lower effective income 
tax rate in the year ended 1 December 2012 compared with the 
previous year.
Cash ow and li uidity
The Group’s reported cash generated from operations in 2012 
was 59 .9 million compared with 656. million in 2011. The 
reported cash ow from operations per issued Ordinary share 
was 75.7 cents per share compared with 81.9 cents per share 
in 2011. This reduction in cash generated from operations is 
primarily due to the increase in joint venture receivables which 
relates to the signi cant capital expenditure on the Alma/Galia 
development.
During the year ended 1 December 2012, 0.8 million of 
income tax payments were made in relation to the settlement 
of EnQuest North Sea BV’s Dutch corporate income tax liabilities. 
It is anticipated that the underlying effective tax rate for 201 will 
be approximately 60%, excluding one-off exceptional tax items. 
The Group also does not expect a cash out ow for UK income 
tax on operational activities until beyond 2014. This is due to the 
projected level of capital expenditure, which bene ts from tax 
deductible rst year capital allowances, and accumulated tax 
losses which are themselves largely attributable to the Group’s 
capital investment programme to date.
Cash out ow on capital expenditure is set out in the table below:

Signi cant projects were undertaken during the year, including:
 ■ the Alma/Galia development;
 ■ the Thistle drilling programme including A58/0 , A59/ 45, A56/1 , 
A1 /22, A5 /60, A22/59 and late life extension programme for 
facilities including the power generation upgrade;
 ■ the acquisition of a further 18.5% interest in West Don and 
on the Don elds the S10, S11 and W5 producer wells, and the 
W6 injector well;
 ■ the programme to reactivate the drilling rig on the Heather 
platform;
 ■ the acquisition of the interests in Kraken and subsequent 
expenditure to progress the opportunity to sanction in 201 ; and
 ■ the Kildrummy and Tryfan exploration wells and activities on 
actual or potential exploration prospects and pre-drilling costs.
Net cash at 1 December 2012 amounted to 89.9 million 
compared with 78.9 million in 2011.
In Q1 201 , EnQuest successfully raised 145 million from the 
issue of a retail bond, with a 5.5% coupon and a 2022 maturity. 
This bond allows EnQuest to diversify its funding base and 
complements the already strong balance sheet.
How signi cant is the 
brown eld tax allowance This is a positive step which 
demonstrates the Government’s 
commitment to the future of the North 
Sea. For Thistle in particular, the 
allowance has helped to ensure the 
commercial viability of the next phase 
of the Late Life Extension project.

 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
Cash and bank
The Group had 124.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at 
 1 December 2012 and 4.6 million was drawn down on the 
 900 million multi-currency revolving credit facility. Of the 
facility, 525 million was initially committed with additional 
amounts up to 900 million becoming available dependent on 
increasing reserves or through acquisitions. Included within the 
cash balance at 1 December 2012 is restricted cash of 14.9 
million relating to cash held under erformance Guarantee 
Agreements with suppliers.
Provisions
The Group’s decommissioning provision increased by 51.8 
million to 2 .0 million at 1 December 2012 2011: 181.2 
million . The increase is due to the combined impact of additions 
of 7.6 million during the year resulting from the Group’s drilling 
programme, 7.5 million due to farm in and farm out activity, 
 10.1 million due to changes in estimates and 10.1 million due to 
the unwinding of the discount. This was offset by utilisation of 
the provision of 1 .6 million on well abandonment and various 
small facility decommissioning workscopes.
Income tax
The Group’s income tax liability increased to .8 million at 
 1 December 2012 from 1.7 million at 1 December 2011. The 
increase of 2.1 million is due to UK income tax arising on foreign 
exchange movements. The income tax asset as at 1 December 
2012 represents the expected refund on exploration activities 
undertaken in Norway, and an expected refund in Holland on 
the carry back of tax losses incurred in 2012.
Deferred tax liability
The Group’s deferred tax liability net of deferred tax assets has 
increased by 1.7 million to 609.1 million at 1 December 2012 
from 577.4 million in 2011. The increase is mainly due to the 
capital expenditure programme undertaken by the Group 
during the year which provides the Group with 100% rst year 
capital allowance claims, as well as an increase in ring fence 
taxation losses carried forward. There was a one-off deferred 
tax adjustment of 10.4 million in respect of the restriction 
on decommissioning relief which has been reported as an 
exceptional item together with a deferred tax credit of 89.2 
million in respect of the impairment of the Heather and Broom 
hub. Total losses carried forward at the year end amount to 
approximately 600 million. This excludes 54.5 million of 
pre-trading expenditure which is expected to become tax 
deductible in 201 .
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables have increased to 29.7 million at 
 1 December 2012 from 2 4. million at 1 December 2011. The 
increase of 95.4 million is primarily due to an increase in trade 
creditors and accruals of 96.1 million resulting from the Group’s 
drilling and capital project programmes which were ongoing at 
the end of 2012.
Financial Risk Management
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent crude 
oil prices on its revenue and pro ts. During 2011, put and call 
options covering  million barrels of oil production in 2012 were 
entered into partially to hedge the exposure to uctuations in 
the Brent oil price. The 2012 oil price hedge contracts consisted 
of put spreads at 95 per barrel and 70 per barrel and calls at 
an average of 122 per barrel, all executed at nil cost. In May 
2012, one of the oil price collars was re-priced to give a revised 
average cap of 12 . per barrel.
Between November 2012 and February 201 , further put and 
call options covering 4.60 million barrels of oil production for 
201 were entered into to partially hedge the exposure to 
 uctuations in the Brent oil price. The 201 oil price hedge 
contracts consist of put spreads at 95- 100 per barrel and 
 70- 75 per barrel and calls at an average of 121.6 per barrel, 
all executed at nil cost.
As a result of the commodity price hedging programme 
undertaken, EnQuest has protected approximately 440 million 
of its capital expenditure for 201 , assuming the oil price remains 
above the lower level of the put spreads. This equates to over 
half of the capital expenditure programme projected for 201 .
EnQuest’s functional currency is US dollars. Foreign currency 
risk arises on purchases and the translation of assets and 
liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars. 
During the second half of 2011, the Group entered into a number 
of forward currency contracts to hedge a total of £126.5 million 
 at an average rate of 1.577 to £1 and €52.7 million at an 
average rate of 1. 4 to €1 of forecast 2012 capital project 
spend. During 2012 EnQuest did not enter into any foreign 
exchange hedging contracts. EnQuest will continue to look at 
opportunities to enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, 
in line with the policy agreed by the Board which allows for up to 
50% of operating expenditure and 70% of capital expenditure to 
be hedged, in order to mitigate the risks of large uctuations in 
the currency markets, speci cally the US dollar versus sterling 
and the US dollar versus the euro. Surplus cash balances are 
deposited as cash collateral against in-place letters of credit as a 
way of reducing interest costs. Otherwise cash balances can be 
invested in short term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity 
funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view to 
minimising counterparty credit risks.

EnQuest’s Environmental Management System EMS was 
further developed during the year. It plays a crucial role in

the environment. The system is aligned with the requirements of 
the environmental management system standard ISO 14001. As 
required by the Department of Energy and Climate Change 
under OS AR the Oslo and aris convention for the protection 
of the marine environment of the North East Atlantic , EnQuest’s 
environmental management system was independently veri ed 
against the ISO 14001 principles. EnQuest successfully obtained 
re-veri cation.
Our ongoing work to foster a culture of health and wellbeing across 
the organisation paid dividends. Having been presented with a 
Healthy Working Lives HWL bronze award in 2011, we received a 
silver award in 2012. Through 201 EnQuest will continue to support 
this Government initiative designed to help employers create a 
safer, healthier and more motivated workforce, as it offers practical 
information and advice to help improve health and safety and the 
wellbeing of everyone at work.
Throughout the year we continued to broaden the capabilities 
and expertise of the HSE&A team, making a number of new 
appointments. We added an Occupational Health Adviser, 
Human Factors Adviser, Graduate Environmental Adviser and 
Safety Engineering Technical Authority to the team.
A maturing organisation
EnQuest’s focus following our launch was on building our 
organisation and demonstrating our commercial and operational 
credentials. During 2012 we built on that in many respects, 
maturing organisationally and developing a distinctive EnQuest 
culture that we are now successfully projecting both within and 
beyond the business.
We continued to grow signi cantly during 2012: 82 new 
employees and 18 new contractors joined us. At the end of 
2012, there was a direct workforce of approximately 500, rising 
to around 1,600 including offshore contractors.
 eople have joined us in signi cant numbers in several key areas, 
including new developments, wells delivery and operations, 
as well as in the geoscience and reservoir disciplines. Our 2012 
attrition rates compared very favourably with wider industry 
trends at approximately 10%.
We can conclude that our strategy to attract skilled and 
committed people within a tight recruitment market remains 
highly effective, while we are continuing to punch above our 
weight in terms of retention. That success is based on two key 
elements: a strong production and development strategy that 
presents new and exciting challenges to industry professionals, 
and our set of organisational values.
Those values are serving to drive the development of our 
distinctive EnQuest culture, which increasingly represents a 
competitive advantage for our business as we look to broaden 
our horizons. In order to accommodate the continuing growth 
of the business, plans are being progressed to build new 
operational headquarters in Aberdeen. We have recently 
established a presence in Malaysia, where we now have interests 
in two blocks offshore Sabah. We have opened an of ce in 
Stavanger, Norway, in support of plans to develop interests in 
Safe results with no harm to people and respect for 
the environment
Our work in this regard is strengthened by the EnQuest values, 
which are increasingly serving to shape and in uence attitudes, 
behaviours and practices across our organisation. We are 
determined to maintain a positive and proactive Health, Safety, 
Environment and Assurance HSE&A’ environment that 
re ects those values.
Our overall HSE&A performance in 2012 illustrates how 
EnQuest’s principles can deliver signi cant achievements. 
 rominent among our accomplishments was the recording of 
 ve years free of Lost Time Incidents LTIs on drilling operations 
in the Thistle eld, as well as a successful Health and Safety 
Executive HSE offshore inspection on Thistle. Further, the HSE 
approved a material change to the installation’s safety case.
EnQuest’s LTIF score increased from 0.9 in 2011 to 2.0 in 2012. 
The LTIs were of low risk potential. The number of events which 
could have had potentially high or serious consequences known 
as high incident potential occurrences or HI Os reduced 
signi cantly from 4 in 2011 to only 1 in 2012.
We recorded a marked reduction in hydrocarbon releases: one 
was recorded during 2012, compared to three in 2011. A review 
of bunkering operations yielded a drop in bunkering related 
incidents, from 12 in 2011 to 6 in 2012.
Operationally, we completed an actuator repair to eliminate a 
subsea hydraulic control uid leak in the Broom eld, allowing 
for the reinstatement of the Broom gas lift subsea isolation valve.

the Norwegian North Sea. The port of Hamburg has also 
become a key area of activity for us, hosting the refurbishment 
and modi cation work on the EnQuest roducer for the Alma/
Galia development.
Alma/Galia features among the performance highlights of 2012 
as signi cant progress was achieved across the project 
environment. The year was also characterised by strong 
production delivery rates, a successful wells campaign, and 
robust transition preparations ahead of assuming duty holder 
status in 201 . It also featured a strong performance by our 
London based business development function. It is a strategic 
priority to ensure we have the capabilities, resources and 
leadership in place to maintain the momentum across all 
these areas.
Our new people and organisation strategy will be central to that 
commitment. A framework for achieving our growth objectives, 
it is based on four themes; the right organisation, with great 
people, who deliver exceptional performance, in the EnQuest 
way. This strategy provides the reference points for new phases 
of activity in building the organisation, and it will be clearly 
articulated across the organisation and beyond throughout 201 
and 2014.
The people and organisation strategy captures many principles 
of the EnQuest culture, the development of which during 2012 
took the form of many different strands. One of those involved 
the formation of the EnQuest Leadership Network. With a stable 
leadership team in place, the network has been established to 
link people from different areas of EnQuest and engage them 
with the organisation in a wider context.
They are being encouraged to lead their respective areas in ways 
that serve to connect the whole business, armed with a greater 
understanding of its breadth and how they contribute to the overall 
strategy. The initiative supports our culture by promoting enhanced 
communication, greater interaction and performance excellence.
A positive community contribution
EnQuest’s work to develop ever closer relationships in our local 
community, and provide active and tangible support in line with 
our community and charity policy, took on many and diverse 
forms during 2012.
One of the most signi cant developments re ected our 
commitment to develop sustainable relationships with individual 
organisations. We nominated Aberdeen based Archway, which 
supports adults and children with learning disabilities, as our 
chosen charity. We aim to raise £100,000 over two years to help 
it create several new facilities. By the end of the 2012, nine 
months into the campaign, we had already raised over £ 5,000 
through a diverse range of fundraising activities. Our plans for 
201 also include supporting a local authority initiative to restore 
the iper Alpha Memorial Garden at Aberdeen’s Hazlehead ark 
in time for the 25th anniversary of the disaster in July 201 .
EnQuest again supported a range of initiatives at Tullos rimary 
School, enhancing a relationship that dates back to 2010. This 
included a contribution of waterproof suits to allow nursery age 
children to use the Aberdeen school’s outdoor area in any 
weather. Our corporate support activities extended to numerous 
other educational institutions, local good causes and charity 
campaigns. EnQuest people, both as individuals and groups, 
instigated and completed a variety of fundraising projects to 
bene t speci c charities.
The Company fosters a working environment that encourages 
participation in community focused activities, as well as in health, 
wellbeing and team focused opportunities. During 2012, Team 
EnQuest competed in league 1 of the Corporate Decathlon after 
being promoted the previous year. Applying EnQuest values 
such as collaboration, passion, agility and focus, it recorded a 
series of notable achievements against teams from many of the 
largest businesses in the northeast of Scotland.
How does EnQuest sustain 
a robust HSE A culture The organisation fully supports the 
HSE&A Continuous Improvement 
Plan which encompasses a series of 
projects, campaigns and reviews, 
with the core aim of achieving 
further improvements across the 
areas of process safety, personal 
safety and health, environmental 
performance and quality assurance.
However the key to our success is 
sustainability and we are committed 
to maintaining an HSE&A culture 
that re ects our Company values 
and marries with our long term plans 
for our people and the environment.

OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Chairman’s introduction
Dear Shareholder
 our Board is committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance. As the Company continues to grow both 
operationally and geographically, your Board recognises the 
challenge to ensure that we have in place the right people and 
processes to manage risk and opportunity effectively.
I have set out below my statement of how the Company has applied 
the principles of the 2010 UK Governance Code the Code for the 
year ended 1 December 2012. It is the Board’s view that the 
Company has complied with the Code throughout 2012, except 
where reported below.
The Board
The role of the Board

reserved to it for decision, which has been approved by the 
Board. Its reserved matters include determination of the overall 
strategy of the Group, to review business plans and trading 
performance, to approve major capital investment projects, 
examine acquisition opportunities and divestment possibilities, 
review signi cant nancial and operational issues, and review  
and approve the Company’s nancial statements, control and  
risk management systems.
The Board delegates the execution of its strategic objectives to 
the Executive Committee, which supports the Chief Executive  
in the discharge of his role and responsibilities. Operational 
management of the Group on a day-to-day basis is managed  
by the Operational Committee, which comprises members  
of the Executive Committee, Asset Managers and selected  
Senior Management.
Board composition
The Board of Directors comprises the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, the Chief Financial Of cer and four Non-Executive 
Directors. The biographical details of each are set out on

Executive Director, hil Nolan, with effect from 1 August 2012. 
Nigel Hares who served as an Executive Director stood down 
from the Board on 9 November 2012.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Chairman is a Non-Executive Director. His key responsibility 
is the leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness on all 
aspects of its role and setting the agenda. The Chief Executive’s 
role is the operational management of the business, developing 
strategy in consultation with the Board and then implementing 
such strategy. The division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive has been clearly established, 
set out in writing and agreed by the Board.
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant information  
to enable it to perform its duties. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all 
governance matters. In addition, each Director has access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary. There is also a 
procedure agreed by the Board, in furtherance of the duties, to 
take independent professional advice if necessary, at the 
Company’s expense, up to a pre-determined limit.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring independent judgement to 
bear on issues of strategy and resources, and independently 
challenge and constructively comment on the performance of 
key business objectives and targets.
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
Helmut Langanger continues to be the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The main responsibilities for the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director are as follows:

it inappropriate to relay views through the Chairman, Chief 
Executive or the Chief Financial Of cer;
 ■ to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and to serve  
as an intermediary with other Directors when necessary; and
 ■ to meet with the other Non-Executive Directors without the 
Chairman present at least annually in order to evaluate the 
performance of the Chairman.
Board diversity
The Board is aware of the provisions of the Governance Code 
and has due regard for the bene ts of diversity, including gender, 
on the Board.
Con icts of interest
The Board has in place a procedure for the consideration and 
authorisation of con icts or possible con icts with the 
Company’s interests. In accordance with the directors’ interests 
provisions in the Companies Act 2006, all the Directors are 
required to submit details to the Company Secretary of any 
situations which may give rise to a con ict, or potential con ict,  
of interest. The Board monitors and reviews potential con icts  
of interest on a regular basis.
How the Board operates
During 2012, six scheduled meetings of the Board were held, four 
of which were held at the Company’s registered of ce in London, 
one meeting was held at the Company’s Aberdeen of ce, and 
one meeting held offsite. Details of attendance at each of those 
meetings, and at meetings of the Board Committees, are set out 
in the table on page 50.
During the year, a number of other meetings took place to deal 
with speci c matters that required consideration at short notice, 
and in each case, notice was duly given to all the Directors. Any 
Director who is unable to attend scheduled or short notice Board 
meetings in person is invited to join the meeting by video or 
telephone conferencing facilities, or is given the opportunity to 
be consulted and comment in advance of the meeting by 
telephone or in writing.
The formal agenda for each scheduled Board meeting is drawn 
up by the Company Secretary in consultation with the Chairman 
and with agreement from the Chief Executive. Formal minutes of 
all Board and Committee meetings are circulated to all Directors 
prior to the next Board meeting and are considered for approval 
at that Board meeting. In addition, the Chief Executive is in 
frequent contact with the Non-Executive Directors between 
meetings in order to keep them updated with progress on the 
Group’s business. The Chairman also meets the Non-Executive 
Directors informally, without any executives present, to discuss 
matters in respect of the business.

The members of the Audit Committee during the year were  
as follows:
 ■ Jock Lennox Chairman ■ Helmut Langanger
 ■ hil Nolan joined the Committee on 1 August 2012 ■ Clare Spottiswoode
The Audit Committee met three times in 2012. At the request  
of the Audit Committee, the Chief Financial Of cer and a senior 
member of the nance department attended each of these 
meetings. The Chief Executive and Chairman also attended the 
meetings when invited to do so by the Committee. In addition,  
all three meetings were attended by the external auditors, who 
receive copies of all the Audit Committee papers. Deloitte, in their 
role as internal auditors, attended as appropriate. The Chairman 
of the Committee regularly meets with the external audit partner 
and the internal audit partner to discuss matters relevant to the 
Company.
The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee include:
 ■ monitoring the integrity of the nancial statements, including 
annual and interim reports and any other formal announcement 
relating to the Company’s nancial performance;
 ■ monitoring and reviewing the process of audit of the Group’s 
proven and probable reserves by a recognised Competent erson;
 ■ monitoring and reviewing the Company’s internal control 
procedures and risk management systems;
 ■ monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the external and 
internal audit activities;

reports to shareholders, the Audit Committee reviewed the 
accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the 
presentation of public nancial information.
CORPORA TE GO VERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED 51
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the year under review, the Group’s half year nancial report 
and full year Annual Report were reviewed by the Audit Committee 
before recommending publication to the Board. In carrying out this 
review the Committee received reports from, and held discussions 
with management and the external auditors. The key nancial 
reporting issues considered during the year focused on how 
management had applied the critical accounting estimates  
and judgements. This included key assumptions regarding 
decommissioning cost estimates, the results of goodwill and asset 
impairment testing, including key assumptions such as oil price 
forecasts and discount rates, the appropriateness of the carrying 
value of intangibles, and taxation.
In addition, the Committee considered the results of the internal 
audits conducted during the year, the feedback on internal 
controls provided by the external auditors, and the Group’s 
approach to estimating oil and gas reserves and their audit  
by a recognised Competent erson.
The Committee held private meetings with the external auditors 
without management present. These meetings provided the 
opportunity for direct feedback and discussion between the 
Committee and the external auditors. The Committee also 
considered the performance of the external auditor and internal 
audit and the effectiveness of its own performance. Various 
improvements were identi ed and adopted.
In its role of monitoring and approving the level and type of 
non-audit services to be delivered by the external auditor, the 
Committee had regard to consideration whether through its 
knowledge of speci c transactions, the external auditor was best 
placed to deliver various services to the Group. Assessment of 
the continuing independence of the external auditor was also 
undertaken. As a result of these considerations a number of 
projects were approved to be performed by the external auditors 
during the year and a number were not. It is the policy that the 
Group has relationships with a number of service providers that 
can provide similar services to the external auditors. Further 
details on the Group’s policy on the use of the external auditors 
to provide non-audit services, on auditor independence, and on 
how the Committee assesses the independence and objectivity 
of the external auditors is provided on page 5 .
Each year, the internal audit plan for the following year is 
co-developed with Deloitte, based on a review of the signi cant 
risks identi ed by the Group, discussion with senior management 
and with the Audit Committee. The internal audits performed 
during 2012 were selected to address risks associated with the 
rapid expansion of the Group. The speci c areas of focus were 
the Group’s procurement and payment processes for new 
developments; the cost monitoring process for major projects; 
human resource management, and management reporting. A 
follow up review of the results of the 2011 internal audits was also 
conducted. Where issues were identi ed during these audits, the 
Committee satis ed itself that appropriate action was being taken 
by management to address the ndings. The approach to internal 
audit will be considered again in 201 and its link with other aspects 
of risk management assurance that are conducted in the Group.
In 2012 the Group updated its Code of Conduct policy, which all 
employees and contractors are required to comply with, by 
augmenting its sections on business ethics, in particular to re ect 
the Company’s Charity olicy and keeping in view the impact of 
the UK Bribery Act.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises four Non-
Executive Directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to 
be independent.
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year 
were as follows:
 ■ Helmut Langanger Chairman ■ Jock Lennox
 ■ hil Nolan joined the Committee on 1 August 2012 ■ Clare Spottiswoode
The Remuneration Committee met three times in 2012. The Chief 
Executive and Chairman also attended the meetings when 
invited to do so by the Committee. The Chief Executive did not 
participate in any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include:
 ■ setting the remuneration policy for the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and Senior Executives;
 ■ assessing and determining total compensation packages 
available to the Executive and Non-Executive Directors;
 ■ monitoring the remuneration of senior management other than 
the Executive Directors whose remuneration it sets;
 ■ making recommendations to the Board for its approval, and 
that of shareholders, on the design of long term share incentive 
plans and making recommendations for the grant of awards to 
executives under such plans; and
 ■ determining policy and scope for pension rights and any 
compensation payments and ensuring compliance with the 
Governance Code in this respect.
Further information on the Remuneration Committee can be 
found in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 57.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee currently comprises the Chairman, 
four Independent Non-Executive Directors and, to ensure input 
from the Executive, the Chief Executive.
The members of the Nomination Committee during the year 
were as follows:
 ■ Dr James Buckee Chairman ■ Helmut Langanger
 ■ Jock Lennox
 ■ hil Nolan joined the Committee on 1 August 2012 ■ Clare Spottiswoode
 ■ Amjad Bseisu
The main responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:
 ■ reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board in 
order to recommend changes to the Board and to ensure the 
orderly succession of Directors;
 ■ formalising succession planning and the process for new 
Director appointments;
 ■ identifying, evaluating and recommending candidates for 
appointment or reappointment as Directors or as Company 
Secretary, taking into account the balance of knowledge, skills 
and experience required to serve the Board; and
 ■ reviewing the outside directorships/commitments of Non-
Executive Directors. 52
EnQuest PLC
Annual Report 2012
GOVERNANCE
The Nomination Committee met once in 2012, in order to deal 
with the appointment of hil Nolan as a Non-Executive Director 
of the Company. The following procedure was followed in 
respect of this appointment:
The Committee evaluated the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience of the Board with a view to identifying any gaps in the 
skill set of the Board and also where gaps would exist following 
Alexandre Schneiter standing down as a Director at the 2012 
AGM. The Committee then decided to conduct a search for a 
new Non-Executive Director with a commercial and/or nancial 
background and with relevant oil and gas sector experience.  
The Committee instructed Heidrick & Struggles, an independent 
executive search rm, to conduct the search, from which a list of 
candidates was provided to the Chairman and Chief Executive. 
Following this, a shortlist was prepared and candidates were  
 rst interviewed by the Chairman and Chief Executive, and the 
preferred candidates were interviewed again by other members 
of the Committee and the Executive Directors.
This process identi ed hil Nolan as the preferred candidate 
based on his business and commercial skills and his experience  
of the oil and gas sector his biographical details are set out on 
page 4 . The Nomination Committee then recommended to the 
Board that hil Nolan be appointed a Non-Executive Director of 
the Company and his proposed appointment was unanimously 
approved by the Board. Consequently, hil was appointed with 
effect from 1 August 2012, and at the same time was appointed a 
member of the Company’s Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees.
The Board and Nomination Committee are satis ed that the 
individuals currently ful lling key senior management positions  
in the Group have the requisite depth and breadth of skills, 
knowledge and experience to ensure that orderly succession  
to the Board and Executive Committee can take place.
Board performance evaluation
At the end of 2012, the Board appointed Consilium Board Review, 
an independent external facilitator, to conduct a Board evaluation 
review. The process consisted of a questionnaire, one-to-one 
structured interviews with each Director and selected senior 
management, and a full Board discussion of the conclusions and 
recommendations. The external facilitator also dealt with the 
evaluation of the Chairman, by having a separate discussion  
with the Senior Independent Director. 
The evaluation showed that we are building from a strong base, 
with an informal, engaged and supportive working climate on  
the Board, coupled with a healthy level of challenge and debate. 
Relations between Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors are good and there is a strong degree of alignment  
on the areas requiring attention over the coming year as part  
of the Board’s commitment to continuous improvement.
The agreed action points from the 2012 Board evaluation review, 
against which progress will be disclosed in EnQuest’s 201 
Annual Report, are set out in summary below:
 ■ the Board Agenda to be more streamlined, by separating 
reports for discussion/information against reports that require 
Board approval;
 ■ Board approval reports to provide executive summaries; and 
 ■ a 12 month rolling agenda to be prepared to ensure that the 
Board addresses all of the key issues throughout the year. 
Induction information and support
New Directors receive a full induction following their appointment, 
covering the activities of the Group and its key business and 
 nancial risks, the terms of reference of the Board and its 
Committees and the latest nancial information about the Group.
The Chairman ensures that Directors update their skills, 
knowledge and familiarity with the Company in order to ful l 
their roles on the Board and on Board Committees. Ongoing 
training is provided as necessary and includes updates from  
the Company Secretary on changes to the Listing Rules, 
requirements under the Companies Act and other regulatory 
matters. Directors may consult with the Company Secretary  
at any time on matters related to their role on the Board.
Internal controls
The Company’s system of internal controls is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against misstatement or loss. The Board will 
continue to review and improve the system of internal controls.
The Board recognises the need for effective internal controls  
and for evaluating and managing the risks of the Company.  
Such matters are brought to the attention of the Board at its 
formal Board meetings or ad hoc discussions.
High level controls in operation include:
 ■ review of management accounts with comparison of actual 
performance against prior periods and budget;
 ■ approval of orders, authorisation of invoices and the 
requirement of two signatures to make a transfer from the 
principal bank accounts;
 ■ reconciliation of control accounts;
 ■ prior approval by the Board for major investments; 
 ■ segregation of duties between relevant functions and 
departments; and
 ■ major capital projects are managed through a stage gate 
process, which is subject to peer review at each stage gate. 
Additionally, cash ow forecasts are presented to the Board 
throughout the process.
The Board has ensured that the process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signi cant risks faced by the Group 
accords with the Turnbull Guidance, and that the process has 
been in place for the year under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Board is aware of the need to conduct regular risk 
assessments to identify any de ciencies in the controls currently 
operating over all aspects of the Group. The Board reviews the 
business risk register at each meeting and monitors the 
assessment of risk and the action required for each risk area. 
The nancial reporting procedures were reviewed during the 
year, following which the Board was able to con rm that the 
 nancial reporting procedures established provided them with  
a reasonable basis on which to make proper judgements on  
the nancial position and prospects of the Company on an 
ongoing basis.
Details of principal risk and uncertainties are discussed in the 
Business Review on pages 22 and 2 .

Auditor independence
The Audit Committee and Board recognise the importance and 
objectivity of the Group’s external auditors, Ernst & oung LL , 
when performing their role in the Company’s reporting to 
shareholders. The external auditors provide the Audit Committee 
with information about their policies and processes for maintaining 
independence and monitoring compliance with current regulatory 
requirements, including those regarding the rotation of audit 
partners and staff. Ernst & oung LL con rmed their 
independence and objectivity.
During the year it was apparent that the fees for non-audit 
services were likely to exceed the audit fees. The Audit 
Committee received a request from management to engage the 
external auditors on certain tax projects. After considering other 
alternatives, management were of the opinion that the advice 
proposed by the external auditors provided the best options  
for EnQuest and its shareholders. The Audit Committee was 
satis ed that this process had been rigorous and that appropriate 
safeguards had been put in place to sustain the external  
auditors’ independence. In addition, and before the tax projects 
commenced, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the  
Chief Financial Of cer met with shareholder bodies such as the 
Association of British Insurers speci cally, during the nancial 
year, to discuss non-audit services and auditor independence. 
Following this meeting, the Audit Committee approved the 
external auditors’ engagement on the tax projects and adopted 
a revised policy in respect of the provision of non-audit services 
to the Company by the external auditor. This policy is available 
on the Company’s website at www.enquest.com. Audit services 
fees payable to Ernst & oung LL during 2012 amounted to 
 55,000 2011: 26 ,000 and 965,000 2011: 991,000  
for non-audit services including tax advice on asset and 
corporate acquisitions. 
Management, and the external auditors, provided the Audit 
Committee with details of the safeguards in place to ensure 
independence was maintained in respect of the non-audit 
services provided during 2012. The Audit Committee assessed 
these safeguards to be adequate. 
The overall performance, independence and objectivity of the 
auditors is reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee. In addition 
to the procedures for assessing independence and objectivity 
described above, this process involves interviewing key members 
of the organisation who are involved in the audit process, on an 
annual basis, to obtain feedback as to the performance of the 
external auditors. Additionally, the Audit Committee members 
take into account their own view of the performance of Ernst & 
 oung LL when determining whether or not to recommend 
their reappointment. 
Communication with shareholders
The Company has a very active investor relations programme 
through which the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Of cer, 
and senior management regularly meet with major shareholders. 
In 2012, numerous investor and broker sales meetings were held, 
presentations were made at international conferences and an 
investor eld trip was held in Aberdeen, which together provided 
for comprehensive and engaging dialogue with shareholders and 
potential investors. The Company periodically arranges for formal 
surveys of investor opinion to be conducted, these are reported 
in full to the Board.
The Company issues its results and other news releases promptly 
and publishes them on the Company’s website at www.enquest.com. 
Other corporate information issued during the year is also available on 
the website. Shareholders and other interested parties can subscribe 
to receive news updates by email by registering online on the website.
At the 201 AGM, a business presentation will be provided for the 
bene t of shareholders. The Chairman will aim to ensure that the 
respective Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
attend the AGM to answer questions and that the other Directors 
also attend.
Compliance with the governance statement
The Company complied with the provisions of the Governance 
Code, except that for the nancial period under review up to 
1 August 2012, there was only an equal balance of Executive and 
Independent Non-Executive Directors who sat on the Board. 
Following the retirement of Alexandre Schneiter on 0 May 2012, 
and the appointment of hil Nolan with effect from 1 August 2012 
as an Independent Non-Executive Director, there became a 
greater number of independent Non-Executive Directors to 
Executive Directors, at which point full compliance with the 
provisions of the Governance Code was achieved.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal Committee of the 
Board, and has powers delegated to it under the Company’s 
Articles. Its terms of reference were formally adopted by the 
Board in March 2010, a copy of which is available on the 
Company’s website. The primary purposes of the Remuneration 
Committee, as set out in its terms of reference, are to:
 ■ recommend to the Board the broad policy in respect of senior 
management remuneration;
 ■ ensure that the levels of remuneration are appropriate in order 
to encourage enhanced performance;
 ■ approve the design and set the targets for any performance-
related pay scheme;
 ■ review the design of all share incentive plans before approval 
by the Board and shareholders, to monitor the application of 
the rules of such schemes and the overall aggregate amount  
of such awards; and
 ■ set the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Directors and 
senior management including annual cash bonus and share 
incentive arrangements.
The members of the Remuneration Committee up until the date 
of this report were Helmut Langanger Chairman , Jock Lennox, 
Clare Spottiswoode and hil Nolan. hil Nolan was appointed 
onto the Remuneration Committee in August 2012. All members 
of the Remuneration Committee are considered by the Board  
to be independent as explained in the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 49 to 5 . The Chairman, Chief Executive, HR 
Director and the Company Secretary attend meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee by invitation but do not participate  
in any discussions that directly relate to their own remuneration. 55

EnQuest’s remuneration policy is geared towards the promotion 
of behaviour and performance throughout the organisation 
which promotes engagement with the long term growth and 
success of EnQuest. Fundamental to this is the requirement to 
deliver a level of reward which is suf cient to attract, retain and 
motivate highly talented individuals in an increasingly competitive 
global market. The Remuneration Committee believes that this 
approach is sustainable and will deliver results that are in the best 
interest of the shareholders.
In light of this objective, the EnQuest remuneration framework  
is focused on the key managerial, technical, commercial and 
professional staff populations, and underpinned by the following 
guiding principles:
 ■ the remuneration framework should re ect EnQuest’s focus on 
growth with the emphasis on ensuring sustainable long term 
growth;
 ■ total reward should be competitive when compared to the 
benchmarked compensation levels of other UK oil and gas 
companies that are of a similar size to EnQuest; and
 ■ the remuneration structure should be consistent with UK 
corporate governance principles and best practice. 
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines  
on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Remuneration 
Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for Executive 
Directors and senior management does not raise environmental, 
social or governance risks by unintentionally motivating 
irresponsible behaviour. More generally, the Remuneration 
Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy  
does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
Within the framework, Executive Directors, senior management 
and key technical, commercial and professional staff are 
incentivised by having the various components of their package 
benchmarked as follows:
 ■ basic salaries are typically set at a market median level or 
below, benchmarked against UK oil and gas companies of a 
similar size to EnQuest. In some circumstances upper quartile 
basic salaries may be offered to attract key technical staff in a 
competitive market; and
 ■ the performance pay and share awards are set above the 
market median and are structured so that individuals can 
achieve a total remuneration level that is in the upper quartile 
range of the market, subject to the achievement of challenging 
performance objectives by both the Company and the 
individual.
The Remuneration Committee believes establishing a reward 
framework which sets the xed elements at median or below and 
provides incentives capable of delivering upper quartile pay for 
delivery of superior performance is the most effective way in 
which to ensure that the Executive Directors and senior 
management are incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic 
goals and therefore long term shareholder value.
The Company’s annual remuneration programme currently 
consists of three primary components: base salary and bene ts, 
annual performance pay, and long term incentive awards granted 
under the Company’s current share plan incentives. 
The chart below illustrates the relationship between base salary and 
the variable elements of remuneration for Executive Directors at 
different levels of performance. For on-target performance, a bonus 
award of 100% of salary and a Performance Share Plan PSP award 
worth 50% of the normal maximum Long Term Incentive award,  
i.e. 100% of salary, has been assumed. For stretch performance,  
a bonus award of 200% of salary is assumed and a PSP award in line 
with the normal maximum, i.e. 200% of salary, has been assumed.
 
The amount of base salary, annual performance pay and long 
term incentive awards granted to the Executive Directors during 
2012 are set out in the remuneration table on page 58.
On 9 November 2012 Nigel Hares stepped down from his 
position as an Executive Director and since that date has 
provided consultancy services to EnQuest as an adviser to the 
Chief Executive. Details of the remuneration received by Nigel 
Hares for 2012 are disclosed on the Directors’ Remuneration table 
on page 58.
Reward component
Base salary and bene ts
The base salary and bene ts of the Executive Directors are 
reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and any 
changes take effect from 1 January each year. In conducting the 
base salary review, the Committee takes into consideration 
factors such as the current competitive market conditions, pay 
and conditions among the wider workforce, and particular skills, 
such as leadership ability and management effectiveness, 
experience, responsibility and proven or expected performance 
of the particular individual. The Committee obtains information 
regarding competitive market conditions from external 
benchmarking agencies, as required.
The Remuneration Committee annually evaluates the performance 
of each of the Executive Directors and benchmarks their salaries 
against comparator companies within the oil and gas market. Any 
adjustments to base salary including the Chief Executive’s are 
initiated and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Prior to the start of the 2013 nancial year the Committee carried 
out a review of the Executive Directors’ salaries, which resulted in an 
increase in line with the lower quartile of the FTSE 250 benchmark 
companies: £410,000 for Amjad Bseisu 3.8% increase and 
£264,000 for Jonathan Swinney 3.5% increase . The average 
increase for the Company’s other employees was 4.3%. 56
EnQuest PLC
Annual Report 2012
GOVERNANCE
The Company provides a de ned contribution pension plan  
for certain employees below Executive Director level. In lieu of 
such bene ts for the Executive Directors, the Company pays  
an allowance of £30,000 per annum £40,000 for the Chief 
Executive . These remained the same as prior years and have  
not changed since the Company was formed.
Annual performance pay
The discretionary performance pay scheme applies to all 
employees and Executive Directors and is based on individual 
and Company performance against objectives. Each measure  
is given a respective weighting, with the Executive Directors 
receiving 80% of performance pay based on Company 
performance targets and 20% based on individual performance 
targets. The Executive Directors’ individual performance is 
measured through personal performance contracts which were 
set and approved by the Remuneration Committee in January 
2012 and then reviewed by the Remuneration Committee in 
January 2013. The Company’s performance objectives are based 
on annually de ned Key Performance Indicators KPIs , which 
require the achievement of operational targets, nancial 
performance, HSE standards, portfolio growth and share price 
performance. These measures were met or exceeded for 
 nancial performance, portfolio growth, HSE standards and 
share price performance; and between the threshold and 
on-target levels for operational performance.
The choice of the Company performance targets for 2012, and 
their respective weightings, re ect the Committee’s belief that 
any short term performance pay should be tied both to the 
overall performance of the Company and the individual’s 
performance. Similar targets will be used for the 2013 scheme 
with the addition of categories for project delivery and people 
and organisation.
Executive Directors are able to receive performance pay of up to 
100% of salary for performance that is in line with expectations. 
For outstanding individual and Company performance, bonuses 
of up to 200% of salary may be paid. At least one third  
of performance pay is paid in shares which vest after two  
years, subject to continued employment. The actual level of 
performance pay awarded to the Executive Directors in 2012 was 
120% of salary for Amjad Bseisu, 69% of salary for Nigel Hares, 
and 114% of salary for Jonathan Swinney, taking into account a 
blend of Company and individual performance.
Long term share incentives
In order to incentivise Executive Directors and selected senior 
management to deliver superior levels of long term performance 
for the bene t of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee’s 
policy is to award these individuals with share incentives under 
the long term incentive plans. The current plans are the EnQuest 
PLC Performance Share Plan 2010 2010 PSP , the EnQuest PLC 
Restricted Share Plan 2010 2010 RSP and the EnQuest PLC 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan 2010 2010 DBSP . Executive 
Directors received initial awards relating to the IPO under the 
2010 RSP and subsequent long term share incentives under the 
2010 PSP only.
2010 PSP
The 2010 PSP enables Executive Directors and selected senior 
employees to be granted conditional awards over Company 
shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both 
continued employment with the Company and the extent to 
which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a 
speci ed period of three nancial years. The scheme is intended 
to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst 
retaining due focus on the underlying nancial performance of 
the Company and to align their interests closely with those of 
shareholders. The value of share awards to a participant under 
the 2010 PSP in any nancial year is subject to a limit of 200%  
of base salary, although a 300% of salary limit can be awarded  
to an individual by the Remuneration Committee in exceptional 
circumstances.
In 2012, PSP awards with a market value of 112% of salary were 
granted to Amjad Bseisu, Nigel Hares received an award 
equivalent to 119% of salary, and 124% for Jonathan Swinney.
Under the PSP, the shares vest subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions. The 2010 PSP share awards granted in 
2012 had three sets of performance conditions associated with 
them. One third of the award relates to Total Shareholder Return 
 TSR against a comparator group of 38 oil and gas companies 
listed on the FTSE 350, AIM Top 100 and Stockholm NASDAQ 
OM ; one third relates to production growth per share, and one 
third relates to reserves growth per share, over a three year 
 nancial performance period.
TSR performance condition
The TSR targets for the 2012 awards are as follows:
Ranking against the comparator group
% of this element of the 
award which vests
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Upper quartile 100%
For performance between median and upper quartile vesting is 
determined on a pro-rata basis.
Production growth per share condition
Performance against this condition is measured from a base net 
export production per share of 23,698 Boepd as at 31 December 
2011. The targets for the 2012 awards are as follows:
Average annual growth in net export 
production per share over three years
% of this element of the 
award which vests
Less than 105% 0%
105% 30%
110% 100%
For performance that is between 105% and 110% of base, vesting 
is determined on a pro-rata basis.
REMUNERA TION REPORT CONTINUED 57
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Reserves growth per share condition
Performance against this condition is measured from a base of 
net 2P reserves of 115.2 MMboe as at 31 December 2011. The 
targets for the 2012 awards are as follows:
3-year cumulative net 2P reserves
% of this element of the 
award which vests
Less than 110% of base 0%
110% of base 30%
125% of base 65%
150% of base 100%
For performance that is between 110% and 150% of base, vesting 
is determined on a pro-rata basis.
It is intended that the targets attached to the awards to be 
granted in 2013 will be similar to those used in 2012.
The Remuneration Committee granted an aggregate of 3,021,117 
share awards to Executive Directors and senior management on 
19 April 2012.
2010 RSP
The 2010 RSP was established for use at the time when the 
Company became listed on the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange in April 2010 in order to facilitate the deferral of IPO 
bonuses and to grant retention focused awards. Other than being 
subject to continued employment, the RSP awards have no 
performance targets, and vest in tranches over two, three and 
four years from the date of grant. The 2010 RSP is available  
as a retention tool whereby awards may be made to selected 
individuals who join the Company part way through the year, 
having left accrued bene ts with a previous employer. In this 
regard, the Remuneration Committee granted an aggregate  
of 686,000 share awards to selected employees on 19 April  
and 20 August 2012.
2010 DBSP
Under the 2010 DBSP, employees, below Executive Director 
level, who achieve a pre-determined rating under the annual 
appraisal system, are invited to defer a proportion of their 
annual performance pay into Company shares. Under the plan, 
the shares which are acquired with a participant’s performance 
pay are called Invested Shares’. Following such an investment, 
the Company will generally grant the participant an additional 
award over a number of shares being a speci ed ratio to the 
number of Invested Shares and these awards are called 
 Matching Shares’. The Remuneration Committee granted an 
aggregate of 391,705 Matching Shares on 19 April 2012, which 
were awarded to participants on the basis of a 1:1 ratio to the 
Invested Shares. No further awards were granted under the 
2012 DBSP during the year.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of each of the Non-Executive Directors other 
than the Chairman is determined by the Chairman and the 
executive members of the Board within limits set out in the 
Articles and having taken independent advice on appropriate 
levels. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the 
Committee in his absence , again based on independent advice. 
The Company’s policy is to set levels of fees so as to ensure that 
they are suf cient to attract experienced individuals and re ect 
the increased responsibilities of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors’ annual fees for 2012 were 
£200,000 for Dr James Buckee and £45,000 for each of the 
other Non-Executive Directors. In addition to this, an annual  
fee of £8,000 is payable to Jock Lennox and Helmut Langanger 
for their roles as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees respectively. Actual fees paid for the year ended 
31 December 2012 are shown in the remuneration table on 
page 58.
The Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in the 
Company’s share incentive arrangements and are not entitled  
to a bonus or pension contribution. 
Service contracts/letters of appointment
The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have 
contracts of service which can be terminated by either the 
Director concerned or the Company on giving 12 months’ notice 
of termination. In the event of termination by the Company other 
than as a result of a change of control , the Executive Directors 
would be entitled to loss of salary and cash bene t allowance  
for the notice period. Depending on the circumstances of 
termination, the Executive Directors may be entitled, or the 
Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to allow  
the Executive Directors, to receive a pro-rated proportion of their 
outstanding awards under the long term share incentive plans.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the 
termination of an Executive Director’s employment, the Executive 
Director is entitled to compensation of a sum equal to his/her 
annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but 
their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Their terms of 
appointment may be terminated by either party giving three 
months notice in writing. The letters of appointment set out the 
time commitment expected by the Company and the Board is 
satis ed that each of the Non-Executive Directors commits 
suf cient time to ful l their duties as a Director of the Company. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Non-
Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection on request and will be available for inspection before 
and during the AGM to be held on 29 May 2013.  58

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group nancial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the 
Directors to prepare Group nancial statements for each nancial 
year. Under that law, the Directors are required to prepare Group 
 nancial statements under International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the Group 
 nancial statements unless they are satis ed that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the pro t 
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the Group 
 nancial statements the Directors are required to:
 ■ present fairly the nancial position, nancial performance and 
cash ows of the Group;
 ■ select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
 ■ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 ■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 ■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speci c requirements in IFRSs is insuf cient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Group’s nancial position and nancial 
performance; and
 ■ state that the Group has complied with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the nancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are suf cient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the nancial position of the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the Group nancial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate 
Governance Statement in accordance with Companies Act 2006 
and applicable regulations, including the requirements of the 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
ST A TEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN 
RELA TION TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS 61
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
We have audited the Group nancial statements of EnQuest PLC 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, Group Balance Sheet,  
the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group Statement 
of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 28. The nancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation  
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
 IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company  
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work,  
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities in respect of the Group nancial statements set 
out on page 60, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group nancial statements and for being satis ed that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
and express an opinion on the Group nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing UK and Ireland . Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the nancial statements suf cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or  
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signi cant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the nancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the nancial and non- nancial information 
in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE ANNUAL

Annual Report 2012
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Corporate information
EnQuest PLC EnQuest or the Company is a limited liability 
Company registered in England and is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and Stockholm NASDAQ OM market.
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for, and 
extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the UK Continental 
Shelf. During the year the Group acquired interests in an exploration 
licence in Malaysia and pre-quali ed as an operator in the 
Norwegian North Sea.
The Group’s nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2012 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the Board of Directors on 26 March 2013.
A listing of the principal Group companies is contained in note 28 
to these Group nancial statements.
2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group nancial information has been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union as they apply to the nancial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012 and applied in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies 
which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
 nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The Group nancial information has been prepared on a historical 
cost basis. The presentation currency of the Group nancial 
information is United States dollars and all values in the Group 
 nancial information are rounded to the nearest thousand 
 US ’000 except where otherwise stated.
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the 
use of the going concern basis is appropriate and there are no 
material uncertainties that may cast signi cant doubt about the 
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. See page 48 
in the Directors’ Report for further details.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the sole 
right to exercise control over the operations and govern the 
 nancial policies generally accompanying a shareholding of  
more than half of the voting rights. The existence and effect  
of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are considered when assessing the Group’s control. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated from the 
date that control ceases.
Intercompany pro ts, transactions and balances are eliminated 
on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012
Unincorporated jointly controlled assets
Oil and gas operations are conducted by the Group as co-
licensees in unincorporated joint ventures with other companies. 
The Group’s nancial statements re ect the relevant proportions 
of production, capital costs, operating costs and current assets 
and liabilities of the joint venture applicable to the Group’s 
interests. The Group’s current joint venture interests are detailed 
on page 25.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate  
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair 
value and the amount of any controlling interest in the acquiree.  
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-
controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identi able net assets. Those 
petroleum reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued 
are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition. Other 
potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot 
be reliably determined, are not recognised.
New standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted new and revised IFRS’s that are relevant 
to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2012. The principal effects of the adoption  
of these new and amended standards and interpretations are 
discussed below:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – Enhanced 
Derecognition Disclosure Requirements
The amendment requires additional disclosure about nancial 
assets that have been transferred but not derecognised to enable 
the user of the Group’s nancial statements to understand the 
relationship with those assets that have not been derecognised 
and their associated liabilities. In addition, the amendment 
requires disclosures about the entity’s continuing involvement in 
derecognised assets to enable the users to evaluate the nature of, 
and risks associated with, such involvement. The Group does not 
have any assets with these characteristics so there has been no 
effect on the presentation of its nancial statements.
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Group, but not yet effective 
up to the date of issuance of the Group’s nancial statements  
are listed below. This listing is of Standards and Interpretations 
issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at  
a future date. The Group intends to adopt these Standards when 
they become effective. The Directors do not anticipate that the 
adoption of these Standards will have a material impact on the 
Group’s accounts in the period of initial application.
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income – 
Amendments to IAS 1
The amendments change the grouping of items presented in  
the statement of comprehensive income. Items that would be 
reclassi ed to pro t or loss at a future point in time would be 
presented separately from items that will never be reclassi ed. 
The revisions become effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 July 2012. 67
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classi cation and Measurement
IFRS 9 as issued re ects the rst phase of the IASB’s work  
on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classi cation and 
measurement of nancial assets as de ned in IAS 39. The 
Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address 
classi cation and measurement of nancial liabilities, hedge 
accounting. The adoption of the rst phase of IFRS 9 will have  
an effect on the classi cation and measurement of the Group’s 
 nancial assets, but will not have an impact on classi cation  
and measurements of nancial liabilities. However, the Group 
determined that the effect shall be quanti ed in conjunction with 
the other phases when issued to present a comprehensive picture.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements/ IAS 27 (Revised) 
– Separate Financial Statements
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all 
entities including special purpose entities and introduces changes 
which will require management to exercise signi cant judgement 
to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are 
required to be consolidated by a parent. The consolidation 
requirements forming part of IAS 27 will be revised and 
contained within IFRS 10. These Standards are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 in the 
European Union.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 11 establishes a clear principle that is applicable to the 
accounting for all joint arrangements. The Standard is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 in the 
European Union. The most signi cant change is that IFRS 11 
requires the use of the equity method of accounting for interests 
in jointly controlled entities thereby eliminating the proportionate 
consolidation method.
IAS 28 (Revised) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
The Standard will be revised due to the introduction of IFRS 11 
and 12. The Standard describes the application of the equity 
method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. 
The revision will become effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2014 in the European Union.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
Includes disclosure requirements for interests in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. 
The Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2014 in the European Union.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
The Standard de nes fair value, provides guidance on its 
determination and introduces consistent requirements for 
disclosures on fair value measurements. The Standard does not 
include requirements on when fair value measurement is required 
but prescribes how fair value is to be measured if another 
Standard requires it. The Standard is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
Annual improvements May 2012
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – This improvement 
clari es the difference between voluntary additional comparative 
information and the minimum required comparative information. 
Generally the minimum required comparative information is the 
previous period.
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment – This improvement clari es 
that major spare parts and servicing equipment that meet the 
de nition of property, plant and equipment are not inventory.
These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2013.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and 
judgements when preparing the nancial statements of the 
Group. Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could have 
an impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the 
Group’s result. The most important estimates and judgements in 
relation thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
The business of the Group is the exploration for, development of 
and production of oil and gas reserves. Estimates of oil and gas 
reserves are used in the calculations for impairment tests and 
accounting for depletion and decommissioning. Changes in 
estimates of oil and gas reserves resulting in different future 
production pro les will affect the discounted cash ows used  
in impairment testing, the anticipated date of decommissioning 
and the depletion charges in accordance with the unit-of-
production method.
Estimates in impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
For details of policy see Impairment of assets excluding 
goodwill and refer to the further economic assumptions above 
within Estimates in oil and gas reserves.
In calculating the asset fair values the Group has applied an oil price 
assumption of US 107.60 per barrel in 2013, US 102.00 per barrel 
in 2014, US 97.80 per barrel in 2015, US 94.30 per barrel in 2016, 
US 91.70 per barrel in 2017 thereafter US 90 in ated at 2% per 
annum from 2013 2011: US 119.25 per barrel in 2012, US 112.08 per 
barrel in 2013, US 104.73 per barrel in 2014, US 98.67 per barrel 
in 2015, US 97.42 per barrel in 2016 thereafter in ated at 2% per 
annum from 2012 and a discounted pre-tax rate of 20.4% 
 2011: 21.3% .
Determining whether an acquisition is a business combination  
or asset purchase
The Group analyses the transaction or event by applying the 
de nition of a business combination, principally whether inputs, 
processes and outputs exist, including reviewing group strategy, 
control and resources. Should the acquired business not be 
viewed as a business combination then it is accounted for as  
an asset purchase.
Determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment  
on business combinations
The Group determines the fair value of property, plant and 
equipment acquired based on the discounted cash ows at the 
time of acquisition, from the proven and probable reserves. In 
assessing the discounted cash ows the estimated future cash 
 ows attributable to the asset are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects the market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to 
the asset at the time of the acquisition. In calculating the asset fair 
value the Group will apply the long term oil price assumption, 
escalated for in ation and discounted at the pre-tax rate. The oil 
price assumption will represent management’s view of the long 
term oil price at the time of the transaction.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Decommissioning provision
Amounts used in recording a provision for decommissioning  
are estimates based on current legal and constructive 
requirements and current technology and price levels for  
the removal of facilities and plugging and abandoning of wells. 
Due to changes in relation to these items, the future actual cash 
out ows in relation to decommissioning are likely to differ in 
practice. To re ect the effects due to changes in legislation, 
requirements and technology and price levels, the carrying 
amounts of decommissioning provisions are reviewed on a 
regular basis.
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior year 
adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. While the Group 
uses its best estimates and judgement, actual results could differ 
from these estimates.
In estimating decommissioning provisions, the Group applies an 
annual in ation rate of 2% 2011: 2% and an annual discount rate 
of 5% 2011: 5% .
Estimates in impairment of goodwill
Determination of whether goodwill has suffered any impairment 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating 
units CGU to which goodwill has been allocated. The present 
value calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash 
 ows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount 
rate. In calculating the present value in use of the CGU, the Group 
has used forward curve prices for the rst ve years before 
reverting to the Group’s long term pricing assumption and 
discounted at a pre-tax rate of 20.4% 2011: forward curve prices 
for the rst four years before reverting to the Group’s long term 
pricing assumption and discounted at a pre-tax rate of 21.3% .
Taxation
The UK’s corporation tax legislation is complex. The Group’s 
operations are subject to a number of speci c rules which apply 
to UK North Sea exploration and production. In addition, the tax 
provision is prepared before the relevant companies have led 
their UK corporation tax and supplementary charge returns  
with HMRC and signi cantly, before these have been agreed.  
As a result of these factors the tax provision process necessarily 
involves the use of a number of estimates and judgements 
including those required in calculating the effective tax rate.  
In considering the tax on exceptionals, the Company applies  
the appropriate statutory tax rate to each exceptional item  
to calculate the relevant tax charge on exceptional items.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses 
where it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available for 
utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and 
assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be 
recognised, as well as the likelihood of future taxable pro ts.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the nancial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates functional 
currency . The Group nancial statements are presented in 
United States dollars, the currency which the Group has elected 
to use as its presentation currency.
In the accounts of the Company and its individual subsidiaries, 
transactions in currencies other than a company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the 
date of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated  
at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange 
as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the rate of exchange at the date the fair value was 
determined. All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken  
to pro t and loss in the statement of comprehensive income.
Classi cation and recognition of assets and liabilities
Non-current assets and non-current liabilities including provisions 
consist, for the most part, solely of amounts that are expected to 
be recovered or paid more than twelve months after the balance 
sheet date. Current assets and current liabilities consist solely  
of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within  
12 months after the balance sheet date.
Property plant and e uipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost comprises the 
purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly 
attributable to making that asset capable of operating as 
intended. The purchase price or construction cost is the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other 
consideration given to acquire the asset.
Oil and gas assets are depleted, on a eld-by- eld basis, using 
the unit-of-production method based on entitlement to proven 
and probable reserves, taking account of estimated future 
development expenditure relating to those reserves.
Depreciation on other elements of property, plant and equipment 
is provided on a straight-line basis at the following rates:
Of ce furniture and equipment 25% – 100%
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method of 
depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each 
 nancial year end.
No depreciation is charged on land or assets under construction.
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment 
is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic bene ts 
are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising 
from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is included in the statement of comprehensive  
income when the item is derecognised. Gains are not classi ed  
as revenue.
Capitalised costs
Oil and gas assets are accounted for using the successful efforts

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 69
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
Intangible oil and gas assets
Expenditure directly associated with evaluation or appraisal 
activities is capitalised as an intangible asset. Such costs include 
the costs of acquiring an interest, appraisal well drilling costs, 
payments to contractors and an appropriate share of directly 
attributable overheads incurred during the evaluation phase.  
For such appraisal activity, which may require drilling of further 
wells, costs continue to be carried as an asset whilst related 
hydrocarbons are considered capable of commercial 
development. Such costs are subject to technical, commercial 
and management review to con rm the continued intent to 
develop, or otherwise extract value. When this is no longer  
the case, the costs are impaired and any impairment loss  
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  
When exploration licences are relinquished without further 
development, any previous impairment loss is reversed and  
the carrying costs are written off through the statement of 
comprehensive income. When assets are declared part of  
a commercial development, related costs are transferred to 
property, plant and equipment oil and gas assets. All intangible 
oil and gas assets are assessed for any impairment prior to 
transfer and any impairment loss is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
Oil and gas assets
Expenditure relating to development of assets including the 
construction, installation and completion of infrastructure 
facilities such as platforms, pipelines and development wells,  
is capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Farm outs – outside the exploration and evaluation phase
In accounting for a farm out arrangement outside the exploration 
and evaluation phase, the Group:
 ■ derecognises the proportion of the asset that it has sold to  
the farmee;
 ■ recognises the consideration received or receivable from  
the farmee, which represents the cash received and/or the 
farmee’s obligation to fund the capital expenditure in relation 
to the interest retained by the farmor and/or any deferred 
consideration;
 ■ recognises a gain or loss on the transaction for the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset disposed of. A gain is only recognised when the value 
of the consideration can be determined reliably. If not, then the 
Group accounts for the consideration received as a reduction 
in the carrying amount of the underlying assets; and 
 ■ tests the retained interests for impairment if the terms of the 
arrangement indicate that the retained interest may be impaired.
The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of property, 
plant and equipment or an intangible asset is recognised initially 
at its fair value by the Group. However, if payment for the item is 
deferred, the consideration received is recognised initially at the 
cash price equivalent. The difference between the nominal 
amount of the consideration and the cash price equivalent is 
recognised as interest revenue. Any part of the consideration that 
is receivable in the form of cash is treated as a nancial asset and 
is accounted for at amortised cost.
Asset swaps
For exchanges or part exchanges of intangible oil and gas assets 
they are accounted for at the carrying value of the asset given up 
and no gain or loss is recognised.
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production calculations 
are dealt with prospectively, not by immediate adjustment of 
prior years’ amounts.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of 
qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to prepare for their intended use, are added to the 
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised as interest payable in the statement of comprehensive 
income in accordance with the effective interest method.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its oil and gas assets to assess whether there is  
an indication that those assets may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the  
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value  
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows 
attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c  
to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but only so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured 
at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the net fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the entity at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for 
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that such carrying value may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is 
allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to 
bene t from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or units 
to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 
the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes.
2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS 70
EnQuest PLC
Annual Report 2012
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit and related 
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and 
part of the operation within the unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the 
carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain  
or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this 
circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the 
operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating 
units retained.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classi ed as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classi ed as held for sale if their carrying 
amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only 
when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classi cation.
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classi ed as 
 nancial assets at fair value through pro t or loss, loans and 
receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale 
 nancial investments, or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group 
determines the classi cation of its nancial assets at initial 
recognition.
All assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transactions 
costs, except in the case of nancial assets recorded at fair value 
through pro t or loss.
Purchases or sales of nancial assets that require delivery  
of assets within a time frame established by regulation  
or convention in the market place regular way trades  
are recognised on the trade date.
The Group’s nancial assets include cash and short term 
deposits, trade and other receivables, loans and other 
receivables, quoted and unquoted nancial instruments and 
derivative nancial instruments.
Subsequent measurement of nancial assets depends on their 
classi cation as described below:
Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classi ed as at FVTPL when the nancial 
asset is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. 
Financial assets are classi ed as held for trading if they are 
acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near 
term. Derivatives are also classi ed as held for trading unless  
they are designated as effective hedging instruments as de ned 
by IAS 39.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains 
or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in pro t or loss.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are 
designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria 
under IAS 39 are satis ed.
The Group evaluates its nancial assets held for trading, other 
than derivatives, to determine whether the intention to sell them 
in the near term is still appropriate. Where the Group is unable to 
trade these nancial assets or management’s intention to sell 
them in the foreseeable future changes signi cantly, the Group 
may elect to reclassify these assets. The reclassi cation to loans 
and receivables, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity depends 
on the nature of the asset. This evaluation does not affect any 
 nancial assets designated at FVTPL using the fair value option 
at designation. These instruments cannot be reclassi ed after 
initial recognition.
Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative nancial assets with xed or determinable 
payments and xed maturity are classi ed as held-to-maturity 
when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold 
them to maturity. After initial measurement, held-to-maturity 
investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method EIR , less impairment. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation and losses arising from impairment are 
included in the pro t or loss.
Available-for-sale nancial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded  
in an active market are classi ed as being available for sale and 
are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes  
in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the available-for-sale reserve with the exception 
of impairment losses which are recognised directly in pro t or 
loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the 
available-for-sale reserve is reclassi ed to pro t or loss.
Loans and receivables
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables that 
have xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market and are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income  
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short term receivables when the recognition of interest would  
be immaterial.
Impairment of nancial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any 
objective evidence that a nancial asset is impaired. A nancial 
asset is deemed to be impaired where there is objective evidence 
of impairment that, as a result of one or more events that have 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, the estimated 
future cash ows of the investment have been affected.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 71
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
For listed and unlisted equity investments classi ed as available-
for-sale, a signi cant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence  
of impairment. When an available-for-sale nancial asset  
is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains and losses 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
reclassi ed to pro t or loss in the period. In respect of equity 
securities, impairment losses previously recognised in pro t or 
loss are not reversed through pro t or loss. Any increase in fair 
value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
For nancial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of  
the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, 
discounted at the nancial asset’s original effective interest rate. 
The carrying amount is reduced through use of an allowance 
account and the amount of the loss is recognised in pro t or loss.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the 
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair value 
hedging instruments are recorded in the pro t or loss, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability.
Cash ow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that qualify as cash ow hedges are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the pro t or loss. Amounts 
accumulated in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the pro t 
or loss in the period when the hedged item will affect the pro t 
or loss. When the hedged item no longer meets the requirements 
for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, any accumulated gain or 
loss recognised in shareholders’ equity is transferred to pro t and 
loss when the forecast transaction which was the subject of the 
hedge occurs.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for in a similar manner as cash ow hedges. The gain or loss 
accumulated in shareholders’ equity is transferred to the pro t  
or loss at the time the foreign operation is disposed of.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes 
in fair value are recognised immediately in the pro t or loss.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision  
for impairment.
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value, cost being determined on a rst in 
 rst out FIFO basis. Inventories of hydrocarbons are stated at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under/over-lift
Under or over-lifted positions of hydrocarbons are valued at 
market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. An under-lift 
of production from a eld is included in current receivables and 
valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract 
price and an over-lift of production from a eld is included in 
current liabilities and valued at the reporting date spot price or 
prevailing contract price.
Cash and cash e uivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, 
outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing 
securities with original maturities of three months or less.
E uity
Share capital
The balance classi ed as equity share capital includes the total 
net proceeds both nominal value and share premium on issue 
of registered share capital of the parent Company. Share issue 
costs associated with the issuance of new equity are treated as a 
direct reduction of proceeds.
Merger reserve
Merger reserve represents the difference between the market 
value of shares issued to effect business combinations less the 
nominal value of shares issued. The merger reserve in the Group 
 nancial statements also includes the consolidation adjustments 
that arise under the application of the pooling of interest method.
Cash ow hedge reserve
For cash ow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or  
loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as other 
comprehensive income in the cash ow hedge reserve. Upon 
settlement of the hedged item, the change in fair value is 
transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments reserve
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured 
at the fair value of the services received, and the corresponding 
increase in equity is recorded directly at the fair value of the 
services received. The share-based payments reserve includes 
treasury shares.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results attributable to 
the shareholders of the parent Company.
Employee bene t trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from the 
share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised 
in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale 
and the original cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.

Provisions
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when 
the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or 
an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and 
when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. The 
amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future 
expenditure. An amount equivalent to the discounted initial 
provision for decommissioning costs is capitalised and amortised 
over the life of the underlying asset on a unit-of-production basis 
over proven and probable reserves. Any change in the present 
value of the estimated expenditure is re ected as an adjustment 
to the provision and the oil and gas asset.
The unwinding of the discount applied to future 
decommissioning provisions is included under nance costs  
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount  
of the obligation.
Derecognition of nancial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A nancial asset or, where applicable a part of a nancial asset 
is derecognised where:
 ■ the rights to receive cash ows from the asset have expired;
 ■ the Group retains the right to receive cash ows from the asset, 
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without 
material delay to a third party under a pass-through’ 
arrangement; or
 ■ the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash ows from 
the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,  
but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities
A nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under  
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If an existing nancial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender, on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modi ed, such an exchange or 
modi cation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability such that the difference in 
the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees 
incurred are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially  
at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a nancial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate  
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash  
payments through the expected life of the nancial liability,  
or a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the nancial 
liability where appropriate.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains  
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the 
inception date. The arrangement is assessed for whether 
ful lment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a 
speci c asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right  
to use the asset or assets, even of that right is not explicitly 
speci ed in an arrangement.
Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and bene ts 
incidental to ownership of the leased item to the Group, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value  
of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned 
between nance charges and reduction of the lease liability so  
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in nance costs  
in the income statement.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. 
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will 
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the 
asset and the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating 
expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over  
the lease term.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable  
economic bene ts will ow to the Group and the revenue  
can be reliably measured.
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales from 
the processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an entitlement basis, 
when the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
passed to the buyer.
Tariff revenue is recognised in the period in which the services 
are provided at the agreed contract rates.
Exceptional items
As permitted by IAS 1 Revised , Presentation of Financial 
Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items 
that the Group separately presents as exceptional on the face  
of the statement of comprehensive income are those material 
items of income and expense which because of the nature and 
expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit 
separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand  
better the elements of nancial performance in the year,  
so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess 
better trends in nancial performance.

 Annual Report 2012
Depletion of fair value uplift to property plant and e uipment 
on ac uiring strategic investments
IFRS requires that a fair value exercise is undertaken allocating 
the cost of acquiring controlling interests to the fair value of the 
acquired identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. 
Any difference between the cost of acquiring the interest and the 
fair value of the acquired net assets, which includes identi ed 
contingent liabilities, is recognised as acquired goodwill. The fair 
value exercise is performed as at the date of acquisition.
The Directors have determined that for strategic investments it is 
important to identify separately the earnings impact of increased 
depletion arising from the acquisition date fair value uplifts made 
to property, plant and equipment over their useful economic 
lives. As a result of the nature of fair value assessments in the  
oil and gas industry the value attributed to strategic assets is 
subjective, based on a wide range of complex variables at a point 
in time. The subsequent depletion of the fair value uplifts bears 
little relationship to current market conditions, operational 
performance or cash generation. Management therefore reports 
and monitors the business performance of strategic investments 
before the impact of depletion of fair value uplifts to property, 
plant and equipment and the uplift is excluded from the business 
result presented in the Group statement of comprehensive 
income.
Employee bene ts
Short term employee bene ts
Short term employee bene ts such as salaries, social premiums 
and holiday pay, are expensed when incurred.
Pension obligations
The Group’s pension obligations consist of de ned contribution 
plans. A de ned contribution plan is a pension plan under which 
the Group pays xed contributions. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
amount charged to the statement of comprehensive income in 
respect of pension costs re ects the contributions payable in the 
year. Differences between contributions payable during the year 
and contributions actually paid are shown as either accrued 
liabilities or prepaid assets in the balance sheet.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees including Directors of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or 
rights over shares equity-settled transactions of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they 
are granted. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account  
is taken of any service or performance conditions, other than 
conditions linked to the price of the shares of EnQuest PLC 
 market conditions or non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the 
period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled  
to the award the vesting period . The cumulative expense 
recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date re ects the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of 
comprehensive income charge or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satis ed, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satis ed. 
Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on 
the date of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the 
award at that date is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Taxes
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Group nancial statements. However, deferred 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable pro t or loss. Deferred tax is measured on 
an undiscounted basis using tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
pro ts will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed  
at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are offset, only if a legal right exists to offset current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes 
relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits 
the Group to make a single net payment.
Production taxes
In addition to corporate income taxes, the Group’s nancial 
statements also include and disclose production taxes on net 
income determined from oil and gas production.
The Group distinguishes between income tax and production 
tax. Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT and 
is accounted for under IAS 12 since it has the characteristics of an 
income tax as it is imposed under Government authority and the 
amount payable is based on taxable pro ts of the relevant elds. 
Current and deferred PRT is provided on the same basis as 
described above for income taxes.

3. Segment information
Management have considered the requirements of IFRS 8, in regard to the determination of operating segments, and concluded that 
the Group has only one signi cant operating segment being the exploration for, and the extraction and production of hydrocarbons.
All revenue is generated from sales to customers in the United Kingdom. Details of the Group’s revenue components are provided in 
note 5 a . All crude oil revenue is received from one major customer, Shell International Trading and Shipping Company Limited and 
amounted to US 879,307,000 or 99% of total revenue excluding oil hedge gains and losses in the year ended 31 December 2012 
 2011: US 954,051,000 or 98% of total revenue .
All non-current assets of the Group are located in the United Kingdom except for US 7,136,000 2011: nil located in Malaysia.

During the prior year the Group disposed of its held for sale interest in the Petisovci project in Slovenia in return for 150,903,958 new 
ordinary shares in Ascent Resources plc Ascent at a market value of US 18,422,000 creating a gain of US 8,644,000 in the year 
ended 31 December 2011.
Impairment of available for sale investments
Following disposal of the held for sale Petisovci asset, the Group held an investment in Ascent. The accounting valuation of this 
shareholding at 31 December 2012 resulted in a non-cash impairment of US 4,417,000 2011: US 12,497,000 .
Impairment of oil and gas assets
As part of the annual impairment review process, impairment triggers were highlighted which has led to a US 143,882,000 
impairment of the Heather and Broom hub refer to note 10 . 
Gain on disposal of property plant and e uipment
On 12 October 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to farm out 35% of the Alma/Galia development to KUFPEC with  
an effective date of 1 January 2012. To earn the 35% interest, KUFPEC agreed to pay EnQuest: 
a a total of US 113,187,000 representing 35% of certain costs incurred between 1 January 2012 and 30 September 2012; 
b a US 15,000,000 capital contribution;
c carry EnQuest from 1 October 2012 up to a cap of US 182,000,000 after which they will revert back to paying their share of  
the costs 35% . This carry has been recognised in other nancial assets refer note 21 and at 31 December 2012 the carry had 
reduced to US 95,302,000; and 
d an additional amount of US 647,000 per month on top of their share of operating costs, for a period of 36 months after the date 
of rst oil production. The present value of these payments of US 19,300,000 has been recognised as an other nancial asset 
 refer to note 21 . 
At 31 December 2012, the amounts due under a and b above had been received.
A balancing payment’ was also agreed whereby should the cost of development exceed US 1,055,000,000 then EnQuest would be 
required to pay 17.5% of costs up to a cap on the cost of development of US 1,153,000,000. As costs are now expected to exceed 
the cap EnQuest will be liable to pay these additional costs and so a liability has been recognised for US 17,150,000 in other nancial 
liabilities. 
In addition, a reserves protection mechanism was agreed to enable KUFPEC to recoup its investment to the date of rst production 
 refer to note 24 . 
The gain on disposal represents the difference between the total consideration and derecognition of 35% of the development at the 
date of the agreement.

Well abandonment expenses
During the year ended 31 December 2011 a credit of US 8,194,000 was recognised following a further review of options to recover 
funds from the previous Thistle eld owners, relating to partial decommissioning of two wells covered by the Intervening Period and 
Decommissioning Liability Agreements.
Depletion of fair value uplift
Additional depletion arising from the fair value uplift of Petrofac Energy Developments Limited’s PEDL oil and gas assets on 
acquisition of US 10,251,000 2011: US 16,973,000 is included within cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.
Tax
In addition to the tax impact of the exceptional items, the tax exceptional amount includes the impact of the 2012 enactment of a 
restriction on relief of costs incurred in respect of the decommissioning of UK oil and gas assets to 50%. This increased the tax charge 
by US 14,279,000, of which US 10,389,000 has been re ected as an exceptional item as it relates to the restriction on the opening 
decommissioning liability.

In addition to the amount charged to the pro t and loss, a deferred tax charge of US 4,167,000 2011: credit US 4,242,000 in respect of 
cash ow hedges note 21 , is recognised as other comprehensive income.
(d) Tax losses
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for the carry-forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which the unused tax losses/credits can be utilised.
The Group has unused UK mainstream corporation tax losses of US 2,662,000 2011: US nil for which no deferred tax asset has 
been recognised at the balance sheet date due to the uncertainty of recovery of these losses.
The Group also has pre-trading ring fence expenditure of US 54,529,000 which has arisen following the acquisition of Canamens 
Energy North Sea Limited in early 2012 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. The expenditure is likely to become 
deductible and available to the Group for UK ring fence taxation purposes during 2013.
The Group has unused overseas tax losses in Canada of approximately CAD 17,106,000 2011: CAD 76,577,000 and in Holland of 
€1,070,000 2011: €920,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date. The tax losses in 
Canada have expiry periods of between 7 and 20 years, none of which expire in 2013. The tax losses in Canada were adjusted in the 
2010 submitted returns to re ect the change in control of Stratic, resulting in a reduction in losses of CAD 47,554,000. Tax losses in 
Holland can be carried forward for a period up to nine years and are likely to expire in 2013.
(e) Change in legislation
The Finance Act 2012 enacted a restriction on relief of costs incurred in respect of decommissioning to 50%, compared to the North 
Sea ring fence rate of 62% of the relief. The impact of the decommissioning relief restriction in 2012 is an increase in the tax charge of 
US 14,279,000, of which US 10,389,000 relates to the restriction of the opening decommissioning balances. A change in the tax 
rate for non-ring fence companies was also enacted in the Finance Act 2012, reducing the corporation tax rate from 25% to 23% with 
effect from 1 April 2013. The impact of the change in tax rate is an increase in the tax charge of US 396,000.
In 2011, the enactment of the increase in the UK supplementary corporation tax rate on oil and gas activities in the North Sea 
increased the deferred tax charge in the income statement by US 78,149,000, of which US 68,086,000 relates to the revaluation of 
the opening deferred tax corporation tax balance.

A farm out agreement was entered into during the year with KUFPEC for a 35% share of the Alma/Galia development. Consideration 
included reimbursement of past costs US 113,187,000 , a capital contribution US 15,000,000 , a cost carry up to a cap of 
US 182,000,000 and future costs payable after the date of rst oil production US 23,292,000 . The cost of the 35% share of assets 
disposed was US 143,054,000 including the decommissioning asset .
During the year ended 31 December 2012 there was a US 143,882,000 impairment of the Heather and Broom hub following a delay 
in phasing of production, particularly to allow the drilling of the West Fault Block well at Thistle in 2013 and an increase in estimated 
capital expenditure associated with the eld life extension programme. The Heather and Broom hub inherited a high net book value 
of US 423,000,000, re ecting the fair value uplift when Lundin acquired the Heather and Broom assets prior to the formation 
of EnQuest. Refer to note 11 in respect of key assumptions used in value in use calculations.

2012 
US$’000
2011 
US ’000
At 1 January and 31 December 107,760 107,760
The balance represents goodwill acquired on the acquisition of Stratic and PEDL in 2010. Goodwill acquired through business 
combinations has been allocated to a single cash-generating unit CGU , the UKCS, being the Group’s only signi cant operating 
segment and therefore the lowest level that goodwill is reviewed by the Board.
Impairment testing of goodwill
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill was reviewed for impairment at the year end. In assessing whether 
goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU, including goodwill, is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined on a value in use basis using a discounted cash ow model comprising 
asset-by-asset life of eld projections. The pre-tax discount rate used is derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost  
of capital and is reassessed each year. Risks speci c to assets within the CGU are re ected within the cash ow forecasts.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The key assumptions required for the calculation of value in use of the CGU are:
 ■ oil prices
 ■ production volumes
 ■ discount rates
Oil prices are based on forward price curves for the rst ve years before reverting to the Group’s long term pricing assumptions. For 
the purposes of calculating value in use, management has applied an oil price assumption of US 107.60 per barrel in 2013, US 102.00 
per barrel in 2014, US 97.80 per barrel in 2015, US 94.30 per barrel in 2016, US 91.70 per barrel in 2017 thereafter US 90 in ated at 
2% per annum from 2013. In 2011, oil prices were based on US 119.25 per barrel in 2012, US 112.08 per barrel in 2013, US 104.73 per 
barrel in 2014, US 98.67 per barrel in 2015, US 97.42 per barrel in 2016 thereafter US 90 in ated at 2% per annum from 2012.
Production volumes are based on life of eld production pro les for each asset within the CGU. The production volumes used in the 
value in use calculations were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent reserve assessment experts.
The discount rate re ects management’s estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital WACC . The WACC takes into 
account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The 
cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing borrowings. Segment risk is incorporated by applying a beta factor based on publicly 
available market data. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the Group’s pre-tax cash ow projections is 20.4% 2011: 21.3% .
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
There are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could erode the estimated amount by which the calculated value in 
use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU. These are discussed below:
 ■ oil price: management has considered the possibility of lower oil prices in the future. Revenue for the Group’s future oil production 
is directly linked to the market price of Brent blend oil. A fall in the price for Brent blend would directly impact the Group’s revenue 
and potentially the economic life of assets in the CGU. It is estimated that the long term price of oil that would cause the 
recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of the CGU would be US 71.75 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum 
 2011: US 80.71 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum .
 ■ production volumes: estimated production volumes were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent reserve 
assessment experts. On a weighted average basis, production would need to fall by 18.4% 2011: 24% to cause the recoverable 
amount to fall below the carrying amount of the CGU.

Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP)
Selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme. Participants may be invited to elect or in some cases, be required, 
to receive a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest Invested Awards . Following such award, EnQuest will generally 
grant the participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing a speci ed ratio to the number of his or her invested 
shares Matching Shares . The awards granted in 2012 and 2011 will vest 33% on the rst anniversary of the date of grant, a further 
33% after year two and the nal 34% on the third anniversary of the date of grant. The awards granted in 2010 will vest 25% on the 
second anniversary of the date of grant, a further 25% after year three and the nal 50% on the fourth anniversary of the date of 
grant. The invested awards are fully recognised as an expense in the period to which the bonuses relate. The costs relating to the 
matching shares are recognised over the vesting period and the fair values of the equity-settled matching shares granted to 
employees are based on quoted market prices adjusted for the trued up percentage vesting rate of the plan.

Revolving credit facility
At 31 December 2011, the Group had US 156,250,000 of undrawn committed borrowing facilities available which expired in March 2012. 
On 6 March 2012, a new US 900,000,000 Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with Lloyds TSB Bank, Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Cr dit Agricole CIB, NICB Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland was established. The new facility 
comprises a committed amount of US 525,000,000 for three years subject to reserves , extendable to four years at the option of the 
Group provided conditions are met and a further year with the consent of the lenders. In addition, US 375,000,000 is available primarily 
for investment opportunities also with the lenders consent. The Letters of Credit LoC of US 123,750,000 under the old facility have been 
rolled into the new facility. The drawdown of US 34,600,000 at 31 December 2012 was subsequently repaid.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at US LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25%, dependent on speci ed covenant 
ratios. A facility non-utilisation commitment fee is payable at 40% of the interest margin.
At 31 December 2012, US 34,600,000 was drawndown under the Group’s facility agreement 2011: nil and LoC utilisation was

Commodity forward contracts
In November 2011, the Group entered into ve separate put and call options in order to hedge the changes in future cash ows  
from the sale of oil production for approximately 3,000,000 barrels of oil in 2012 for accounting purposes. These instruments  
were deemed to be ineffective for hedging purposes and are therefore designated as at fair value through pro t and loss FVTPL . 
These derivative instruments had fully unwound by the end of December 2012 and therefore had no fair value 2011: US 2,147,000 . 
The gains of US 2,147,000 recognised in 2011 were reversed during 2012 and are included within other nance costs.
In November 2012, the Group entered into three separate put and call options in order to hedge the changes in future cash ows 
from the sale of oil production for approximately 1,000,000 barrels of oil in the rst quarter of 2013 for accounting purposes. These 
instruments were deemed to be ineffective for hedging purposes and are therefore designated as at fair value through pro t and loss 
 FVTPL . The derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of US 871,000 2011: nil and gains of US 871,000 2011: nil were

Other receivable
As disclosed in note 4, as part of the farm out to KUFPEC of 35% of the Alma/Galia development, KUFPEC will carry EnQuest  
up to a cap of US 182,000,000 and agreed to pay EnQuest a total of US 23,292,000 after production commences over a period  
of 36 months. Receivables have been recognised for both these:
 ■ The carry element is being unwound over the period of the carry and at 31 December 2012 the remaining balance was 
US 95,302,000;
 ■ A receivable has been recognised for the additional payments at its fair value of US 19,300,000. The unwinding of the discount on 
these future payments will be included within nance income in the income statement.
Other liability
Under the KUFPEC agreement a balancing payment’ was also agreed whereby should the cost of development exceed US 1,055,000,000 
then EnQuest would be required to pay 17.5% of costs up to a cap on the cost of development of US 1,153,000,000. As costs are now 
expected to exceed the cap EnQuest will be liable to pay these additional costs, resulting in the recognition of a US 17,150,000 liability.

Provision for decommissioning
The Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning its oil production facilities and pipelines on a discounted 
basis. With respect to the Heather eld, the decommissioning provision is based on the Group’s contractual obligation of 37.5% of the 
decommissioning liability rather than the Group’s equity interest in the eld.
The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs which are expected to be incurred up to 2030 assuming no 
further development of the Group’s assets. The liability is discounted at a rate of 5.0% 2011: 5.0% . The unwinding of the discount  
is classi ed as a nance cost note 6 .
These provisions have been created based on internal and third party estimates. Assumptions based on the current economic 
environment have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These 
estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning 
costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will re ect market 
conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning liabilities is likely to depend on the dates when the elds 
cease to be economically viable. This in turn depends on future oil prices which are inherently uncertain.

(iii) Capital commitments
At 31 December 2012, the Group had capital commitments excluding the above lease commitments amounting to US 203,620,000 
 2011: US 310,408,000 .
Contingencies
At 31 December 2012, potential future commitments included US 45,000,000 contingent consideration due to Canamens Limited after 
acquisition of two of its companies, US 5,000,000 in respect of the Group’s interest in Block 9/2b in the UK North Sea Kraken and a 
further potential commitment of £7,000,000 US 11,200,000 is due in respect of back-in payments associated with the sole risk drilling 
undertaken by the previous operator on the Kraken 9/2b-04 appraisal well and 9/2b-04z exploration sidetrack. During 2012 EnQuest 
acquired interests in Kraken from Nautical Petroleum plc 25% and First Oil plc 15% . The amounts payable are US 150,000,000 to 
US 240,000,000 and US 90,000,000 to US 144,000,000 respectively, linked to independent reserves determination between 
100 Mboe and 166 Mboe. All will become payable upon approval of the Kraken Field Development Plan FDP by the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change. The FDP is expected to be submitted in the rst half of 2013.
As part of the KUFPEC farm in agreement, a reserves protection mechanism was agreed with KUFPEC to enable KUFPEC to recoup its 
investment to the date of rst production. If on 1 January 2017, KUFPEC’s costs to rst production have not been recovered or deemed to 
have been recovered, EnQuest will pay to KUFPEC an additional 20% share of net revenue giving them 55% in total . This additional 
revenue is to be paid from January 2017 until the actual net revenue or the deemed net revenue equals or exceeds the costs to rst oil.
In addition, there is contingent consideration of US 20,000,000 after the acquisition of Nio Sabah Limited which will be 
determined based on 2P reserves associated with an approved FDP on Blocks SB307 and SB308 in Malaysia. An exploration/
appraisal well is expected to be drilled in the area in the second half of 2013.
There is also deferred consideration of US 3,000,000 dependent on FDP approval in relation to the 20% interest in Kildrummy 
acquired from ENI UK Limited during the year.

26. Risk management and nancial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal nancial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short term deposits, interest-
bearing loans, borrowings and nance leases, derivative nancial instruments and trade and other payables. The main purpose of 
these nancial instruments is to manage short term cash ow and raise nance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme.
The Group’s activities expose it to various nancial risks particularly associated with uctuations in oil price, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. 
Also presented below is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s nancial instruments 
and to show the impact on pro t and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. The sensitivity has been prepared for periods ended 31 
December 2012 and 2011 using the amounts of debt and other nancial assets and liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent oil prices on its revenues and pro ts generated from sales of crude oil.
During 2010, the Board of EnQuest approved a policy to hedge up to a maximum of 50% of annual oil production. In November 2011, 
the Group entered into ve separate put and call options to hedge approximately 3,000,000 barrels of oil in 2012. During November 
2012, the Company entered into a further three put and call options, to hedge approximately 1,000,000 barrels of oil in the rst 
quarter of 2013. Since the year end the Group has entered into further put and call options covering 3,600,000 barrels of oil 
production for 2013.
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax pro t and total equity of a reasonably possible change in the Brent 
oil price, with all other variables held constant:

31 December 2011 70,836 67,500 26,918 25,650 Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the Group’s 
functional currency. The Group manages this risk by converting United States dollar receipts at spot rates periodically and as required 
for payments in other currencies. Approximately 1% 2011: 2% of the Group’s sales and 89% 2011: 89% of costs are denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group had entered into 11 forward currency contracts to partially hedge the Group’s 
exposure to uctuations in foreign currencies, namely Sterling and Euro. At 31 December 2012 only three of these contracts remained 
and are due to mature in 2013. These contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have been disclosed within note 21.

At 31 December 2012, the Group had one customer accounting for 87% of outstanding trade and other receivables 2011: one customer, 92% 
and three joint venture partners accounting for 90% of joint venture receivables 2011: six joint venture partners, 80% .
With respect to credit risk arising from the other nancial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these 
instruments.
Cash balances can be invested in short term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with 
a view to minimising counterparty credit risks.
Li uidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash ow requirements on a regular basis relative to its existing 
bank facilities and the maturity pro le of these facilities. Speci cally the Group’s policy is to ensure that suf cient liquidity or 
committed facilities exist within the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the Group can service its debt 
and adhere to its nancial covenants. Throughout the year and at 31 December 2012 the Group was in compliance with all nancial 
covenant ratios agreed with its bankers.
On 6 March 2012, a new US 900,000,000 Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with Lloyds TSB Bank, Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Cr dit Agricole CIB, NICB Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland was established. The new facility 
comprises a committed amount of US 525,000,000 for three years dependent upon reserves , extendable to four years at the option 
of the Group provided conditions are met and a further year with the consent of the lenders. In addition, US 375,000,000 is available 
primarily for investment opportunities also with the lenders consent. The Letters of Credit of US 123,750,000 under the old facility were 
rolled into the new facility and have subsequently increased to US 181,500,000. An upfront arrangement fee of 1.75% was payable.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at LIBOR relative to each agreed loan period plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25% 
dependent on the Group’s leverage ratio. Facility non-utilisation commitment fees are payable at 40% of the interest margin.

At 31 December 2011 and 2012, the Group held commodity forward contracts for which, based on the oil price at 31 December 2011 
and 2012, there were no projected contracted cash ows.
Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in notes 20 and 24, cash and cash 
equivalents and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves, and retained earnings as 
in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity on page 64.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure 
to achieve capital ef ciency whilst also maintaining exibility for future acquisitions. The Group regularly monitors the capital 
requirements of the business over the short, medium and long term, in order to enable it to foresee when additional capital will be 
required. Note 20 to the nancial statements provides further details of the Group’s nancing activity.
The Group also has approval from the Board to hedge the exchange risk on up to 70% and 50% of the non US dollar portion of the 
Group’s annual capital budget and operating expenditure respectively, and up to 50% of annual production. This is designed to 
minimise the risk of adverse movements in exchange rates and prices eroding the return on the Group’s projects and operations.
The Board regularly reassesses the existing dividend policy to ensure that shareholder value is maximised. It continues to believe that, 
in the light of the Group’s signi cant capital projects and exploration and acquisition opportunities, the enhancement of shareholder 
value can best be achieved by reinvesting the Group’s cash. Any future payment of dividends is expected to depend on the earnings 
and nancial condition of the Company and such other factors as the Board considers appropriate.

On 21 January 2013 the Group received formal consent from the Department of Energy and Climate Change in respect of the Thistle 
Late Life Extension LL development. The incremental reserves targeted by the development will receive Additionally Developed 
Oil Field Allowance in excess of £200,000,000 US 320,000,000 . This is a new eld allowance announced by the Government in 
2012 to help mature elds in the UKCS and will apply when the taxation legislation receives Royal Assent in 2013.
On 23 January 2013, EnQuest Britain Limited agreed with CIECO Energy UK Limited to acquire two of its af liate companies which 
together hold a total of an 8% non-operated interest in the producing oil eld Alba, in the UK Continental Shelf. The acquisition

deferred cash consideration of up to £500,000 US 800,000 contingent on certain project milestones.
In February 2013, the Group issued a 5.5% Sterling Retail Bond through the Order Book for Retail Bonds of the London Stock 
Exchange ORB . The Bonds raised £145,000,000 and will pay a xed gross rate of interest of 5.5% per annum until 2022.

Scope of the audit of the nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the nancial statements suf cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signi cant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the nancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the nancial and non- nancial information 
in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on nancial statements
In our opinion the parent Company nancial statements:
 ■ give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2012 and of its loss for the year then ended;
 ■ have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 ■ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 ■ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
 ■ the information given in the Directors’ Report for the nancial 
year for which the nancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company nancial statements.
Matters on which we are re uired to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 ■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 ■ the parent Company nancial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ■ certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speci ed by law 
are not made; or
 ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group nancial statements 
of EnQuest PLC for the year ended 31 December 2012.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Corporate information
The Company nancial statements of EnQuest PLC the 
Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised 
for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 
26 March 2013.
EnQuest PLC EnQuest or the Company is a limited liability 
Company registered in England and is the holding Company  
for the Group of EnQuest subsidiaries together the Group’ .
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for,  
and extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the UK 
Continental Shelf.
2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate nancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards on a 
historical cost basis. The functional and presentation currency of 
the separate nancial statements is United States dollars and all 
values in the separate nancial statements are rounded to the 
nearest thousand US ’000 except where otherwise stated.
No pro t and loss account is presented by the Company as 
permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. EnQuest 
reported a loss for the nancial year ended 31 December 2012 of 
US 757,000 2011: pro t US 436,000 . There were no other 
recognised gains or losses in the period 2011: nil .
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the 
use of the going concern basis is appropriate and that there are 
no material uncertainties that may cast signi cant doubt about 
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. See 
page 48 in the Directors’ Report for further details.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result 
in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the 
future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
pro ts from which deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted 
basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries are non-interest bearing 
short term funding to and from subsidiaries.
These are recognised at the fair value of consideration received 
or paid. Amounts receivable are stated net of any provision for 
impairment.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising  
the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative  
is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Cash ow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that qualify as cash ow hedges are recognised through the 
statement of total recognised gains and losses. The gain or loss 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately  
in the pro t and loss account. Amounts accumulated in 
shareholders’ equity are transferred to the pro t and loss 
account in the period when the hedged item will affect the 
pro t or loss. When the hedged item no longer meets the 
requirements for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, any 
accumulated gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ equity  
is transferred to the pro t and loss account when the forecast 
transaction which was the subject of the hedge occurs.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes 
in fair value are recognised immediately in the pro t and loss 
account.
Employee bene t trust
EnQuest shares held by the Group are deducted from the 
share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from the sale and the original cost being taken to reserves.  
No gain or loss is recognised in the pro t and loss account  
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees including Directors of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or 
rights over shares equity-settled transactions of EnQuest.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 97
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are 
granted. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service or performance conditions, other than conditions 
linked to the price of the shares of EnQuest market conditions or non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award the vesting period . The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date re ects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The pro t and loss account charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or 
non-vesting conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satis ed, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satis ed. Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date 
of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the pro t and loss account.
The Company operates a number of share award schemes on behalf of the employees of the Group which are described in detail 
within note 19 of the Group nancial statements.
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to 
employees and transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.

 Annual Report 2012
Included within amounts falling due from/to subsidiaries are amounts relating to internal back to back derivatives with subsidiary 
entities for the above external derivatives which are fair valued through pro t and loss .
Full details of the Group’s nancial risk management objectives and procedures can be found in note 26 of the Group nancial 
statements. As the holding company for the Group, the Company faces similar risks over foreign currency and changes in oil prices.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 29 for parent Company accounts. The disclosures are included 
within the Group’s nancial statements.
In November 2011, the Company entered into ve separate put and call options on behalf of its subsidiaries; EnQuest Heather Limited, 
EnQuest Thistle Limited, EnQuest Dons Limited and Stratic Energy UK Limited; in order to hedge the changes in future cash ows 
from the sale of Brent oil production in 2012. These instruments were deemed to be ineffective and were designated as at fair value 
through pro t and loss FVTPL . These derivative instruments had fully unwound by the end of December 2012 and therefore had no 
fair value 2011: US 2,147,000 . The gains of US 2,147,000 recognised in 2011 were reversed during 2012 within pro t and loss.
During November 2012, the Company entered into a further three separate put and call options on behalf of its subsidiary EnQuest 
Heather Limited, in order to hedge the changes in future cash ows from the sale of Brent oil production in 2013. These instruments 
were deemed to be ineffective and are therefore designated as at fair value through pro t and loss FVTPL . Gains of US 871,000 
 2011: US 2,147,000 were taken into pro t and loss during the year.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Company had entered into nine forward currency contracts on behalf of its subsidiaries; 
EnQuest Heather Limited, EnQuest Thistle Limited and EnQuest Dons Limited to partially hedge the Group’s exposure to uctuations in 
foreign currencies, namely Sterling and Euro. At 31 December 2012 only three of the original contracts were in place of which all will mature 
in 2013. These contracts qualify for hedge accounting in the Group nancial statements see note 21 of the Group nancial statements . At 
the balance sheet date, the fair value of these derivatives was a liability of US 121,000 2011: US 5,440,000 . The amounts in the cash ow 
hedge reserve of US 4,026,000 net of deferred tax liability of US 1,414,000 were reclassi ed to pro t and loss during the period.

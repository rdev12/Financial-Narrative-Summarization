Financial Performance 
The Group has delivered another year of growth from continuing 
operations in all service lines on a constant currency basis. The 
results were in line with expectations despite being affected for a 
second year by the strength of sterling. In addition, cash balances 
at 31 January 2016 were slightly higher than expectations. 
Revenue from continuing operations was in line with the prior 
year at £676.5m (2015: £677.9m), gross profit increased by 6.4% 
to £90.3m (2015: £84.9m) and operating profit from continuing 
operations before non-recurring items for the year increased by 
4.1% to £10.2m (2015: £9.8m). Adjusted
(1)
 profit before tax from 
continuing operations was in line with expectations at £9.3m 
(2015: £9.2m). 
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased 
by 10.7% to 9.42p (2015: 8.51p). Basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations before non-recurring costs increased by 
3.3% to 9.73p (2015: 9.42p).
In constant currency, revenue and gross profit increased by 4.9% 
and 9.1% respectively, with adjusted operating profit up 9.2%, 
reflecting an overall improvement to the net profit margin. 
Key to the success during the year has been the record growth 
reported from our US business combined with strong trading 
results from Asia Pacific following the Group’s investment in both 
of those regions in 2015. Trading conditions in the USA have been 
favourable with strong demand for technology skills, in executive, 
technical and offshore services. In Asia, revenues and gross profits 
grew strongly as productivity continued to improve and a new 
office was opened in Singapore.
Currency headwinds in mainland Europe masked good underlying 
growth despite a strong performance in contract recruitment. Both 
Germany and Sweden grew significantly in a recruitment market 
recovering from the uncertainty of the euro crisis. In the UK, 
notwithstanding a generally weaker permanent recruitment market, 
particularly in the final two months of the year, contract recruitment 
was robust and offshore services reported record growth.
Following a full review of all the strategic options, in December 
2015, Nash Technologies GmbH (“NT Group”), the German 
outsourcing business, was disposed of by way of a management 
buy-out. This transaction provided an exit from non-core, 
loss-making activities and lowered the Group’s financial risk 
profile, while retaining the upside potential of possible further 
consideration depending on the future performance of the NT 
Group. This resulted in a £13.6m (2015: £0.6m) loss on disposal. 
The NT Group’s loss before tax on discontinued operations for 
the year was £0.4m (2015: £0.9m). 
The Group also decided to close its Oil and Gas operations in 
Warrington due to a downturn in the energy market. The business 
incurred a loss before tax of £0.2m (2015: £0.1m profit) and 
the non-recurring costs resulting from closure were also £0.2m 
(2015: £nil). 
In Belgium, the Group’s acquisition of Talent-IT in Antwerp 
delivered a record performance. The final payment of £2.1m 
under the earn-out was settled in August resulting in excess 
consideration payable of £0.2m.
Taking into account these events, the Group’s statutory loss for 
the year was £7.6m (2015: £5.3m profit).
The Board is recommending an 8.7% 
increase in the final dividend to 2.360p

Strategy 
The Group’s strategy is to continue to grow the business organically 
as well as through earnings-enhancing, bolt-on acquisitions. 
The Group’s strong relationship-based trading model supports the 
delivery of a broad portfolio of services to our clients enabling 
cross-selling opportunities across service lines and geographic 
regions. 
A major competitive advantage is the Group’s market-leading 
business in Vietnam where services such as candidate sourcing 
and business process outsourcing are being cost-effectively 
delivered directly to the Group’s clients in the USA and UK and 
increasingly in Europe and Asia.
The business model comprises a majority of annuity revenues 
(2016: 62.4%), namely contracting, managed and offshore 
services, supplemented by higher-margin, cash-generative 
permanent recruitment (2016: 37.6%), both executive and 
technical. Cash generated by the business model is applied to 
organic investments, bolt-on acquisitions and for the payment of 
progressive and sustainable dividends. 
This balance of permanent recruitment, contracting and offshore 
services, combined with our market-leading position in the senior 
technology hiring market, provides the Group with a competitive 
advantage, enabling the Group to maintain client engagement 
at each stage of the business cycle, and thereby deliver resilient 
financial results.
Governance and Board
Harvey Nash’s robust corporate governance framework underpins 
its performance. I have previously set out three clear priorities for 
the Board, on which we remain firmly focused. 
Our first priority is to debate the strategy for increasing shareholder 
value and to hold the executive team accountable for its delivery. 
Our second priority is to ensure we have a highly talented team 
capable of executing our strategy and that we plan effectively for 
succession across the Group. Our third priority is to ensure that the 
right corporate values are in place, supported by the appropriate 
governance structures and their effective implementation.
In the year under review, our key strategic focus has been on 
securing the disposal of the NT Group, which was completed 
in December 2015. This has improved the Group’s financial risk 
profile, as well as allowing us to concentrate on the core strategic 
aims of the Group. We are also embracing the new risk guidelines 
and ensuring the robustness of our risk assessment processes to 
ensure we have the right mechanisms in place in order to make 
the right strategic decisions and enable us to confirm the longer-
term viability of the Group to our stakeholders.
Further details on the role and effectiveness of the Board are 
provided in my statement in the Corporate Governance section 
of this Annual Report. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending an 8.7% increase in the final dividend 
to 2.360 pence per share (2015: 2.171p). This gives a total dividend 
for the year of 3.850 pence per share (2015: 3.531p), up 9.0%, and 
reflects the Group’s progressive and sustainable dividend policy. 
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 30 June 
2016, the final dividend will be paid on 8 July 2016 to shareholders 
on the register as at 17 June 2016.
Outlook
In the year ended 31 January 2016, the Group’s businesses in the 
USA, Germany, Sweden and Asia all reported strong growth and 
in some cases record revenues and profits. Whilst the weakness 
in executive recruitment and the energy sector held back the 
overall UK results, strong growth came from Scotland and offices 
outside of London. Despite this and the strong contracting results, 
the UK experienced a slowdown in permanent recruitment in the 
final two months as uncertainty affected clients’ decision-making 
processes. This caution in the UK is likely to continue until the 
referendum on Europe concludes.
In the current year, uncertainty in Asia as a result of economic 
challenges in China continues however, trading in Europe has 
been broadly on track. 
Visibility is undoubtedly limited whilst global economic and UK 
political volatility persist. Nevertheless the Group’s performance 
at this early stage of the financial year is in line with expectations.

STRATEGIC REPORT 12 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT
Strategy
Our focus for growth
The Group’s strategy is to continue to grow the business organically as well as through earnings-enhancing, bolt-on acquisitions. 
The Group’s strong relationship-based trading model supports the delivery of a broad portfolio of services to our clients enabling cross-
selling opportunities across service lines and geographic regions. 
The business model comprises a majority of annuity revenues (2016: 62.4%), namely contracting, managed and offshore services, 
supplemented by higher-margin, cash-generative permanent recruitment (2016: 37.6%), both executive and technical. Cash generated 
by the business is applied to organic investments, acquisitions and payment of a progressive and sustainable dividend.
Three strategic pillars underpin the model.
The core business is the recruitment and provision of highly skilled talent: executive, technical, project teams and offshore. This includes 
identification, sourcing, placing or contracting talented people, anywhere in the world, as individuals or in teams with the Group’s clients.
A key growth strategy is to grow market share: through building long-term client relationships, leveraging our unique portfolio of services 
throughout the existing network, while broadening our geographic presence both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions.
Growth in market share will be achieved by increasing the number of clients and achieving higher levels of client retention than 
our competitors. There are also opportunities to infill with complementary services in existing locations, broadening existing client 
relationships and securing new revenue streams.
Growth will also be achieved by expanding operations in both existing and new locations. Investment in headcount will be considered in 
locations that are sub-scale, or provide opportunities for further growth through introducing additional services or in new markets where 
economic conditions are favourable.
Companies attracted by the benefits of having a supplier of broad software development talent, whether in-house or in the form of 
offshore projects, are a key focus. This is a natural service extension for a technology recruitment business delivering a complete range 
of talent services to the IT function. 
We will also continue to develop the Group’s global recruitment support services centre established in Vietnam and co-located with the 
offshore services division. This centre supports our operations in the USA, Europe and Asia by augmenting our in-house recruitment 
and research capability and expertise. This delivers improved consultant productivity, reduced average cost of placement and increased 
speed to market. 
The Group’s digital strategy brings the complete portfolio of services to market via new channels using numerous social media tools 
and platforms to leverage our competitive advantages. With a reputation for being at the forefront of digital initiatives, we will continue 
to use our pioneering in-house digital research team to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the disruptive nature of 
technological change. 
1. Growth
• Expanding the client base by winning 
new contracts and mandates
• Investing in fee-earning headcount to 
add scale in existing locations 
• Cross-selling the Group’s services to 
existing clients
• Organic investment in new growth 
markets and locations
• Making bolt-on acquisitions in new 
markets and service lines 
2. Profitability
• Adding value and improving pricing 
and margins through expertise and 
specialist consultant knowledge 
• Improving productivity through 
rigorous professional management 
• Developing efficiencies by using 
the Vietnam business for candidate 
identification, sourcing and 
administration
• Using technology to reduce the 
overhead costs 
• Increasing the ratio of fee-earning 
consultants to administrative employees
3. Sustainability
• Quality of delivery ensuring a high 
level of repeat business from all our 
clients
• Attracting new clients and engaging 
with existing clients through thought 
leadership and relationship-based 
activities
• Continued development of our 
professional services culture 
underpinned by a strong set of core 
values 
• Maintaining a strong balance sheet HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT  / 13
Model
How the portfolio works to increase shareholder value
Resilience through the business cycle
A key differentiator of our portfolio of services is the resilience it provides over the business cycle. This broad portfolio retains and maximises 
resilience and flexibility as the mix of services addresses changing client needs at each stage of the economic and business cycle. 
Demand for permanent recruitment grows as markets expand, while temporary, contract and offshore services enable clients to balance risk 
and achieve cost reductions. Managed solutions have become the gateway to new client relationships whether it’s the management of client IT 
operations or providing recruitment outsourcing and payroll services. Increasingly, elements of the recruitment process are undertaken offshore, 
reducing cost and increasing efficiency. 
Generating sustainable growth in a cyclical market remains our key priority, enabling the Group to remain in the top quartile of its peer group as 
measured by total shareholder returns.
Cash generative in nature
The Group’s objective is to be cash generative over the business cycle but excluding working capital outflows relating to growth which 
are, in part, financed by the Group’s banking facilities. 
The business model comprises a majority of annuity revenues (2016: 62.4%), namely contracting, managed and offshore services, 
supplemented by higher-margin, cash-generative permanent recruitment (2016: 37.6%), both executive and technical. Cash generated 
by the business model is applied to organic investments, acquisitions and payment of a progressive and sustainable dividend. 
The positive trading cash flows fund organic growth, bolt-on acquisitions and returns to shareholders in the form of increasing dividends. 
Calculated on a gross profit basis, the long-term target is 67% contract revenue (including offshore and solutions) and 33% permanent 
revenue.

Risk Description Mitigation Change in

Risk level 
after 
mitigation
Brand damage The Group’s reputation 
could be significantly 
affected by a service failing 
or individual action with 
viral social media exposure. 
Adverse exposure may 
affect sales.
The Group protects its reputation for 
professionalism and quality through its staff 
recruitment and development practices. The Group 
utilises high-quality external professional advice 
to reduce risk in this area. Robust internal controls 
ensure high levels of compliance in relation to legal 
and contractual risks and obligations.
Client retention The Group is not overly 
reliant on any one client, 
but there is a risk that 
business performance may 
be affected if a number of 
clients were lost. 
The Group’s client-centric strategy places great 
emphasis on the client and the retention of the 
relationship. A diversified geographical footprint 
and sector focus also reduces the risk of key client 
losses affecting the overall Group due to adverse 
country or sector-specific conditions. 
Cyber risk The Group operates with 
a number of complex 
systems that maintain 
confidential data. The 
risk is perceived to have 
increased due to the higher 
number of cyber-attacks in 
the UK.
The Group has cyber and data protection and 
security policies in place and regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of these policies. In the current 
year, we have focused on achieving ISO 27001 
compliance throughout the Group while working 
on other recognised cyber and data security 
enhancements to combat this risk.
Economic 
environment
The performance of the 
Group is affected by the 
economic cycles of the 
markets of the countries 
in which it operates. The 
current volatility of the 
markets in China and 
the UK referendum have 
increased the uncertainty 
in the markets in which we 
operate.
The Group developed a broad portfolio of 
services appropriate to different stages of the 
economic cycle and a continued focus on annuity 
revenue streams providing enhanced visibility and 
improving client retention rates during downturns. 
Foreign 
exchange 
The global nature of 
the Group’s operations 
naturally gives rise to 
exposure to a basket of 
currency movements, both 
in actual cash gains / losses 
and translation differences. 
In the previous year, 
the Group’s results were 
adversely affected by the 
strengthening of sterling 
against the euro and dollar.
The majority of the Group’s costs are aligned with 
revenues in single currencies. Exposure on equity 
investments in overseas subsidiaries is managed by 
holding foreign currency borrowings. Cash gains 
or losses are limited through active management 
of working capital and appropriate accounting 
policies and financial controls. Variances on 
translation arise as part of the strategy of 
increasing international exposure and are not 
actively hedged. 
Margin 
pressure
Increased pressure 
particularly on temporary 
recruitment margins 
in maturing markets 
facilitated by digital 
dynamics and use of 
social media. 
The Group goes to great lengths to 
differentiate itself and deliver a high-quality 
service to clients. The Group’s balance of 
permanent and contracting revenues creates a 
sustainable mix of one-off, higher-profitability 
income alongside annuity revenues, which 
builds sustainable profits in competitive 
markets. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT  / 17
Retention and 
succession
Delivery of the Group’s 
growth strategy is reliant 
on the recruitment, 
development and 
retention of high-
quality managers and 
consultants. Failure 
to attract and retain 
high-calibre individuals 
with the appropriate 
skill set could adversely 
affect the Group’s 
performance. 
The Group’s Head of Talent continually 
evolves the recruitment and retention plans 
of the Group. As set out in the Remuneration 
Report, an element of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is linked to retention of key 
employees. Senior management have deferred 
bonus arrangements and are often rewarded 
in equity. The senior management team 
that comprises 82 key business managers, 
lead consultants and executive team meet 
annually to discuss strategy. The Group also 
has an established talent academy and global 
leadership programme.
Regulatory 
environment 
The recruitment 
industry is governed 
by an increasing level 
of compliance, which 
varies from country to 
country and market 
to market. In the 
current year, regulatory 
changes in the UK 
and Netherlands have 
increased the risk.
The Group utilises high-quality external 
professional advice to reduce risk in this area. 
Robust internal controls ensure high levels of 
compliance in relation to legal and contractual 
risks and obligations.
Technological 
development 
and digital 
innovation
The risk of disruption 
to the recruitment 
sector through digital 
innovation is mainly 
considered to be the 
growing use of social 
media to source 
candidates.
The Group has invested time both at board 
level and in the operational context to design 
suitable strategies to capture the benefits of 
the current disruption and mitigate potential 
erosion of the Group’s market share. The Group 
has also invested significantly in developing its 
in-house expertise in utilising social media to 
accelerate sourcing and recruiting and updated 
its CRM for 50% of the business.

Viability statement 
The Directors have assessed the Group’s viability over a longer period than the 12 months required by the “Going Concern” 
statement in accordance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. The Directors have assessed the Group’s viability over 
the three-year period ending 31 January 2019, which aligns with the Group’s planning process. 
In making the assessment, the Directors took account of the Group’s current financial and operational positions, contracted 
expenditure and availability of financing. They also assessed the potential financial and operational impacts on the Group’s 
strategic plan over this period, in severe but plausible scenarios of the principal risks and uncertainties set out above and the 
likely degree of effectiveness of current and available mitigating actions. The impact of most of the principal risks would be 
to lower revenues, gross profit and operating margins and cash generation in the near term, which may have a longer-term 
impact. The Group’s strong annuity revenue stream and flexible cost base mean that it is well structured to withstand the 
longer-term impact of the principal risks.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet all their liabilities as they fall due up to 31 January 2019. 
In making this statement the Directors have made the assumption that in the event that the UK votes to leave the European 
Union, the terms of exit are such that the Group would be able to continue to operate in the same jurisdictions and on a similar 
basis to its present operational structure.  18 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT
The Group has delivered another year of underlying growth in gross 
profit across all regions on a constant currency basis, returning to 
its pre-financial crisis level of operating profit.
The UK & Ireland delivered further progress during the year, with 
particular success in growing market share. Overall organic revenues 
and gross profit, including the UK offshore business, hit record 
highs despite the market for permanent recruitment being weaker 
at the end of the year, which held back operating profit.
The underlying results in our European operations were strong, 
despite foreign exchange headwinds, with the exception of the 
loss-making Nash Technologies GmbH (“NT Group”), which was 
sold in December 2015. Sweden recorded a year of strong growth 
but, as with the euro, the weak Swedish krona held back results.
Record results were delivered by the USA, reflecting progress in all 
three service lines: executive search, IT recruitment and offshore 
services. The business has focused its activities on the fast-
growing technology and digital sectors and has benefited from 
unprecedented levels of demand for IT skills, ranging from highly 
skilled software developers to senior leadership roles within global 
Fortune 500 companies.
Strong growth was achieved in Asia, an encouraging result in a 
relatively new region of growth for the Group. The best performers 
were the businesses in Vietnam and Japan, but Hong Kong also 
significantly improved its results in the second half. Australia was 
steady and a new office was opened in Singapore. 
More details about the performance of the business are set out 
below by region. All results are from continuing operations; details 
of the performance of discontinued operations in respect of the 
German outsourcing business are set out in the FD Report.
United Kingdom & Ireland 
The UK & Ireland represented 41.0% of the Group’s gross profit 
in 2016 and operated from 10 offices, employing 247 fee earners 
across the region. The Group has leveraged its unique portfolio of 
services to gain considerable market share over the last decade 
despite the market being mature and highly competitive. Harvey 
Nash and its subsidiary brands Impact Executives (interim), 
Mortimer Spinks (specialist digital technology talent) and Nash 
Tech (offshore software development) have strong market 
positions in executive and professional recruitment across the UK 
and Ireland and a growing presence in offshore services. Permanent 
placements accounted for 36.4%, contract placements 49.1% and 
offshore services 14.5% of gross profit.
 
The business is one of the market leaders in technology 
recruitment and a significant opportunity to integrate the broad 
service portfolio further exists across the business. In particular, 
its growing capability to augment client recruitment of specialist 
technology skills with offshore teams, where appropriate, can offer 
a more valuable and competitive cost proposition than contract 
recruitment.
 During the first half of the year particularly, the UK contingent 
recruitment business enjoyed strong growth and experienced 
robust demand especially for permanent hires. However, during 
the final two months of the year, client decision-making processes 
slowed and a swing from permanent recruitment to contract

reflected a more cautious “wait and see” approach. Trading 
conditions in the senior market for executive and leadership 
roles tightened up considerably compared with the prior year, 
impacted first by the UK general election in May and then by global 
uncertainty in relation to China and energy markets in the second 
half. The offshore business, however, appeared to benefit from 
these variable conditions and reported a record year in the UK. 
Revenue increased by 1.8% to £233.4m (2015: £229.3m) and gross 
profit increased by 3.6% to £37.0m (2015: £35.7m). Reported 
operating profit was down 2.8% at £3.5m compared with £3.6m 
the previous year. 
This was a solid performance, as the business capitalised on market 
share gains and continued to invest in capacity expansion. The 
main reasons for the small reduction in operating profit were a 
broad swing from permanent to temporary recruitment in the UK 
in the final quarter, a weaker market for senior executive search 
and a decline in contribution from Ireland.
Strong growth came from the UK regions and Scotland. This was 
driven by organic investment in headcount in existing offices and 
newly established satellite locations such as Glasgow and Bristol. 
New client wins and increased market share resulted in a 17.0% 
increase in gross profit for the year compared with the prior year. 
London was weaker, with exposure to the oil and gas slowdown 
affecting numbers of contractors on billing. The decline in the 
energy market also affected executive recruitment and the Group 
decided to close its Oil & Gas business based in Warrington, which 
focused on recruiting international engineering and technology 
candidates mainly for companies based in the Middle East. 
Mainland Europe
Mainland Europe is the Group’s largest geographic region. With 
operations in nine countries, the Group employs 300 staff in 18 
offices across Northern Europe, and the Group has many leading 
market positions across the continent. Harvey Nash Alumni is the 
clear market leader in executive and leadership services and the 
largest executive and senior professional recruitment business 
in the Nordics. In the Benelux, the Group is the largest specialist 
technology recruiter in the market. In Germany and Switzerland, 
the Group has been trading for over 20 years as a leading player 
in certain high-value niche markets. The brand is well recognised 
for quality and a professional approach to recruitment. The region, 
which includes Poland, comprises a number of large, mature 
markets, across which there is a broad range of global competition. 
This market offers attractive opportunities for the Group in two 
key areas. First, there are opportunities to expand in temporary 
and contract placement, as clients seek to outsource risks arising 
from directly employing IT staff. This includes outsourcing 
models, such as extended workforce services, where the Group 
flexibly employs IT consultants and hires them out to companies 
as employees. This is a growing trend in Germany particularly but 
also in the Benelux. Second, there are opportunities to develop 
further in board services and executive recruitment, such as in 
the Nordics where this market is growing and companies are 
undergoing significant change. 
 
 
In 2016, the region generally enjoyed improved market conditions 
but this was affected significantly by the weakness of the euro and 
other currencies. Revenue in Mainland Europe was £378.0m (2015: 
£395.0m) and gross profit was £32.6m (2015: £33.3m), declines of 
4.3% and 2.1% respectively. However, in constant currency, revenue 
increased by 5.1% and gross profit increased by 7.8%. Operating 
profit reduced by 7.1% from the prior year to £5.2m (2015: £5.6m) 
but again increased by 1.8% on a constant currency basis. Across 
the region, permanent executive and professional placements 
accounted for 38.0% and temporary and contract management 
placements 62.0% of gross profit. 
Results from the Benelux were solid with gross profit increasing 
3.1% on a constant currency basis, as clients continued to favour 
temporary contract recruitment over permanent recruitment. In 
the Netherlands, uncertainty over new legislation in relation to 
temporary recruitment affected demand and resulted in delays to 
clients hiring. In Belgium, the Group made further progress in its 
relatively new location in Ghent with a good business contribution 
for the year and the new service of providing teams of permanently 
employed technical apprentices reported an increase in gross 
margin of 10.0%. Deferred consideration of £2.1m relating to the 
acquisition in Antwerp acquired in 2012 was settled during the 
year. This business has delivered excellent results throughout its 
three-year earn-out period. 
The Nordic region comprises Norway, Sweden and Finland. The 
Group’s business in Sweden reported strong financial results with 
overall gross profit up 7.3% despite challenging trading conditions, 
and business contribution up 42.7%. The overall reported results 
were materially impacted by weak currencies, recession in Finland 
and uncertainty linked to the decline of the oil price in Norway. The 
business in Finland held up well with net fees only 13.9% below the 
prior year. The office was broadly breakeven as a result. In Norway, 
despite the challenges, the prior year’s loss was reduced by 9.4%. 
The results from Central & Eastern Europe, which includes 
Germany, Switzerland and Poland, were stronger: particularly in 
Germany, which was up 5.6% in gross profit and 53.8% in business 
contribution. In Switzerland, results were down 8.8% on the prior 
year mainly due to the decline of managed services revenues in the 
Financial Services sector. In Poland, the technology recruitment 
business reported a slightly higher loss than in the prior year, but 
this was mainly related to restructuring. The business will serve as 
a nearshore recruitment centre for the Swiss business with the 
benefits of lower costs and higher productivity. 
The Group disposed of its German telecommunications outsourcing 
business, the NT Group, and its two subsidiaries on 6 December 
2015. The NT Group was identified as non-core in a strategic review 
of the Group’s operations in 2014 and, following a full review of

Asia Pacific
The Group has six offices across the Asia Pacific region, employing 
48 fee earners and representing 6.5% of the Group’s gross profit 
during the year. Growth in gross profit was the fastest regional 
growth achieved across the Group, albeit from a lower base. 
Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong are well developed and offer 
good opportunities for professional recruitment, executive search 
and leadership consulting. Multinational companies base many 
of their senior staff in these locations and compensation levels 
are comparable with Europe. China also represents a growing 
opportunity, as large domestic Chinese companies seek to grow 
their international presence and are increasingly employing 
recruiters to search for business leaders. 
Our Vietnam business is located in the faster-growing South East 
Asian economic region, which is generally underdeveloped and 
offers strong growth opportunities for recruitment and offshoring. 
Australia is a mature, well-developed and highly competitive market 
but, with its technology sector rapidly adopting digital strategies 
and a fast-growing and healthy start-up sector, the Group’s leading 
IT recruitment brand and offshore capability has made a significant 
impact in the market. 
 
Revenue in Asia Pacific increased by 76.7% to £10.6m (2015: £6.0m) 
and gross profit increased by 47.5% to £5.9m (2015: £4.0m). The 
profit of £0.1m compares with an operating loss of £0.3m in the 
prior year. Permanent or executive placements accounted for 
65.6%, contract placements 2.3%, and offshore services 32.1% of 
gross profit.
Asia Pacific enjoyed strong growth particularly in the second half 
of the year, and benefited from demand in offshore services in 
the USA and UK. Executive search fees grew 72.0% in Hong 
Kong, Japan and the new office in Singapore resulting in an 
operating profit before the investment in Singapore. Professional 
recruitment fees in Vietnam were up 41.1% and delivered good 
business contribution growth. Gross profit from offshore services 
(software development, BPO and shared services) grew 48.2% and 
contribution 51.9% as results from the Japanese market improved. 
While Australia remained challenging throughout the year, revenues 
were up 56.3% and the loss reduced compared with the prior year.
the disposal options, the Board agreed the sale of the NT Group 
by way of a management buy-out. This transaction provided an 
exit from a non-core loss-making activity and lowered the Group’s 
financial risk profile, while retaining the upside potential of possible 
further consideration depending on the future performance of 
the NT Group. This resulted in a charge of £13.6m (2015: £0.6m) 
relating to the loss on disposal. The NT Group’s loss before tax on 
discontinued operations for the year was £0.4m (2015: £0.9m). 
United States
The USA represented 16.4% of the Group’s gross profit in 2016. 
The USA is the largest market for technology recruitment in the 
world but is fragmented and offers strong growth, particularly 
on the West Coast. The Group’s unique portfolio of technology 
recruitment is compelling in a market with severe skills shortages 
and limited competition of any scale. The Group has six offices, 
with 80 fee earners based in the USA and 45 offshore recruiters 
based in Vietnam supporting clients such as Apple and Microsoft. 
 
Permanent placements accounted for 35.6%, contract placements 
33.8%, and offshore and solutions 30.6% of gross profit. Revenue 
in the USA increased by 14.5% to £54.6m (2015: £47.7m) and 
gross profit increased by 25.4% to £14.8m (2015: £11.8m), while 
operating profit increased by 55.6% following the investment in 
fee-earning capacity in the prior year. 
The US economy was once again the strongest market across the 
Group during 2015. All services grew strongly, with demand for 
enterprise recruitment the strongest with gross profit up 79.0% in 
constant currency. Executive search also reported a record year 
with net fees up 19.0% to $3.0m mainly driven by US Fortune 
500 companies investing in digital transformation. Permanent IT 
recruitment was also strong with gross profit up 17.0% in a buoyant 
market for technology specialists. The swing from temp to perm 
affected contractor numbers but higher margins resulted in an 
overall increase in gross profit (+39.7%). Offshore and solutions 
also posted good growth of +11.3% in gross profit.

Key Performance Indicators
The Board considers the following four performance indicators to be key in monitoring the Group’s performance.
Net fee growth*
Net fee growth is critical to increasing operating profit and the 
value of the Group. 
In 2016, our net fees grew by 6% due to strong growth in contract 
management.
Operating profit* per region
Our international footprint across Europe, the USA and Asia Pacific 
diversifies the Group’s exposure to any one country or economic 
region.
Gross profit ratio*
A balanced portfolio of services engages clients at all stages of 
the economic cycle, resulting in financial resilience. The long-term 
target is 67% contract revenue (including offshore and solutions) 
and 33% permanent revenue. 
The Group maintained a steady balance between its three key 
sources of gross profit during the year.
Net cash generated from operating activities
Strong cash generation is key to sustainable dividends and a net 
positive cash balance, indicative of a strong balance sheet.
 
*From continuing operations before non-recurring items. All prior periods have been presented to reflect continuing operations. 22 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT
Overview
Revenue from continuing operations was in line with the previous 
year at £676.5m (2015: £677.9m) but 4.9% higher on a constant 
currency basis. Statutory revenue, including discontinued 
operations, declined by 1.0% to £689.6m (2015: £696.6m) but 
increased by 4.2% on a constant currency basis. 
Gross profit from continuing operations increased by 6.4% to 
£90.3m (2015: £84.9m) and was 9.1% higher on a constant 
currency basis. Total gross profit increased by 4.4% to £93.4m 
(2015: £89.5m) and was 7.3% higher on a constant currency basis. 
Gross profit from permanent recruitment was 5.1% higher, while 
contracting increased by 4.2%. Gross profit from offshore solutions 
was 3.1% higher, with the decline in NT Group gross profit partially 
offsetting an underlying increase of 15.7% in respect of continuing 
operations from offshore solutions. Fee-earner headcount for 
continuing operations was in line with the prior year at 597 (2015: 
595), following investment in 2015. 
The net finance charge of £0.8m (2015: £0.6m) was slightly higher 
than the prior year due to increased use of the discounting facility 
to fund the NT Group disposal. 
Profit before tax and non-recurring items from continuing 
operations increased by 1.1% to £9.3m (2015: £9.2m). Profit before 
tax from continuing operations increased by 7.1% to £9.1m (2015: 
£8.5m) due to a higher non-recurring charge relating to continuing 
operations in the prior year. Including discontinued operations, the 
loss for the year was £7.6m (2015: £5.3m profit) due to the costs 
of the disposal of the NT Group (£13.6m) and the closure of the Oil 
& Gas division (£0.2m). 
Taxation
The overall effective rate of tax is a function of the mix of profits 
between the various countries in which the Group operates, with 
higher rates in the USA, Germany and Belgium in particular being 
offset by lower rates elsewhere.
The tax charge for continuing operations for the year was £2.2m 
(2015: £2.3m) giving an effective rate of tax on continuing 
operations of 24.0% or 28.2% (2015: 27.1%) excluding the impact 
of discontinued losses relieved against profits from continuing 
operations. 
The deferred income tax asset decreased by £0.4m due to the 
disposal of the NT Group and the removal of assets relating to 
associated pension obligations. The deferred tax asset of £2.3m 
(2015: £2.8m) relates primarily to accrued Group interest charges 
payable by the US business (£1.0m), tax losses (£0.8m) and 
was partially offset by a deferred tax liability of £0.2m relating 
to unremitted earnings. The deferred tax liability decreased 
by £0.1m due to the removal of a deferred liability relating to 
accrued income in the NT Group. 
Disposals and acquisitions
Following a full review of all the strategic options, on 6 December 
2015, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of 
the German telecommunications outsourcing business Nash 
Technologies GmbH and its two fully owned subsidiaries, Nash 
Technologies Stuttgart GmbH and Nash Innovations GmbH (“NT 
Group”) by way of a management buy-out. 
The initial consideration for the sale for the NT Group was 
€27,600, with further cash consideration receivable up to an 
aggregate cap of €9.0m, by way of an earn-out, based on the 
performance of the NT Group for the financial years 2016 to 
2020. No asset has been recorded for the deferred consideration 
in the accounts. 
The loss on disposal of the NT Group amounted to £13.6m (2015: 
£0.6m) and related predominantly to the write-off of loans from 
Harvey Nash GmbH to the NT Group on disposal (£6.8m) and 
payments accrued in respect of the agreement to indemnify the 
buyer in relation to certain liabilities of the NT Group up to a 
maximum of £4.2m (€5.75m) which were expected to be incurred 
over the nine-month period to 31 August 2016. A loan to the NT 
Group of £1.7m (€2.3m) for product investment and property 
costs was also agreed. No provision has been recognised against 
this long-term receivable at 31 January 2016 as management 
believe it to be recoverable. Cash outflows in respect of the 
disposal totalled £2.7m in the period to 31 January 2016. The NT 
Group’s loss before tax on discontinued operations for the year 
was £0.4m (2015: £0.9m). 
The Group also decided to close its Oil & Gas operations in 
Warrington due to a downturn in the energy market. The business 
incurred a loss before tax of £0.2m (2015: £0.1m profit) and 
the non-recurring costs resulting from closure were also £0.2m 
(2015: £nil). 
In Belgium, the Group’s acquisition of Talent-IT in Antwerp 
achieved its targets and the final payment of £2.1m under the 
earn-out was settled in August, with a small excess consideration 
payable of £0.2m, charged to non-recurring items.

FD REVIEW HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT  / 23
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased 
by 10.7% to 9.42p (2015: 8.51p). Basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations before non-recurring costs increased by 
3.3% to 9.73p (2015: 9.42p). Due to the loss on disposal of the NT 
Group, statutory loss per share was 10.48p (2015: 7.24p earnings).
Balance sheet
Total net assets at the year-end were £54.1m (2015: £64.6m), a 
decrease of 16.3% due to the retained loss in the year arising from 
the disposal of the NT Group of £7.6m, dividend payments of 
£2.7m and adverse currency movements of £0.2m. 
Property, plant and equipment decreased by £0.3m to £3.6m 
(2015: £3.9m) due to the disposal of £0.6m of assets related to 
the NT Group, offset by a £0.3m increase in other assets as capital 
additions exceeded depreciation. Other fixed asset disposals of 
£0.3m were made, of which £0.3m were fully depreciated.
Intangible assets decreased by £0.7m to £50.7m due to the disposal 
of capitalised software of £3.8m as part of the NT Group disposal, 
of which £2.1m had been capitalised in the year (2015: £1.7m), 
offset by exchange adjustments (£1.0m) and brand amortisation 
(£0.1m).
Net trade receivables increased to £106.3m (2015: £80.0m), due 
mainly to the timing of invoicing in the Netherlands (+£23.0m). 
Debtor days
(1)
 decreased for another year to 41.8 days (2015: 42.5 
days). Prepayments and accrued income decreased by £18.0m, 
due mainly to decreases in accrued revenue in the Netherlands 
as a result of the timing of invoicing (-£13.2m). Trade payables 
increased by £2.7m to £61.8m, again due mainly to the timing of 
payments. Accruals for taxes and social security payable increased 
by £4.0m to £11.0m, due mainly to the later payment of VAT in 
the Netherlands compared with the prior year (+£3.7m). Accruals 
and deferred income increased by £7.0m to £48.8m, due mainly to 
higher accruals for contractor costs in the Netherlands (+£5.5m). 
Other payables increased by £7.3m to £8.2m and relate mainly to 
payment obligations related to the NT Group disposal. 
Deferred consideration also decreased by £1.9m to £0.5m (2015: 
£2.4m), due to the final payment of £2.1m in respect of the 
Talent-IT acquisition, of which £1.9m was included within deferred 
consideration and the excess taken to non-recurring items. The 
excess consideration was due to the assumed discounting of the 
payable not being realised. The closing balance includes £0.5m 
estimated as payable in August 2017 in respect of the Beaumont 
KK acquisition completed in August 2014. The overall decrease of 
£0.3m in provisions for liabilities and charges relates predominantly 
to the utilisation of the provision in respect of the closure of 
the French office which was completed in the current year. The 
remaining provision of £0.1m relates to an onerous lease obligation 
in the Norwegian business following restructuring in 2015.
The Group had a positive net cash position at 31 January 2016 of 
£0.2m (2015: £2.1m) and has no long-term debt.
Cash flow
Free cash flow from operating activities before movements in 
working capital was once again strong at £10.8m (2015: £10.2m). 
Overall net cash at 31 January 2016 of £0.2m was £1.9m lower than 
the previous year, due mainly to cash outflows of £2.1m relating 
to the settlement of deferred consideration for the acquisition of 
Talent-IT. Other significant cash outflows in the period that were 
paid from retained profits included dividend payments of £2.7m 
(2015: £2.4m) and tax payments of £3.3m (2015: £2.6m). The 
disposal of the NT Group resulted in cash outflows of £2.7m in 
the period, being the costs of disposal paid of £4.4m, offset by the 
£1.7m loan facility disposed of to the NT Group. Cash outflows of 
£2.1m (2015: £1.7m) relating to capitalised software for the NT 
Group before disposal also lowered cash. Cash outflows on capital 
expenditure in the year were £0.1m higher than the previous year. 
Banking facilities
The Group maintains substantial headroom in its banking facilities 
to fund working capital. The Group maintained an invoice 
discounting facility of £50m in the year, of which: £22m is in the 
UK; the equivalent in euros of £2m is in Ireland, £5m in Belgium, 
£15m in the Netherlands; and the equivalent in US dollars of £6m is 
in the USA; plus a £2m overdraft facility in the UK. In March 2016, 
the Group increased its invoice discounting facilities to £60m.

Corporate Responsibility
People
People are at the heart of our business and the Board takes a keen interest in how we engage with and develop our employees. We foster 
employee engagement through building: 
• respect for the organisation and its leaders 
• understanding of, and opportunities to influence, the Group’s strategy and performance
• the chance to grow and develop within the organisation. 
Progress is measured in an annual Employee Engagement Survey. In the 2015 survey, when asked whether staff were satisfied with Harvey 
Nash as an employer, over 80% (2015: 80%) of respondents said they felt positively about the Group and 82% (2015: 84%) said that they 
would recommend the Group as a great place to work. 
The Group’s internal communications are designed to achieve awareness of the financial and economic factors that affect the 
performance of the Group. Employees are consulted regularly to make sure their views can be taken into account when decisions are 
made that affect their interests. Over 80% (2015: 80%) of respondents in the 2015 survey indicated that management had a clear view of 
where the organisation is going and how to get there.
Harvey Nash is a meritocracy, where talent and contribution come first. An attractive culture and strong, commercial corporate values 
are at the heart of what we do. Integrity, transparency, fairness, passion and excellence in delivery to our clients are just some examples 
of the professional attributes to which we all aspire. We always aim to work in the longer-term interests of our clients and candidates 
and we know that this, in turn, will be in the interests of our shareholders. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in 
share incentive plans to help align their interests with those of shareholders and reward contribution to the Group’s performance. Our 
commitment is reflected in our membership of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, which requires us to observe the 
highest principles, of ethics, integrity, professional conduct and fair practice.
Harvey Nash not only ensures that employment decisions are consistent with equal opportunities legislation in each country, but also 
actively encourages diversity consciousness among its management, staff and clients. One of our key principles is that the Group’s senior 
management includes nationals in the country in which they operate, so that they understand the market and are naturally integrated in 
the local business culture. 
In 2015 Harvey Nash signed up to Ernst and Young’s National Equality Standard, one of the UK’s most respected and rigorous standards 
in diversity and inclusion. This ongoing programme will help Harvey Nash assess and improve its inclusivity, from education, to culture to 
processes.
Our hugely successful Inspire and Aspire programmes set out to encourage promotion of women to the highest levels in our UK and 
international markets. In 2015 the founder of Inspire, Carol Rosati, was appointed an OBE for services to Women in Business.
The table below summarises the gender diversity of the Group at the end of the financial year. This has been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.

Directors of undertakings included in the consolidation 19 79% 5 21%
Full consideration is also given to the recruitment, promotion, training and working environment of all staff including those with 
disabilities. The Group respects human rights and regards those rights relating to non-discrimination, fair treatment and respect for 
privacy as having the greatest potential impact on its key stakeholder groups of customers, employees and suppliers. The Board ensures 
that its policies encourage respect for the individual. These policies are communicated to all employees through the Human Resources 
Policies Manual.  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT  / 25
Environment
The Board recognises that the business must minimise its impact on the environment and follows recommendations from the Carbon 
Trust to reduce its carbon footprint. As a service business, our operations are inherently less damaging to the environment than some other 
business sectors. However, to reduce our emissions as much as possible the Group’s environmental policy statement commits us to: 
• reducing the overall amount of waste being sent to landfill by separating out materials for recycling
• making use of mains water supply for personal consumption through onsite water filtration and purification
• optimising the operation of building cooling and heating systems
• introducing low-energy lighting wherever appropriate and feasible
• using software that automatically switches off computers to reduce consumption of power
• where possible using low-emission travel alternatives such as public transport and video conferencing 
• taking account of our carbon footprint in procurement of goods, services and material capital items.
The Group surveyed its environmental impact in the form of greenhouse gases in the year. The estimated greenhouse gas emissions 
for the Group for the 2016 financial year were 1,255 tonnes of CO2e (2015 restated*: 1,219 tonnes of CO2e), or 0.5 tonnes of CO2e 
per employee** (2015 restated*: 0.6 tonnes of CO2e per employee**). The main emissions source is purchased transport (Scope 3), 
representing 50% of the total carbon footprint. Purchased electricity (Scope 2) represented 35.8% while fuel combustion (Scope 1) 
represented 10.1% of the total carbon footprint. 
We calculated the above greenhouse gas emissions estimate to cover all material sources of emissions for which the Group is responsible. 
The methodology used was that of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition, 
2004). Responsibility for emissions sources was determined using the operational control approach. All emissions sources required under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 are included.
The estimate covers all operations that are consolidated within the financial statements and the offices leased to conduct these 
operations. Survey data (e.g. electricity usage) was collected from the Group’s largest offices, which together employ approximately 
74% of the Group’s employees, and extrapolated to cover the whole Group. Data was  also collected for the Group’s transport activity 
and research & development sites. Activity data was then converted to greenhouse gas estimates using the UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2014.
Charitable contributions 
Many of our staff engage in activities that support charities and their local communities, which is encouraged by senior management 
and the Board. 
Here are a few examples:
Harvey Nash staff in London and Birmingham have been involved in raising money for Byte Night, in aid of Action for Children, including 
achieving the world record for the furthest distance travelled on a static bike in 12 hours, as well as various “sleep outs”. Our London 
Executive Search supported Hestia: Housing & Support Charity, which supports victims of domestic abuse and their children.
In Ireland, our team participated in a sponsored charity walk for Focus Ireland, a charity that works to prevent people becoming, 
remaining or returning to homelessness. 
Our international offices and staff are active in supporting a wide number of causes. In Germany, we supported the Good Night bus 
which provides homeless people with meals, medical and other services. In Sweden, we co-hosted an event at Skansen, an open-air 
museum, for refugee families to enjoy local Christmas traditions. The event was a success with over 90 attendees. In Sweden, we 
continue to carry out a variety of pro bono board appointment and assessment work for the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the 
Stockholm City Mission and the Ester Foundation. 
In the USA, we sponsor a junior cycling development team and hosted a reception dinner for business, society and public policy initiative 
at Georgetown University. Additionally, we support the ADA Developers Academy, helping women take their first step into software 
development, as well as a San Francisco-based foodbank.
In the Netherlands, staff participated for the fifth year in the Unicef run in Breukelen.

Corporate Governance
For the year ended 31 January 2016
Dear Shareholders 
As a Board, we recognise that we have been entrusted with the stewardship of the Company and its undertakings by our shareholders and 
at all times carry out our responsibilities in a transparent manner with honesty, integrity and commitment. 
In the interests of full disclosure we have set out in these financial statements the sources of capital made available to the Group other than 
that provided by shareholders. As in previous years, we continue to use an invoice discounting facility provided by RBS, which increased in 
March 2016 from £50 million to £60 million for the Group as a whole. We also have an overdraft facility of £2 million in the UK. 
As a Board, we have reviewed the statements in this report to ensure that they comply with the spirit of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and in particular with the provision of C1.1 that they are fair, balanced and understandable. We have reviewed the Strategic Report 
as set out on pages 12 to 25 of the Annual Report to ensure that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy. We are satisfied that it is consistent with our understanding of business performance, 
financial position and the story told by the numbers. We have highlighted the risks that we perceive the business faces and how they 
have been and will continue to be mitigated. The Audit Committee also reviewed the annual financial statements as a whole to ascertain 
whether the statements were fair, balanced and understandable with particular consideration of the reasonableness of accounting 
judgements and estimates and the selection and application of suitable accounting policies.
We are confident that we have achieved our aim of transparency and hope that you agree we have provided you with the information 
you need to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy. We have conducted a robust assessment of the 
risk management processes in place and the underlying internal control environment to ensure they are effective. We have paid particular 
attention in the current year to enhancing the clarity with which we communicate to you as shareholders the risk management policies 
of the Group and why we are confident in confirming the Longer-Term Viability of the Group to you over the three-year period ending 
January 2019. We have included this information within the Strategic Report as we view good risk management as a key aspect of our 
sustainability strategy. 
The Board completed its annual evaluation process in November 2015. During the current year, an independent external adviser, Socia, 
was engaged to review the performance of the Board. The Board evaluation report included an assessment of performance against each 
of the provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in September 2014 (the “Code”) and actions required to improve the 
Board’s performance. While no significant performance matters were noted in respect of compliance with the Code, the Board received 
constructive feedback on improving its approach to strategy development along with a number of other useful recommendations to 
enhance its effectiveness. These have been adopted by the Board and will be monitored during the current year.
Throughout the year ended 31 January 2016 and to the date of this document, the Group has been compliant with the provisions set out 
in the Code, which can be found on the FRC website (www.frc.org.uk) and further details of how we have complied with the Code can be 
found in the Statement of Internal Control.

Board of Directors
Throughout the financial year there were three Executive and four Non-Executive Directors. A list of Directors, their biographies and 
roles is set out on page 7. The Board members with executive responsibility were the Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance Director and 
European Managing Director. There were no changes to the composition of the Board’s members during the year.

The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive is clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the 
Board. There is a strong non-executive representation on the Board, including Ian Davies, the Senior Independent Director. The Non-
Executive Directors meet regularly during the year without the Executive Directors and provide effective balance and challenge.
The Executive Directors are responsible for the overall operational and financial management of the Group within the framework set 
out by the Board. The Executive Council sits below the Group Board and executes the day-to-day running of operations. The Executive 
Council comprises senior operational management, including the Executive Directors.  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  / 29
Outside the formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors make themselves available for 
consultation with the executive team as often as necessary.
The Senior Independent Director and the Company Secretary monitor procedural compliance. The appointment and removal of 
Directors is a matter for the Board as a whole. Independent professional advice and training are available to all the Directors. The Senior 
Independent Director is available for consultation with shareholders through the Company Secretary. The Executive Directors meet with 
the Company’s major shareholders and other potential investors on a regular basis and report to the Board on those meetings.
On joining the Board, a new Director receives appropriate induction including meetings with other Directors and senior management, the 
opportunity to visit the Group’s key operations and meeting the Group’s principal advisers. 
The Board has a policy of providing reasonable funding for independent professional advice for all Directors in furtherance of their duties 
as Directors of the parent Company, and continued professional development.
The Board discusses and reviews its performance and membership regularly and sets its objectives annually. As part of this process, the 
Board, including the Chairman, considers whether it has sufficient time to discharge its responsibilities effectively. The Directors’ profiles 
and other commitments are set out on page 7.
As mentioned above, the Board engaged an independent external adviser, Socia, to review the Board’s performance in the current year. 
Socia has no other relationship to the Group beyond evaluating the Board. The evaluation process provided the opportunity for the Board 
to reflect on how after a period of significant development in the business, the changes have affected the dynamics, constitution and 
operation of the Board. 
The evaluation included:
• meeting with the Chairman and the Company Secretary to agree objectives of the evaluation
• interviews with each member of the Board
• observation of a Board meeting
• reviewing the Board composition, expertise and dynamics
• assessment of succession planning and appraisal processes.
Socia provided the Board with an evaluation report, which included feedback on performance against each of the Code provisions 
and suggested actions to improve the Board’s performance. The findings of this evaluation process were that the Board operates in a 
professional manner and was compliant with the principles and the spirit of the UK Corporate Governance Code as appropriate to the 
business. A number of recommendations were made, including how the Board could improve its approach to strategy development. 
These recommendations have been adopted and will be monitored during the current year. The summary results from the evaluations 
were presented at the Board meeting in November 2015. 
In relation to non-reserved matters, the Board is assisted by a number of committees with delegated authority. The defined terms of 
reference for each committee are available within the Investors section of the Group’s website.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year with the Group’s senior financial management and the External Auditor to review the 
interim and annual financial statements, the accounting policies of the Group, its internal financial control procedures and compliance 
with accounting standards. 
The members of the Committee during the year were Ian Davies (Chairman), David Bezem and Kevin Thomas. The Board considers that 
the members of the Committee both individually and as a whole have sufficient recent and relevant financial experience to discharge 
its function. 
The Audit Committee Report on pages 53 to 55 includes details of the Audit Committee policy, practices and engagement with the 
External Auditor.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a year. The members of the Committee during the year were David Bezem (Chairman), 
Julie Baddeley, Ian Davies and Kevin Thomas. 
The Remuneration Committee determines and approves the policy, remuneration and long-term incentive arrangements of the 
Company’s Executive Directors and the Chairman. The Chief Executive Officer may be invited to attend meetings of the Committee but 
does not participate in discussions of his own remuneration arrangements.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman of the Board, is set by the Executive Directors. The remuneration 
of the Chairman of the Board is set by the Remuneration Committee excluding the Chairman.
The Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 52 includes details of remuneration policy, practices and the remuneration of the Directors. 30 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Nomination Committee
The Group has a Nomination Committee, which provides a transparent process and procedure for the appointment of new Directors 
to the Board. The members of the Committee during the year were Julie Baddeley (Chairman), Ian Davies, David Bezem and Albert Ellis. 
The Committee’s terms of reference include:
• responsibility for identifying and nominating candidates for appointment to the Board
• evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience required on the Board
• succession planning.
In making appointments, the Nomination Committee takes account of the diversity of experience, gender, background and the 
composition of the Board. 
The Committee considers succession plans for the members of the Group Board over the short and longer term, keeping in mind the 
balance of skills, experience and background required to ensure the Group’s commitment to deliver sustainable shareholder value is met. 
The Committee considers the requirements of the Board and seeks to maintain a balance between innovation and experience when 
considering the required composition of the Board. 
The Group remains committed to maximising career opportunities through significant investment in training and professional development 
at all levels of the Group. The Committee supports internal development programmes to build the skills required of future Board Directors 
and leaders among relevant employees. 
The terms and conditions for the appointment of Non-Executive Directors are available for review at 110 Bishopsgate, EC2N 4AY during 
normal business hours and 15 minutes before the AGM begins at 9.30am on 30 June 2016. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board maintains regular dialogue with its major shareholders and City analysts by conducting formal presentations, being readily 
available for discussion and providing information as required. During the year, the Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance Director 
met significant shareholders to update them in person regarding results and key developments concerning the Group and to understand 
any issues and concerns they may have. The views of shareholders and market perceptions are regularly communicated to the Board via 
verbal briefings. The Company produces Annual and Interim Reports for shareholders and the Company’s website contains up-to-date 
information on the Group’s activities. 
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
Shareholder attendance and participation at the AGM is welcomed. Amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association require 
shareholder approval at the AGM. The Company proposes separate resolutions on each substantially separate issue and the proxy 
appointment forms for each resolution provides shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote either for or against a resolution 
or to withhold their vote. The Company’s registrars ensure that all valid proxy appointments received for the AGM are properly recorded 
and counted and a schedule of proxy votes cast is made available to all shareholders attending the meeting. There is also full disclosure 
of the voting outcome on the Company’s website as soon as practicable after the AGM. Shareholders are given the opportunity to raise 
issues formally at the AGM or informally with Directors after the meeting. All Directors normally attend the AGM and the Chairs of the 
Committees are available to answer questions at the meeting. The notice of the AGM and related papers are sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting.
Internal control
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal controls, for monitoring their 
effectiveness to provide them with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information used within the business and 
for publication, and that assets are safeguarded. There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control and accordingly even the 
most effective system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Board identifies and appraises risks, and maintains control and direction over appropriate strategic, financial, and organisational 
structure matters with formally defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. There are established procedures for planning 
and capital expenditure, for information and reporting systems, and for monitoring the Group’s business and its performance. The Board 
has delegated to executive management the implementation of the systems of internal financial control within an established framework 
that applies throughout the Group, and is responsible for reviewing the Group’s whistleblowing procedures.
The Directors believe the following to be the key procedures established to provide internal financial control:
• the operation of authorisation procedures
• appropriate segregation of duties 
• clearly delegated responsibilities
• close involvement of senior management in day-to-day activities
• setting of detailed annual budgets with reporting of variance analysis on a monthly basis
• the operation of an Audit Committee, supported by an internal audit function
• an established whistleblowing policy, the governance of which is overseen by the Audit Committee. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  / 31
The Board considers a significant failing to be any item that would lead to a material misstatement of the financial statements. In 
considering whether an item represented a significant failing, qualitative aspects of any failing would also be considered, as would the 
potential for the failing to affect the wider Group. While there were no significant weaknesses identified, any actions required as a result 
of non-significant weaknesses were discussed and actions agreed and monitored at the Audit Committee meetings held during the year. 
Further details of the assessments and actions are provided in the Audit Committee Report. The internal audit function, which is not 
wholly independent of Group Finance, was reviewed by the Audit Committee during the year.
The Directors have reviewed the systems of internal financial control in operation during the year and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report. No significant concerns were raised. The process is regularly reviewed and a full evaluation of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems is performed at least annually. This process accords with the Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors 
on the Combined Code. 
Going concern
In assessing the going concern of the business, the Board reviewed the budget for the year ending 31 January 2017. In considering the 
going concern of the Group, the Board also gives consideration to the principal risks to the business as presented in the Strategic Report 
on pages 15 to 17 and the liquidity of the Group as shown in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and other sources of 
funding that would be available if necessary. 
After consideration of these factors, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements. 32 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 January 2016
The Directors present their Annual Report and the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements 
of the Company for the year ended 31 January 2016.
Principal activities
The Group’s principal activity during the year was the provision of professional recruitment and offshore solutions. The Group has a 
number of overseas subsidiaries and branches in Europe, the USA, Vietnam, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. The parent Company is 
incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The registered office is 110 Bishopsgate, London EC2N 4AY. 
Details of the Group’s strategy and a discussion of trends affecting the Group’s businesses are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 
12 to 25. 
Results and dividends 
The Group’s profit before tax and non-recurring items from continuing operations for the year was £9.3m (2015: £9.2m). The Group’s 
loss before tax was £5.4m (2015: profit £7.6m). The Directors recommend a final dividend of 2.360 pence per share amounting to £1.7m 
(2015: 2.171 pence per share amounting to £1.6m), to be paid on 8 July 2016 to shareholders on the register as at 17 June 2016. If 
approved at the AGM on 30 June 2016, this would take total dividend pay-outs for the financial year to 3.850 pence per share (2015: 
3.531 pence per share). This marks the ninth successive annual increase. As in previous years, the Harvey Nash Group Employee Benefit 
Trust (“EBT”) once again waived its right to receive dividends. As at 31 January 2016, the EBT held 897,584 shares (2015: 897,584).
Share capital
There was no movement in shares in issue during the financial year. The number of ordinary shares in issue at 31 January 2016 was 
73,450,393 (2015: 73,450,393) with a nominal value of £3,672,520 (2015: £3,672,520). 
Research and development 
In December 2015, the Group disposed of its interest in its German telecommunication outsourcing business, Nash Technologies GmbH. 
The Group capitalised direct costs incurred of £2.1m (2015: £1.7m) as an intangible asset, but these were disposed of as part of the 
agreement. Further details are available in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
Political and charitable donations
The Group made no political or charitable donations during the year (2015: £nil). As outlined in the Corporate Responsibility section, 
support for worthy charities and community projects by employees is actively promoted.

• Julie Baddeley (Chairman)
• Ian Davies (Senior Independent Director)
• David Bezem
• Kevin Thomas  
• Albert Ellis

Chief Executive 34 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Part 1: Annual statement
Dear Shareholders
Introduction
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 January 2016, Part 3 of which will be put forward 
for your consideration and approval at the Annual General Meeting on 30 June 2016. Part 2, the Directors’ remuneration policy, was 
approved at the Annual General Meeting on 3 July 2014 and is binding for three years. The policy is set out again following this letter for 
your convenience so you do not have to refer back to a prior year’s Annual Report. We remain aligned to the policy that was agreed and 
do not propose any changes this year to our current remuneration policy. 
The Group has again delivered a robust performance, with growth in gross profit across all service lines on a constant currency basis. 
This has been achieved notwithstanding continuing challenging conditions, particularly in Europe and in permanent recruitment in 
some markets, which did not improve over the course of the year. Reported profit before tax from continuing operations before non-
recurring items was £9.3 million (2015: £9.2 million), an increase of 1.1% year on year. Net cash at the year-end was £0.2 million, ahead 
of expectations due to tight working capital controls, and debtor days at the year-end were also excellent at 41.8 days, the lowest for 
some years.
In addition, the Group streamlined its operations with the disposal of its German telecoms outsourcing business Nash Technologies 
GmbH (“Nash Technologies”), which included the innovations business developing a mobile small cell technology solution. The Board 
viewed these operations as non-core and both were facing significant challenges. 
The Remuneration Committee has taken these and other factors into account when making decisions about remuneration as explained 
below.
Remuneration strategy and policy
Our remuneration policy was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 3 July 2014 and introduced by the Committee following a 
review of the appropriateness and efficacy of our previous remuneration policies. It was developed mindful of the wider debate on 
executive remuneration and the published views of the various shareholder representative bodies. The policy was also informed by the 
consultations carried out before it was put to shareholders and a small number of adjustments were made as a consequence of that 
exercise. 
The Board remains committed to aligning overall compensation with the long-term interests of shareholders, balanced by a variable 
bonus component focused on achieving stretching performance targets set annually. In the following sections of this letter, I explain the 
outcome of the annual bonus award for Executive Directors for the 2016 financial year and the approach adopted for the next financial 
year. I also report on the salary reviews for the next financial year and awards made under the Performance Share Plan.
Annual bonuses for the 2016 financial year
In accordance with the approved remuneration policy, the maximum possible total bonus payable to each of the Executive Directors 
in respect of the 2016 financial year was 100% of their respective base salaries. Up to 70% of this was based on profit before tax and 
non-recurring items (“the financial performance bonus”) and up to 30% on personal and strategic targets (“the personal targets bonus”).
For the financial performance bonus, the Remuneration Committee set on-target and maximum performance targets of £9.7 million and 
£10.0 million at which levels 60% and 100% respectively of the financial performance bonus would be awarded. On-target performance 
of £9.7 million reflected the Group’s budget and the City’s initial expectations for the 2016 financial year. The target for threshold 
performance was set at £9.0 million, being the actual profit before tax and non-recurring items in the preceding financial year. Between 
£9.0 million and £9.7 million the financial performance bonus increased from 0% to 60% calculated on a straight-line basis. In the event, 
profit from continuing operations, before tax and non-recurring items, for the year of £9.3 million resulted in 26.0% of the financial 
performance bonus being payable.
The personal targets bonus for the 2016 financial year was based on three objectives, which the Remuneration Committee determined 
to be in line with the Group’s short- and longer-term objectives. Each of these accounted equally for a third of the maximum personal 
targets bonus. The three objectives related to:
i. achievement of a satisfactory disposal of or exit from the Nash Technologies businesses;
ii. achievement of specified targets for cash and debtor days at the year-end; and
iii. retention of key employees. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT / 35
In December, Nash Technologies was successfully sold, notwithstanding the challenging and competitive environment both the Nash 
Technologies businesses were facing, resulting in a satisfactory outcome for shareholders in the Board’s view. This was supported by 
feedback from a number of institutional investors.
As mentioned at the beginning of this letter, the net cash balance and debtor days at the end of the financial year exceeded expectations. 
The on-target performance for this component of the personal targets bonus was aligned to the budget with the maximum being set at 
a level requiring a significantly better result. This element of the bonus was also subject to net cash at the end of the year exceeding a 
pre-set minimum.
Both these tests applied to all three Executive Directors.
The Group’s most important asset is its people and for this reason the third personal targets bonus related to the retention of key 
employees. In respect of Albert Ellis and Simon Wassall, in order to achieve on-target performance approximately 90% of these individuals 
needed to be retained throughout the financial year. To achieve the maximum bonus a significantly higher percentage was required. For 
Richard Ashcroft, in view of his position as Group Finance Director, he was responsible for a specific sub-set of this list comprising the 
most senior finance individuals in the Group.
In summary, Albert Ellis and Simon Wassall achieved all their personal objectives resulting in 100% of the personal targets bonus being 
payable to each of them. Richard Ashcroft achieved the first two of his three personal objectives, resulting in him receiving 66.7% of the 
maximum personal targets bonus. 
In aggregate, therefore, Albert Ellis and Simon Wassall received a bonus for the 2016 financial year of 48.2% of their base salary. This 
comprised 18.2% in respect of the financial performance bonus and 30% in respect of the personal targets bonus. Richard Ashcroft 
received a bonus of 38.2% of his base salary. This comprised 18.2% in respect of the financial performance bonus and 20% in respect of 
the personal targets bonus.
Annual bonuses and salary reviews for the 2017 financial year
The Remuneration Committee has set new bonus targets for the 2017 financial year. As for 2016, the maximum possible annual bonus 
will be 100% of base salary in accordance with the approved remuneration policy. With respect to the financial performance bonus, 
representing 70% of the maximum possible bonus, on-target performance, which would result in the payment of 60% of this element of 
the bonus, will require the Group to achieve higher profits as compared with the actual outcome for the 2016 financial year. This new 
target has been set taking account of the Board’s view of the Group’s prospects for 2017, City expectations and the general economic 
environment as it may affect our business. It is intended to be an achievable but stretching target. The details will be set out in next year’s 
Annual Report.
The tests for the 2017 personal targets bonus, representing 30% of the maximum possible total bonus, have been set for the three 
Executive Directors on a similar basis to the 2016 financial year, although they have been refined and adjusted to improve further the 
alignment of the Executives’ incentives with the Group’s short- and long-term objectives. Each of the three Executive Directors has three 
tests, some shared, each accounting for a third of the personal targets bonus and, as for 2016, these relate to the achievement of certain 
specified cash and debtor day targets, the retention or recruitment of key staff and to a number of strategic objectives.
The Committee reviewed salaries for the Executive Directors for the 2017 financial year in the light of the wider exercise for the Group’s 
senior staff and the approved remuneration policy. The policy limits annual increases in base salary for the Executive Directors to the 
higher of the increase in the RPI and 5%. The Committee decided that the base salaries for the Executive Directors should be increased 
by the change in RPI over the preceding 12 months prior to the beginning of the 2016 financial year. This was an increase of 1.2%. There 
were no other changes to their remuneration terms.
The Committee also reviewed the remuneration of the Chairman and decided that this should be increased in line with the increase in 
the RPI as well. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors, which are determined by the Executive Directors and not the Remuneration 
Committee, were also increased by 1.2%.
Long-term share schemes
The Group introduced a long-term share scheme in the form of a Performance Share Plan (the “PSP”) following its approval at the 
Annual General Meeting on 3 July 2014. The Committee granted awards under the PSP in both the 2015 and 2016 financial years with 
the intention that awards under the PSP would be made annually. The third award is being made to each of the Executive Directors 
immediately after the announcement of results for this financial year. In accordance with the remuneration policy, each of these awards 
was worth 100% of the respective recipient’s base salary based on the prevailing share price at the time the award was made.
Under the PSP, threshold performance is achieved if earnings per share increase by an average of 7.5% over a three-year period. This 
minimum performance criterion has so far not been achieved in respect of either of the first two awards and, as such, no charge to the 
income statement has been accrued for the PSP awards made to date.  36 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT
We also continue to operate the Harvey Nash 2005 Share Option Plan (the “CSOP”) for key members of staff below Board level although 
no new awards were made in the 2016 financial year. As stated in the remuneration policy, the Committee has no intention of issuing 
new share options under the CSOP to Directors.
Share options issued to the Executive Directors in June 2012 and due to vest in June 2015 did not meet the minimum performance 
criterion when tested in respect of the three financial years ending on 31 January 2015. In accordance with the terms of the CSOP, the 
Company last year extended the performance period by one year. Accordingly, the performance test was applied again in respect of the 
four years ending on 31 January 2016 and, as the minimum performance criterion was not achieved in respect of this period either, these 
options will not vest and accordingly have lapsed. 
The Executive Directors had one other tranche of share options. These were granted under the CSOP in June 2013 and were due to vest in 
June 2016, subject to achieving the performance criteria when tested over the three financial years ending on 31 January 2016 as well. As 
the minimum performance criterion was not met in respect of this period, and the Remuneration Committee has decided not to extend 
the performance period by an additional year, these options have also lapsed. 
Committee members and meetings
In accordance with best practice, set out below are the members of the Remuneration Committee during the 2016 financial year and,

policy, to come into effect on 1 February 2016 for the 2017 financial year. 
• Agreement that in the event the 2013 CSOP awards did not vest, once audited results for the 2016 financial year were available and 
they could be tested, the performance period would not be extended by an additional year. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT / 37
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2013 (“the Regulations”)
The Companies Act 2006 requires the External Auditor to report to the shareholders on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations. 
The parts of the Annual Report on Remuneration that are subject to audit are indicated within the Report.
I hope you have found this letter to be a helpful summary of the Remuneration Committee’s approach to remuneration in the 2016 
financial year and for the next financial year. As I have mentioned above, the approved remuneration policy is reprinted in Part 2, which 
includes notes on the implementation of each of the facets of the policy, and the annual report on remuneration in respect of the 2016 
financial year is set out in Part 3. These have been prepared in accordance with the Regulations and our understanding of current best 
practice for remuneration reporting.
The 2017 financial year will be the third year of operation of the current remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders on 
3 July 2014. Accordingly, in accordance with the Regulations, we will put forward a new policy for your approval at the Annual General 
Meeting following the end of the next financial year. We value shareholder dialogue and feedback at Harvey Nash and therefore, to the 
extent that we are considering making significant changes to the current remuneration policy, we will seek to discuss these with our 
major shareholders in advance so that we can take your views into account. This consultation is likely to take place towards the end of 
the 2017 financial year.

Part 2: Directors’ remuneration policy 
Current policy table
Executive Directors
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Executive Directors. The only changes made to the policy tables below are in 
respect of the implementation of the policy in the current year. 
Base salary
Objective and link 
to strategy
› Helps to recruit, reward and retain. 
› Reflects competitive market level, role, skills, experience and individual contribution.
Operation Normally reviewed annually for the following year taking into account general economic 
and market conditions, the level of increases made across the Company as a whole, the 
remuneration of executives in similar positions in comparable companies and individual 
performance. Further increases, if any, over the next two years would be capped at the higher 
of 5% or RPI, unless there is a significant change in role or responsibilities. 
Maximum 
opportunity
Not applicable.
Performance 
measures 
None, although performance of both the Company and the individual are taken into account 
when determining an appropriate level of base salary each year.
Implementation On 1 February 2016, Executive Directors’ salaries were increased by 1.2%, being the change in 
RPI over the preceding twelve months.
Other employees The approach to setting base salary increases elsewhere in the Group takes into account 
economic factors, competitive market rates, roles, skills, experience and individual performance. 
The increase in wages and salaries for the Group as a whole is reported in note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Benefits and 
allowances
Objective and link 
to strategy
› Help to recruit, reward and retain. 
› Reflect competitive market level, role, skills, experience and individual contribution.
Operation Include cash allowances and non-cash benefits such as healthcare, life insurance and car 
allowances. Allowances and benefits do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Maximum 
opportunity
The provision and level of allowances and benefits are competitive and appropriate in the 
context of the local market.
Performance 
measures 
None.
Implementation Benefits for the 2016 financial year are reported in the total remuneration table on page 46. 
There are no changes to these in the 2017 financial year.
Other employees Allowances and other benefits for employees reflect the local labour market in which they are 
based. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT / 39
Annual bonus
Objective and link 
to strategy
› Motivate achievement of annual goals and objectives.
› Provide focus on key financial metrics.
› Reward individual contribution to the success of the Company.
Operation 70% of total potential bonus is based on financial performance of the Group. The Committee 
establishes threshold, target and maximum levels of performance for different levels of pay-
out with sliding scales in between. The remaining 30% is based on performance against 
predetermined individual targets, set from year to year. Annual bonuses do not form part of 
pensionable earnings. Subject to performance criteria being met, the annual bonus will be paid 
in cash up to 60% of the maximum entitlement of the individual and the balance, up to 40%, will 
be satisfied in shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of award.
Annual bonuses are discretionary and the Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to 
payments if it believes exceptional factors warrant doing so. Annual bonuses awarded in respect 
of the 2016 financial year and subsequent years will be subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Maximum 
opportunity
For all Executive Directors the maximum opportunity is 100% of base salary. There is 60% pay-
out for performance at target. Performance significantly in excess of target is required to achieve 
the maximum award.
Performance 
measures 
30% of performance criteria is based on individual objectives and 70% on profit before tax and 
non-recurring items for the financial year. The target for profit performance is set taking account 
of the annual budget and market consensus.
Implementation Profit before tax and non-recurring items for the 2016 financial year was £9.3 million, resulting in 
18.2% of the maximum potential bonus being payable. The individual targets of Albert Ellis and 
Simon Wassall were achieved resulting in 30% of the maximum potential bonus being payable. 
Richard Ashcroft achieved 20% of the maximum potential bonus with respect to individual 
targets. The total annual bonus for Albert Ellis and Simon Wassall for the 2016 financial year was 
therefore 48.2% of the maximum total potential bonus. Richard Ashcroft achieved 38.2% of the 
maximum total potential bonus.
A description of the individual objectives set for the 2016 financial year is given within Part 1 
of this Report. New financial performance and individual targets have been set for the 2017 
financial year.
Other employees A range of cash-based annual incentives are offered in the form of bonuses, profit-shares or 
sales commissions plans. The Harvey Nash management team will award annual incentives after 
consideration of the most appropriate reward structure and targets for the employee and their 
role.  40 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT
Long-term 
incentive 
Objective and link 
to strategy
› Designed to help recruit, reward and retain.
› Drive long-term earnings and share price growth and value creation.
› Align interests of executives and shareholders.
› Encourage long-term shareholding and commitment to the Company.
› Link corporate performance to management’s long-term reward in a flexible way.
Operation Harvey Nash Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
The 2016 financial year was the second year of operation of the PSP. Share awards will vest 
following a 3-year performance period subject to the achievement of compound average 
earnings per share (“eps”) growth targets. Sustaining eps growth is a key performance metric 
that will drive long-term shareholder value creation. Targets have been set by reference to 
the Company’s six-year strategic plan and analysts’ forecasts and reflect strong and sustained 
performance for maximum awards.
Eps is based on adjusted earnings attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding any ordinary 
shares purchased by the Company and held in trust. Earnings will normally be stated before non-
recurring items, subject to the discretion of the Committee.
Eps growth is calculated using the point-to-point method. This method compares the adjusted 
eps in the Company’s accounts for the financial year ended prior to the grant date with the 
adjusted eps for the financial year ending three years later and calculates the implicit compound 
annual growth rate (“cagr”) over the period.
The Remuneration Committee retains the right, in exceptional circumstances, to reclaim any 
awards based on financial misstatement and/or the misconduct of an individual through means 
deemed appropriate to those specific circumstances.
Harvey Nash Share Incentive Plan
All employees of the Group (with at least three months’ service) have the opportunity to acquire 
shares in the Group via the Harvey Nash Share Incentive Plan (SIP). The shares are then held in 
trust on behalf of the employee. Partnership Shares may be withdrawn from trust at any time by 
the individual and retained or sold.
› If shares are withdrawn within three years, tax will normally be due on their value at that time.
› If withdrawn after three but before five years, there will be no tax on any gain in value since 
acquisition.
› After five or more years, no tax at all will be payable on the shares.
Maximum 
opportunity
Harvey Nash Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Awards will be made up to 100% of salary in the normal course of business. In exceptional 
circumstances, the scheme rules permit awards of up to 200%.
Harvey Nash Share Incentive Plan
Employees may purchase via deduction from salary up to a maximum value of £1,500 of shares 
in each tax year (or 10% of salary if less). This can be done via a single deduction or deductions 
each month during the tax year. 
Performance 
measures 
Harvey Nash Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Shares vest based on earnings per share (eps performance with 100% vesting at a cagr of 15% in 
eps and 20% of the maximum award vesting at a cagr CAGR of 7.5%. Vesting in between these 
levels will be on a straight-line basis and below 7.5% cagr no shares will vest. Shares vested under 
the Scheme must be retained for two years post vesting, and full dividends accrue during this 
period. 
Implementation The Committee has granted two awards under the PSP, worth 100% of base salary, to each of 
the Executive Directors. The first award was granted on 3 July 2014 with a vesting date of 3 
July 2017. The second award was granted on 1 May 2015 with a vesting date of 1 May 2018. 
Following the announcement of annual results for the 2016 financial year, the Committee 
intends to make a third award worth 100% of base salary.  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT / 41
Long-term 
incentive 
(continued)
Other employees Harvey Nash 2005 Company Share Option Scheme (“CSOP”)
Other employees receive awards in share options under the CSOP. Awards vest based on 
3-year cumulative eps growth over the vesting period in excess of RPI +3%. The basis of eps 
measurement is the same as the PSP plan for Directors. Individual awards are set by taking into 
account:
› the face value of individual awards at the time of grant, assuming that performance targets are 
met in full
› market practice for comparable companies and market assessments of total remuneration 
from our independent advisers.
Options are awarded based on merit and are only awarded for outstanding contributions to the 
Group.
Harvey Nash Share Incentive Plan
Employees may join the Share Incentive Plan after 3 months of service with the Group. 
Harvey Nash Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
The Performance Share Plan is designed for Executive Directors but may be used for other top-
tier management if appropriate. 
Pension

› Recognise long-term commitment to the Company.
Operation Pension contributions are made directly into the Directors’ personal pension plans.
Maximum 
opportunity
15% of basic salary.
Performance 
measures 
There are no performance measures. 
Implementation In the 2016 financial year, pension contributions of 15% of basic salary were made into Directors’ 
pension schemes. In accordance with the policy, pension contributions will remain at 15% of 
base salary in the 2017 financial year. Where an executive exceeds the prevailing tax-deductible 
pension allowance, the Company will pay cash in lieu net of employers’ National Insurance 
contributions. Albert Ellis took advantage of this provision in the financial year.
Other employees Harvey Nash Scottish Widows Pension Scheme
The Harvey Nash Scottish Widows Pension Scheme is a defined contribution pension plan open 
to all employees. From 1 January 2014, all employees who have been employed by the Company 
for at least three months will be auto-enrolled into the scheme. The employees may choose 
to opt out but will be automatically re-enrolled at three-year intervals. Harvey Nash will make 
contributions to the pension scheme based on the length of enrolment of the employee varying 
from 50% of the employer National Insurance savings to 5% of basic salary.  42 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT

Implementation The Directors’ shareholdings are set out on page 49 within Part 3 of this Report. Albert Ellis 
and Richard Ashcroft met this test for the financial year 2016. The number of shares held by 
Simon Wassall fell short of the required total for the financial year 2016 by 1,738 shares, worth 
£1,600 at the average share price of 92.05 pence. Simon Wassall has indicated his intention to 
purchase the number of shares needed to meet the shareholding requirement, following the 
announcement of the annual results for the 2016 financial year.

› Align interests of executives and shareholders.
› Encourage long-term shareholding and commitment to the Company.
› Link corporate performance to management’s long-term reward in a flexible way.
Operation Harvey Nash 2005 Company Share Option Scheme (“CSOP”)
Previously, Directors were awarded options under the CSOP. This has been replaced by the PSP 
for Executive Directors and it is not planned to use the CSOP scheme in the foreseeable future 
for Directors.
Maximum 
opportunity
Not applicable. 
Performance 
measures 
Harvey Nash’s compounded annual growth in earnings per share over the performance period 
must exceed the compounded annual growth in the Retail Prices Index by a minimum of 
3.0%. This performance criterion was chosen to incentivise the maximisation of shareholders’ 
return. If unforeseen circumstances cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that the 
performance criterion has become unfair or impractical in the circumstances, they may, at their 
discretion, amend the performance criterion. 
Implementation Share options granted to Executive Directors under the June 2012 CSOP did not meet the 
performance criterion when tested in respect of the three financial years ended 31 January 
2015. As permitted by the scheme rules, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion 
to extend the performance period of the options by one year. The June 2012 CSOP share options 
were re-tested in respect of the four financial years ending 31 January 2016 and again did not 
meet the performance criterion and therefore lapsed. 
Share options granted to Executive Directors under the June 2013 CSOP also failed to vest as 
they did not meet the performance criterion over the three financial years to 31 January 2016. 
The Committee chose not to extend the performance period of the June 2013 CSOP grant. 
Share options awarded under the CSOP to the Executive Directors are detailed on page 48 
within Part 3 of this Report.
Other employees Other employees will continue to be awarded share options from the CSOP for exceptional 
performance. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT / 43
Non-Executive Directors
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Non-Executive Directors.
Fees
Objective and 
link to strategy
› Helps to recruit, reward and retain.
› Reflects competitive market level, role, skills, experience and individual contribution.
Operation Reviewed annually for the following year taking into account general economic and market 
conditions, the level of increases made across the Company as a whole, and the remuneration 
of Non-Executive Directors in similar positions in comparable companies. Any increases are 
capped at the higher of 5% or RPI.
Maximum

Not applicable.
Performance 
measures 
None.
Implementation The Chairman was paid £101,600 during the 2016 financial year. All other Non-Executive 
Directors received a fee of £42,672. If a Non-Executive Director chaired a sub-committee or 
performed the role of Senior Independent Director, an additional payment of £5,000 per role 
was paid. In line with the policy, from 1 February 2016, the Chairman’s remuneration and the 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees, including those paid for chairing a sub-committee or performing 
the role of Senior Independent Director, were increased by 1.2%, being the change in the RPI 
over the preceding twelve months. 
Shareholding
Objective and 
link to strategy
› To ensure independence of the Non-Executive Directors is maintained.
› To safeguard the governance of the Group.
Operation Non-Executive Directors are permitted but not obliged to hold shares.

Performance 
measures 
None.
Implementation Julie Baddeley and Kevin Thomas hold 10,000 shares each.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration.
Element Policy
Base salary and benefits
Harvey Nash operates in a highly competitive sector. The Committee’s approach to recruitment 
remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role. Any 
new Executive Director’s package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same 
constraints, as those of the existing Executive Directors.
Pension 15% of base salary. The Committee reserves the right to adjust contributions by a maximum of 10% 
if it feels it is warranted based on economic and competitive factors. 
Annual bonus Up to 100% of base salary based on performance. Annual incentive plans are discretionary and the 
Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to payments if it believes exceptional factors 
warrant doing so.
Long-term incentives Any new Executive Director’s package would be expected to include the same long-term incentive 
structure as those of existing Executive Directors. 
Sign-on payments/ 
recruitment awards
Harvey Nash’s policy is not to pay sign-on payments above and beyond the normal buy-out policy 
to replace rewards forfeited or payments forgone. 
Share buy-outs/ replacement 
awards
Where it is necessary to “buy out” an individual’s awards from a previous employer, the Committee 
will seek to match the expected value of the awards by granting awards that vest over a similar 
period, reducing the quantum if the new awards are subject to performance conditions that are 
less stretching than those on the awards given up.
Relocation policies Harvey Nash will cover reasonable costs of relocation for Directors.
Implementation Share options granted to Executive Directors under the June 2012 CSOP did not meet the 
performance criterion when tested in respect of the three financial years ended 31 January 
2015. As permitted by the scheme rules, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion 
to extend the performance period of the options by one year. The June 2012 CSOP share options 
were re-tested in respect of the four financial years ending 31 January 2016 and again did not 
meet the performance criterion and therefore lapsed. 
Share options granted to Executive Directors under the June 2013 CSOP also failed to vest as 
they did not meet the performance criterion over the three financial years to 31 January 2016. 
The Committee chose not to extend the performance period of the June 2013 CSOP grant. 
Share options awarded under the CSOP to the Executive Directors are detailed on page 48 
within Part 3 of this Report.
Other employees Other employees will continue to be awarded share options from the CSOP for exceptional 
performance. 44 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT

The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Group’s policy on payment for loss of office in respect of Directors 
who leave in accordance with the terms of their contract (“good leavers”) and any discretion available to the Committee.
Element Approach Committee discretion
Base salary benefits and 
pension
Executive Directors are remunerated for the twelve months 
of their notice period in accordance with their normal 
contractual terms. 
Non-Executive Directors are remunerated for the six months 
of their notice period in accordance with their normal 
contractual terms. 
The Committee may agree a 
payment in lieu of notice if they 
consider it to be in the interests of 
shareholders for the Director not 
to serve the full notice period. 
Annual bonus Annual bonus – for the purposes of any annual bonus 
entitlement, if the Executive Director is still employed on 
the bonus payment date (including if under notice, if such 
notice was given after the end of the performance year), 
a bonus will be paid as normal. No payment will be made 
if the employment is terminated before the end of the 
performance period or if the executive is not employed on 
the bonus payment date. 
Deferred share bonus – any awarded but unvested deferred 
share awards will be reduced on a time pro rata basis and paid 
on the vesting date.
The Committee has discretion 
to negotiate the annual bonus 
payable based on the individual 
performance of the Director and 
expected full-year result. 
The Committee also has the 
discretion to substitute unvested 
deferred share awards for a 
commensurate cash alternative if 
felt appropriate. 
Long-term incentive – PSP Upon cessation of employment, the Director’s awards shall 
cease to be capable of call and the awards will lapse 30 days 
later.
The Committee has discretion to 
allow the call of unvested awards 
on an accelerated basis subject 
to a reduction in the number 
of shares that may be acquired. 
Alternatively, the Committee may 
allow the Director to maintain the 
awards until vesting and permit 
their call within six months of the 
vesting date, subject to a reduction 
in the number of shares that may 
be acquired. 
Long-term incentive – CSOP Any long-term incentive awards which are in at least the 
second year of the performance period will vest after the 
end of the performance period on a pro-rated basis. If 
the Executive Director leaves during the first year of the 
performance period, the award will lapse. 
The award of long-term incentives 
in respect of options under the 
CSOP is entirely at the discretion 
of the Committee up to the levels 
defined in the LTIP policy for 
normal service. 
Non-executive and executive appointments will be terminated immediately with no compensation for loss of office if they are terminated 
for cause (“bad leavers”). Bad leavers will be remunerated in the form of their base salary and benefits for services performed to the date 
of termination. All outstanding unvested shares will lapse; no cash or deferred share bonuses will be paid.  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT / 45
Illustrations of application of salary and bonus policy
Assumptions used in determining the level of pay-out under given scenarios are as follows for the 2017 financial year.
Element Threshold On-target Maximum
Albert Ellis Fixed £413,763 £413,763 £413,763
Annual variable - £233,194 £388,657
Total £413,763 £646,957 £802,420

Annual variable - £116,597 £194,328
Total £211,234 £327,831 £405,562
Notes 
“Fixed” represents the total remuneration agreed as payable to the Executive Directors for the financial year 2017, which is not subject to performance 
measures. 
 “Annual variable” represents the potential amounts that may be awarded to the Executive Directors at threshold, target and maximum performance 
under the annual bonus for financial year 2017. 
The “Annual variable” totals do not include any amounts in respect of the PSP awards in issue. The first two awards were made under the PSP scheme 
in July 2014 and May 2015. The indicative growth in EPS over a three-year period, based on the maximum performance target for the purposes of the 
annual bonus, do not meet the threshold criterion for vesting of the PSP award and consequently no amounts in respect of the scheme have been 
included in the scenarios.
70% of the annual bonus is based on financial targets. Nothing will be paid until the “threshold” is reached. The bonus increases on a straight-line basis 
until “target” performance is achieved at which 60% of this component of the bonus is payable. 100% of this component of the bonus is payable if 
“maximum” performance is reached. 30% of the annual bonus is based on individual targets which vest at the discretion of the Committee based on its 
assessment of performance against the objectives set. Vesting of individual performance awards has been assumed to increase in line with vesting of 
the financial performance award. All percentages are based on base salary.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group in developing policy
In accordance with the Committee’s terms of reference, available on the Group’s website, the Committee’s remit does not include 
remuneration matters below that of the Chief Executive and the other Executive Directors. However, before the remuneration packages 
for the Harvey Nash Executive Directors are set for the year ahead, the Committee considers general pay trends in the market and the 
level of pay increases across the Group as a whole. This helps to ensure that executive remuneration packages are reviewed in the context 
of the wider organisation and that they are aligned to the Group’s strategy, competitiveness and performance of the business and other 
matters affecting employees.
The Group also conducts an Employee Engagement Survey to find out how people feel about working for Harvey Nash, what they think 
about the work they do, the opportunities they have and the rewards they get (including a section on pay and benefits). The Group 
uses all of this feedback to inform decisions on people-related activities, resources and investment, local management action plans 
and wider business unit and organisational strategies. It is the Group’s intention to continue to engage with employees and employee 
representatives in this way in the future.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Group consults regularly with shareholders on all matters affecting its strategy and business operations. As part of that process, we 
also engage with shareholders on matters relating to executive remuneration. 
The Committee continues to be aware of and respond to best practice guidelines of shareholders and their representative bodies.

Notes 
1. An increase to the car allowance of £1,000, effective 1 March 2014, was approved by the Committee in the 2014 financial year.
2. The annual cost of the Group’s health insurance decreased in the year ended 31 January 2016 with no associated reduction in the benefits received.
3. The outcome of the annual bonus for the 2016 financial year is detailed on page 47. The cash element of the annual bonus award is capped at a 
maximum of 60% of maximum bonus opportunity. Any remaining balance is settled in shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years from 
the date of the award. In both the years ended 31 January 2015 and 2016, the bonus payable was less than the cap and therefore all payable as cash. 
4. Directors receive pension payments directly into their personal pension plans. The Group does not operate any defined benefit pension schemes 
for Executive Directors. In the 2016 financial year, pension contributions of 15% of basic salary were made into Directors’ pension schemes, except 
where a Director received cash in lieu of pensions as explained below. There were no increases to pension contributions as a percentage of base 
salary during the 2016 financial year. Where pension contributions to which a Director is entitled would exceed the prevailing tax-deductible 
pension allowance, in accordance with the policy set out in Part 2 of this Remuneration Report, the Company will pay cash in lieu net of employers’ 
National Insurance contributions. During the financial year, Albert Ellis received £11,604 (2015: £5,746) of his pension paid as cash.
5. Shares were granted to the Executive Directors in the year under the PSP and will vest on 31 January 2018 if the performance criterion is met. No 
share options previously awarded under the CSOP vested during the year as the performance criterion was not met. Further details of scheme 
interests awarded are set out on page 48.
6. Margot Katz stepped down from the Board as a part-time Executive Director on 3 July 2014. Margot Katz acts as a Talent Consultant for a number

Notes 
1. For the purposes of Directors’ bonuses, profit before tax is measured from continuing operations before non-recurring items. Non-recurring items 
from continuing operations in the year ended 31 January 2016 were £0.2m and predominantly related to the settlement of deferred consideration 
on the acquisition of Talent-IT. Discontinued operations relating mainly to the sale of the NT Group and the associated non-recurring costs were 
£13.6m and are disclosed separately in note 32 to the financial statements.
2. Personal bonus targets are set year to year by the Remuneration Committee, as set out in Part 2 of this Remuneration Report. The targets set in 
respect of the 2016 financial year are described within Part 1 of this Remuneration Report. The Committee views the disclosure of certain details 
of the actual personal performance targets as commercially sensitive. In the year, Albert Ellis and Simon Wassall achieved all three of their personal 
targets set by the Remuneration Committee and therefore each received 100% of the bonus in respect of personal targets. Richard Ashcroft 
achieved two of the three personal targets set by the Remuneration Committee resulting in a bonus of 66.7% in respect of personal targets.  48 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC REMUNERATION REPORT

Notes 
1. The share options issued under the CSOP in June 2012 failed to meet the performance criterion in the initial three-year performance period ending 
31 January 2015. The Committee exercised its discretion to extend the performance period in respect of these options by one year to 31 January 
2016. The performance of the options was retested at 31 January 2016 and the options still failed to meet the performance criterion. The share 
options issued under the CSOP in June 2013 also failed to meet the performance criterion in the three-year performance period ending 31 January 
2016. Both tranches of options therefore lapsed as at 31 January 2016.
2. Share awards were made under the PSP based on 100% of base salary during the 2016 financial year, representing the maximum award possible in 
the normal course of business. The prevailing share price at the date of award was 85.0 pence. The performance criterion and vesting schedules are 
set out on page 40 within Part 2 of this Remuneration Report.

year’s annual base salary in shares within a five-year period of joining the Group. The average share price during the 2016 financial year of 92.05 
pence has been applied for the purposes of this illustration.
2. The number of shares held by Simon Wassall fell short of the required total at the year-end by 1,738 shares, worth £1,600 at the average share price 
of 92.05 pence. Subsequent to the announcement of the results for the year ending 31 January 2016, Simon Wassall has indicated his intention to 
purchase the number of shares needed to meet the shareholding requirement.

year at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the rules of the CSOP. The options with 
the extended performance period did not meet the performance criterion on 31 January 2016 and therefore lapsed.  
124,822 options were issued in 2013 under the CSOP and were subject to a three-year performance period. The options failed to meet the 
performance criterion at 31 January 2016 and therefore lapsed.
2. 250,000 options were issued in 2008 under the CSOP and were subject to a three-year performance condition. The options failed to vest at the

Audit Committee Report
For the year ended 31 January 2016
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee Report for 2016, the purpose of which is to give shareholders an overview of the operation 
and scope of the Committee’s function and to report on its activities undertaken over the past year. 
Members and meetings 
The members of the Committee during the year were myself as Chairman, David Bezem and Kevin Thomas. I reported after each 
Committee meeting to the Board on the principal matters discussed, to ensure that all Directors were kept informed of our work. I also 
made myself available to any Director who wished to discuss particular items in greater detail.
Our terms of reference require that we meet at least twice a year with the Group’s senior financial management and the External 
Auditor to review the interim and annual financial statements, the accounting policies of the Group, its internal control procedures and 
compliance with accounting standards. In addition, we review forthcoming regulatory changes and proposed standards to assess their 
impact on the Group. Our terms of reference can be found within the Investors section of the Group’s website.
The Audit Committee met three times during the year to 31 January 2016, with full attendance at each meeting. The Chairman of the 
Board, the Group Finance Director and senior financial management were also often invited and regularly attended.
During the year, we have:
• reviewed the financial statements and financial reporting judgements contained within those statements for the Group and any formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance
• reviewed the Group’s internal control system, risk controls and the viability statement
• reviewed the reports and recommendations from the Group’s internal audit function
• made ourselves available to hear any concerns from staff, in line with the Group’s whistleblowing policy
• monitored the independence and objectivity of the External Auditor
• reported to the Board any matters requiring its attention
• reviewed the external audit plan, discussed the findings of the FY16 audit and reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process
• reviewed the key accounting judgements and estimates related to the financial statements
Annual Report review
We have considered whether the Annual Report for the year ended 31 January 2016 is fair, balanced and understandable and whether it 
provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy. We 
focused on the significant issues related to the financial statements, including the presentation of the key accounting judgements and 
estimates, which are considered below. We also challenged the consistency of accounting policies with those presented in the financial 
statements and considered whether the words in the Strategic Report reflected the performance of the Group fairly. In forming its 
conclusion, the Committee also considered the overall governance process in place for the preparation and review of the Annual Report 
and financial statements. These include:
• management of the overall governance process, which is performed by the Group’s senior financial management, who have appropri-
ate skill, experience and qualifications in preparing and delivering such reporting
• the completion of a detailed disclosure template by each component of the Group, the design of which is governed by the Group’s 
senior financial management
• comprehensive reviews performed at different levels of management to ensure consistency and balance
• the setting of a review timetable well in advance and that permits sufficient time for such review, including any resulting challenge and 
resolution of matters
• preliminary reviews of the draft Annual Report by the Group Board.
Overall, we considered that as a whole the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.
Significant issues related to the financial statements
The Audit Committee pays particular attention to significant issues in relation to the financial statements and how they are addressed. 
The significant issues are important by virtue of their impact on the Group’s results and the remuneration of senior management.
The following significant issues, including critical accounting judgements and estimates, were considered by the Committee. These issues 
are further described within note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of goodwill
The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill by reviewing an impairment test report prepared by management. The report 
outlined the value in use calculated for each of the Group’s cash-generating units. It was noted that the assumptions applied were  54 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
consistent with the long-term strategic plan approved by the Board. The Committee also challenged the audit work undertaken to assess 
those assumptions.
The Committee was satisfied that the assumptions applied were appropriate, sufficiently disclosed within the notes to the financial 
statements, and the carrying value of goodwill supportable.
Revenue recognition
Judgement applied in respect of recognition of revenue is significant in two key areas: cut-off and presentation of temporary recruitment 
fees and cumulative revenue generated by fixed price contract work. The revenue generated by the latter is recognised on a percentage 
completion basis.
The Committee discussed and reviewed these areas with management before concluding that the Group’s revenue for the year has been 
appropriately recognised.
Bad and doubtful debts
Recoverability of trade receivables and accrued income is a key area of focus given the material nature of these balances and the working 
capital needs of the Group. The debt profile of the Group covers a high volume of balances from a considerable number of customers. 
Management must therefore apply judgement in determining the amount of provision required for possible non-collection of bad or 
doubtful debts. This is performed on a case-by-case basis across the Group taking into account differences between countries and 
service lines.
The Committee assessed the appropriateness of the provisioning by considering the level and ageing of debtors and accrued income, 
the consistency of provisioning assumptions year-on-year and past experience of bad debt exposure. The Committee concluded that the 
level of provisioning and carrying value of trade receivables and accrued income is appropriate.
Disposal of subsidiaries
During the financial year, the Group disposed of its German telecommunications outsourcing business Nash Technologies GmbH and its 
two fully owned subsidiaries, Nash Technologies Stuttgart GmbH and Nash Innovations GmbH (“NT Group”). The NT Group was involved 
in software development of a wireless solution for the automotive and rail sectors with the disposal allowing for refocus on the Group’s 
core recruitment services. Management prepared an accounting position paper on the disposal that was presented to the Committee 
for their review. The Committee discussed and reviewed the disposal accounting with management before concluding this had been 
appropriately recognised and disclosed.
External audit
The Committee undertook a full tender of the external audit contract following the announcement of the 2014 year-end results. Deloitte 
LLP was appointed as the Group’s External Auditor at the Annual General Meeting on 2 July 2015 effective for the year ended 31 January 
2016. The Committee has considered and recommends to the Board and shareholders, the reappointment, remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the External Auditor, Deloitte LLP, for the year ended 31 January 2017. The lead audit partner is subject to mandatory 
rotation every five years.
Monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit
Following their first year of tenure, we assessed the effectiveness and quality of the external audit provided by Deloitte. The Committee 
sought feedback from management across the Group and challenged Deloitte on its risk assessment during the audit planning process 
and subsequent reporting thereof. The Committee members also made themselves available to hold private discussions with Deloitte 
regarding the quality of the external audit process. Based on this evidence, we are satisfied with the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
external audit process.
The Committee is required to monitor the independence and objectivity of Deloitte as External Auditor. Representation was reconfirmed 
by Deloitte and the external audit partner at the commencement of the planning process. We shall continue to monitor the independence 
and objectivity of Deloitte, which extends to the provision of non-audit services.
Provision of non-audit services
The Audit Committee has a policy that governs the extent of non-audit services provided by the External Auditor. This requires a 
competitive tendering process for significant non-audit services other than routine tax and compliance services, and precludes the 
External Auditor from providing certain services such as valuation work or the provision of accounting services.
In addition, we have set a limit on the value of non-audit services that may be provided by the External Auditor, being 30% of the audit 
fee, without prior consideration and written authorisation by the Audit Committee. An analysis of the fees paid to Deloitte LLP can be 
found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  / 55

The Committee is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of the Group’s internal audit function. This includes setting the scope of the 
annual internal audit plan, review of internal audit reports, consideration of findings and identification of issues for further investigation 
and reassessment of risk. We also review the resources and effectiveness of the function. We are satisfied with the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function.
We approved the internal audit plan for the year. The scope of the plan was focused on key risk areas identified by the Committee, both 
financial and commercial.
The findings of two internal audit reviews were reported to us this year, covering our operations in the Netherlands and the Nordic 
region. Additionally, follow-up reviews were performed at two previously audited operations, Belgium and Talent-IT. While areas for 
improvement were identified, no significant weaknesses were highlighted.
Internal controls and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal control including financial controls. The Audit Committee has robustly 
assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls in mitigating the principal risks faced by the Group. These have been designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to meet business objectives. The systems of internal control can only provide reasonable, 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board has an ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage the principal risks faced by the Group, details of which can be found 
on pages 15 to 17. This was in place throughout the financial year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and financial 
statements. This process is regularly reviewed by the Board in accordance with the FRC Internal Control Revised Guidance for Directors. 
The Board reviews annually the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems. No significant failings or weaknesses 
were identified. 
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee provides a facility for employees to raise issues, which may be disclosed confidentially if requested. An independent 
person is assigned to promptly investigate any matters raised, with findings reported to the appropriate management team and escalated 
to the Audit Committee and the Group’s internal audit function as appropriate. Any necessary corrective action or follow-up review is 
undertaken on a timely basis. 
The Audit Committee reviews the whistleblowing policy and arrangements in place annually.
Audit Committee effectiveness
The Committee considered our effectiveness in discharging our duties throughout the financial year. We assessed the work we undertook 
during the financial year, within the context of our terms of reference and latest best practice. In conjunction with the Board effectiveness 
review referred to on page 29, we concluded that our performance against these criteria remained effective.
Ian Davies
Audit Committee Chairman 56 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in 
Respect of the Annual Report
For the year ended 31 January 2016
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law) including FRS 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable infor-
mation
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information nec-
essary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 27 April 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:
Richard Ashcroft
Group Finance Director HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  / 57
Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Harvey Nash Group PLC
Opinion on 
financial 
statements of 
Harvey Nash 
Group plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 January 2016 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the related notes 1 to 
32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes 1 to 14 to the Parent Company Financial 
Statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial 
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Going concern 
and the Directors’ 
assessment of the 
principal risks that 
would threaten 
the solvency or 
liquidity of the 
group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the 
going concern basis of accounting contained within note 2(b) to the financial statements and the Directors’ 
statement on the longer-term viability of the group contained within the Principal risks section of the Strategic 
Report on page 17. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 10 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 15 to 17 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or 
mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in 2(b) to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements;
• the Director’s explanation on page 17 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify 
any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm 
that we are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in 
those standards.
Our assessment of 
risks of material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
As part of our audit of the Group, in addition to substantive tests, we also evaluate the design and implementation 
of internal controls over financial reporting in each of the risk areas. 58 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Debtor and accrued income recoverability
Refer to page 53 (Audit Committee Report), page 74 
(critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty) and note 13, page 83 (financial 
statement disclosures)
As per note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, 
trade receivables were £107.0m as at 31 January 2016 
(2015: £80.4m) and the provision applied to this was 
£0.7m (2015: £0.4m). The provisioning policy in relation to 
debtors is detailed in note 2(k) to the financial statements. 
Accrued income and prepayments at the year-end date 
was £18.6m (2015: £36.6m). 
The recoverability of trade debtors, accrued income and 
the level of provisions for bad debts are considered to 
be a significant risk due to the size of these balances and 
the importance of cash collection as part of the working 
capital management of the business. Whilst historically 
the Group has not recorded a material level of bad debt 
write-offs, judgement is required to estimate the level of 
bad debt provision based on the individual circumstances 
of customers.
We have:
• challenged management regarding the level and ageing of debtors and 
accrued income, by assessing recoverability with reference to cash 
received in respect of debtors and cash received and billings raised 
against accrued income;
• in selected locations, issued and received debtors confirmations from 
the third party debtors selected for testing;
• challenged the application of the provisioning approach with reference 
to the post year-end developments for aged debt throughout the Group;
• considered the Group’s experience of bad debt exposure with reference 
to the individual counterparty risk, the level of provision held by other 
recruitment businesses and the general economic environment in each 
jurisdiction; and
• critically assessed the recoverability of overdue unprovided debt and 
aged accrued income with reference to historical levels of bad debt 
expense and the credit profile of counterparties.
Goodwill impairment
Refer to pages 53 and 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 
73 (critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty) and note 11, page 82 (financial 
statement disclosures)
As per note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, 
the total value of goodwill held by the Group at 31 January 
2016 is £49.7m (2015: £48.7m). This goodwill has arisen 
based on historical acquisitions and the increase in the 
goodwill held in the year is solely due to the movement in 
foreign exchange rates.
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill, as 
described in note 11, involves considerable judgement 
due to the challenges in accurately forecasting future cash 
flows given the market environment for global recruitment 
businesses. Key assumptions in management’s analysis 
include the identification of cash generating units, short- 
and long-term growth rates and the discount rate applied 
to the future cash flows.
 
We tested management’s assumptions used in their impairment 
assessment of the Group’s goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Our procedures included:
• assessing the identification of appropriate cash generating units;
• assessing the short-term cash flow projections against recent 
performance, historical forecasting accuracy and comparing the 
forecasts to external recruitment industry sources of data; 
• comparing the long-term forecasts against long-term economic growth 
rates from external data for each relevant jurisdiction; 
• comparing the discount rate applied against a recruitment industry 
comparator group as well as involving our internal valuation specialists 
to assess the key components of the discount rate calculation;
• evaluating the reasonableness of, and recalculating, the sensitivity 
assessment applied by management;
• performing further sensitivity analysis of our own on the cash generating 
units with the lowest headroom in the impairment model; and
• checking the arithmetical accuracy of the impairment model in the 
calculation of the recoverable amount.
In addition we have critically assessed the disclosures provided in note 11 
against the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of assets. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  / 59
Capitalisation of intangible fixed assets
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report) and page 
73 (critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty)
The Group disposed of the Nash Technologies business 
in Germany during the year. Prior to the disposal 
Nash Technologies capitalised costs relating to the 
development of software projects as intangible assets. 
There is significant judgement in determining whether this 
expenditure meets the strict capitalisation criteria set out 
in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
This has continued to be recognised as a risk of material 
misstatement, even though Nash Technologies was 
disposed of in the year, because if such costs were 
inappropriately capitalised they should have been 
recognised as an item of underlying operating expenditure 
in the Consolidated Income Statement rather than as 
part of the loss on disposal attributed to discontinued 
operations.
The carrying value of the intangible assets disposed of at 
the date of disposal was £3.8m (£1.7m was recognised on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 January 2015), 
and details can be found in note 32 of the financial 
statements.
In respect of capitalised costs relating to the development of software 
projects prior to the disposal of Nash Technologies, we have:
• gained an understanding of the projects that were in the process of 
development; and
• selected a sample of development costs that have been capitalised, 
assessed the nature of these costs, traced the costs to supporting 
invoice or contract and assessed the appropriateness of capitalisation 
against the requirements of IAS 38.
Revenue recognition 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 73 
(critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty) and note 5, page 74 (financial 
statement disclosures)
The key risks identified in respect of revenue recognition 
are:
• the valuation and completeness of accrued revenue 
in respect of contractor arrangements. Contractor 
revenue is the main revenue stream of the Group and 
significant judgement is required in the estimation of 
accrued revenue recognised in respect of missing and 
submitted but not approved timesheets at the period 
end; and
• the revenue derived from software development 
contracts. The revenue for these bespoke projects is 
recognised on the percentage completion basis. There 
is significant judgement in estimating the level of 
completion in relation to these projects and therefore 
the revenue that should be recognised. This revenue 
primarily relates to the Nash Technologies business. 
This continues to be a risk despite the disposal of the 
business as the revenue in Nash Technologies continues 
to be presented as part of the Consolidated Income 
Statement up to the date of disposal.
In relation to the valuation of contractor revenue accrued at the period 
end we have assessed the appropriateness of the proportion of revenue 
recognised from missing and submitted but not approved timesheets by:
• understanding and challenging management’s rationale for the 
proportion of revenue accrued by tracing sample items to evidence of 
submission and customer approval post period end;
• considering the appropriateness of the estimates made by management 
in previous periods with reference to the subsequent receipt or approval 
of timesheets accrued for at the prior year reporting date; and
• mechanically recalculating the accrued income estimate made by 
management.
• In relation to the revenue derived from software development we have 
obtained individual contracts and assessed the stage of completion at 
the date of disposal. We have assessed this by:
• discussing the progress of individual projects with the Project Managers 
responsible for their completion;
• obtaining evidence of the forecast costs to complete and reviewing this 
against historical performance;
• reviewing the sales projections prepared by management in relation to 
each project; and
• auditing the costs that have been incurred in the development of each 
project. 60 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Accounting for disposals and discontinued operations
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 73 
(critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty) and note 32, page 92 (financial 
statement disclosures)
The Group disposed of the Nash Technologies business in 
Germany in December 2015. The impact of this disposal 
has been presented as a loss from discontinued operations 
of £14.0 million in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
The Group has also recognised the closure of the Oil and 
Gas business in the UK as a discontinued operation with a 
loss of £0.4 million recorded.
There is judgement involved in the recognition of the loss 
on disposal, the costs associated with the disposal/closure 
as well as in the consideration of the appropriateness 
of presentation as discontinued operations in line with 
IFRS 5, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations, within note 32 to the financial statements.
The audit procedures we have completed in respect of this risk of material 
misstatement include:
• agreeing the terms of the transaction to underlying documentation 
including vouching the consideration to the Sale Purchase Agreement 
(“SPA”);
• assessing the carrying value of the net assets disposed of to ensure that 
the recorded loss on disposal for Nash Technologies and UK Oil and Gas 
business is accurate;
• reviewing management’s assessment of the fair value of the earn-out 
arrangement included in the SPA and the recoverability of the loan that 
was provided to the disposed of entity;
• recalculating the loss on disposal; and
• agreeing a sample of disposal related costs to supporting documentation. 
We also considered the appropriateness of the recognition as discontinued 
operations for both Nash Technologies and the UK Oil and Gas business 
and the associated disclosures in line with IFRS 5.
Accounting for disposals 
and discontinued 
operations is a new risk 
for the period under 
audit. 
In the 2015 Audit Report we defined an additional element within the revenue recognition risk of 
material misstatement. This related to the presentation of temporary contractual arrangements where 
Harvey Nash acts as a principal, and the revenue and directly associated costs are recognised and 
presented on a gross basis as opposed to a net basis. This was an assessment made in our first year of 
audit and as such it has not been included as a component of the risk of material misstatement for the 
year ending 31 January 2016. Whilst this is performed for any new contracts this is not considered to be 
a significant area of risk for the current period.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of 
materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We 
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £505,000 (2015: £490,000), which equates to 5% (2015: 
5%) of continuing operations profit before tax and non-recurring items. It is also below 1% (2015: 1%) of 
both revenue and equity. The increase in materiality is directly attributable to the increased underlying 
pre-tax profit for the Group. Pre-tax profit, excluding non-recurring items and discontinued operations, 
has been chosen for the basis for materiality as this is the measure by which stakeholders and the market 
assess the wider performance of the entity. The non-recurring items are one-off restructuring costs 
relating to the strategic restructuring of the Group’s European operations and thus are excluded when 
determining materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in 
excess of £45,000 (2015: £45,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  / 61
An overview of the 
scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including 
Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that 
assessment there were various different levels of procedures applied to entities depending if they were 
subject to a full scope audit, specified audit procedures on specific financial statement line items or 
statutory audits only. We determined which components are subject to which scope based upon the 
financial significance and the specific account balances within each component. We performed full 
scope audit procedures in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands  and in the USA as we determined these 
components to be financial significant to the Group. In addition we performed audit procedures in 
Germany focussing on specific financial statement lines items associated with the Nash Technologies 
business. Our audit work at each location that was either full or limited scope for Group reporting was 
executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group 
materiality and ranged from £101,000 to £353,500 (2015: £98,000 to £345,000).
The components that were subject to full scope or limited scope audit procedures represented 88% 
(2015: 89%) of the Group’s revenue and 85% (2015: 86%) of the Group’s profit before tax attributed to 
continuing operations.
The Group audit team established a rotation programme of planned visits designed so that a senior 
member of the Group audit team visits all components that are full scope or subject to an audit of 
specific financial statement line procedures at least every two years. In the current year the Group audit 
team visited the UK, USA and the Netherlands. In 2015, in addition to these components we also visited 
Belgium, Germany and Vietnam. For those components that are not full scope or subject to specified 
procedures the audits are conducted in line with the Group timetable and a member of the Group team 
attends the concluding meetings for these components. 
Each component audit team is included in our detailed team briefing and the Group audit team 
participates in the component auditor risk assessment, reviews the documentation of the findings from 
their work and attends the component audit close meetings.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures 
to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account 
balances.
Opinion on other 
matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of 
explanations received 
and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising 
from these matters.
Corporate Governance 
Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We 
have nothing to report arising from our review. 62 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Our duty to read other 
information in the 
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We 
confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective 
responsibilities of 
Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard 
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General information
Harvey Nash Group PLC (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”) is a leading provider of specialist recruitment and outsourcing 
solutions. The Group has offices in the United Kingdom, Europe, United States, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Vietnam.
The Company is a public listed company incorporated in the United Kingdom. Its registered address is 110 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 
4AY and its listing is on the London Stock Exchange.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied across the Group in both years presented. 
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Harvey Nash Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on 
a going concern basis, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair 
value through profit or loss. 
The main section of these financial statements presents the financial statements of the Group prepared under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union. In line with the relevant accounting standards, the results for the year 
ended 31 January 2015 have been re-presented to show separately the comparative impact of discontinued operations included in the 
year ended 31 January 2016. Pages 96 to 100 show the financial statements of the parent Company prepared under Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 (FRS 101). The Parent Company adopted FRS 101 in the current reporting period in accordance with the FRC revision 
to the UK Financial Reporting Standards and restated the comparatives which were previously prepared under UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). There were no significant adjustments to either total comprehensive income or equity as a result of the 
adoption of FRS 101. 
(i) New and amended standards, adopted by the Group
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted:
• Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011–2013 Cycle
These changes have no material impact on the consolidated result, financial position or cash flows of the Group. 
(ii) New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective and, in some cases, had not yet been adopted by the EU:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
• IFRS 16 Leases
• Amendment to IFRS 11 on Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarifying Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• Amendments to IAS 1 for the Disclosure Initiative
• Amendment to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements on Use of Equity Method
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 for Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture 
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exemption
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012–2014 Cycle Amendments to: IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Opera-
tions, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
The Group intends to adopt the above in the relevant future accounting periods in which they become mandatory, subject to endorsement 
by the EU where relevant. 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of 
the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 may have an impact on both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments, 
IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures and IFRS 16 will have an impact on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 
until a detailed review has been completed, this will be completed in the year ending 31 January 2017. 68 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(b) Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Corporate Governance Report on page 31. 
(c) Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements consolidate the results of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 January each 
year and are based on the consistent accounting policies disclosed herein.
Interests acquired in subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date on which control passes to the Group. They are deconsolidated 
from the date on which control ceases. Transactions and balances, including unrealised profits, between Group companies are eliminated 
on consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated as the difference 
between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous 
carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. The costs associated 
with disposal have also been included in total costs of disposal. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 
relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. 
reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs).
(d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the supply of services, net of value added tax, 
rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. 
The Group derives its revenue in the contract services and interim businesses on a time and materials basis. It is recognised as services 
are rendered as validated by receipt of a client-approved timesheet or equivalent. Where the Group is acting as a principal, turnover 
represents amounts billed for the services, inclusive of the remuneration costs of the workers. 
For fixed price development work, revenue is recognised on the percentage completion basis, using pre-specified milestones or a client 
sign-off to trigger revenue recognition and the estimate of profit.
Revenue arising from permanent placements is recognised on acceptance of the candidate or on start date, subject to the contractual 
agreement. Provision is made for the expected cost of obligations where employees do not work for the specified contractual period.
Executive recruitment and assignment fees are recognised as services are provided, typically in three stages: retainer, shortlist and 
placement fee. Provision is made for the expected cost of obligations where employees do not work for the specified contractual period. 
Revenue anticipated, but not invoiced at the balance sheet date, is accrued on the balance sheet as accrued income. Revenue invoiced 
but not earned at the balance sheet date is recorded as a liability as deferred income.
(e) Investments
Investments in associated undertakings (“associated companies”) are stated at the amount of the Group’s share of net assets.
(f) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, 
plant and equipment is their purchase cost together with any incidental costs of acquisition. 
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets (excluding motor vehicles), less their estimated residual values, on a 
straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Leasehold improvements   term of the lease
Furniture, fixtures and equipment  5 years 
Office equipment    5 years
Computer equipment   3 years
Motor vehicles    25% reducing balance HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / 69
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying 
amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater. The gain or loss on disposal 
or retirement of an item of plant, property or equipment is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment purchased to deliver outsourcing projects, which have been recharged to clients at cost, remain the legal 
property of the Group. The cost of the asset is capitalised within current assets and charged to cost of sales over the contract length. 
(g) Foreign exchange
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling 
which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies in each company are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the reporting period date. 
On consolidation, revenues, costs and cash flows of overseas undertakings are included in the Group income statement at average rates 
of exchange for the period. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date and any differences arising are recognised in equity. When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative 
amount previously recognised in equity in respect of that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity on consolidation.
(h) Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet 
as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expense and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Rentals payable under operating lease are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentive 
benefits are recognised as a reduction in rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
(i) Intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of 
the acquired subsidiary at the date of the acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the future cash flows of the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Development costs are capitalised as an intangible asset in accordance with the requirements of IAS 38 Intangible Assets. An intangible 
asset is recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group. Only 
costs directly incurred in relation to a development project are capitalised. This includes the cost of internal labour, which is captured via 
appropriately approved timesheets. Amortisation of the intangible asset commences at the point the underlying product is commissioned 
for use. An impairment review is performed at each balance sheet date until the product is commissioned. Amortisation is charged on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated lifespan of the product. The estimated lifespan is reviewed regularly for appropriateness.
Other intangible assets, which are acquired separately or through a business combination, are stated at cost or fair value respectively, 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised from the date the asset 
is available for use, and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life, between 1 and 20 years. The 
Group does not have any assets, other than goodwill, with infinite useful lives. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement.  70 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(j) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
All assets are tested annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of sale and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). 
Where an impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the original carrying value prior to any impairment charges. 
(k) Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the Group’s contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the Group transfers 
substantially all the risks and reward of the financial asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised from the Group’s balance sheet when the 
obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Financial assets 
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as “loans and receivables”. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial. For trade receivables, generally this results in recognition at nominal value less any allowance for doubtful 
debts.
Financial assets which are not classified as loans and receivables are classified as ‘‘fair value through the profit and loss” (“FVTPL”). Financial 
assets at FVTPL are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose 
of selling in the short term or such designation would eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency that 
would otherwise arise. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either FVTPL or “other financial liabilities”. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is held for 
trading or specifically designated as such to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the 
profit and loss. 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield 
basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life 
of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. 
(l) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash-in-hand and deposits that can be withdrawn as cash without giving any notice and without suffering any penalty. 
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to insignificant risk of changes in value.
(m) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the 
consideration paid is deductible from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or 
disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
(n) Tax 
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by 
the balance sheet date.  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / 71
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with 
such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against 
which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in 
the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
(o) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
(p) Employee benefits
Pension obligations
Wherever possible the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, under which the Group pays fixed contributions into 
separate entities. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. Pension costs are charged to the income 
statement in the year in which they arise. In Belgium and Switzerland, legislation requires the operation of pension schemes that contain 
an element of defined benefit, the obligations under which are fully insured and there are no unrecorded liabilities. These schemes are 
accounted for as defined contribution schemes. 
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or when an employee accepts 
voluntary redundancy in exchange for benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to 
terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal.
Bonus plan
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses when contractually obliged.
Share-based plans
The Group’s management awards certain employees share options on a discretionary basis. The options are subject to three-year vesting 
conditions and their fair value is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in retained earnings over the 
vesting period. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium 
when the options are exercised. For options exercised against own shares held, the shares are removed from the own shares held reserve. 
The Group has applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to all instruments granted after 7 November 2002 but not fully vested as at 1 January 
2005 and has adopted the Black-Scholes model for the purposes of computing “fair value”. Deferred tax is also provided based upon the 
expected future tax deductions relating to share-based payment transactions and is recognised over the vesting period of the schemes 
concerned. 
(q) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a present obligation exists as the result of a past event and it is probable that this will result in an outflow 
of economic benefit, the size of which can be reliably estimated. Discounting is applied only when the effect is material.
(r) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are written off as incurred or, in the case of initial arrangement fees, may be spread over the term of the facility where 
appropriate. Invoice discounting fees are recognised as incurred. 72 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(s) Working capital facilities
The Group has access to working capital finance facilities provided by its bankers in the form of a confidential trade receivables finance 
facility which is secured by a floating charge over the Group’s assets. The borrowings under this are included within current liabilities 
and described as borrowings on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and the facility is secured specifically against the Group’s trade 
receivables. Trade receivables are included within trade receivables in the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(t) Discontinued and non-recurring items
Material discontinued and non-recurring items are presented separately on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement due to their nature 
and/or size with further information included in the notes to the financial statements. The separate reporting of such items helps to provide a 
better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance as it enables shareholders to see the results of the ongoing trading operations. 
 
3. Financial risk management
Financing
The Group’s principal financial instruments are invoice discounting, overdrafts, cash and short-term deposits. The Group has other 
financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. Acquisitions are financed 
through a mixture of operating cash flow and equity. Working capital finance for day-to-day requirements is provided through operating 
cash generation, invoice discounting facilities and small short-term overdraft facilities. Where applicable, funds are then made available 
for the financing of the Group’s subsidiaries through intercompany loans.
Objectives, policies and strategies
The most significant treasury exposures faced by the Group are raising finance, managing interest rates and currency positions as well as 
investing surplus cash in high-quality assets. The Board has established clear parameters, including levels of authority, on the type and use 
of financial instruments to manage these exposures. Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures and cannot 
be viewed as speculative.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital 
for the Group. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. During 2016, the Group’s strategy, which was unchanged 
from 2015, was to have adequate headroom and access to cash facilities to meet its requirements.

Net debt £’000 - -
Total equity £’000 54,118 64,598
Total capital £’000 54,118 64,598
Gearing ratio % - -
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s policy is to minimise interest charges through cash pooling and active cash management. The Group does not actively hedge 
interest rate risk.
Market risk and foreign exchange risk management
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The 
Group’s policy is to minimise foreign currency risk. The Group manages its exposure on equity investments in overseas subsidiaries 
through foreign currency borrowings. The currency risk of holding assets and liabilities in foreign currencies across the Group is managed 
by partially matching foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities. The Group does not actively hedge foreign exchange risk.
The Group’s operating profit exposure to foreign currency translation is primarily in respect of the US dollar and the euro.
In the year to 31 January 2016, if sterling had strengthened by 10% against the euro with all other variables held constant, operating profit 
for the year would have been £534,000 (2015: £619,000) lower.

Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers 
with an appropriate credit history and historically there are low levels of debt write-off throughout the Group. Trade receivables consist 
of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. The Group does not have any significant credit 
risk exposure to a single customer. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / 73

Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and committed credit facilities. Management monitors rolling 
forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (comprising undrawn borrowing facility, cash and invoice discounting) on the basis of expected 
cash flow. All borrowings are short term. The Group’s main discounting facility is a rolling facility and was most recently renewed in 
February 2016. 
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial 
statements are as follows. 
Critical accounting judgements 
Capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets
In the prior year, the Group commenced software development of a wireless solution for the automotive and rail sectors during the 
year. Cumulative direct costs of £2.1m (2015: £1.7m) incurred by the project were capitalised as an intangible asset. Management must 
apply judgement in determining the appropriateness of direct costs incurred, particularly own labour costs, when capitalising these as an 
intangible asset.
Disposal of subsidiary
The Group disposed of its interest in the German telecommunications outsourcing business during the year. The Group was involved in 
software development of a wireless solution for the automotive and rail sectors with the disposal allowing for refocus on the Group’s 
core recruitment services. The disposal has been accounted for as a discontinued operation within these financial statements. The key 
judgements relate to management’s estimate of the deferred consideration which has been valued at £nil and the recoverability of the 
commercial loan of €2.3m. Further details are set out in note 32.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether the goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. These include forward-looking forecasts which are 
inherently judgemental. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 January 2016 was £49.7m (2015: £48.7m). The key assumptions in the 
value in use calculations are set out in note 11.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Revenue recognition
Judgement applied in respect of recognition of revenue is significant in two key areas: cut-off and presentation of temporary recruitment 
fees and cumulative revenue generated by fixed price contract work. The revenue generated by the latter is recognised on a percentage 
completion basis which is based on management’s best estimate of utilisation at the reporting date. 74 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Carrying value of trade receivables 
Recoverability of trade receivables and accrued income is a key area of focus given the material nature of these balances and the working 
capital needs of the Group. The debt profile of the Group covers a high volume of balances from a considerable number of customers. 
Management must therefore apply judgement in determining the amount of provision required to be made for possible non-collection 
of bad or doubtful debts. This is performed on a case-by-case basis across the Group taking into account differences between countries 
and service lines. The carrying value of receivables is set out in note 13. The judgement in respect of the provision is based on the 
individual circumstances of the customer. 
5. Segment information
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires disclosure of information about the Group’s operating segments. It requires a management approach 
under which segment information is presented on a similar basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. The chief operating decision-
maker in the business has been identified as the Group Board. Services provided by each reportable segment are permanent recruitment, 
contracting and outsourcing.
The Group Board analyses segmental information as follows.

The deferred tax asset recognised for accrued interest charges relates to Group interest charges payable by the US business. Deferred 
tax assets relating to post-employment liabilities were disposed of as part of the disposal of Nash Technologies. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will 
be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which they are realised. The 
rates enacted or substantively enacted by the United Kingdom Government for the relevant periods of reversal are 23% and 20% as at 
31 January 2016.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. The Group has two categories of potential dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise 
price is less than the average price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year, and deferred consideration shares to be issued.

During the year, the goodwill in respect of each CGU was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. All were 
assessed to have a value in use in excess of their respective carrying values, and hence no adjustments to goodwill were considered necessary.
In the current year, the Impact Executives Limited CGU was aggregated with the Techpartners CGU to reflect the operational structure of the 
business units. Both are UK-based businesses and are viewed as one CGU by management as the operational structures have aligned over time. 
The assumptions applied in the impairment review are consistent with those applied within the Group’s long-term plan, approved by 
management and the Group Board. The assumptions are based on latest industry forecasts and the expectations of management given 
their past experience. The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were as follows.
The first five years of the forecasts were based on post-tax cash flows derived from the management and Group Board approved long-
term plan. The growth rate applied to these cash flows varied between (42.5)% and 115.8%. 115.8% relates to Bjerke &Luther AS in 2017, 
with the CGU forecast to return to profitability. The decline of 42.5% is expected in Beaumont KK due to investment in 2017 before a 
return to growth.
The growth rates of the larger CGUs are listed below.
Cash-generating unit Average growth rate in first five years Long-term growth rate
2016 2015 2016 2015
Techpartners Group 8.0% 6.2% 2.1% 2.4%
Harvey Nash US 6.3% 11.0% 2.0% 2.6%
Alumni 10.0% 7.8% 2.1% 2.4%
Harvey Nash BV 8.6% 5.7% 2.1% 2.0%
Talent-IT BVBA 5.0% 2.5% 1.5% 1.2%
Harvey Nash IT Consulting NV 5.5% 1.7% 1.5% 1.2%
The terminal growth rate is based on the long-term growth rate for each country and was on average 2.4%. Management believe the 
forecasts are achievable.
The post-tax discount rate used was based on the industry-weighted average cost of capital for each country and was on average 10.6% 
(2015: 10.1%). The pre-tax discount rate is on average 13.3% (2015: 12.8%). HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / 83
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of the CGUs. This has been based on changes in key 
assumptions considered by management to be reasonably possible including a 10% decrease in the assumed growth rates and a 10% 
increase in the assumed weighted average cost of capital. The analysis reveals that no impairment would arise under each scenario apart 
from in Harvey Nash BV, which has headroom of £1.6m but an immaterial impairment would arise at a 10% decrease in growth rates or 
10% increase in weighted average cost of capital.

22. Share-based payments
Under the Harvey Nash 2005 Company Share Option Plan (CSOP), the Remuneration Committee can grant options over shares in the 
Company to employees of the Company. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under 
option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years. Awards under the CSOP are open to all full-time employees 
except those who have had a material interest in the Group in the previous 12 months. 
Options granted under the CSOP will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the growth in earnings 
per share over that period exceeding the compounded annual growth in the Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) by 3% per annum. Options were 
valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. 
A reconciliation of option movements over the year to 31 January 2016 is shown below.

The CSOP share options in relation to the Directors failed to meet the performance criterion and therefore lapsed at 31 January 2016. This 
is detailed within the Remuneration Report on page 36. There were no share options exercised during the year. The options outstanding 
at 31 January 2016 had a weighted average exercise price of £0.62, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of one year. 
There was no charge in the year relating to employee share-based payment plans (2015: £17,000). The inputs into the Black-Scholes 
model are as follows.
2016 2015
Weighted average share price - 6.03p
Weighted average exercise price - 6.06p
Expected volatility - 44.0%
Expected life - 3 years
Risk-free rate - 4.3%

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / 87

may be invited to join earlier at the discretion of the Directors. The Group contributes 5% and the employee contributes 3% of the 
employee’s basic earnings (excluding bonuses) to the Plan. The Group’s total contribution to the Plan for the year ended 31 January 2016

Provisions relate to an onerous lease in the Norwegian business. In the prior year, there were £0.2m of French closure costs included.
All provisions fall due within one year.
30. Non-recurring items 
Non-recurring items of £0.2m were incurred in the year (2015: £0.7m). The non-recurring items predominantly related to the settlement 
of deferred consideration for the Talent-IT acquisition. Deferred consideration of £2.0m had been recognised as at 31 January 2015 in 
respect of the estimated consideration due on completion of the earn-out period which commenced on acquisition of Talent-IT. The 
non-recurring element represents the excess consideration payable over the previously recognised deferred consideration. 
  92 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The prior year non-recurring items included £0.5m in respect of restructuring the Norwegian operations. £0.2m was incurred in the UK in 
respect of acquisition cost of Beaumont KK. The current year tax credit as a result of the non-recurring items was £nil (2015: £40,000).
31. Business combinations
In the prior year, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Beaumont KK, a recruitment business in Tokyo, Japan, for an initial 
cash consideration of JPY 61,163,000 (£0.4m). The deferred consideration arrangements require the Group to pay the former owners 
of Beaumont KK based on a multiple of profit before tax, over threshold performance, for the three years ending August 2017 up to a 
maximum of JPY 81,077,000 (£0.5m). 
There was no change during the current year to the fair value of the net assets acquired as reported in the prior year Annual Report. 
The excess of consideration above net asset values has been attributed in full to goodwill as no other intangible assets have been 
identified. 
Details of the net assets acquired and the goodwill recognised were as follows.

Nash Technologies
On 6 December 2015, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of the German telecommunications outsourcing business 
Nash Technologies GmbH (“NT”) and its two fully owned subsidiaries, Nash Technologies Stuttgart GmbH (“NTS”) and Nash Innovations 
GmbH (“NI”), “NT Group”. On the disposal date, full control passed to the acquirer. 
The initial consideration for the sale of the NT Group was €27,600 with possible further earn-out consideration dependent upon the 
financial performance of the NT Group for the financial years 2016 to 2020, which has a maximum cap of €9.0m but has been fair valued 
as £nil. The sales and purchase agreement provided for a loan to Nash Technologies of £1.75m (€2.3m), which is not repayable in the 
next 12 months. At 31 January 2016, Nash Technologies had not drawn down against this facility. There has been no provision recognised 
against this long-term receivable at 31 January 2016. 
Nash Technologies had previously been reported under the Mainland Europe segment.  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / 93

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is given on 
page 8. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 12 to 25 of the 
consolidated financial statements. 
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (“FRS 100”) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Accordingly, in the year ended 31 January 2016, the Company has changed its accounting framework from UK 
GAAP to Financial Reporting Standard 101 (“FRS 101”) as issued by the Financial Reporting Council and has, in doing so, applied the 
requirements of IFRS 1.6–33 and related appendices. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. There were no material adjustments to total comprehensive income 
or equity upon restatement. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, which is generally based on the fair value of the consideration 
given in exchange for the goods and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
business combinations, share-based payment, non-current assets held for sale, financial instruments, capital management, presentation 
of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment 
of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Group accounts.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. For 
further information please refer to the note on going concern in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 68.
2. Critical judgement areas and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimations of the investments’ values in 
use. The value in use calculations require the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and suitable 
discount rates in order to calculate present values which are inherently judgemental and complex in calculation. The carrying amount of 
investments in subsidiaries at the balance sheet date was £53.1m with no impairment loss recognised in 2015 or 2016.
3. Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements of Harvey Nash Group PLC are consistent with those presented herein.
 (a) Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
(b) Taxation
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
(c) Investments 
Investments held as fixed assets are shown at cost less provision for impairment. Impairment reviews are conducted annually and 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of sale and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).  HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / 99
(d) Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
4. Investments

The Directors believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by their underlying net assets. 
The carrying value of the investments was tested against discounted future cash flows during the year. The forecasts were based on post-
tax cash flows derived from approved budgets for FY16–FY17. Management believe the forecasts are reasonably achievable. Where the 
future cash flows could not support the carrying value, an impairment would be recognised.

In this Report, the term “underlying” indicates the amount has been adjusted for the effects of currency translation and acquisitions and disposals; in the case of proﬁts, the amount is also stated
before goodwill amortisation and operating exceptional items. Some ﬁgures and ratios mentioned in this Report are not readily available from the ﬁnancial information and details of how these ﬁgures
and ratios have been arrived at are set out on page 82 and in the Financial review.
During 2002, Tomkins plc changed its accounting reference date from 30 April to 31 December. The comparative ﬁgures in this Report are therefore for the eight-month accounting period from 
1 May 2002 to 31 December 2002. Unless otherwise stated, the commentary in this Report compares results for the 368 day period from 1 January 2003 to 3 January 2004 (“2003”) with unaudited

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
(2002: non operating exceptional income 
of £4.1 million) including a £72.9 million
charge in relation to our exit from the
valves, taps and mixers businesses.
The net interest charge was £8.4 million
(2002: net interest income of £0.6 million)
and proﬁt before taxation was £132.4
million (2002: £237.0 million).
A tax credit for the year of £47.5 million
arose due to an exceptional release 
of £90.7 million from the other tax
provisions following a comprehensive
review of potential tax exposures of the
Group. For 2004 we estimate the effective
tax rate will return to around 30 per cent. 
Basic earnings per share were 18.5
pence (2002: 18.9 pence). 
Dividend 
The Board has recommended a ﬁnal
dividend of 7.4 pence per share, which,
together with the interim dividend of 4.6
pence per share paid on 10 November
2003, brings the total dividends for the
year to 12.0 pence per share. This is the
same as the total dividends paid in respect
of our last twelve-month accounting 
period ending on 30 April 2002.
Our good cash ﬂow enables us to
maintain our dividend and we anticipate
reviewing the level of our dividend
payments this year as and when the 
hoped for improvement in operating
earnings comes through.
The ﬁnal dividend, if approved at the
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 
1 June 2004 to shareholders on the register
at 30 April 2004. The Board has decided 
to offer the Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
in respect of this ﬁnal dividend.
In 2003, we achieved a creditable ﬁnancial
performance at the same time as we
prepared the Group for what, we hope,
will be better times ahead in some of 
our markets. All our people have shown
tremendous enthusiasm and commitment
towards achieving the strategic initiatives
set out in our last Report and Accounts 
and expanded upon by our Chief
Executive, Jim Nicol, in his review. 
In particular, we have been focusing 
upon the ﬁve elements that will most
impact growth in the economic value 
of the Group, namely the building of an
entrepreneurial culture, the development
of new technologies and products,
achieving manufacturing excellence,
expanding internationally and making
value-creating acquisitions.
Overview of 2003 results 
In 2003, reported sales were £3,150.4
million (2002: £3,245.4 million) and
operating proﬁt (before operating
exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation) was £271.8 million (2002:
£288.8 million). Operating proﬁt from
continuing operations, before goodwill
amortisation in 2003 was £246.0 million
(2002: £237.3 million).
The signiﬁcant weakness of the US
dollar adversely affected our reported
sterling sales and operating proﬁt (before
operating exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation) by £208.9 million and 
£20.2 million respectively.
Operating exceptional items before
taxation were £35.9 million (2002: £46.1
million). Non operating exceptional
charges before taxation were £83.2 million
Corporate governance
We place great importance in ensuring 
that we have the checks and balances to
provide shareholders with comfort about
our long-term future. The structure of your
Board ensures that we have the highest
standards of corporate governance, which
has been acknowledged during the year by
third party commentators such as the NAPF
and Euromoney. The transparency of our
reporting provides shareholders with a
clear understanding of the Group’s results
and prospects. We have a conservative
financial culture that ensures our businesses
operate within a structure of strong
internal ﬁnancial controls. Our strong
balance sheet makes us resilient but also
ﬂexible to take advantage of opportunities
to make value-creating acquisitions. 
The Board
Tony Reading, who was a Director of the
Company from 1992, stood down from 
the Board on 31 December 2003. Tony,
aged 60, was based in the USA and was
responsible for Engineered & Construction
Products, Automotive Fluid Systems, Wiper
Systems and the automotive aftermarket
manufacturing companies. On behalf of
the Board, I would like to thank Tony for
his contribution to the Group and wish 
him well in his future endeavours.
People 
Tomkins people across all our operations
have responded with great enthusiasm and
commitment to the challenges placed upon
them by the level of change taking place
within their businesses. Their hard work has
been crucial in achieving the progress that
we have made this year and I thank them
for their considerable efforts.
Outlook 
The measures that we have taken during
the past three years to reduce costs and
improve efﬁciency will increasingly beneﬁt
the Group during 2004. There are signs 
of recovery in several of our markets,
particularly in the USA where the weaker
dollar is expected to stimulate further the
economy. Whilst this continued weakness
of the US dollar will affect our reported
sterling earnings, we expect a good
improvement in the underlying
performance of the Group during 2004.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
During 2003 we have made considerable
progress in a number of areas:
• We outperformed most of our 
principal markets.
• We continued our investment in
manufacturing excellence through our
programme of strategic manufacturing
initiatives and lean manufacturing.
• We initiated further investment in Asia
and China, building on our global reach.
• We acquired Stackpole to enhance 
further our position in the rapidly
growing outsourced market for
automotive powertrain systems and
components and have since invested 
to expand capacity to meet the 
growing demand in that business.
• We continued to encourage the
development of an entrepreneurial
culture with a focus on growth in value. 
• We progressed the disposals of 
non-core businesses.
• We achieved underlying growth 
in sales and operating proﬁt.
Our principal objective must be to 
achieve long term sustainable growth 
in the economic value of Tomkins through
strategic development of our businesses.
Through effective communication to 
the ﬁnancial markets, this translates 
into growth in equity value for our
shareholders. We describe “Managing 
for Value” on page 18.
We see the main drivers for growth 
in the intrinsic value as:
• improving our competitive advantage
through technology and innovation;
• proﬁtable growth in sales;
• increasing the cash margin; and
• investing where we can earn an 
after tax return in excess of our 
weighted average cost of capital.
All our businesses recognise the need 
for growth and are pursuing strategies
aimed at maximising their potential. 
We have previously outlined our plans 
to develop three of our business areas
where we see the greatest potential for
long term growth in value: the automotive
powertrain, the industrial and automotive
aftermarket and Air Systems Components.
Automotive powertrain
The automotive powertrain, which consists
of the engine, transmission and related
accessories, is currently a $150 billion 
global market, of which only approximately 
$30 billion or 20 per cent is currently
outsourced by automotive original
equipment manufacturers (“AOEs”) to
third party suppliers like Tomkins. This
compares with around 60 per cent for the
rest of the vehicle. 
The AOEs are seeking to reduce their
cost base by outsourcing more of the
powertrain and are embracing new
technologies and production techniques
that are being developed by suppliers. 
At the same time, global automotive
production is increasing and the overall
value of the powertrain is rising due to
ever stricter emission regulations and
consumer demands for performance 
and economy. These factors combine to
create a signiﬁcant increase in the size 
of the market for outsourced powertrain
components and systems. Through Gates
and our recent acquisition of Stackpole,
Tomkins is already a major player in this
market and we intend to participate 
fully in this future growth.
Industrial and automotive aftermarket 
The Group already has a signiﬁcant 
position in the North American industrial
and automotive aftermarket, supplying
products such as accessory drive and
synchronous belts, tensioners, wipers, high-
pressure hydraulic hoses and connectors
and other automotive accessories. We are
building upon this strength by increasing
sales of new products, adding products
manufactured by third parties and further
developing our rapidly growing presence 
in Europe and Asia.
Air Systems Components
Our Air Systems Components businesses 
are already the US market leaders in air
handling products for the commercial and 
“ALL OUR BUSINESSES RECOGNISE THE NEED
FOR GROWTH AND ARE PURSUING STRATEGIES
AIMED AT MAXIMISING THEIR POTENTIAL.”
JAMES NICOL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE residential markets. As well as participating
in the anticipated recovery in the US
commercial and industrial construction
market, we are seeking to make bolt-on
acquisitions that add new products or
markets to our existing US businesses. 
We intend to expand internationally,
particularly in Asia where we are in
discussions with a major US customer 
on a co-operative marketing effort.
Our ﬁve pervasive themes that
encapsulate the drivers that I believe 
will lead to growth in economic value are:
Building an entrepreneurial culture
We have introduced a new management
incentive scheme that more closely aligns
the interests of management with those

continued 
Senior Management Team (from left to right).

Components; Malcolm Swain, Vice President –

of shareholders. The new scheme bases
managers’ bonuses upon a percentage of
“Bonusable Proﬁt”, which is based upon
their businesses’ operating proﬁt, less tax,
and a charge for the capital invested in
their businesses (based upon the Group’s
weighted average cost of capital). This
moves individual managers’ focus from
performance measurement against an
arbitrary annual budget to the absolute
performance of their business and year 
on year improvement. Salaries are ﬁxed 
in real terms and bonuses will only rise 
if absolute performance improves. The
scheme included around 30 senior
managers during 2003 and has been
extended to approximately 50 additional
individuals for 2004. 5 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
People development is key to achieving our
goals and therefore we have initiated the
Tomkins College, in conjunction with the
University of Indiana in the USA. The
College will focus upon ensuring that all
our management teams have the necessary
and most up-to-date skill sets to enable
them to optimise their own and their
businesses’ performance. 
Developing innovative products
All our businesses realise that product
innovation is key to maintaining the
competitive advantage that allows them 
to grow their businesses. Progress in this
area is monitored closely on a quarterly
basis. Examples include the following:
• In Industrial & Automotive, the
electromechanical drive “stop-start”
technology using our patented belts 
and tensioners goes into production 
this year with a major European car
manufacturer. This has also attracted
considerable interest from other
manufacturers across the world.
• In Air Systems Components, Lau’s
proprietary PropSound software helps 
fan designers to minimise noise, placing
us at the leading edge of this increasingly
important point of differentiation in the
commercial and industrial market.
• In Engineered & Construction Products,
Dexter Axle has had great success with 
its electro-hydraulic actuator, which
signiﬁcantly improves trailer braking
distances and reduces the risk of 
jack-kniﬁng.
Achieving manufacturing excellence
Our aim is to be the lowest cost producer
of quality products through excellence 
in manufacturing. We will achieve this
through strategic manufacturing initiatives
(“SMIs”), which address the location 
of manufacturing activities and lean
manufacturing, which makes the
manufacturing processes more efﬁcient.
We are reaching the end of a three-year
programme of SMIs, having accelerated a
number of projects during 2003. Since the
start of the programme, we have
consolidated facilities, moving production
to optimal locations. Projects undertaken
during 2003 were the closure of the
Elizabethtown, Kentucky transmission belt
plant and the transfer of its production to
other US plants, the relocation of hose
production from two plants in the USA to
a plant in Cohisa, Mexico and the second
phase of the reorganisation of 
our Wiper Systems operations in Europe,
following the recently completed closure
of the Dunstable plant in the UK. 
The overall investment of around £200
million in operating costs and capital
expenditure during the past three years
has resulted in annual cost savings of 
the order of £50 million.
A signiﬁcant exercise for the staged
implementation of lean manufacturing is
taking place across all our facilities. During
2003, we estimate that we have saved
around £25 million in operating costs 
and these savings are in addition to the
signiﬁcant beneﬁts arising from reduced
inventory levels, the release of
manufacturing space and the freeing 
up of machine capacity.
Expanding our global position
Some developing countries such as China
are expected to experience growth rates
during this decade well above those
achievable in the developed world. For
example, China is expected to become the
third largest car manufacturer in 2005,
overtaking countries such as Germany and
South Korea. We already lead the Chinese
market for transmission belts and, together
with our partner, we are making a £50
million investment over the next three
years to create a second production plant.
Commercial construction in China will grow
signiﬁcantly, driven in part by the Olympic
Games in Beijing in 2008, and our Air
Systems Components businesses are
working to establish a larger presence in
this market. Several of our other businesses
are seeking expansion in Asia, both as a
market for their products and as a lower
cost source of product.
Making value-creating acquisitions
Our ﬁnancial strength enables us to
supplement organic growth with
acquisitions in our areas of business focus.

continued 
Stackpole, which brought us expertise in
powder metal and engineered components
for powertrain, is an example of what 
we look for when assessing acquisitions,
namely, the ability to achieve double 
digit growth and double digit margins,
proprietary technology, good management
and, above all, the ability to create value.
We continue to look to make further
acquisitions in Powertrain, Air Systems
Components and Aftermarket.
Market outlook
Overall, our main markets are expected 
to show some improvements in 2004.
The global industrial and automotive
aftermarket, our most proﬁtable market
(around 29 per cent of Group sales), is
expected to show further modest growth 
in 2004 but we expect to outperform that
market through new product introductions
and geographical expansion.
According to CSM, a leading industry
forecaster, the global automotive original
equipment market (around 27 per cent of
Group sales) is expected to grow in 2004 
by 4.7 per cent to 59.3 million units, with
modest growth in North America and
Europe and 16 per cent growth in Asia.
The US commercial construction market
(around 11 per cent of Group sales) has
experienced a signiﬁcant decline since its
peak in 2000 but is forecast to grow by
around 2 per cent in 2004.
The US residential construction market
(around 14 per cent of Group sales), which
measured by new housing starts grew by
8.4 per cent in 2003, is forecast by the
National Association of Home Builders to
show a modest decline of 3.2 per cent in
2004 but will remain at what are
historically high levels.
The actions that we have taken will
ensure that we will be a much better
company in 2004 than we were last year. If
our markets perform as forecast, our ability
to outperform our competitors should
ensure that we achieve good underlying
growth in performance during 2004.

OPERATING REVIEW: INDUSTRIAL & AUTOMOTIVE
We have made a signiﬁcant investment 
in restructuring our Industrial &
Automotive group during the past three
years and we are now beginning to see 
the beneﬁts coming through. The group
achieved another strong performance in
2003, reﬂecting the resilience of our
businesses, their global reach and their
success at product innovation and
improved manufacturing efﬁciency.
Against a background of overall ﬂat
original equipment, aftermarket and
replacement markets, underlying sales 
and operating proﬁt before operating
exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation increased by 6.3 per cent 
and 9.9 per cent respectively. Operating
exceptional items amounted to £20.7
million arising from the implementation 
of strategic manufacturing initiatives.
In automotive original equipment,
North American and Western European
production fell by 2.9 per cent and 3.4 per
cent respectively in 2003 while, in the rest
of the world, production increased by 6.7
per cent. The automotive aftermarket
across the world generally remained at
levels similar to 2002, although there were
some notable exceptions such as the strong
growth in the Chinese market. Sales of 
industrial original equipment and
replacement products remained at low
levels with little improvement in demand
from the construction, agriculture and
mining markets. 
Powertrain
Sales: 2003 £890.5m; 2002 £797.0m
Underlying sales increased by 7.4 per cent 
Underlying operating proﬁts increased by
8.4 per cent
Within Powertrain, Power Transmission
recorded a very strong performance,
reﬂecting market share gains driven by
product innovation and the operational
beneﬁts arising from strategic
manufacturing initiatives and lean
manufacturing. It also produced good
growth in the aftermarket, particularly in
Europe where sales rose by 10.0 per cent.
Notable new business wins during the
year included our ﬁrst QMT Micro-V® belt,
a moulded front end accessory drive belt
with exceptional noise and efﬁciency
characteristics which will go into
production in July 2004 in North America.
We also received our ﬁrst order for the
Electro-Mechanical Drive stop-start system,
which will go into production with a major
European car manufacturer later this year.
Amongst the many awards received by
Power Transmission during the year, our
Asian operations gained the Honda
Technology Award and our North American
businesses were made "GM Supplier of the
Year" for the second year running.
As part of its focus upon broadening its
geographic reach, Power Transmission has
begun the construction of a new facility in
Suzhou, China. The existing facility, which
opened in 1997 and has been expanded
twice, is now running at full capacity. 
The £50 million investment, in conjunction
with our partner, will create production
capacity for the industrial market and the
existing facility will then focus exclusively
on the automotive market. Escalating
foreign direct investment, transplant
manufacturing and high GDP growth 
are driving the rapid development of 
the Chinese industrial and automotive
markets. 2003 was a record year for
Chinese automotive demand, and sales 
are expected to double by 2005 and to
triple by 2010. Tomkins, the leading player
in the Chinese power transmission sector, 
is ideally placed to beneﬁt from this
substantial growth. TOP 10

9 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 9
The integration of Stackpole, acquired in
June 2003, has progressed well and it has
recently begun construction of two new
facilities required to fulﬁl new business
awarded prior to acquisition. New business
gains since acquisition have amounted 
to Cdn$16 million per annum and a 
further Cdn$96 million per annum of near
booked business is awaiting ﬁnal order
conﬁrmation, including transmission oil
pumps, variable valve timing components
and transmission modules. Operating
margins in Q4 2003 returned to double
digits following the effect of the power
outage in North America in August,
adverse product mix within its automotive
gear business and the loss of the
protection of currency hedges against 
the weak dollar as these were marked-to-
market when Stackpole was acquired.
Going forward, the business continues 
to invest to support its pipeline of over
Cdn$500 million of business under
development and quotation.
Fluid Power
Sales: 2003 £307.3m; 2002 £326.3m
Underlying sales increased by 3.2 per cent
Underlying operating proﬁts declined by
14.3 per cent
Fluid Power had a difﬁcult year with low
levels of activity in its main markets for
construction, mining and agricultural
equipment. Although it achieved a small
increase in underlying sales, proﬁtability
was affected by a weak performance by 
its European operations. However, the
business will begin to beneﬁt from recent
restructuring in North America and Europe.
There are also signs that activity in some of
its markets is improving, with order levels
from North American construction and
agricultural equipment manufacturers and
distributors increasing markedly towards
the end of the year. 
Wiper Systems
Sales: 2003 £284.1m; 2002 £282.7m
Underlying sales increased by 8.2 per cent
Underlying operating proﬁts increased by
52.6 per cent
Wiper Systems produced a strong result
driven by market share gains and a 
good performance in the automotive
aftermarket. In particular, the range of
aftermarket Teﬂon blades has been well
received in both the USA and Europe 
and new platform wins have helped to
improve original equipment margins. The
consolidation of its manufacturing base
continued with the closure of the plant in
Buffalo, New York State with the transfer
of activity to our existing facilities in Texas
and Mexico, where all rubber extrusion is
now concentrated. In Europe, an improved
aftermarket performance was offset in part
by the effect of production problems at the
Pontypool facility in the UK. 
Fluid Systems
Sales: 2003 £221.8m; 2002 £215.6m
Underlying sales increased by 9.5 per cent
Underlying operating proﬁts increased by
6.9 per cent
Schrader Electronics maintained its global
market leadership in remote tyre pressure
monitoring systems with sales up by over
two thirds compared with 2002. In order 
to meet the ramp up of demand for its
products, it is constructing a new facility in
Northern Ireland, with production due to
commence in May 2004. The pipeline of
new products and new technology, such 
as wireless auto location and the snap-in
sensor, continues to grow, providing
Schrader Electronics with an innovative
edge over its competition. 
The group is also a leader in fuel vapour
management systems required to meet
increasingly stringent emission regulations
across the world. Stant recently maintained
its position as principal supplier of fuel
closure caps to Ford with a new design 
that meets all present and anticipated
legislation in the US and Europe. The team
responsible for this product received our
Charles C Gates Award as recognition for
product innovation.
Other Industrial & Automotive sales
Sales: 2003 £273.5m; 2002 £327.1m
These businesses manufacture a range 
of products mainly for the automotive
aftermarket. Lower sales reﬂected the
disposal of Gates Formed-Fibre earlier in
the year. Underlying sales and operating
proﬁt were ahead of last year. 10 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

2003 HIGHLIGHTS: AIR SYSTEMS COMPONENTS
• Strong margin recovery through the year
• Excellent results in residential markets
• Upside when commercial markets improve
Tomkins Air Systems Components group 
is the leading manufacturer of air
handling components in North America,
supplying the heating, ventilation and 
air conditioning market. The product
range includes fans, grilles, registers,
diffusers, fan coils and terminal units for
residential and commercial applications
and dampers for commercial and
industrial use. Products are sold under
the leading brand names in the industry,
including Hart & Cooley, Ruskin, Lau, 
Titus, Krueger and Actionair.
The US commercial and industrial
construction market, which represents
around 70 per cent of Air Systems
Components (“ASC”) sales, declined by
around 6.1 per cent and is now some 
28 per cent below its peak in 2000. US
residential construction, around 30 per cent
of ASC sales, remained buoyant throughout
the year and ﬁnished 8.6 per cent ahead of
2002. Compared with the same period last
year, ASC underlying sales and operating
proﬁts before operating exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation declined by 1.8
per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively. 
Results for the ﬁrst half of the year 
were affected by additional costs incurred
in maintaining supply to customers during
the closure and subsequent transfer of
production from ﬁve facilities to other
plants within the group. However, with
these problems behind it, operating
margins returned to double-digit levels 
in the second half. 
ASC continued to reduce its cost base
through the group wide implementation of
lean manufacturing. During 2003, this has
resulted in freeing up sufﬁcient capacity to
enable it to close its Junction City facility in
December and to announce that a further 
facility will be closed in 2004. These closures
gave rise to operating exceptional items of
£4.1 million during the year.
Signiﬁcant and high proﬁle new
business gained during the year includes
Titus’s contract for Visteon Village, Detroit,
Miami International Airport and a major
headquarters building in the United Arab
Emirates. Ruskin Air Management is
currently working with the design team 
on London Heathrow’s Terminal 5. Talks 
are progressing with a major customer to
enable ASC to increase its penetration into
the rapidly growing Chinese commercial
construction market.

2003 HIGHLIGHTS: 
ENGINEERED & CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS
• Strong performance from Dexter
• Refocused Bathware and Fittings
• Disposal of Valves, Taps and Mixers businesses
Tomkins Engineered & Construction
Products group manufactures a range 
of engineered products for a variety of
end markets primarily related to the
building, construction, truck and trailer
and automotive industries. Over 90 per
cent of the sales are within North America.
Each of the business areas has a good
competitive position as a result of a strong
branded product offering and a low
manufacturing cost base. Long established
relationships in the channels to market
also provide competitive strength.
In mixed markets, Tomkins Engineered 
& Construction Products group gradually
improved its overall performance during
the year with underlying sales and
operating proﬁts from continuing
operations up by 2.1 per cent and 
4.5 per cent respectively. 
Lasco
Sales: 2003 £221.8m; 2002 £259.6m
Overall, Lasco’s underlying sales were
slightly down on last year. Lasco Bathware
performed well in the residential
construction market and, although sales
were down on last year, it made signiﬁcant
progress in replacing sales lost when a key
original equipment customer decided to
exit the business earlier in the year. Lasco
Fittings achieved sales similar to last year
but margins were reduced by further rises
in PVC raw material prices, which it was
unable to pass on in full to customers. 
Philips Doors & Windows
Sales: 2003 £150.1m; 2002 £158.2m
Philips produced an increase in underlying
sales of 4.5 per cent with strong growth in
sales to the residential construction market 
more than compensating for a further
decline in manufactured housing and, 
for the ﬁrst time, residential construction
became its largest market segment. 
Material Handling
Sales: 2003 £101.1m; 2002 £99.0m
Material Handling saw a return to proﬁt 
on an increase in underlying sales of 7.2 
per cent. Better order intake and improved
contract margins as well as the lower 
ﬁxed costs due to a plant closure in the
previous year all contributed to the
turnaround in performance. 
Dexter Wheels & Axles
Sales: 2003 £175.2m; 2002 £185.8m
Dexter produced another very good
performance with underlying sales 
up 3.9 per cent. Increased demand 
in the industrial and utility and 
recreational vehicle markets more 
than offset a signiﬁcant decline in
manufactured housing.
Valves, Taps and Mixers
Sales: 2003 £77.1m; 2002 £93.7m
During the year, Milliken Valve Co Inc.
was sold for £4.5 million and the business
and assets of Cobra were sold for £7.4
million. Since the year end, the remaining
valves, taps and mixers businesses,
Hattersley Newman Hender and Pegler,
were sold for £13.0 million before
expected additional costs. The businesses
have been treated as discontinued in the
financial information.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Accounting reference date
The Company’s year end was changed 
to the end of December during 2002, 
which resulted in an eight-month period
being reported in the comparative period.
To assist in the comparison of accounting
periods we have presented in the 2003
ﬁnancial statements, we have included 
an unaudited pro forma proﬁt and loss
account for the year ended 31 December
2002. The commentary below compares 
the year ended 3 January 2004 with this
unaudited pro forma ﬁnancial information.
Determining underlying 
ﬁnancial performance
Around 70 per cent of our businesses have
the US dollar as their currency and so the
weakening of the US dollar during 2003
had a translation impact on our reported
turnover and operating proﬁt when
converted into sterling.
For 2003, our US dollar ﬁnancial results
were translated at an average rate of
£1=$1.6306 compared with £1=$1.4984 
in 2002. This represents an 8.8 per cent
reduction in the US dollar to sterling
exchange rate.
Also during 2003 our continuing major
investment in strategic manufacturing
initiatives resulted in signiﬁcant abnormal
costs. These strategic initiatives are aimed
at improving the cost base of the Group. 
It is important we charge these costs to 
the businesses as they are a real cost 
of our operations. However, the scale 
of the costs does distort the reported
performance unless they are separately
identiﬁed. We therefore describe these 
costs as operating exceptional items 
and highlight them separately.
Acquisitions and disposals can 
also distort the view of the change in
performance from one year to the next 
and so we regard it as helpful to show 
their impact on sales and operating proﬁt.
To present a view of the underlying
performance of Tomkins and our business
groups we have prepared the tables
presented on page 16 to pull out the
impact of currency translation, operating
exceptional items and acquisitions 
and disposals.
In January 2004 we completed the
disposal of the remaining businesses 
within our valves, taps and mixers business
segment. To identify the impact of the
results of the business in 2003 we have
separately identiﬁed the sales and results 
of discontinued businesses in the proﬁt 
and loss account.
Margins
Overall our reported operating margin
before operating exceptional items and
amortisation of goodwill was 8.6 per cent.
This compares with 8.9 per cent in the
comparable year. The operating margins of
our business groups are set out in detail on
page 15.
Goodwill
Goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to
May 1998 used to be set directly against
retained proﬁts and was not charged to 
the proﬁt and loss account. Goodwill
relating to periods prior to May 1998, 
and to companies remaining in Tomkins,
which has been written off to reserves
amounts to £1,054.8 million. 
Since May 1998 we have been required
to amortise goodwill relating to acquisitions
through the proﬁt and loss account based
on the expected life of the goodwill.
Amortisation in the year amounted 
to £11.9 million (2002: £10.4 million) with
the increase being attributable to the
acquisition of Stackpole during 2003.
When businesses are sold we are
required to reinstate the acquisition
goodwill relating to the business and set
this off against the sale proceeds in arriving
at a proﬁt or loss on disposal. During the
year goodwill written back on disposals
amounted to £29.9 million. 
Operating exceptional items
The operating exceptional items are
separately disclosed in note 3 to the
ﬁnancial statements. The table overleaf
sets out the proﬁt and cash effect of the
strategic manufacturing initiatives in 2003. 
“OUR STRONG CASH FLOW AND BALANCE 
SHEET PROVIDE A SOUND FOUNDATION 
FOR GROWING OUR BUSINESSES.”
KEN LEVER, FINANCE DIRECTOR 13 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
Non-operating exceptional items
We have recorded a net loss on the disposal
of businesses in the year of £18.5 million.
This loss relates to the disposal of three of
our businesses, Formed-Fibre, Milliken and
Cobra, as previously reported.
The provision for the loss on the 
exit of the European Automotive Hose
business of £32.6 million and the release
of the provision of £33.1 million relating
to the disposal of operations and related
warranties were reported in our results 
for the half year to 5 July 2003. Any
ongoing operating losses of the European
Automotive Hose business included in the
reported operating proﬁt of the Group, 
to the extent they have been included 
in the provision for the loss on exit, are
offset by a transfer from the provision
shown separately in the proﬁt and loss
account. This amounted to £1.6 million
for the period from the date of the
announcement of the exit.
In January 2004 we completed the sale
of Pegler Limited and the business and
assets of Hattersley Newman Hender
Limited. The provisional sale proceeds
before costs amounted to £13.0 million, 
of which £5.8 million is deferred. The
estimated loss on disposal of £72.9 million
includes a goodwill impairment charge of
£51.4 million relating to recycled goodwill
previously written off against reserves. 
As noted above, this completes the exit
from the valves, taps and mixers business
and the results have been separately
identiﬁed as discontinued in the proﬁt 
and loss account.
Proﬁt on disposal of ﬁxed assets of 
£7.7 million relates principally to the
insurance proceeds in excess of the book 
value of assets destroyed in a ﬁre at 
Pegler Limited in 2002.
Full details of the disposals during 
the period are contained in note 29 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
Finance costs
The nature and currency of our cash and
loan balances around the Group affect the
overall net interest charge. Although we
have net debt, this comprises gross cash
balances and gross debt balances around
the Group. The gross debt relates primarily
to our sterling corporate bonds issued in
December 2001, which are at a ﬂoating
rate of around 6.6 per cent, and the
sterling corporate bonds issued in
September 2003, which are at a ﬂoating
rate of around 4.8 per cent. Our cash is
denominated primarily in US dollars and
sterling and earns lower rates of interest
than the interest on the debt. 
The net interest expense in 2003 was
£8.4 million (2002: net interest income of
£0.6 million). 
Earnings per share
We have presented earnings per share
before and after amortisation of goodwill
and non-operating exceptional items.
Before amortisation of goodwill and non-
operating exceptional items, earnings per
share was 18.78 pence compared with
20.41 pence in 2002. After goodwill and
non operating exceptional items, earnings
per share was 18.53 pence compared to
18.91 pence in 2002.
Dividends
The dividends to our preference
shareholders are dollar denominated 
and in the year, the sterling equivalent 
was £28.9 million (2002: £38.3 million).
Preference dividends have reduced as 
a result of the redemption of the
redeemable convertible cumulative
preference shares and due to the
weakening of the US dollar.
The dividends to holders of ordinary
shares for the year were £92.8 million. This
represents dividend cover, before goodwill
amortisation and non-operating exceptional
items, of 1.6 times (2002: 1.7 times).
The cash cover for dividends paid in the
year, represented by operating cash after
interest, tax and preference dividends,
compared to the ordinary dividends
amounted to 1.5 times. In 2002 the cash
cover on the same basis was 1.9 times.
Capital expenditure
Our total gross capital expenditure in 
the year was £141.1 million (2002: £152.9
million). This represented 1.1 times
depreciation charged (2002: 1.2 times). 
After proceeds from asset disposals 
of £27.1 million the net expenditure on
ﬁxed assets was £114.0 million (2002:
£141.2 million). This represents 0.9 times
depreciation charged in the year (2002: 
1.1 times). 
In the table on page 15 we show the
ratio of capital expenditure to depreciation
for each of the business groups in Tomkins.
Working capital
Average working capital as a percentage 
of sales over the year amounted to 13.4 
per cent compared to 12.9 per cent in 
the comparable period.
Currency movements and acquisitions
and disposals affect overall reported
working capital. After currency movements
(a decrease of £26.5 million) and
acquisitions and disposals (a decrease of
£31.8 million) working capital increased by
£22.9 million. This was due to an increase in
stock of £4.2 million, an increase in debtors
of £17.2 million and a decrease in creditors
of £1.5 million. Stock levels were higher as
it has taken longer than planned to reduce
levels of safety stocks built up to minimise
any disruption to customer service during
the plant rationalisation initiatives. Debtors
are higher due to longer credit terms on
certain aftermarket sales.

year, the current tax charge for the period
would have been 26.6 per cent.
The reconciliation of the current tax 
rate of 30 per cent to the actual tax rate
prior to the contingency release is set out
in the table above.
Return on average invested capital
The annualised return on average 
invested capital for the Group, before
operating exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation, calculated on a constant
currency basis, was 9.8 per cent compared
with 10.3 per cent in the year to 
31 December 2002. This is an accounting
measure we monitor for each of 
our businesses. 
Comparison of return on average
invested capital with the Group weighted
average cost of capital gives a broad
indication of the extent to which a business
is covering the Group’s cost of capital over
time. Return on average invested capital
represents the after tax operating proﬁt 
in the business expressed as a percentage
of the average invested capital in the
business including all goodwill associated
Operating cash ﬂow is stated after £34.3
million of restructuring costs and £29.9
million of capital expenditure associated
with the various restructuring projects.
Details of net cash inﬂow from operating
activities for the year are set out in note
9 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Taxation
A tax credit of £47.5 million (2002: charge
of £44.9 million) was recognised during 
the year. This was principally due to an
exceptional release of other tax provisions
of £90.7 million. 
Favourable adjustments to prior year 
tax estimates of £7.8 million and the
recognition of deferred tax assets of £7.2
million beneﬁted the tax charge. Also in
the period there has been an exceptional
release of £90.7 million from other tax
provisions as separately identiﬁed in note
20 to the ﬁnancial statements. This release
has arisen as a result of an ongoing review
of Group tax exposures. Taking into account
the favourable impact of the above and the
impact of the disallowance for tax purposes
of certain of the exceptional charges in the
with acquisitions made in the past. We use
9 per cent as an estimate of the weighted
average cost of capital for the Group.
Accounting convention requires
goodwill relating to acquisitions to be
translated at the rate of exchange existing
at the time an acquisition is made. If the
local currency of a business weakens then
the reported sterling operating proﬁts
may decline whilst the reported sterling
asset base remains at a higher level due to
the historic rate of translation. Return on
average invested capital is a more
meaningful measure when stated in local
currency or at a constant exchange rate on
translation. We have therefore shown the
constant currency return on average
invested capital for the Group and for the
business groups on page 15.
Return on average operating assets
employed is a measure of the pre tax
accounting return on the accounting book
value of the net capital employed in a
business. It is based on operating proﬁt
before interest and tax as a percentage 
of the net book value of net operating
assets employed in the business.
A table setting out each of the 
measures for the business groups is 
shown on page 15. 
Capital structure and treasury policy
Our ﬁnancing structure has been 
revised following the early redemption 
of the redeemable convertible cumulative
preference shares in August 2003. 
The redemption price of $48.50 per
share was at a $1.50 discount to the par
value of $50.00 per share. The total
redemption value including accrued
dividends was $604.1 million. We ﬁnanced
the redemption with existing cash resources
and a £250 million sterling corporate 
bond, giving rise to the overall net debt
position for the Group. The early
redemption gave rise to a net gain of
£10.8 million, which is reported in the
proﬁt and loss account. This amount 
is not included in the calculation of
earnings per share.
Our medium term aim is to maintain 
an appropriate mix of equity and debt 
to ensure an efﬁcient capital structure
consistent with our desired investment
grade ﬁnancial proﬁle. Our debt capacity 
is consistent with this aim and includes
maintaining a level of interest and
preference dividend cover of ﬁve times 
in the medium term. Our long term 
debt ﬁnance requirements are deﬁned

within these parameters and with an
understanding of our future ﬁnancing
needs for capital investment, acquisitions
and dividends. 
We have a Global Medium Term Note
Programme under which Tomkins may 
issue bonds in each of the main currencies
up to a total maximum principal amount 
of £750 million. Our initial bond under
the programme in December 2001 was for
£150 million with a 10 year maturity and
was issued at a coupon of 8 per cent. 
In September 2003 we issued a further
£250 million bond with a 12 year maturity
at a coupon of 6.125 per cent. The
proceeds of this bond issue were used 
to ﬁnance the early redemption of the
redeemable convertible cumulative
preference shares which took place 
in August 2003.
In the immediate future our debt
requirements will continue to be sourced
from the banking market.
Our committed bank borrowing facilities
mainly comprise a multi-currency revolving
credit facility of £400 million maturing in
February 2009, which contains ﬁnancial
covenants relating to interest cover and 
net debt to EBITDA. 
Financial risk management is the
responsibility of our central treasury
function, which operates within strict
policies and guidelines approved by the
Board. Compliance with these policies 
and guidelines is monitored through the
regular reporting of treasury activities.
Interest rates
Interest rate exposures are managed by
using interest rate swaps, options and
forward rate agreements. A degree of 
ﬁxed rate cover is maintained which is
appropriate to the Group’s ongoing
operations and capital structure.
Foreign currency transaction exposures
The foreign currency transaction exposures
in the business are protected with forward
currency purchases and sales. These are 
put in place when foreign currency
trading transactions are committed or
when there is a high likelihood of such
transactions arising.
Foreign currency translation exposures
To the extent that Tomkins is funded by
shareholders’ equity, overseas investments
are not hedged. The Group’s net
borrowings are generally retained in
proportion to the currencies in which 
the Group’s assets are denominated, to
hedge the foreign currency translation
exposure arising from the Group’s 
overseas investments. The net debt 
position comprises principally US dollars,
Canadian dollars and Euros.
Dividends are funded by converting 
the foreign currency cash ﬂows generated
by overseas investments at the time 
of payment of the dividend. Interest
payments on foreign currency net
borrowings will be funded with cash 
ﬂows generated by the corresponding
foreign currency investments.
We do not hedge foreign currency
proﬁt and loss translation exposures and
we are subject to the risk of currency
ﬂuctuation. We estimate a movement of 10
per cent in the £/$ exchange rate has an
impact on reported operating proﬁts of
around 7 to 8 per cent. This risk is partly
offset to the extent that interest arises on
foreign currency net borrowings.
Information on our use of derivatives and
ﬁnancial instruments is given in note 28 to
the ﬁnancial statements.
Liquidity
Borrowing facilities are monitored against
forecast requirements and timely action 
is taken to put in place, renew or replace
credit lines. Our policy is to reduce
ﬁnancing risk by diversifying our funding
sources and by staggering the maturity 
of our borrowings.
We operate in a wide range of markets
and geographic locations and as a result the
seasonality of our borrowing requirements
is low. Our policy is to apply funds from one
part of the Group to meet the obligations
of another part wherever possible, to
ensure maximum efﬁciency of the Group’s
funds. No material restrictions apply which
limit the application of this policy.

Pensions
The disclosure information required 
by Financial Reporting Standard No. 17
“Retirement Beneﬁts” (“FRS 17”) is
included in note 26 to the ﬁnancial
statements. Under FRS 17, the asset values
and the discount rates of the liabilities are
based on the ﬁnancial markets existing at
our ﬁnancial year end.
At 3 January 2004 there was a gross
deﬁcit of liabilities compared to assets in
the deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans of £148.2
million (31 December 2002: £194.8 million).
The decrease in the deﬁcit was due to the
improvement in the equity markets, offset
by a reduction in the long-term discount
rate applied to pension liabilities.
The recognition of the related deferred
tax asset reduces the net pension liability to
£103.7 million (31 December 2002: £136.4
million). Under FRS 17 this deﬁcit would
have to be included in the balance sheet.
Cash contributions to the scheme in
2004 we estimate will be £20 million, 
a decrease of £3 million on 2003.
Results prepared under US GAAP 
in US dollars 
Operating income from continuing
operations under US GAAP in 2003 was
$352.1 million, compared to $377.4 million
in 2002. Both are stated before goodwill
impairment and the latter before goodwill
amortisation charged in the four months 
to 30 April 2002. Net income under US
GAAP was $430.8 million in 2003, which
compared to $197.2 million in 2002.
The differences between operating 
income under US GAAP and UK GAAP 
arise from the treatment of costs associated
with exit or disposal activities, goodwill,
intangible assets, pension costs and share
options. Net income under US GAAP is
subject to additional adjustments relating
to the treatment of capitalised interest,
derivatives and deferred tax.
Shareholders’ equity under US GAAP
was $2,701.1 million at 3 January 2004,
compared to $2,412.6 million at 31
December 2002. The adjustments from 
UK GAAP reﬂect the cumulative effect 
of adjustments noted above.
A reconciliation of the reported
ﬁnancial information prepared under UK
and US GAAP is shown on pages 74 to 77,
as supplemental ﬁnancial information.
International Financial 
Reporting Standards
From 2005 onwards, in common with over
7,000 listed companies within the European
Union, Tomkins will be required to prepare
its consolidated ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Consequently,
our 2004 Report & Accounts will be the 
last to contain ﬁnancial statements
prepared in accordance with UK GAAP .
For some months now, we have been
planning for the transition from UK GAAP
to IFRS. We are currently in the process of
interpreting the accounting standards that
will apply from 2005 onwards, setting the
Group’s future accounting policies in
accordance with IFRS and identifying the
detailed accounting and disclosure
requirements that will necessitate changes
to our ﬁnancial information systems.
We are not, as yet, in a position to
quantify the effect of the differences
between IFRS and UK GAAP on the Group’s
results or ﬁnancial position. Based on 
our work to date, we believe that the
signiﬁcant differences will arise in the
following areas.
Preference shares
Under UK GAAP , the 5.560% Voting
Convertible Cumulative Preference Shares
are presented as non-equity shareholders’
funds. Under IFRS, the carrying value of
these shares must be split for accounting
purposes between a liability component,
representing the present value of the
obligation to pay dividends in perpetuity,
and an equity component, representing the
fair value of the holder’s option to convert
into ordinary shares. Dividends payable on
the shares will be presented as ﬁnance
costs in the income statement, rather than
as an appropriation of proﬁt.
Derivatives and hedge accounting
Under UK GAAP , the derivative ﬁnancial
instruments that the Group uses to manage
its currency and interest rate exposures 
are not recognised until the hedged
transaction has itself been recognised 
in the ﬁnancial statements. Under IFRS,
derivatives are recognised as assets and
liabilities stated at their fair values and
changes in their fair values are recognised
in the income statement. While so-called
“hedge accounting” can be used to
mitigate ﬂuctuations in earnings, it is 
not our current intention to adopt this
approach. As a result we are likely to
experience some volatility in our proﬁt 
and loss account, presented under IFRS, 
due to movements in exchange rates.
Goodwill 
Generally, the carrying amount of goodwill
recognised under UK GAAP on past
acquisitions will not be revisited under 
IFRS. However, in comparison to UK GAAP ,
where goodwill is amortised over its useful
life, under IFRS goodwill will be subject to
an annual impairment review. 
Research and development costs
Under UK GAAP, all research and
development costs are written off to the
proﬁt and loss account in the period in
which they are incurred. Under IFRS,
development costs must be capitalised as
an intangible asset if certain conditions
relating to the feasibility of the
development project are met and the asset
must be amortised over its useful life. 
Retirement beneﬁts
Under IFRS, the basis of accounting for
retirement beneﬁts is broadly similar 
to that required by FRS 17 “Retirement
beneﬁts” the disclosures for which 
are given in note 26 to the ﬁnancial
statements. However, whereas under FRS 17
actuarial gains and losses would be taken
directly to equity, under IFRS they must be
recognised in the income statement.
Overall, we believe that the further
move under IFRS towards the fair 
valuation of assets and liabilities will lead
to greater volatility in the reported results
of listed companies. 
Outside the European Union, many
other countries will either require or 
permit companies to report under IFRS
from 2005. We support the continuing
efforts of the accounting standard-setters
to achieve convergence between IFRS and
US GAAP . 
Going concern 
The Directors are conﬁdent, on the 
basis of current ﬁnancial projections 
and facilities available, that the Company
and the Group have adequate ﬁnancial
resources to continue in operation for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
the Directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the
ﬁnancial statements.

MANAGING FOR VALUE
The intrinsic value of a business reﬂects 
its ability to generate sustainable cash
ﬂows over time. This in turn is a function
of the strategic positions we occupy. 
Strategic position depends on the
attractiveness of the market, in terms 
of size, growth and ability to earn a
sustainable economic return, and our
competitive position in the market place,
in terms of product offering, cost base,
manufacturing capability and technology.
We focus our planning, reporting,
control and performance management
framework on a managing for value
approach. The framework focuses on 
value based decision-making at all levels 
and is designed to improve strategic and
operational decisions to ensure long-term
creation of value for our shareholders.
The change has been subtle rather 
than major. It has been about a change 
of mindset rather than reporting. We 
have achieved this through some changes
in our key processes. We have ensured 
that our strategic planning processes
direct resources into those areas where
we believe we can create value. We have
improved our approach to appraisal of
investments and potential acquisitions to
ensure that they will be value-creating. 
We have also modiﬁed our performance
measurement so that in addition to
standard accounting metrics, such as return
on invested capital, we look at cash ﬂow
metrics, such as free cash ﬂow from our
businesses, and also economic metrics such
as cash added value and economic return.
Strategic development of the business 
is an integral part of value creation. The
strategic initiatives described in this Annual
Report are important as we grow the value
of our business. The restructuring projects
help us to lower our cost base and be more
cost competitive. The focus on technology 
and development of new products
enhance our competitive position. Lean
manufacturing initiatives lead to more
efﬁcient manufacturing processes, also
lowering cost and reducing working
capital. 
The progress of the managing for 
value initiative is set out on the following
time line.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
In recognising our corporate social
responsibilities, Tomkins’ approach 
is one of continuous improvement,
particularly in the areas of health, safety
and the environment (“HSE”). Notable
amongst our activities during the year 
has been the work of the Health, Safety
and Environment Committee of the Board
and a supporting team of specialist
professionals throughout the Group. They
have been active in guiding operating
businesses to strive to achieve the highest
internationally recognised standards
including Occupational Health and Safety
Assessment Series 18001 and ISO 14001 
in environmental management.
Another important milestone achieved
by Tomkins during the year was the
Company’s admittance to the FTSE4Good
UK Index, which is designed to measure 
the performance of companies that meet
globally recognised corporate responsibility
standards. For inclusion, eligible companies
must meet criteria requirements in three
areas, namely working towards
environmental sustainability, developing
positive relationships with stakeholders
and upholding and supporting universal
human rights.
Our Code of Conduct and Ethics and
Human Rights Policy form the basis on
which uniform standards are applied
across the Group in all countries where 
we operate.
Health, safety and environment
The priority and importance placed by the
Board and management of Tomkins on HSE 
matters is driven by a belief and experience
that our commercial success and HSE
performance are compatible objectives. It
was because of the importance placed on
HSE matters that the Health, Safety and
Environment Committee was formed by 
the Board at the beginning of the year.
Policy, Objectives and Compliance
The intention of our HSE policy is to
provide a safe and healthy workplace 
for our employees and to protect the
environment. We are committed to the
highest health, safety and environmental
standards consistent with regulatory
requirements and best management
practices. Our businesses are required to
operate their facilities consistent with 
this commitment. We recognise that all
employees have a part to play in that
commitment and they are encouraged 
and expected to do so.
Our policies and objectives are
translated by management into speciﬁc
action plans for each operational site. All
business groups are encouraged to set
realistic HSE targets and objectives within
their annual business plans in order to
pursue a strategy based on continuous
performance improvement. The HSE
activities of individual businesses in the
Group are monitored by a team of
specialist professionals who carry out
regular performance audits. The audit
reports arising are provided to
management who are responsible for
correcting any deﬁciencies that come 
to light as a result of the audit. 
Health, Safety and Environment
Committee activities
The Health, Safety and Environment
Committee plays a key role in our HSE
activities. The Committee comprises two
non-executive Directors and the Chief
Executive, and has met four times during
the year. Meetings always take place at 
one of the Group’s facilities and form 
part of a two-day programme during 
which the Committee will usually visit two
or three sites. Amongst the Committee’s
responsibilities is the determination on
behalf of the Board of the framework or
broad policy and objectives in the areas of
HSE and to propose any amendments to
existing policies and objectives for approval
by the Board. The Committee has formal
terms of reference which can be found 
on the Company’s website
www.tomkins.co.uk. Each quarter, the
Committee receives an update of the 
HSE reports across the Group which
highlight current areas of HSE focus and
improvement and any event or breach 
of regulatory requirements. Any serious
breach is communicated immediately to 
the Chief Executive and the Committee.
This ensures the Committee is able to
monitor fully, and assess the compliance
record of, each business unit and ensure
corrective action is taken. Of the
environmental deﬁciencies found by
regulators or discovered during audits in
2003, the substantial majority related to
reporting deﬁciencies rather than unlawful
emissions. On health and safety, the
substantial majority of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”)
citations and informal inquiries were
resolved very quickly; in one case, a minor
injury resulted in an OSHA citation.
To enable it to gain an understanding 
at ﬁrst hand of HSE activities of business
units and the issues facing them, site visits
are undertaken by the Committee. This
process enables the Committee to maintain
a strong and continuing overview of the
way the Group’s HSE policies and objectives
are being implemented. The Committee
reports regularly to the Board on its
activities, which assists the Board in making
informed decisions about the business 
of the Group, particularly relating to any
proposed new investment in manufacturing
facilities and the HSE implications thereof.
Other HSE activities
Work has continued during the year to
integrate our HSE activities, which has been 
“THROUGHOUT THE GROUP WE HAVE ACTIVELY
GUIDED OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES TO STRIVE
TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST INTERNATIONALLY
RECOGNISED STANDARDS.” 21 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
were not based on the ISO 14001 Outline
but achieve similar results and are not
intended for ISO certiﬁcation); 11 facilities
are expected to achieve ISO 14001
Compliant Status in 2004 (these facilities
have implemented an ISO 14001
Environmental Management System but
have not undergone a formal registration
audit). The remaining facilities have
committed to implementing environmental
management systems which are in various
stages of development. The percentage of
facilities which have an environmental
management system in place has doubled
to 42% during the year and further
progress is expected during 2004.
There were a number of notable
environmental achievements during the
year and by way of example, ﬁve are
summarised below:
• At Standard-Thomson Corporation, the
largest manufacturer of thermostats for
vehicles in the US, a team was formed
with representatives from environmental
facilities and manufacturing operations
with the purpose of improving the
quality, material handling facilities, 
safety and environmental requirements
associated with the cleaning of
thermostat components. With the
implementation of lean manufacturing
initiatives, the opportunity arose to
review the existing clean line process. 
The result was the installation of a new
state-of-the-art cleaning system which
improved quality by the elimination 
of damage to parts; reduced chemical
consumption by 75% and water
consumption by 20,000 gallons per
working day; eliminated steam from the
cleaning process resulting in a substantial
reduction in the use of the plant’s boilers;
and, ﬁnally, reduced waste water
discharges and nitrous oxide and sulphur
dioxide emissions signiﬁcantly. The
ﬁnancial impact is that, in less than 18
months, the cost of the new process will
be met by the savings achieved.
• At the Air System Components plant in
Lebanon, Indiana, a new closed loop
parts washer cleaning system has been
installed which treats and lowers metal
concentrations in waste water prior to
discharge to the sewer in compliance
with local and federal regulations. This
saves money on transportation and
external treatment costs, and the savings
will have paid for the equipment in
about three months.
met with enthusiasm. This has provided 
the opportunity, amongst other things, 
for a greater consistency in reports to 
the Committee.
Regular conferences are held by HSE
professionals from around the Group 
which have provided a forum in which
experiences can be shared and issues
discussed. There is now tangible evidence
of beneﬁts emerging from such meetings
and the experience of Hart and Cooley
(described below) is just one such example.
It also provides opportunities for training
and bringing practitioners up to date with
changes in HSE rules, regulations and laws.
It also encourages operating businesses to
seek internationally accepted standards.
This has accelerated the development,
setting and monitoring of HSE key
performance indicators (“KPIs”) as
important Group-wide operating measures.
All of our business groups have established
a range of KPIs within their current
business plans to monitor and assess HSE
performance on an ongoing basis. The
Committee monitors the results of the 
KPIs on a regular basis to ensure that HSE
focus and continuous improvement in
performance is being delivered by all
business groups. Business risk assurance
audits are conducted by our own
professionals together with the site
management teams to ensure that
processes and controls are in place to
maintain compliance with Group policy 
and the applicable local and national 
HSE legislation. Examples of the KPIs 
used include:
• incident/accident and severity rates;
• raw material wastage and energy
consumed per applicable production 
unit; and,
• compliance with Tomkins’ health, 
safety and environment policy and 
local environmental legislation.
Environmental Management Systems
There has been a major increase in the
number of the Group’s manufacturing and
distribution facilities worldwide achieving
ISO 14001 certiﬁcation or equivalent. Out
of 149 facilities, some 42 facilities were ISO
14001 certiﬁed at the end of 2003 (2002:
18) and during 2004 a further 8 facilities
plan to achieve certiﬁcation. A further 20
facilities have alternate environmental
management systems in place (these
facilities have implemented fully functional
Environmental Management Systems that 
• At Dexter Axle, improvements have
been achieved in basic manufacturing
operations at two plants in Missouri and
Georgia, for example, by replacing
brush painting with paint spraying,
which has had a positive environmental
impact as well as a positive ﬁnancial
impact. At the Missouri plant, a new
lighting system has been installed which
will use less energy and cost less to
maintain, as well as improving the
working conditions for employees.
• At Trico Products’ Texas facility, a project
to minimise the amount of scrap plastic
material was instigated. The process
consisted of blending recycled plastic
regrind with the base (virgin) material
and the recycle programme resulted in 
a 25% reduction in base material being
purchased for certain plastic parts.
Financially, the project yielded a cost
improvement and environmentally the
facility was able to minimise the amount
of plastic material being wasted.
• Stackpole’s UK business, FormFlo, 
won the Accelerate Supplier of the 
Year Award for 2003 for Sustainable
Improvement. Two of the criteria 
used to judge the award were the
reduction in scrap from 3.4% in 2001 
to 1.2% in 2003 and the halving of
manufacturing lead times.
There are a number of continuous
improvement projects which operating
businesses have been running which 
yield year-on-year gains in environmental
and ﬁnancial performance. For example,
at Trico Products’ Texas facility, a source
reduction-waste minimisation plan 
has been in place since 1999. This plan
requires the reduction of hazardous 
waste streams by 25% from 1999 to 
2005. The 25% reduction target has been
achieved after just four years. Operator
training in waste water treatment
techniques and optimising process
monitoring has resulted in a signiﬁcant
reduction in hazardous and non-
hazardous waste streams and increasing
annual cost savings. Other projects at 
the same plant include reductions in 
the amount of oil and grease and 
total zinc concentration being legally
discharged into the municipal treatment
works from the Rubber Extrusion Process
and the reduction of emissions into 
the environment from the dip-coating
process in the Plating Department. 22 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
continued 
Health and Safety
Our businesses are encouraged to seek 
the health and safety industry standard,
Occupational Health and Safety Assessment
Series (OHSAS) 18001 or equivalent. 
This standard has been created to allow
companies to develop systematic controls
relating to their health and safety risks 
and to seek external accreditation of the
management system.
Trends on accidents within Tomkins
manufacturing plants and distribution
facilities are measured using OSHA
standards, since the majority of the 
Group’s operations are based in North
America. The number of reportable
accidents, the incident rate and the
resulting lost days, and the severity rate 
are all tracked. In 2003, the incident rate
was 4.82 (2002: 6.06) and the severity 
rate 26.80 (2002: 35.09). This declining
trend has continued from 2001 and is a
key performance measure for each facility.
There were a number of notable health
and safety achievements during the year,
four of which are summarised below:
• Gates’ plants at Charleston, Missouri,
Galesburg, Illinois and Red Bay, 
Alabama have been recognised for 
top performance by the US Rubber
Manufacturers Association through 
RMA’s Safety Health Improvement
Program, by meeting RMA improvement
criteria of a 10% reduction in incidence
rate over the prior year. Other Gates’
plants at Ashe County, North Carolina,
Iola, Kansas and Siloam Springs, Arizona
were also recognised for meeting RMA
excellence criteria.
• Lasco Fittings won the Plastic Pipe 
Fitting Association’s Processor Safety
Recognition Award for both 2001 and
2002 and this achievement is reﬂected 
in their accident incident rate where 
they have now gone 1.3 million hours
without a lost time injury.
• At Dexter Axle’s Albion facility, robot
systems have been introduced to reduce
and in many cases eliminate, material
handling by employees and, as a result,
greatly reducing the potential risk of
strain and repetitive stress injury.
• The distribution centre at Lithonia,
Georgia, one of Gates’ largest in the US,
has worked an entire year without an
accident. They have created safety
training programmes for all employees, 
as well as an in-depth and speciﬁc
programme for the operation of fork 
lift trucks, narrow-aisle reach lifts and
“cherry pickers”.
There are numerous examples throughout
the Group where changes to processes 
can yield environmental, health and safety
and ﬁnancial beneﬁts in one operation. 
As an example, work done at Hart and
Cooley illustrates the sort of activity 
leading to gains in all three areas. As 
a direct result of the annual Tomkins 
Safety and Environmental Conference, 
an energy audit of the Holland, Michigan
manufacturing facility of Hart and Cooley
disclosed that approximately one-sixth of
all electricity used was attributed to plant
lighting at a substantial annual cost. The
audit also disclosed that 50% of both the
cost and usage could be reduced through
the installation of energy efﬁcient units
with longer bulb life, lower wattage and
better performance. These units can also 
be disposed of as general refuse compared
to the metal halide ﬁxtures which have
mercury content and require a licensed
waste hauler for disposal. Phase 2 of the
energy reduction programme is planned
which is expected to realise additional
savings through the replacement of all
ofﬁce ﬂuorescent lighting.
Acquisitions
We place a great deal of importance 
on HSE matters in our acquisition 
process. Where appropriate, external
environmental advisers are employed to
review and assess any environmental risks
to which we could become exposed if we
proceeded with an acquisition. In addition,
a review is made of an acquisition
candidate’s environmental management
systems, relationships with regulatory
ofﬁcials and general level of respect and
care shown for the environment. In the
due diligence process, health and safety is
also a key area for which a full review is
undertaken including, among other things,
the level of compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations. Where necessary, 
an indemnity is sought from the vendor 
to cover any potential liabilities, but it 
is possible that a potential acquisition
would be rejected if the HSE risks were
considered to be too high. We may require
a vendor to undertake health, safety or
environmental improvements before we
will conclude a transaction.
Socially responsible investment
The Board considers social, environmental
and ethical matters in three respects:
1. Capital expenditure proposals
When submitting capital expenditure
proposals for approval by the Board, 
operating businesses are required 
to consider and report on social,
environmental and ethical matters 
where there is any potential impact.
2. Reports from the HSE Committee
The Chairman of the HSE Committee 
makes regular reports to the Board on 
the activities of the Committee and, in
particular, draws to the attention of 
the Board any major issues.
3. Business Risk Assurance
The Business Risk Assurance group 
has included in its overall business risk
assurance process speciﬁc requirements to
examine and assess social, environmental
and ethical matters in its list of
responsibilities. The results of the work 
of the Business Risk Assurance group are
reported quarterly to the Audit Committee
which, in turn, reports to the Board.
Our approach to managing risks to
short and long-term value arising from
social, environmental and ethical matters 
is to include it as an integral part of the
general business risk assessment and
management processes. Through these
processes the Board is able to assess the
signiﬁcant risks to the Company’s short 
and long-term value. Such processes 
are subject to continual review and
improvement where appropriate.
The Tomkins Annual Bonus Incentive
Plan for management is focused on a
sharing of a proportion of Group proﬁts
after deduction of the cost of capital. An
intrinsic feature of our ability to generate
sustained proﬁtability is the need to
maintain high standards of HSE controls 
in our operating businesses worldwide.
There is much evidence, some of which 
is set out in this report, that actions to
improve standards of HSE are frequently
ﬁnancially beneﬁcial to the Group.
Furthermore, high standards of HSE are
often paralleled by high standards of
product quality control and customer
service. For these reasons, the Board 
does not believe it is necessary to 
identify separately the performance 
on HSE matters as a speciﬁc criterion 
in determining bonus payments.
Code of Conduct and Ethics
Our Code of Conduct and Ethics sets 
out a series of policies and principles 
of conduct to be followed by all our
companies and applies to all directors,
ofﬁcers and employees who are expected
to conduct Company business with 
integrity and in compliance with the  23 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
including a description of what action has
been taken to address those matters and
the timetable to completion. The adoption
of international or comparable internal
standards, tailored to the unique operation
by a growing number of operating
businesses, increases the Committee’s
conﬁdence in the veracity of the reporting
systems and procedures.
Charitable giving and community affairs
We have well-established guidelines that
determine the nature of organisations to
which we will give support. We recognise
that we have an obligation to our
shareholders and the wider community in
which our businesses operate to provide
balanced and targeted charitable
assistance. The charities given assistance
cover a wide range of activities including
health and welfare, education, civic and
community projects, culture and the arts.
We prefer to spread our charitable giving
over many smaller local charities that
usually do not have the organisation,
structure or resources to compete with the
marketing skills of the larger high-proﬁle
charitable bodies. Each year donations are
made to hundreds of charities. We make
further donations through advertising,
sponsorship, products for prizes and
volunteers or other in-kind support.
In the UK, applications are normally
made to Tomkins’ corporate ofﬁce in
London. Requests for donations are made
from a variety of charities and we try to
respond positively to as many requests as
possible, provided they come from small
local charities and are registered with the
Charities Commission.
In the US most requests for support 
are made locally and donations can be
made in a number of ways. The Tomkins
Foundation makes matching gifts,
foundation gifts and contributions 
to United Way, an external charitable
organisation that distributes funds to
charities. Tomkins’ US subsidiary companies
also make donations to United Way. In
addition to their charitable giving activities,
our businesses also run a whole range of
initiatives for the beneﬁt of local
communities. These include allowing our
employees time off to participate in
community activities and other charitable
support. With the co-operation of certain
of our US companies, some local charities
will designate a “casual day for a cause”,
whereby our companies allow their
employees to dress casually for a good
cause, to enable funds to be raised for
laws of the countries in which we 
operate. The Code covers a number of
important areas including competing
fairly and complying with anti-trust and
competition laws, employee health and
safety laws and environmental laws. It
also reafﬁrms our commitment to fair
treatment of all employees, ethical and
lawful behaviour and sets out some
general principles, which are important 
in dealing with suppliers and customers,
and with governments and government
agencies. The Code emphasises the
importance of employees protecting 
our intellectual property. Any waivers 
to the Code require the approval of 
the Board and will be published on the
Company’s website. During the year 
no waivers have been either sought 
or granted. The full Code can be viewed
on our website www.tomkins.co.uk or 
a printed copy is available by application
to the Company Secretary at the
Company’s registered ofﬁce. 
Human rights
Our Human Rights Policy has established 
a number of principles that are applied
across the Group. These principles cover
anti-discrimination, employee rights 
(in the areas of health and safety, wages
and working hours), prohibition of 
child labour and social responsibility
(covering environmental impact and
community relations). We expect
employees to maintain the highest
standards in conformity with the 
principles. A copy of the full text of 
the Human Rights Policy can be found 
on our website www.tomkins.co.uk.
Veriﬁcation
In the case of the Code of Conduct and
Ethics and Human Rights Policy, senior
management throughout the Group are
required to conﬁrm annually that they 
and their businesses have complied with
the principles set out in both the Code 
and Policy and to report any breaches. 
For 2003, no breaches were reported by
any of the operating businesses. A process
of veriﬁcation will be introduced in 2004
under which adherence to the Code of
Conduct and Ethics and the Human Rights
Policy will form part of the business risk
assurance process.
In the case of HSE, the Health, Safety
and Environment Committee of the Board
receives detailed quarterly reports from a
team of experienced professionals on the
current status of all matters reported to 
the Committee which require attention, 
charity. Examples of the many organisations
to which help was provided during the year
include American Heart Association,
American Cancer Society and the Museum
of Nature and Science. At the plant level,
donations were also made to “March 
of Dimes” (an organisation that helps
prevent birth defects and infant mortality)
and support was given to Drug Awareness
Resistance Education (DARE) programmes
(which aim to keep children off drugs).
Total charitable donations during the
year are shown in the Directors’ report 
on page 25.
No donations were made to any
organisation in which any of the
independent non-executive Directors
serves in an executive capacity.
Political donations
It is our practice not to use shareholders’
funds for the purpose of making 
political donations either in the form 
of cash donations or other in-kind 
beneﬁts and consequently we have 
not sought shareholder approval to 
make such donations. 24 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report and the ﬁnancial statements for
the year ended 3 January 2004.
Principal activities
Tomkins is a world-class global engineering and manufacturing 
group with market and technical leadership across its three
businesses: Industrial & Automotive, Air Systems Components, and
Engineered & Construction Products. The principal subsidiary and
associated undertakings and their activities are listed in note 31 to 
the ﬁnancial statements.
Results
The audited ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 3 January
2004 are set out on pages 40 to 73. Proﬁt attributable to
shareholders is £171.8 million (eight months ended 31 December
2002 – £117.8 million).
A review of the businesses, activities and future developments 
of the Company and its subsidiaries is given on pages 2 to 18 and
should be read as part of this report.
Ordinary dividends
The Directors recommend an ordinary ﬁnal dividend of 7.4p per
ordinary share, to be paid on 1 June 2004 to ordinary shareholders
on the register as at the close of business on 30 April 2004. Together
with the ordinary interim dividend of 4.6p per share paid on 
10 November 2003, this makes a total dividend for the year 
of 12.0p (eight months ended 31 December 2002 – 8.0p).
Acquisitions and disposals
See note 29 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Resolutions at the Annual General Meeting
Resolution 7 is a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP 
as the Company’s independent auditors, following the transfer 
on 1 August 2003 by the Company’s auditors Deloitte & Touche of
their business to Deloitte & Touche LLP, a limited liability partnership
incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000. The
Company’s consent has been given to treating the appointment of
Deloitte & Touche as extending to Deloitte & Touche LLP under the
provisions of section 26(5) of the Companies Act 1989. 
Resolution 9 renews the Directors’ authority to issue relevant
securities up to an amount not exceeding £12,887,706, representing
257,754,120 ordinary shares of 5p each, being 33
1
⁄3 per cent of 
the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 
26 February 2004, until the next Annual General Meeting. The
Company held no shares in treasury as at 26 February 2004. There
are at present no plans to exercise this authority, except in relation
to share options and other similar categories of allotment.
Resolution 10 renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares 
for cash without ﬁrst offering them to existing shareholders 
on a pro rata basis until the next Annual General Meeting. 
If resolution 12 is approved at the Annual General Meeting, 
the authority will also cover the sale of treasury shares for cash. 
The authority sought is limited to the issue or, in the case of 
treasury shares, sale of up to 38,663,100 ordinary shares of 5p each
(£1,933,155), being approximately (but not more than) 5 per cent 
of the issued ordinary share capital as at 3 January 2004 and also 
as at 26 February 2004. Your Board conﬁrms its intention, in line
with the guidelines issued by representatives of institutional investors
and the London Stock Exchange, that not more than 7.5 per cent of
the issued ordinary share capital will be allotted or, in the case of
treasury shares, sold for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during any
three-year period.
Resolution 11 seeks authority for the Company to make market
purchases of its own ordinary shares up to a maximum of 
10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital. Your Board may
make purchases of the Company’s shares if it considers such
purchases will result in an increase in earnings per share and are
considered to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
If the Company purchases any of its ordinary shares pursuant to
resolution 11, the Company may cancel these shares or hold them 
in treasury. Such decision will be made by your Board at the time 
of purchase on the same basis as outlined above.
At last year’s AGM, the Company was given authority to make
market purchases of up to 115,868,703 ordinary shares of 5p each.
No ordinary 5p shares have been purchased by the Company in the
market since that date. The Company effected the early redemption
of the US$50 redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares
during the course of the year (see note 22 to the ﬁnancial
statements). The redemption of these shares was effected pursuant
to the resolutions passed at the extraordinary general and class
meetings held on 11 August 2003.
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares 
of 5p each in the Company outstanding at 26 February 2004 was
25,248,579, being 3.27 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital
(excluding treasury shares) as at that date. If the Company were 
to purchase the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted
(under the existing authority and resolution 11), the options
outstanding at 26 February 2004 would represent 4.35 per cent of
the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares).
Following new legislation, the Company may now hold its own
shares in treasury following their purchase. Resolution 12 is a
technical change to the Articles of Association of the Company so
that the Directors’ authority to allot shares for cash on a non-pre-
emptive basis pursuant to resolution 10 will also cover the sale, for
cash, of any shares held by the Company as treasury shares. The
limits set out in resolution 10 will apply to both the allotment of
new shares, and the sale of treasury shares, for cash. 
Directors
The Directors of the Company at the year end are listed on the next
page. They were all Directors throughout the year. Mr A J Reading
ceased to be a Director prior to the year end, on 31 December 2003.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Messrs. D B Newlands,
K Lever and Sir Brian Pitman retire by rotation and, being eligible,
offer themselves for re-appointment.
Directors’ interests 
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company 
are shown on the next page. No Director had any beneﬁcial interest
in the shares or loan stock of any other Group undertaking. The
executive Directors, as potential beneﬁciaries, are technically
deemed to have an interest in all ordinary shares held by or in which
the trustees of the Tomkins Employee Share Trust (the “Trust”) are
interested. The table includes, however, only those Trust shares
which are speciﬁcally allocated to the individual Director.
No changes took place in Directors’ interests during the period
from 4 January 2004 to 26 February 2004.
For details of the Directors’ options to purchase ordinary 
shares, please refer to the Remuneration Committee report on 
pages 31 to 37. 25 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

Research and development
Applied research and development work continues to be directed
towards the introduction of new and improved products and the
application of technology to reduce unit and operating costs and 
to improve services to customers.
Employment policies
Each company in the Group is encouraged to implement
comprehensive employment policies designed to identify employees
with its achievements and determine ways in which their knowledge
and skills can best contribute towards its success. Schemes are
introduced to ensure that loyalty and performance are properly
rewarded. The Tomkins Savings Related Share Option Scheme No. 2,
which provides an opportunity to purchase shares in Tomkins, is
open to all eligible employees as and when invitations 
to participate are issued. 
Employee involvement and communication programmes
continue to be developed, designed to provide equal opportunity
to all, irrespective of sex, race, religion or colour. Each company 
in the Group endeavours to provide equality of opportunity in
recruiting, training, promoting and developing the careers of
disabled persons.
Supplier payment policy
Tomkins requires its operating companies to determine terms and
conditions of payment for the supply of capital and revenue items
just as keenly as they negotiate prices and other commercial matters.
Suppliers are made clearly aware of the agreed terms and how any
disputes are to be settled and payment is made in accordance with
those terms.
The number of days credit taken by the Company for trade
purchases at 3 January 2004 was 22 days (eight months ended 
31 December 2002 – 23 days). The number of days credit taken 
by group companies for trade purchases at 3 January 2004 ranged
from 2 days to 183 days (eight months ended 31 December 2002 – 
13 days to 142 days).
The average number of days taken was 45 days (eight months
ended 31 December 2002 – 44 days).
Pensions
The Group operates retirement plans covering most employees. A
proportion are deﬁned beneﬁt plans funded by contributions from
both employer and employee, at rates determined by independent
actuaries in the light of regular valuations. Except where legislation
makes pre-funding ﬁnancially inappropriate, the remainder are money
purchase plans funded by contributions from employer and employee.
The funds are held independently of the Group’s ﬁnances and
administered by trustees. In the United Kingdom, Tomkins requests
that trustees prohibit fund managers from investing directly 
in the Company.
Charitable and political donations
Total charitable donations in the year were £563,163 (eight months
ended 31 December 2002 – £377,235) of which the United Kingdom
accounted for £110,090 (eight months ended 31 December 2002 –
£52,876); in the United States they totalled £353,751 (eight months
ended 31 December 2002 – £272,728), of which £161,607 (eight months
ended 31 December 2002 – £103,266) came from a Tomkins funded
charitable trust; and in the remaining overseas companies they
totalled £99,280 (eight months ended 31 December 2002 – £51,631).
No political donations were made during the year (eight months
ended 31 December 2002 – £nil).

INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. To fulﬁl this
responsibility the directors have established a planning, control 
and performance management framework within which each 
of the Group’s businesses operate. Within this framework, 
the management of each of the businesses considers strategic,
operational, commercial and ﬁnancial risks and identiﬁes risk
mitigation actions. Whilst acknowledging the overall responsibility
for the system of internal control the directors are aware that the
system is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives and can provide reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
During the period under review, the directors were not aware 
of any control breakdowns which resulted in a material loss.
The planning, control and performance management framework,
which includes an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group, has been in place
throughout the ﬁnancial year and up to the approval date of the
Annual Report and Accounts. Each business unit’s management
identiﬁes and assesses the key business risks affecting the
achievement of its objectives. Business unit management also
identiﬁes the risk management processes used to mitigate the 
key risks to an acceptable level and, where appropriate, additional
actions required to further manage and mitigate them. The risk
summaries developed out of this process are updated at least
annually. In addition, Corporate Centre management considers 
those risks to the Group’s strategic objectives that may not be
identiﬁed and managed at the business unit level.
In connection with quarterly business reviews, relevant 
executives discuss risk management activities with Corporate 
Centre management. The key risks and mitigation strategies are 
also discussed at least annually with the Audit Committee as well 
as the full Board.
The risk management framework described above is applied 
to major decision-making processes such as acquisitions as well 
as operational risks within the business including environmental, 
health and safety. 
The other key elements of the framework, which constitutes the
control environment, are:
Business strategy reviews – each business is required to prepare 
a strategic position assessment taking into account the current and
likely future market environment and competitive position of the
business with speciﬁc consideration given to strategic risk. The
Corporate Centre management reviews the strategy with each
business and the Board is presented with a summary of the plans.
Business reviews – on a quarterly basis, Corporate Centre
management performs extensive reviews with each business. 
These reviews consider current and projected ﬁnancial and
operating results, and address the progress of key strategic and
operating initiatives, the risks affecting their achievement and the
actions being taken by business unit management to manage the
risks and achieve their objectives.
Financial plans – each business prepares ﬁnancial plans in
accordance with a deﬁned format, which includes consideration 
of risks. To the extent that risks are both reasonably estimable and
likely to occur, they are reﬂected speciﬁcally in the respective
business’ plan. Management at the Corporate Centre reviews the
ﬁnancial plans with the business units and a summary is presented 
to the Board for approval.
Balance sheet reviews – business unit and Corporate Centre
ﬁnancial management conduct periodic, on-site reviews of
underlying rationale and support for the signiﬁcant line item
components comprising the balance sheets for each business 
in the Group.
Capital authorisation approval – all signiﬁcant capital
expenditures are subject to a formal capital authorisation process,
which takes into account, inter alia, operational, ﬁnancial and
technical risks. For signiﬁcant capital projects, a post-investment
analysis is completed to facilitate continuous improvement in the
capital planning process, including risk identiﬁcation and mitigation.
Reporting, analysis and forecasts – all businesses are required to
report monthly to the Corporate Centre on ﬁnancial performance
compared to plan, forecast and prior year and to explain signiﬁcant
variances from plan and changes in the business environment.
Monthly each business reassesses its forecast for the ﬁnancial 
year. Quarterly, each business prepares a forecast for the following
eighteen months and reviews projections for the three-year period
covered by the ﬁnancial plan.
Financial strategy – the ﬁnancial strategy includes assessment 
of the major ﬁnancial risks related to interest rate exposure, 
foreign currency exposure, debt maturity and liquidity. There is 
a comprehensive global insurance programme using the external
insurance market and some limited use of an internal captive
insurance company. Group Treasury manages hedging activities,
relating to ﬁnancial risks, with external cover for net currency
transaction exposures. The Group Tax function manages tax
compliance and tax risks associated with the Group’s activities.
The Audit Committee through the Finance Committee oversees 
the ﬁnancial strategy as well as the tax strategy and considers the
associated risks and risk management techniques being used by
the Group. 
Reporting certiﬁcations – in connection with the preparation 
of the annual and quarterly ﬁnancial statements, senior business
general management and ﬁnancial management sign a certiﬁcate
which includes a declaration regarding the existence of internal
controls, the proper recording of transactions and the identiﬁcation
and evaluation of signiﬁcant business risks.
Sarbanes-Oxley – as a foreign private issuer (FPI) listed on the
NYSE in the US, the Group is subject to the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). Speciﬁcally, Section 404
requires certiﬁcations by management regarding the effectiveness 
of internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting and requires our
external auditors to express an opinion on our assertions regarding
such internal controls. Accordingly, the Group is undertaking a
project to ensure we are in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 by 31 December 2005 (the effective date for the Group
as a FPI). While the certiﬁcation and external audit opinion on
internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting will be reported in Tomkins’
US SEC ﬁlings, the results of our compliance with the Act will serve
to further strengthen the internal control framework for the Group.
The Group established an internal audit function in 2001 and
uses a co-sourcing arrangement. The Vice President – Business 
Risk Assurance directs the activities of the internal auditors on a 
day-to-day basis and reports directly to the Audit Committee of 
the Board at least four times a year. As part of their ﬁnancial audit
responsibilities, the external auditors also provide reports to the
Audit Committee on the operation of internal controls affecting key
financial processes. The directors conﬁrm that the effectiveness of
the system of internal control for the year ended 31 December, 2003
has been reviewed in line with the criteria set out in the guidance
for directors on the Combined Code “Internal Control” issued 
in September 1999.  27
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
The Board promotes the highest standards of corporate governance
within the Company through its support and application of the
Principles of Good Governance set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code. A summary of the Company’s system of applying the principles
and the manner in which the provisions in Section 1 have been
complied with are set out in this report to shareholders. Section 1 of
the Combined Code sets out the main and supporting Principles of
Good Governance for companies, which are split into the following
areas: directors, remuneration, accountability and audit, and relations
with shareholders.
A DIRECTORS
1. The Board
The Company is controlled through its Board of Directors. The Board’s
main roles are to create value for shareholders, to provide leadership
of the Company, to approve the Company’s strategic objectives and 
to ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial and other resources are made
available to the management to enable them to meet those objectives.
The Board, which has reserved certain speciﬁc matters to itself for
decision, is responsible for approving overall Group strategy and
ﬁnancial policy, acquisition and divestment policy and major capital
expenditure projects. It also appoints and removes members of the
Board and Board Committees, and reviews recommendations of the
Remuneration Committee and the appointment of auditors and the
ﬁnancial performance and operation of each of the businesses. 
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group subject 
to certain ﬁnancial limits above which Board approval is required. 
Such delegated authority includes such matters as acquisitions and
divestitures, investments, capital expenditure, borrowing facilities 
and foreign currency transactions.
The Board of Directors is comprised of a non-executive Chairman,
ﬁve additional non-executive Directors and two executive Directors
who together, with their different ages, ﬁnancial, commercial,
technical and operational expertise and cultures, bring with them 
a wide range of experience to the Company. 
The Board has determined that David Newlands, Norman
Broadhurst, Jack Keenan, Ken Minton and Sir Brian Pitman are
independent, as they are independent of the Company’s executive
management and free from any material business or other
relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner,
shareholder or ofﬁcer of an organisation that has a relationship 
with the Company). 
Accordingly, the Board believes that there are no such relationships
that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgment. Marshall Wallach is the only non-executive Director deemed
not to be independent as a result of his advisory capacity to the Gates
family who, notwithstanding the redemption of the redeemable
convertible cumulative preference shares during the course of 2003,
remain substantial preference shareholders in the Company. Non-
executive directors are normally appointed for a period of two years,
which is renewable by agreement with the Board. The terms and
conditions of appointment of non-executive Directors are available for
inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal business
hours and will also be available for inspection at the Annual General
Meeting. The Combined Code recommends the appointment of a
senior independent non-executive Director and Sir Brian Pitman has
served in such capacity during the year under review.
The role of non-executive Directors is to challenge constructively,
and help develop, proposals on strategy, scrutinise the performance of
management in meeting agreed objectives and monitor the reporting
of performance, including satisfying themselves as to the integrity of
ﬁnancial information, and that ﬁnancial controls and systems of risk
management put in place by the Company are robust and effective.
They meet together from time to time in the absence of management
and the Chairman normally presides over such meetings.
Directors receive a range of information about the Company upon
appointment and, where appropriate, any training that is necessary for
them to carry out their duties effectively. An induction programme is
available which aims to provide an understanding of the Company as 
a whole, including its strategy, structure, geographical spread of
operations, ﬁnancial position, markets, products, technologies and
people, as well as the legal responsibilities of a Director. The Directors
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary whose
removal may be effected only with the approval of the Board. There is
an approved procedure by which all Directors can obtain independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense in furtherance of their
duties, if required; this procedure is reviewed periodically.
The Board meets not less than ﬁve times a year, and will hold
additional meetings when circumstances require. During the year 
to 3 January 2004, the Board met on seven occasions, including 
a meeting held solely to consider and approve Group strategy.
Between meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
update the non-executive Directors on current matters and there 
is frequent contact to progress the affairs of the Company.
Attendance by each individual Director at Board and Committee
meetings held during 2003 is set out in the table below:
Notes:
(1) N/A = Not applicable (where a Director is not a member of a Committee).
(2) The table provides details of the attendance record of each Director at meetings of the Board and of its respective Committees. During the year, other Directors have attended meetings of
the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee by invitation. These details are not included in the table.
(3) On the rare occasion where a Director cannot attend a meeting, he will normally, prior to the meeting, make his views on the agenda items known to the Chairman or, in respect of
Committee meetings, to the chairman of the respective Committee.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
continued
The Board sets the standards and values of the Company and much 
of this has been embodied in the Company’s Code of Conduct and
Ethics and Human Rights Policy which can be found on the Company’s
website www.tomkins.co.uk. The Code of Conduct and Ethics applies 
to all directors, ofﬁcers and employees, including the principal
executive, ﬁnancial and accounting ofﬁcers, as required by section 
406 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the related rules of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission and the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange. The Code contains provisions (in paragraph XVI) 
under which employees can report violations of company policy or 
any applicable law, rule or regulation including those of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission. US employees have the added
protection of section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which prohibits
the discrimination by a company or others against an employee where
such violations are reported. The current procedure, which is set out 
in Tomkins’ Code of Conduct and Ethics, provides for information to 
be given anonymously or by named employees under conditions of
conﬁdentiality. Those employees who come forward and give their
name are assured that they will receive the full protection of section
806 and no retaliation will take place. This is predominantly a US
requirement but the principles will be applied in other jurisdictions,
subject to local employment law.
Re-election of Directors
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company, 
David Newlands, Ken Lever and Sir Brian Pitman will stand for re-
election. Details of their terms of appointment can be found in the
Remuneration Committee Report. The Board strongly supports their 
re-election and recommends that shareholders vote in favour of their
re-election. David Newlands brings to the Board and the affairs of the
Company, considerable ﬁnancial and management experience having
been ﬁnance director of The General Electric Company, p.l.c. and a
non-executive director of a number of other companies. He also has
substantial experience in relationships with institutional shareholders.
Sir Brian Pitman spent almost 50 years with Lloyds Bank, becoming
Chief Executive in 1983 and Chairman for his last four years with the
bank. Having managed a large ﬁnancial institution, he brings extensive
experience to the Board, together with a wide knowledge of the City
and institutional shareholders and a particular emphasis on creating
shareholder value.
2. Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, with neither having unfettered 
powers of decision with respect to substantial matters. The Chairman 
is responsible for running the Board and ensures that all Directors
receive sufﬁcient relevant information on ﬁnancial, business and
corporate matters to enable them to participate effectively in Board
decisions. In advance of each meeting, the Board is provided with
comprehensive brieﬁng papers on items under consideration.
During the year, the Chairman, David Newlands, was appointed
chairman of Kesa Electrical plc and deputy chairman of The Standard
Life Assurance Company. Whilst these are important appointments, the
Board of Tomkins believes that the Chairman continues to be able to
carry out his duties and responsibilities effectively for the Company.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s primary role is the running of 
the Company’s businesses and the development and implementation 
of strategy.
The non-executive Directors have the opportunity to meet with 
the Chairman and with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer periodically, either
together or separately, to consider and discuss a wide range of matters
affecting the Company, its business, strategy and other matters.
3. Board performance evaluation
The Board conducted an evaluation of its own effectiveness and the
evaluation process concentrated on six key elements comprising: 
(i) the optimum mix of skills and knowledge amongst the Directors, 
(ii) clarity of goals and processes, (iii) tailoring the evaluation to the
speciﬁc circumstances of Tomkins, (iv) the culture of candour that
encourages constructive evaluation, (v) regular reviews of assessment
criteria and (vi) full disclosure of procedures and criteria to the Board.
The results of the ﬁrst evaluation were that, in general, much progress
had been made during the previous two years in improving the
effectiveness of the Board but progress could still be made in
improving overall performance. The evaluation found that the wide
range of skills and experience of the present group of Directors
provided a sound basis for an effective Board. Improvements in Board
performance could be achieved through a number of measures
including the use of a more formal induction programme for new
Directors, modiﬁcations to some Board processes and procedures, 
a greater understanding of the macro-economic environment in which
the Company’s businesses are operating and regular reviews of
succession planning initiatives. The matters identiﬁed in the Board
performance evaluation have been considered by the Board and 
action has been taken to address those matters.
The performance of the Chairman is reviewed and evaluated
annually by the Board in his absence and it is intended that the
evaluation of individual Directors and Board committees will
commence in 2004.
4. Board Committees
The Board has established a number of committees with 
their own delegated authorities as deﬁned in their terms of 
reference, which are reviewed periodically, and receives reports 
of their proceedings. A review of the terms of reference of 
Board Committees has been undertaken and amendments made 
to reﬂect recent changes in corporate governance requirements. 
The Board is satisﬁed that its Committees have written terms 
of reference which conform to best corporate governance 
practice. The terms of reference for all Board Committees 
can be found on the Company’s website www.tomkins.co.uk 
or a copy can be obtained by application to the Company 
Secretary at the Company’s registered ofﬁce.
The Board appoints the chairmen and members of 
all Board Committees upon the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee.
The Company Secretary is Secretary to all Board Committees.
The principal Committees, their membership, a brief description 
of their terms of reference and their duties are as follows:
Audit Committee
N N Broadhurst (Chairman), K J Minton, J M J Keenan.
The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee
are independent for the purposes of the new Combined Code and 
rule 10A.3(b)(1) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange’s Listed Company
Manual. In addition, the members have wide-ranging ﬁnancial,
commercial and management experience which they bring to the
work of the Audit Committee. A brief summary of their biographical
details is set out on page 19. The Chairman of the Committee,
Norman Broadhurst is a chartered accountant (FCA) and a Fellow 
of the Institute of Corporate Treasurers, having previously been group
ﬁnance director of Railtrack PLC (1994 to 2000) and joint deputy chief
executive and ﬁnance director of VSEL Consortium PLC (1990 to 1994).
In accordance with section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,  29 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
the Board has determined that Norman Broadhurst is an “audit
committee ﬁnancial expert” as that term is deﬁned under the rules 
of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, having signiﬁcant,
relevant and up-to-date UK and US ﬁnancial and accounting
knowledge and experience.
The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year and 
on other occasions when circumstances require and reviews the
Company’s ﬁnancial statements and reports (including earnings
releases) before they are submitted to the Board for approval. It
reviews the Company’s ﬁnancial and corporate controls, accounting
policies, internal audit and business risk assurance activities and 
it monitors compliance with statutory requirements for ﬁnancial
reporting. It also keeps under review the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal control systems (including ﬁnancial, operational and
compliance controls and risk management procedures). It considers
reports from external auditors, internal auditors, business risk
assurance executives and from other members of management and
reports and makes recommendations to the Board. In addition, the
Audit Committee keeps under review the scope and results of the
external audit, its cost effectiveness, the independence and objectivity
of the auditor and the nature and extent of non-audit services
supplied to the Group by the external auditor, seeking to balance 
the maintenance of objectivity and value for money.
In determining its policy on the extent of non-audit services
provided by the external auditor, the Committee takes account of the
rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission which regulate
and, in certain circumstances, prohibit certain types of non-audit
services, certain other rules, including those relating to audit partner
rotation, and relevant ethical guidance issued by the professional
bodies in the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, in
particular that the external auditor should not audit its own ﬁrm’s
work, make management decisions for the Company, create a
mutuality of interest nor be put in the position of advocate for the
Company. The Committee believes that, taken together, the adoption
of these rules and regulations provides adequate protection of auditor
independence. All fees proposed by the external auditor must be
reported to the Audit Committee and prior approval is required 
from the Chairman of the Audit Committee for any projects above
speciﬁed limits.
The Company’s practice, in accordance with the UK Companies 
Act and new Combined Code in relation to the appointment and
termination of the external auditor, involves a recommendation from
the Audit Committee to the Board, which will then make a
recommendation to shareholders in general meeting. This differs from
the procedure in the US, where the external auditor is accountable 
to the Audit Committee, which has the authority to appoint or dismiss
the external auditors without reference to shareholders.
With the approval of the Board, the Committee has established
guidelines for the recruitment of employees or former employees of
the external auditor. Tomkins will not engage, on a part-time or full-
time basis, any person who is or was an employee of the Company’s
external auditor, where that person has worked on the Group’s audit
either as a principal or partner at any time during a period of not less
than three years prior to the proposed date of joining the Tomkins
Group. In addition, though Tomkins may employ an employee of the
Company’s external auditor where such person has never worked on
the Group’s audit either as a principal or partner, a period of not less
than one year must elapse prior to the proposed date of that person
joining the Company. Any former employee of the external auditor
who joined the Company before the external auditor was appointed
will remain unaffected. 
The Committee met four times during the year to 3 January 2004 and
reports regularly to the Board on its activities. The Company’s internal
and external auditors attend meetings and have the opportunity to
raise matters or concerns in the absence of executive Directors and
other senior executives at separate meetings with the Committee and
at other times.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference take account of the Guidance
Notes set out in Sir Robert Smith’s Report published in January 2003.
Remuneration Committee
K J Minton (Chairman), N N Broadhurst, J M J Keenan.
The Remuneration Committee, which meets at least twice a year and
on other occasions when circumstances require, comprises independent
non-executive Directors and has responsibility for determining
Company policy on executive remuneration for approval by the Board.
It also determines speciﬁc remuneration packages and compensation
packages on employment or early termination of ofﬁce for each of the
executive Directors of the Company. The Committee takes independent
advice from consultants as and when required. All decisions of the
Remuneration Committee in respect of remuneration packages of
executive Directors are referred to the Board. No executive Director
takes part in any discussion or decision concerning his own
remuneration. The Remuneration Committee also monitors the
compensation packages of other senior executives in the Group below
Board level.
The report of the Remuneration Committee can be found on 
page 31.
Nomination Committee
D B Newlands (Chairman), N N Broadhurst, J M J Keenan, K J Minton, 
Sir Brian Pitman, M F Wallach.
The Nomination Committee makes recommendations to the Board 
on all proposed appointments of Directors through a formal and
transparent procedure. The Committee meets as and when required. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Directors are
subject to re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting immediately
following the date of their appointment, and thereafter they have to
seek re-appointment no more than three years from the date they
were last re-appointed. The Committee recommends to the Board the
names of the Directors who are to seek re-appointment at the Annual
General Meeting.
During the year, no new Board appointments were made.
Accordingly, the Nomination Committee was not called upon to initiate
a recruitment process, but the Committee and Board are aware of and
support the principles set out in section A.4 of the new Combined Code.
Health, Safety and Environment Committee
K J Minton (Chairman), J Nicol, M F Wallach.
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee meets at least four
times a year. The Committee is chaired by an independent non-
executive Director and its membership also includes the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer. Its principal role is to determine on behalf of the Board the
framework or broad policy and objectives in the areas of health, safety
and the environment (“HSE”) and propose any amendments to existing
policies for approval by the Board. It also reviews management’s
performance in the achievement of HSE objectives and reviews HSE
reports produced by business units for compliance with all health,
safety and environmental local codes of practice, legislation and
relevant industry practice. More details of the work of the Health,
Safety and Environment Committee can be found in the Corporate
Social Responsibility report on page 20. 30 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
continued
General Purposes Committee
J Nicol (Chairman), K Lever, E H Lewzey, J E Middleton, N C Porter, 
K A Sullivan, M T Swain, N P Wilkinson.
The General Purposes Committee meets as and when required. It
comprises executive Directors and senior executives and the quorum
requires the presence of at least one executive Director. The Committee
deals principally with day-to-day matters of a routine nature and
matters delegated to it by the Board.
B REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee report to shareholders can be found on
page 31 and sets out the Company’s remuneration policy, procedures
and the remuneration of individual Directors and related information.
C ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
Financial reporting
The Board, through the Operating review and Financial review, 
seeks to provide a detailed review of each business of the Group. 
In conjunction with the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer’s statement, the Financial review and the Directors’ report, the
Board seeks to present a balanced and understandable assessment of
the Company’s position and prospects.
Internal control
Further information on the internal control environment within which
Tomkins operates may be found in the Directors’ statement on internal
control on page 26.
Going concern
The Directors’ statement in relation to the Company and Group
functioning on a going concern basis appears in the Financial review
on page 17.
“Whistleblower” reporting procedures
Under section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all public companies,
including non-US public companies such as Tomkins, acting through 
the Audit Committee of the Board must provide a procedure for 
(i) the receipt and retention, and (ii) the treatment of complaints
received by the Company regarding accounting, internal controls 
or auditing matters. A procedure has been agreed in principle by the
Audit Committee for the conﬁdential and anonymous submission by
employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing
matters and is expected to be put in place by June 2004.
D RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company places a high degree of importance on maintaining
good relationships and communications with both institutional and
private investors and ensures that shareholders are kept informed 
of signiﬁcant Company developments.
In order to assist members of the Board to gain an understanding
of the views of institutional shareholders, at each of its meetings the
Board receives an Investor Relations Report, which covers a wide range
of matters including a commentary on the perception of the Company
and views expressed by the investment community. Analysts’ reports
are also made available to all Directors. The announcement of
quarterly, interim and ﬁnal results provides opportunities for the
Company to answer questions from institutional shareholders covering
a wide range of topics. There is a regular dialogue with institutional
shareholders to ensure mutual understanding of objectives. The Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer participates in industry conferences organised by
investment banks, which are attended by existing and potential
shareholders, and he holds regular meetings with analysts and
institutional shareholders. The Chairman also maintains regular contact
with a number of the Company’s major shareholders. The Company
exercises care to ensure that all price-sensitive information is released
to all shareholders at the same time, as required by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority and Regulation FD in the US.
The Company’s website www.tomkins.co.uk provides shareholders
and potential investors with information about the Company including
annual and interim reports, trading updates, recent announcements,
investor presentations, share price information, group policies and the
terms of reference of its Board Committees. Shareholders are also able
to put questions to the Company via its website.
The Company aims to deal expeditiously with all enquiries from
individual shareholders on a wide range of matters. Individual
shareholders also have the opportunity of attending the Annual
General Meeting to put questions to the Chairman and chairmen of
Board Committees. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer gives a presentation to
shareholders covering a wide range of matters affecting the Company
and its business and shareholders also have the opportunity to ask him
questions. The Company indicates the level of proxy votes lodged in
respect of each resolution proposed at its Annual General Meeting
following each vote on a show of hands. In the event of a poll being
called, the result will be published as soon as possible after the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting. Directors also meet
informally with shareholders before and after the meeting. The
Company keeps under review ways in which it can communicate more
effectively with its shareholders throughout the year, as well as at the
Annual General Meeting.
It has been the Company’s practice to send the Notice of the
Annual General Meeting and related papers to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting and to propose separate
resolutions on each substantially separate issue.
Institutional shareholders
The Board notes that Section 2 of the new Combined Code seeks to
encourage more active participation by institutional shareholders
including entering into a dialogue with companies and making
considered use of their votes – principles which the Company supports.
Compliance statement
The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority require the Board
to report on compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1 of
the Combined Code. The new Combined Code, issued in July 2003, 
is only effective for reporting years beginning on or after 1 November
2003. However, Tomkins considers that throughout the year to
3 January 2004 the Company has been in compliance with the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the new Combined Code, except 
for those matters indicated in the Corporate Governance Report and
the Remuneration Committee Report.
The certiﬁcations of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Finance
Director required under section 302 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002, and the related rules of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission, will be ﬁled as exhibits to the Company’s Form 20-F. 
In addition, following the Annual General Meeting, Mr. Nicol will
certify to the New York Stock Exchange that he is unaware of any
violations by the Company of the New York Stock Exchange’s 
corporate governance listing standards.
The Company has placed on its website, www.tomkins.co.uk, 
a general summary of the signiﬁcant ways in which the Company’s
corporate governance differs from that followed by domestic US
companies under the New York Stock Exchange’s listing standards, 
as required by section 303A.11. 31
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
1. INTRODUCTION
This report to shareholders sets out the membership of the Remuneration Committee and the names of the advisers who provided services to the
Committee during the year to 3 January 2004. The policies that have been followed by the Remuneration Committee during the year in determining
the elements of executive remuneration have also been set out, together with the policies and principles to be followed by the Committee over the
next two years.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, which sets out statutory requirements for the
disclosure of Directors’ remuneration. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and
describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. Schedule 7A requires the auditors to
report to the Company’s members on the auditable part of the Remuneration Committee report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part
of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
Since the Report and Accounts for the eight months ended 31 December 2002, the Board has modified the terms of reference for the
Remuneration Committee to reflect current best practice. The principal responsibility of the Committee is to determine the framework or broad
policy for the Company’s executive remuneration and the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, for approval by the Board. The
remuneration of non-executive Directors is a matter for the Board itself. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found on
the Company’s website www.tomkins.co.uk.
Details of the emoluments, bonuses, benefits-in-kind, incentive arrangements (including share options and other long term incentives), pensions
and service contracts applicable to each Director who served during the year are given in this report.
The report will be put to the vote of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
2. MEMBERSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AND ADVISERS (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Remuneration Committee is made up exclusively of non-executive Directors whom the Board determined to be independent as each was found
to be free from any material business or other relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organisation
that has a relationship with the Company). Accordingly, the Board believes that there are no such relationships that could materially interfere with
the exercise of their independent judgement. Members of the Committee who served throughout the year were:
K J Minton (Chairman)
N N Broadhurst
J M J Keenan
There were no changes to the membership of the Committee during the year. 
The Committee consults with the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer concerning matters of executive remuneration. The
Committee also received advice from external advisers who were appointed by the Company, namely PA Consulting concerning the Company’s new
Annual Bonus Incentive Plan. PA Consulting provided no other professional services to the Tomkins Group during the year. Mercer Human Resource
Consulting provided pension advice in respect of Executive Directors and senior executives and provided professional services in the area of pension
scheme advice.
3. STATEMENT OF COMPANY’S POLICY ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The policies operated by the Company during the year and those to be applied over the next two years, are set out below:
Executive remuneration
The Company’s policy on executive remuneration is that the Remuneration Committee and Board should satisfy itself that executives, including
executive Directors, are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group’s performance. The Remuneration Committee has sought to
ensure that executive Directors receive a level of remuneration that is appropriate to their scale of responsibility and performance and which will
attract, motivate and retain individuals of the necessary calibre. The only pensionable element of executive Directors’ remuneration is basic salary.
This policy applies whether or not an executive Director is a member of the Tomkins Retirement Benefits Plan or has a personal pension arrangement.
Annual remuneration for executives
The Board recognises that one of its key objectives is to grow the value of the business for the benefit of shareholders and that such growth is
strongly related, amongst other things, to the degree of entrepreneurial spirit in the Group. In order to create the necessary entrepreneurial impetus
within an organisation, compensation arrangements are required which are similar to those that an owner of a business would seek. This has led 
to the adoption of a remuneration policy whereby levels of total remuneration are set which attract, retain and motivate executives, and which are
provided through a combination of base salaries at median level or below and annual bonuses that have a direct and proportionate link to total
value created for shareholders. This provides the incentive for executives to act like owners of the business. The Remuneration Committee and the
Board believe that this more closely aligns the interests of shareholders and management whereby executives only receive substantial rewards when
they have created high value in the business.
Over time and subject to the achievement of value-creating performance targets, this policy is likely to lead to a realignment of the component
parts of total executive remuneration, so that a greater part of the total package received by executives is made up of incentive pay with the
remainder coming from base salaries at the median level or below. The establishment of performance targets for the Company’s executive share
option schemes and the new incentive pay arrangements, ensures that a substantial proportion of total remuneration is directly related to actual
measurable performance. Further details of the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan are set out in section 5b on page 34.  32 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
continued
Non-executive Directors’ fees and Chairman’s remuneration
The executive members of the Board review from time-to-time the fees of non-executive Directors, who play no part in determining their own
remuneration. The Chairman’s remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee (in the absence of the Chairman) and is approved 
by the Board. In future, the review of non-executive Directors’ fees and the Chairman’s remuneration will take place every two years.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy on Directors’ service contracts is that service contracts and letters of appointment for executive Directors normally provide
for notice periods of no longer than twelve months. On appointment, a longer notice period may apply, but this will reduce over time to the
normal twelve months’ notice period. Notwithstanding the provisions in an executive Director’s service contract or letter of appointment
concerning termination payments, the Company will seek to reduce any compensation that may be payable to reflect the departing Director’s
obligations to mitigate loss.
External appointments
The Company’s policy on external appointments is that, with the approval of the Chairman of the Board, executive Directors are permitted to hold
appointments outside the Company. Any fees payable in connection with such appointments are normally retained by Directors unless otherwise
agreed. See further details set out in section 10 below.
Long term incentives and share options – Performance conditions and phasing
The Company has operated a number of share-based long-term incentive schemes in the past but following a review of executive remuneration, the
Remuneration Committee and Board expect the number of plans and schemes to reduce over time as they lapse and are not renewed or replaced.
This affects The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) and The Tomkins Long Term Loyalty Plan. Existing obligations in respect of those schemes will
be honoured but no new commitments will be entered into. No further awards will be made under the Group’s share-based incentive plans, other
than The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme, which in due course will also be phased out, as awards cease to vest under the RSP.
As regards share options, the Company’s policy on performance conditions and phasing is to align the interests of scheme participants with
those of shareholders by setting appropriate performance conditions at levels that encourage and stretch management to maximise value creation.
In addition, performance conditions are selected that take account of current industry practice. Performance conditions, where applicable, for each
of the schemes operated by the Company are given below. The Company has operated a policy of phasing the grant of options and recognises
that, in exceptional cases, it may be necessary to increase initial grants to attract and retain senior executives and employees with specialist skills.
Other than options granted under the employees’ savings related share option scheme, no options are granted at a discount to the market price.
No amount is payable by the employee on the grant of an option. The current executive share option schemes will lapse for the purpose of
making grants in 2005.
Retirement benefits
The Company’s retirement benefit plan was closed to new members in April 2002 and, since that time, the Company’s policy has been that new
employees, including executive Directors and senior executives, will receive a payment from the Company to enable them to make contributions to
retirement benefit schemes of their choice on behalf of themselves and their dependants. No change to this policy is expected over the next two years.
James Nicol and Ken Lever are not entitled to any retirement benefits defined in terms of final or average salary but they receive a payment 
at an annual rate of 37.5 per cent of their basic salary, to enable them to make contributions to retirement benefit schemes of their choice on behalf
of themselves and their dependants. All payments made by Tomkins plc were for the year ending 3 January 2004.

3 Benefits in kind include company car and related costs, medical cover and life assurance. 
Benefits in kind for James Nicol for the year to 3 January 2004 included the following elements:
(a) a buy-out bonus payment and relocation allowance of £23,333 per month for a period of three years commencing 18 February 2002, such payments to cease on termination of employment, 
if sooner;
(b) a cash payment under the Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan equivalent to the net dividend payable on 1,015,228 shares of Tomkins plc;
(c) on 26 April 2002, the Company entered into a short-term lease on a property that will be occupied by James Nicol and his family from 1 June 2002 to 30 June 2004. James Nicol has provided 
an indemnity to ensure that the Company’s commitment as to the cost of such property is limited to that provided in his service contract; and
(d) other benefits in accordance with the terms of his contract.
4 During the year, non-executive Directors were paid a basic fee at the rate of £30,000 per annum, plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares. On 23 July 2003, 2,000 shares were purchased for each of them at 
a market price of £2.45 and the cost of these shares forms part of their remuneration. In addition, the Chairmen of the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and the Health, Safety and
Environment Committee were each paid an additional £5,000 per annum. As a member of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee, Marshall Wallach is paid an additional £2,500 
per annum. As a member of the Remuneration and Audit Committees, Jack Keenan is paid an additional £2,000 per annum in total.
5 Anthony Reading stood down from the Board on 31 December 2003 and his basic salary included £397,217 paid in connection with the early termination of his employment representing 51 weeks’
salary. Included within his benefits in kind is an amount of £4,700 in respect of relocation expenses paid in connection with the early termination of employment. The Company has undertaken
responsibility for the sale of Anthony Reading’s house in the USA as part of his relocation back to the UK. 
During the year no Director exercised any options and accordingly no gains or losses were made on exercise (Anthony Reading for the eight month period to 31 December 2002 – gain of £22,825).
Retirement benefits
James Nicol and Ken Lever are not entitled to any retirement benefits defined in terms of final or average salary but, in addition to the figures
above, they receive a payment at an annual rate of 37.5 per cent of their basic salary, which for the year ending 3 January 2004 amounted to
£293,000 (eight months to 31 December 2002 – £188,000) and £141,000 (eight months to 31 December 2002 – £88,000) respectively, to enable
them to make contributions to retirement benefit schemes of their choice on behalf of themselves and their dependants.
Chairman’s remuneration
The Remuneration Committee noted during the course of the year that since David Newlands became Chairman of Tomkins in June 2000, 
his remuneration had remained the same. Having taken into consideration comparative remuneration data, the contribution made by the
Chairman to the Company’s affairs and the time he devotes to the Company’s business, the Committee recommended to the Board that his
remuneration should be increased from £150,000 to £175,000 per annum plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares, with effect from 1 January 2004. This
recommendation was approved by the Board.
Non-executive Directors fees
The executive members of the Board reviewed the fees paid to non-executive Directors and noted that the basic fee paid to non-executive
Directors of £30,000 plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares was last reviewed in 2000. Having taken into consideration comparative remuneration data, the
contribution made by individual non-executive Directors to the Company’s affairs, the time they devoted to the Company’s business, and the extra
responsibilities placed upon them arising from the changes in corporate governance requirements in the UK and the US, the executive Directors
concluded that the basic fee should be increased to £40,000 plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares commencing 1 January 2004. At the same time, the fee
paid to the Chairman of the Audit Committee was increased to £15,000 per annum, the fee paid to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
was increased to £10,000 per annum and the fee paid to the Chairman of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee was increased to £12,500
per annum. Members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of £7,500 per annum, members of the Remuneration Committee will
receive an additional £5,000 per annum and non-executive members of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee will receive £5,000 per
annum and £1,500 per meeting day, all with effect from 1 January 2004. 34 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
continued
b. Current schemes – Annual Bonus Incentive Plan, Share Options and Long-term Incentives
(i) Annual Bonus Incentive Plan
The executive Directors and senior executives participate in the Company’s Annual Bonus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Each participant in the Plan
receives a percentage of “bonusable profit” of the business for which he or she has responsibility. “Bonusable profit” is based on operating profit less
a charge for tax, less certain exceptional items and less a charge for invested capital. The objective of the Plan is to reward the senior executives for
increasing the overall value created in the business based on the margin of the after-tax return on invested capital in excess of the weighted average
cost of capital. Accordingly, “bonusable profit” may increase at a faster rate than operating profit where the margin of the return over the cost of
capital increases. This aligns the interests of management and shareholders.
In arriving at “bonusable profit”, adjustments may be made for operating exceptional items relating to strategic manufacturing initiatives to
match the costs of the strategic manufacturing initiatives to the benefits over a period of up to three years. Adjustments are also made for non-
operating exceptional items. Such adjustments are made with the approval of the Remuneration Committee. The charge for taxation reflects the
ongoing charge for tax excluding any benefit from exceptional adjustments to tax provisions. The charge for invested capital is based on applying
the estimated weighted average cost of capital to the average invested capital in the Group. The estimated weighted average cost of capital takes
into account the capital structure of the Group and the costs associated with each element of capital. It is estimated to be 9 per cent. The invested
capital is based on the book value of assets in the Group excluding goodwill relating to acquisitions made prior to 30 December 1999.
The incentive bonus of the executive Directors of Tomkins plc is based on a percentage of the “bonusable profit” of the Group which, for the
year ended 3 January 2004, was £96.3 million. James Nicol received the sum of £1,146,000, Ken Lever received the sum of £337,000 and Anthony
Reading received the sum of £160,000, which took account of the businesses for which he had responsibility. In the current financial year, Anthony
Reading is entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 51 weeks from 1 January 2004 as part of his termination arrangements. Although there is no
limit to the “bonusable profit” on which bonuses are calculated, significant growth in “bonusable profit” in any one year is unlikely to arise due 
to the nature of the Group’s business.
The bonus awards are payable as to four-sevenths in cash, one-seventh in bonus shares and two-sevenths in deferred shares. The bonus is paid
at the end of June, September and December based on 75 per cent of the bonus earned to the end of the previous quarter with the balance of
the full entitlement to the bonus for the calendar year paid at the end of March following the calendar year end. 
Bonus shares are restricted and vest only after a period of three years after the initial bonus award. Dividends are paid on the bonus shares.
Deferred shares are awarded at the time of the initial bonus award but the vesting of the shares is conditional on continued employment with 
the Group three years after the award. Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares.
As a condition of continued participation in the Plan, the executive Directors are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent to one
year’s total after tax remuneration including bonus based on an average of the previous three years. Increases in annual base salary of participants
are restricted to the equivalent rate of increase in the Retail Price Index (in the UK) or equivalent index in the country in which a participant works.
The restrictions on the increases in salary together with the growth in bonus, assuming increases in bonusable profit, will result in the incentive pay
element of remuneration increasing over time. The share awards will increase the investment each of the directors has in Tomkins plc shares.
(ii) Share Options
The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme (No. 2) (“ESOS 2”), The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No. 3 (“ESOS 3”) and The Tomkins
Executive Share Option Scheme No. 4 (“ESOS 4”)
ESOS 2 has expired for grant purposes, though options already granted remain outstanding and can be exercised in accordance with the rules 
of the scheme.
ESOS 3 is an Inland Revenue-approved scheme under which Tomkins employees who are resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes 
are able to receive options with an aggregate exercise price not exceeding £30,000 that attract favourable tax treatment. 
ESOS 4 is not approved by the Inland Revenue and is a scheme under which options granted do not attract favourable tax treatment in the
United Kingdom. There is a limit to the number of options that can be granted under the ESOS 4 scheme of four times annual remuneration
(which includes annual bonuses and certain benefits-in-kind). Under ESOS 4, options granted in excess of four times a participant’s annual earnings
(“super options”) will only be exercisable if at least five years have elapsed since the date of grant and then only if, over a five-year period
following the grant of the option, the growth in the Company’s earnings per share is such that it would be in the top quartile of a league table for
growth in earnings per share over a five-year period for companies in the FTSE 100 index.
ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 will continue and their current performance condition will remain in place until they lapse for grant purposes in 2005. 
The performance condition is based upon the growth in Tomkins earnings per share, which must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index 
by an average of 2 per cent per annum over a three-year period before an option can be exercised. When the schemes were introduced in 1995,
the earnings per share performance condition was widely adopted and the choice of 2 per cent was in accordance with contemporary practice. 
In determining whether or not the growth in earnings per share performance condition has been met, a simple arithmetic calculation is made
annually when the Company’s results are known. 35 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
Tomkins Premium Priced Option
This was an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol as part of the incentive package on his joining Tomkins. No performance conditions
were attached to this option in order to attract him to the Company and retain his services and this therefore does not comply with Schedule A 
of the Combined Code. It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire 5,076,142 shares with an aggregate market value of £10 million, granted
on 11 February 2002. The price per share payable on the exercise of the option will be 197 pence in respect of 2,538,072 shares (A option shares),
276 pence in respect of 1,522,842 shares (B option shares) and 345 pence in respect of 1,015,228 shares (C option shares). The options vested as 
to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2003, will vest as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2004 and as to
one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2005. The option will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances.
Ongoing Option
This was also an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol on 11 February 2002, as part of the incentive package to attract him to the
Company. It consisted of a non-transferable option to acquire 1,522,842 shares at 197 pence, which may not be exercised before 18 February 2005
and unless and until the performance condition has been satisfied or waived. The performance condition will be achieved if, on or after the third
anniversary of the date of grant, the rate of increase of earnings per share over any three-year period is equal to or greater than the rate of increase
of the Retail Price Index plus 9 per cent. The performance condition may be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee. If there is a
change of control of the Company then the option is exercisable immediately regardless of whether the performance condition is satisfied. The same
lapsing events for the Premium Priced Option, apply to this option.
If there is a variation in the share capital of the Company the Remuneration Committee may adjust the number of shares in either the Premium
Priced Option or the Ongoing Option as it reasonably deems appropriate to take account of the variation.
The Tomkins Savings Related Share Option Scheme No. 2
This is a standard Inland Revenue-approved savings related share option scheme, which is open to employees who are resident for tax purposes in
the United Kingdom. No grants under this scheme were made during the year.

2 Options included in the above table relate to the Tomkins Executive Share Option Schemes No. 3 and No. 4 (J Nicol 2,569,456 shares, K Lever 1,078,000 shares) and, in the case of James Nicol, 
Premium Priced Options (5,076,142 shares) and Ongoing Options (1,522,842 shares).
(iii) Long-term Incentives
Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan
This was specifically and solely introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company. Under the Deferred
Matching Share Purchase Plan 3,045,684 shares (“Matching Shares”) were awarded on 11 February 2002 following the purchase by James Nicol of
1,015,228 Tomkins plc shares (the “Purchased Shares”). After three years from 18 February 2002, or earlier in certain circumstances, the award will
vest in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares. The remaining 2,030,456 Matching Shares will vest according to the share price at that time, to the
extent that, for every 1 pence that the share price increases over 197 pence, being the market price on 8 February 2002, up to a maximum of 591
pence, James Nicol will receive 5,153 shares. He may elect at any time prior to the vesting of the award to receive either the shares, or at his
option, a cash payment equal to the market value on the date of the award. The award is conditional upon James Nicol (or his relatives or trustees
of a family trust fund) holding the Purchased Shares for at least three years. Until the award vests in respect of at least one-third of the Matching
Shares, James Nicol is entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the net dividends payable on the Purchased Shares. The cash payment shall
reduce pro rata to the extent of any vesting of the award up to one-third of the Matching Shares. The aggregate value of the entitlement of
James Nicol in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares and a further 371,016 Matching Shares (derived from 5,153 shares multiplied by the difference
in the market price at 3 January 2004 of 269 pence and 197 pence) at the year end amounted to £3,729,000 (31 December 2002 – £1,929,000). 36 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT

c. Closed schemes – The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”), The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme (“SMS”) and The Tomkins Long Term Loyalty
Plan (“LTLP”)
The RSP required either an element of annual cash bonus to be taken in restricted shares in the form of a Trustee Award, or employees could acquire
further shares in the Company in the form of a Company Award, using cash bonuses already paid to them. Both Trustee and Company Awards were
subject to forfeiture if an employee left the Company before the end of a three-year restricted period. The last award made was in July 2001.
The SMS matched vested Trustee or Company Awards under the RSP. SMS awards were up to two conditional share matching awards vesting 
a further two years and four years respectively after the end of the RSP restricted period, each award being for the same number of ordinary shares
vesting under the RSP, with proportionate reductions to the matching awards on a disposal of any vested shares. When existing commitments to
match RSP awards have been satisfied, the SMS will close.
The LTLP allowed participants to use their own funds to acquire Tomkins shares, which were matched up to a maximum of 100,000 matched
shares per employee. The sale or transfer of any of the shares purchased by the employee at any time during a seven-year restricted period would
result in the forfeiture of the matched shares. The last awards made were in July 1997.
With shareholder approval, these share schemes were introduced in 1995 and 1996 with no performance conditions attached and accordingly

The Directors’ current interests in Tomkins shares are set out in the Directors’ report on page 24 and, in the case of the executive Directors, where
appropriate these include shares held through their participation in the RSP, SMS and LTLP (together the “Schemes”).
The interests of the Directors in Tomkins ordinary shares held within the Schemes that are yet to vest and yet to be included in Directors’
remuneration were as follows:
3 January 31 December 
Scheme 2004 Awarded Vested 2002 Vesting
Director or Plan Number Number Number Number Period
K Lever RSP 100,000 – 1,869 101,869 2004
SMS 1,809 1,809 – – 2005
A J Reading (to 31 December 2003) SMS – – 17,320 17,320 2003
LTLP – – 100,000 100,000 2003
1 Ken Lever’s RSP award of 100,000 shares will vest at the end of the three-year restricted period, but will not be eligible for a matching award under the SMS.
2 Within the RSP, the value of entitlements for current Directors at 3 January 2004 was £269,000 (31 December 2002 – £194,000). During the year 1,869 shares vested under the RSP at 267.75 pence per
share, market value £5,000, in respect of Ken Lever (period ended 31 December 2002 – £25,000 in respect of former Director Anthony Reading).
3 For the SMS, the value of entitlements for current Directors at 3 January 2004 was £5,000 (31 December 2002 – £33,000). 1,809 shares were awarded to Ken Lever on 25 November 2003 (in relation 
to the vesting of the RSP award made on 15 August 2000) with a market value of £5,000 when the market price per share was 271.25 pence per share (period ended 31 December 2002 – £24,000 in
respect of former Director Anthony Reading). No other Director received an award under the SMS during the year.
During the year 17,320 shares vested under the SMS at 267.50 pence per share, market value £46,000, in respect of Anthony Reading (period ended 31 December 2002 – £138,000 in respect of former
director David Snowdon and £23,000 in respect of former director Richard Marchant). At 3 January 2004, 1,809 shares were required to be retained by Ken Lever in order to allow the SMS award in the
above table to vest in the relevant vesting period (31 December 2002 – 117,320 shares required to be retained by Anthony Reading). No other current Director was required to retain shares in this
respect at 3 January 2004.
4 Within the LTLP, the value of entitlements for current Directors at 3 January 2004 was £nil (31 December 2002 – £190,000). During the year 100,000 shares vested under the LTLP at 267.50 pence per
share, market value – £268,000, in respect of Anthony Reading (period ended 31 December 2002 – £254,000 in respect of former director David Snowdon and £94,000 in respect of former director
Richard Marchant).
6. RETIREMENT BENEFITS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
James Nicol and Ken Lever are not entitled to any retirement benefits defined in terms of final or average salary but they receive a payment at an
annual rate of 37.5 per cent of their basic salary, to enable them to make contributions to retirement benefit schemes of their choice on behalf of
themselves and their dependants. All payments made by Tomkins plc were for the year ending 3 January 2004. The normal retirement age of the
Directors is 60.
Retirement benefits, defined in final salary terms, accrued during the year ending 3 January 2004 for Anthony Reading. The Tomkins Retirement
Benefits Plan (the ”RBP”) provides pension and other benefits within Inland Revenue limits. Total benefits for Anthony Reading are in excess of
prescribed limits. The excess benefits for him are unfunded. 
The accrued benefit entitlements and transfer values were:

total of accrued of accrued Accumulated pension at
Age at pension at pension at total of accrued 30 April 2002 Increase in

Name of director £000 pa £000 £000 pa £000 £000
A J Reading 60 189 2,484 103 1,475 1,009
The transfer values are the full cash equivalent of the accrued pension, at the stated date, calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note
GN11 Version 8.1. 
The increase in transfer value takes into account that Tomkins has consented to Anthony Reading’s early retirement. The terms of early retirement
in this event are laid down under the Rules of the RBP. 37 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
Accrual for Anthony Reading as a Director ceased on 31 December 2003. He continued in service beyond his sixtieth birthday, and his alternative
pension formula based on retiring at 65 applies. Pensionable Earnings on this formula comprises basic earnings only. Re-calculating his accrual to 
31 December 2002 on the formula would have resulted in an accrued pension of £152,000 pa (higher than the £103,000 pa accrued pension disclosed
last year, but of less value). His accrual was augmented during the year by £13,256 pa, the benefit he would have accrued as a Director during the
2004 year. 
Taking account of the re-calculated accrual to 31 December 2002 and the augmentation to his accrual of £13,256, the total increase in accrual 
for Anthony Reading in the period, after allowing for inflation, amounted to £33,123. The total increase in accrual before allowing for inflation
amounted to £37,366. The transfer value of the increase, before any allowance for early retirement terms, amounts to £422,000. 
7. SERVICE CONTRACTS (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)

Compliance statement

Ken Minton
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
26 February 2004 38 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at the
end of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt of the Group for the year. 
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
I. select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
II. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
III. state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed; and
IV. prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the members of Tomkins plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Tomkins plc for the 
year ended 3 January 2004 which comprise the proﬁt and loss account,
the balance sheets, the cash ﬂow statement, the statement of total
recognised gains and losses, the reconciliation of movement in
shareholders’ funds, the principal accounting policies and the related
notes 1 to 31. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the
Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards. They are also responsible for the preparation of
the other information contained in the Report and Accounts including 
the directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United
Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report 
is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions 
with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained
in the Report and Accounts for the above year as described in the
contents section, including the unaudited part of the directors’
remuneration report and consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the
Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that
the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 3 January 2004
and of the proﬁt of the Group for the year then ended, and the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report described as having been audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes: 
An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website,
including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether any changes may have
occurred to the ﬁnancial statements since ﬁrst published. These matters are the responsibility
of the directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions. 39

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
Accounting convention
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention
and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The accounts include the results of all subsidiary undertakings
(“subsidiaries”). The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are
consolidated for the periods from the effective dates of acquisition 
or to the effective dates of sale.
Accounting period
The accounts are for the 368 days ended 3 January 2004. The
comparative ﬁgures are for the 245 days ended 31 December 2002.
Foreign currencies
Trading results denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into sterling at the average rates of exchange ruling throughout the
year. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date, or at composite rates speciﬁed in related
forward contracts. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
the translation of the opening net assets of foreign subsidiaries, the
translation of foreign subsidiaries’ proﬁt and loss accounts from
average or composite rates to closing rates and from transactions
executed solely for the purpose of hedging foreign currency translation
exposure are taken to reserves. Other exchange differences are taken
to the proﬁt and loss account when they arise.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are held to reduce exposure to foreign
exchange risk and interest rate movements. None are held for
speculative purposes.
To qualify as a hedge, a ﬁnancial instrument must be related 
to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable
commitment. It must involve the same currency or similar currencies 
as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency
exchange movements on the Group’s operations. Gains and losses
arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the proﬁt
and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of ﬁxed
assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reﬂected 
in the Group’s accounts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for
example, because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, 
the instrument is marked to market and any resulting proﬁt or loss
recognised at that time.
Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any provision for impairment.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of tangible ﬁxed assets, other than freehold land and
assets under construction, is provided on the straight line basis over
anticipated useful lives: 
Freehold buildings and long 
leasehold land and buildings Ten to ﬁfty years
Short leasehold land and buildings Length of lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles Two to twenty years
Finance leases
Assets held under leases which confer rights and obligations similar
to those attaching to owned assets are capitalised at fair value as
tangible ﬁxed assets and the corresponding liability to pay rentals 
is shown net of interest in the accounts as obligations under ﬁnance
leases. The capitalised values of the assets are written off on the
straight line basis over the shorter of the period of the lease or 
the useful life of the asset concerned. The interest element of the
lease payments is allocated so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of charge.
Investments
Shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
An associated undertaking (“associate”) is an investment in which
the Group has substantial long-term minority equity interest and 
in which it participates in commercial and ﬁnancial policy decisions.
The consolidated proﬁt and loss account includes the Group’s share 
of the results of associates. Investments in associates, all of which were
acquired before 2 May 1998, are incorporated in the consolidated
balance sheet at cost, less goodwill written off, plus the Group’s share
of post-acquisition reserves.
Other investments are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Stock
Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value with due
allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items. Net realisable value
is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Work in
progress, ﬁnished goods and goods held for resale include an
appropriate proportion of overhead expense. 
Long-term contracts are valued at cost plus attributable proﬁt less
provisions for foreseeable loss. If the outcome of a contract can be
assessed with reasonable certainty, proﬁt is taken by the percentage 
of completion method, otherwise proﬁt is taken at the conclusion 
of each contract.
Certain commodities used by operating companies are purchased 
or sold by way of forward contracts in order to ﬁx the purchase 
price of the underlying raw material or product. Where such an
arrangement exists, commodities are accounted for at the cost ﬁxed 
by the forward contract.
Own shares
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the
cost of the Company’s ordinary shares acquired by ESOP trusts in
connection with the Group’s employee share schemes.
The accounting policy for own shares held in an ESOP trust has
been amended to conform with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No.
38 “Accounting for ESOP trusts” (“UITF 38”). See note 23.
Goodwill
Goodwill, being the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair
values attributed to the net assets at acquisition, is now capitalised and 
is being amortised over its useful economic life which is usually expected
not to exceed twenty years. Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or before 2 May 1998 
was charged directly to reserves. The proﬁt or loss on disposal or
closure of a business includes any attributable goodwill previously
charged to reserves.
Turnover
Turnover comprises sales in the ordinary course of business to external
customers for goods supplied and despatched and services provided,
exclusive of sales related taxes. 
Application Note G to Financial Reporting Standard No.5 “Reporting
the substance of transactions”, (“FRS 5”) which deals with revenue
recognition, has been adopted during the year. The Group’s revenue
recognition policy was already compliant with this pronouncement. 46 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
continued
Research and development
Expenditure on research and development and on patents and
trademarks is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the proﬁt and loss account 
on the straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Employee share schemes
With the exception of awards made under SAYE option schemes in
respect of which no cost is recognised, the cost of awards made under
the Group’s share based compensation schemes is based on the intrinsic
value of the awards and is charged to the proﬁt and loss account on 
a straight line basis over the period to which the employees’
performance relates.
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
The costs of pension plans and other post-retirement beneﬁts are
charged to the proﬁt and loss account so as to spread the costs over
the employees’ working lives with the Group.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of Financial
Reporting Standard No. 17 “Retirement beneﬁts” (“FRS 17”) the Group
has elected to defer its implementation. The disclosures required under
the transitional arrangements are set out in note 26. 
Government grants
Government grants relating to tangible ﬁxed assets are treated as
deferred income and credited to the proﬁt and loss account in equal
instalments over the anticipated useful lives of the assets to which the
grants relate. Other grants are credited to the proﬁt and loss account
when they are received.
Tax
The tax charge is based on the proﬁt for the year and takes into
account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment
of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is
provided in full on all liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent it is regarded that it is more likely than not that they will be
recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted. 47

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of ordinary
shares held by trusts relating to employee share schemes to which the participating employees are not unconditionally entitled. Diluted earnings
per share takes into account the dilutive effect of share options outstanding under employee share schemes and the dilutive effect of the
conversion of convertible preference shares. 
The directors have presented earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation on the basis that they believe it represents
a useful measure of underlying year on year performance.

Post-retirement beneﬁts other than pensions:
Other post-retirement beneﬁts, mainly healthcare, are provided by certain US subsidiaries to current and former employees. The cost relating to
the beneﬁts is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualiﬁed actuaries, and the provision in the accounts for the accrued cost of the beneﬁts
at 3 January 2004 is based on an actuarial valuation at that date. The assumption which has the most signiﬁcant effect on the cost relating to the
beneﬁts is the weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of health care beneﬁts of approximately 6.5 per cent. 
Deferred tax and other tax provisions:
Provisions relate to deferred tax and other tax liabilities where there is uncertainty over the timing of settlement of such amounts. For details 
of the Group deferred tax balance see note 6.
Other provisions:
Other provisions include provisions for restructuring costs, disposals and warranties. Provision is made for warranty claims on various products
depending on speciﬁc market expectations and the type of product. The period of warranty can extend indeﬁnitely, however, the majority of
relevant sales have warranty periods of two years. Provision has been made for warranties based on actual and anticipated claims. 59 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

During the year 262,500 and 19,126 ordinary shares of 5p each were allotted pursuant to options exercised under the executive share option
schemes and savings related share option schemes respectively, for total consideration of £675,592.
During the year 757 of the US dollar denominated 5.560 per cent voting convertible cumulative preference shares of US$50 each (“perpetual
convertible shares”) were converted into 7,395 ordinary shares of 5p each. The perpetual convertible shares were issued on terms that they could
be converted at any time, at the shareholder’s option, into fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each of the Company on the basis of 9.77 ordinary
shares of 5p each for every perpetual convertible share so converted. The Company has the option, at any time when the total amount 
of perpetual convertible shares issued and outstanding is less than 10% of the amount originally issued and in any event on or after 29 July 2006,
to redeem, in the ﬁrst case, all but not some only and, in the second case, all or any of the perpetual convertible shares which remain issued and
outstanding at that time.
Following agreement being reached with Bear Creek Inc., a corporate trustee administering certain Gates family trusts which controlled
approximately 90 per cent of the US dollar denominated 4.344 per cent voting redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares of 
US$50 each (“redeemable convertible shares”), the terms of the redeemable convertible shares, as contained in Tomkins Articles of Association,
were amended at an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and at a separate class meeting of the holders of the redeemable
convertible shares so that on 26 August 2003 all of the outstanding redeemable convertible shares were redeemed at a price 
of US$48.5 each (“the redemption”). None of the redeemable convertible shares were converted into ordinary shares of 5p each during the
year. The redeemable convertible shares had been issued on terms that they could be converted at any time, at the shareholder’s option, into
fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each in the Company on the basis of 9.77 ordinary shares of 5p each for every redeemable convertible share 
so converted. Prior to the redemption the Company would have been required to redeem, at a price of US$50 each, all of the redeemable
convertible shares which remained issued and outstanding on 26 July 2006. 
At the date of issue the conversion terms of the perpetual convertible shares were equivalent to an ordinary share price of 334p.
On a return of assets on liquidation or otherwise (other than on redemption or repurchase of shares) the assets of the Company available to
shareholders will be applied ﬁrst in repaying the capital paid up or credited as paid up thereon together with all arrears and accruals of dividend to
the holders of the perpetual convertible shares and any other classes of shares ranking pari passu with the perpetual convertible shares as to capital. 60 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

Until such time as the shares are converted or redeemed, the holders of the perpetual convertible shares have a right to receive dividends at 
an annual rate of 5.560 per cent in preference to the holders of the ordinary shares. 
The holders of the perpetual convertible shares are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company where, on a show of hands, each
holder will have one vote and, on a poll, each holder will have one vote in respect of every seven fully paid ordinary shares to which the holder
would be entitled on the full exercise of his conversion rights, except if two or more consecutive quarterly dividends are in arrears whereupon, on

In the opinion of the directors, all of the capital reserve and £297.3 million of the proﬁt and loss account of the Company are distributable. 
UITF 38 “Accounting for ESOP trusts” has been adopted during the year, which states that the consideration paid for shares in Tomkins plc, held
by an ESOP trust on behalf of the Company, should be accounted for as a reduction in shareholders’ funds rather than as a ﬁxed asset investment.
Consideration paid for the purchase of own shares represents the cost of shares purchased by the Company. UITF 38 requires any compensation
expense related to share awards to be based on the intrinsic value of the awards. In the past the compensation expense has been based on the
cost of the shares purchased, which has been equal to the intrinsic value. As a result of the adoption of UITF 38, net assets and shareholders’ funds
at 31 December 2002 have decreased by £0.2 million. Comparative ﬁgures have been restated accordingly. The adoption had no impact on the
Group’s results in previous accounting periods, but resulted in a £0.2 million increase in operating proﬁt in the current year.
Own shares represent the cost to the Tomkins Employee Share Trust (“the Trust”) of the Company’s ordinary shares that it has acquired to meet
the expected requirements of the share based compensation schemes described in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 34 to 36.
As at 3 January 2004, the Group was deemed to hold 2,628,859 of the Company’s ordinary shares (31 December 2002 – 1,827,382 ordinary
shares) by way of the Trust with a market value of £7.1 million (31 December 2002 – £3.5 million). As at 3 January 2004, the Company was deemed
to hold 2,077,583 of its own ordinary shares (31 December 2002 – 1,257,778 ordinary shares) by way of the Trust with a market value of £5.6 million
(31 December 2002 – £2.4 million). Dividends relating to the Company’s ordinary shares held by the Trust have been waived with the exception of
those that are payable to participants in the relevant schemes.
Following the agreement to sell Pegler Limited and the business and assets of Hattersley Newman Hender Limited subsequent to the year end,
a provision of £51.4 million was charged to the proﬁt and loss account for the resulting impairment of goodwill. 
In addition to the above, the goodwill arising since 1 March 1973 on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings owned at 
3 January 2004 written off against reserves, totals £1,054.8 million (31 December 2002 – £1,136.1 million).
24 RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
The Company has not presented its own proﬁt and loss account, as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The proﬁt for the
ﬁnancial year in the accounts of the Company, after the receipt of £607.6 million of dividends from subsidiaries, amounted to £512.3 million 
(31 December 2002 – loss of £2.1 million). 62 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

26 PENSIONS
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 24 “Accounting for Pension
Costs” (“SSAP 24”) and the disclosures given in (a) comply with that standard. As permitted by the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 the Group 
has elected to defer full implementation of the standard until the year ended 31 December 2005. Nevertheless, a number of items determined in
accordance with FRS 17 must be disclosed. These disclosures, to the extent not given under (a), are set out in (b) for funded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
and in (c) for unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. The disclosures in respect of post retirement beneﬁts other than pensions are set out in note 20.
(a) SSAP 24 Disclosures
As at 3 January 2004, the Group operates pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of its employees. These plans are 
structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country and include deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt plans. In the case 
of the deﬁned beneﬁt plans, amounts are charged to the proﬁt and loss account so as to spread the cost of providing beneﬁts over employees’
service lives. Further details on the schemes in the two principal countries (the United Kingdom and the United States) are set out below.
At 3 January 2004, pension related assets of £25.3 million (31 December 2002 – £23.6 million) (Company – £3.1 million (31 December 2002 – 
£0.8 million)) and pension related liabilities of £53.4 million (31 December 2002 – £43.8 million) (Company – £6.7 million (31 December 2002 – 
£6.1 million)) were included in debtors and creditors respectively.
United Kingdom
The majority of plans in the United Kingdom are deﬁned beneﬁt in nature and provide beneﬁts based on ﬁnal pensionable salary and length 
of service. The assets of the plans are held by trustees in separate pension funds and day to day management of those assets is carried out by
independent professional investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in
Tomkins. All plan assets are held by custodians who are independent of the investment managers and of Tomkins. 
The latest actuarial valuations and formal reviews of the plans were carried out by independent consulting actuaries, with effective dates
between April 2002 and September 2003 using the projected unit method of valuation, which includes allowance for future earnings growth.
Assets were valued at market value. The principal assumptions used in valuing the scheme liabilities are set out in the tables on page 63. 
At the dates of the latest formal actuarial valuations, the market value of the assets of the plans amounted to £174.5 million which was
sufﬁcient to cover 90 per cent (31 December 2002 – 81 per cent) of the liabilities for beneﬁts accrued to members. At 3 January 2004 total plan
assets had a market value of approximately £186.0 million (31 December 2002 – £160.5 million).
Certain employees whose beneﬁts exceed the maximum that can be paid from the approved arrangements are entitled to an additional
pension payable directly from the company following retirement. An accrued liability of £2.7 million (31 December 2002 – £1.8 million) is included
in the balance sheet in respect of this.
There are a small number of deﬁned contribution plans where contributions are charged to the proﬁt and loss account in the year in which
they fall due. 
United States of America
Both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution plans are operated in the United States of America. Assets are held in trustee administered funds
independent of the assets of the companies.
Deﬁned beneﬁt plans are operated by a number of the Group’s US subsidiaries providing beneﬁts based upon pensionable salary and length 
of service. Actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities are performed annually by independent consulting actuaries, using the projected unit
method of valuation which includes allowance for future earnings growth. Assets were valued at market value. 
At 3 January 2004, total plan assets had a market value of £212.8 million (31 December 2002 – £226.1 million). The actuarial valuation of the
assets was sufﬁcient to cover 84 per cent (31 December 2002 – 78 per cent) of the estimated accrued liabilities of the funded plans.
Deﬁned contribution plans, which include proﬁt sharing plans, cover most of Tomkins US employees. Contributions are charged to the proﬁt
and loss account in the year in which they fall due.
Other countries
Over 60 per cent of Tomkins employees are either in the UK or in the US. For the balance, Tomkins operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned
contribution plans. Where these are not available, state beneﬁts are considered adequate. Full provision is made for liabilities arising under deﬁned
beneﬁt schemes in these countries, as calculated in accordance with actuarial advice and contributions to deﬁned contribution plans are accounted
for in the year in which they fall due.  63 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

(c) Unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The Group has unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes with present value of scheme liabilities of £22.6 million (31 December 2002 – £24.1 million),
which are already provided for. Accordingly, no adjustment for these schemes is necessary. The assumptions used to derive the present value of
scheme liabilities are broadly similar to those used for the funded schemes.
27 CONTINGENCIES
The Company guarantees the bank facilities of certain subsidiaries and the Group provides cash as security for letters of credit in order to reduce
their cost. The maximum amount covered by these arrangements at 3 January 2004 was £156.2 million (31 December 2002 – £122.6 million) and
£3.8 million (31 December 2002 – £1.5 million) respectively. The Company has also guaranteed certain property leases and performance bonds
entered into in the ordinary course of business by certain of its subsidiaries. The Group is also, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and
claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business. The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of any of the above proceedings and
claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
28 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Tomkins policy in relation to ﬁnancial risk management is discussed in the Financial Review on page 14. As permitted by FRS 13, short term debtors
and creditors have been omitted from all disclosures other than the currency analysis. The disclosures also exclude the Company’s preference shares
(see note 22) and the ﬁnancial guarantees (see note 27).

cent over a weighted average period of 3.4 years. All other interest rate hedging agreements are included. Interest payments on ﬂoating rate
assets and liabilities are determined mainly by reference to LIBOR in the relevant currency.

The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures that give rise to net currency gains or losses that are dealt with in reserves in accordance
with SSAP 20.
Net (debt)/funds comprise cash and deposits, borrowings and off balance sheet contracts. The borrowings and off balance sheet contracts
shown against each currency are matched against the assets and liabilities of that currency under the requirements of SSAP 20 and to that extent
produce no net gain or loss on translation into sterling for the purposes of the Group proﬁt and loss account.
Net currency gains of £35 million (31 December 2002 – £2.3 million) relating to net (debt)/funds and foreign currency derivatives used to ensure
that the Group’s net borrowings are retained in proportion to the currencies in which the Group’s net assets are denominated have been included

Derivatives to manage currency proﬁle of net assets 1.4 1.4 0.6 0.6 
The fair value of short term borrowings is approximately equal to book value as they comprise mainly bank overdrafts which attract ﬂoating rates.
Long term borrowings consist mainly of the £250 million and £150 million medium term notes, the fair values of which have been determined by
reference to market rates. Deposits are held short term and mainly attract ﬂoating rates.
Foreign currency derivatives are used to ensure that the Group’s net borrowings are retained in proportion to the currencies in which the
Group’s assets are denominated. These are marked to market and the resulting differences recognised, thereby avoiding signiﬁcant divergence
between book and fair values.
Where foreign currency cash ﬂows generated by overseas investments have not been remitted to Tomkins plc at the time of dividend payment,
forward contracts are used to ensure the currency proﬁle of the Group is in line with policy.
Fair value of preference shares
The above analysis excludes the details of the fair value of the preference shares. These preference shares are not traded on an organised market
and fair values are therefore not readily available. Other details of the preference shares are given in note 22.
Hedges of future transactions
Gains and losses on derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is recognised.

Of the unrecognised gains and losses on foreign exchange transaction exposure hedging outstanding at 3 January 2004, all are expected to be
realised in the year ending 31 December 2004.
The unrecognised gain on interest rate hedging at 31 December 2002 related to interest rate swaps used to hedge the Tomkins plc £150 million
medium term note. At 31 December 2003 the gains and losses relate to interest rate swaps used to hedge the Tomkins plc £150 million medium
term note, the Tomkins Finance plc £250 million medium term note, Forward Rate Agreements (“FRAs”) and interest rate swaps to manage the
interest rate risk on the Group’s US dollar net debt.

DESCRIPTION OF DIFFERENCES FROM ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions subsequent to 3 May 1998 is capitalised and amortised through the proﬁt and loss account over its estimated
useful economic life which is estimated not to exceed a maximum of 20 years. Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or before 2 May 1998 was
charged directly to reserves and is recaptured through the proﬁt and loss on disposal. Under US GAAP, effective 1 May 2002 Tomkins adopted US
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. This statement addresses ﬁnancial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and requires that goodwill and some intangibles no longer be
amortised on a recurring basis. Instead, goodwill and intangible assets with an indeﬁnite life are subject to an initial impairment test and an
annual impairment test thereafter. As of 1 May 2002, Tomkins had goodwill with a net carrying value of approximately £1,200 million that was
subject to the transition provision of SFAS No. 142. Tomkins performed the required impairment tests of goodwill as of 1 May 2002 and
determined that a total goodwill impairment of £32.7 million should be recorded. Additionally, an annual impairment test has also been
completed as of 31 December 2002 and 3 January 2004. These reviews resulted in an additional total goodwill impairment of £30.9 million and
£30.0 million respectively. In the future, the annual impairment test will be performed by the Group as of 31 December.
(b) Recognition of intangibles arising on a business combination
Under UK GAAP, intangible assets, other than goodwill, may only be separately recognised in a business combination if they can be disposed 
of separately from the business of the entity and their value can be reasonably estimated.
Under US GAAP, intangible assets arising on a business combination should be recognised (i) if they arise from contractual or other legal rights
(regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired entity or from other legal rights or obligations) or (ii) they are
capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or otherwise exchanged.
(c) Valuation of net assets acquired in a business combination
Under US GAAP manufactured stock acquired in business combinations is recorded at estimated selling price less future disposal costs 
(and a reasonable proﬁt allowance) whereas it is recognised at replacement cost under UK GAAP.
(d) Disposal of operations 
The gain or loss on the disposal of operations is a result of the difference in values between assets and liabilities disposed of under UK GAAP and
under US GAAP. The majority of the difference arises from the differing treatment of goodwill.
(e) Pension costs
In Tomkins consolidated ﬁnancial statements, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice
No. 24 “Accounting for Pension Costs”, with costs being charged to income over employees’ estimated working lives. Under US GAAP, pension 
costs are determined in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 87 – “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS No. 88 – “Employers’
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension Plans and for Termination Beneﬁts”. Key differences between the UK 
and US GAAP ﬁgures arise from the requirement to use different methods and assumptions for valuing scheme assets and a different method 
of amortising surpluses or deﬁcits.
Under UK GAAP , the effect of the variations in cost can be accumulated at successive valuations and amortised on an aggregate basis. Under US
GAAP , the amortisation of the transition asset and the costs of past service beneﬁt improvements are separately tracked: experience gains/losses are
dealt with on an aggregate basis but amortised only if outside a 10 per cent corridor. UK GAAP allows measurements of plan assets and liabilities to
be based on the result of the latest actuarial valuation, whereas US GAAP requires measurement of plan assets and liabilities to be made at the date
of the ﬁnancial statements or up to three months prior to that date. US GAAP also requires that a minimum pension liability must be recorded for
the amount by which the plan is under funded (ignoring projected future salary increases). A corresponding amount is recorded as an intangible
asset, to the extent of unrecognised prior service cost, and the balance is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax.
(f) Share options 
Under UK GAAP, the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares at the grant date is recorded as compensation
expense in the income statement. Under US GAAP, stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under APB No. 25, the Company recognises compensation expense for the
difference between the exercise price and market price at the measurement date over the vesting period. The measurement date is the ﬁrst date
on which the employer knows the number of shares that an employee is entitled to receive and the exercise price is known. Where the 76 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
RECONCILIATION TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA (UNAUDITED)
continued 
measurement date occurs after the grant date, as in the case of performance related options, compensation cost is recorded over the vesting
period for the difference between the share price at the balance sheet date and the exercise price and is adjusted in subsequent periods up to the
measurement date. Where the performance condition is such that management cannot make a reasonable estimate because the company cannot
control the outcome of the performance conditions, such as the achievement of a target share price, no compensation cost is recognised until the
performance condition is satisﬁed.
Under UK GAAP, the compensation costs relating to share options granted to employees under annual bonus plans that vest in future periods
are recognised on the grant date. Under US GAAP, the compensation cost relating to such grants are recognised over the future vesting period.
(g) Capitalisation of interest
In Tomkins consolidated ﬁnancial statements, interest expense is not capitalised. To comply with US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest
expense incurred while constructing major projects is included in ﬁxed assets and amortised over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings.
(h) Deferred income tax
In Tomkins consolidated ﬁnancial statements, deferred tax is provided in full on all liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be
deducted, and for this purpose Tomkins considers only future periods for which forecasts are prepared. Under US GAAP , deferred taxes are provided
for all temporary differences on a full asset and liability basis. A valuation allowance is established in respect of those deferred tax assets where it is
more likely than not that some portion will not be realised. The look forward period is not limited to the period for which forecasts are prepared. 
(i) Derivative instruments
Tomkins has entered into derivative ﬁnancial instrument contracts in order to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
Under UK GAAP , where there are derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge, gains and losses are deferred and recognised in the proﬁt and loss
account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, only when the hedged transaction has itself settled and been reﬂected in
the Group’s accounts. If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting proﬁt or loss
recognised at that time. Derivatives entered into to hedge the net investment in overseas entities are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity. Under
US GAAP , derivative instruments are not regarded as hedges and any unrealised gains or losses arising at the period end are taken to income.
Derivatives entered into to hedge the net investment in overseas entities do not qualify as a hedge under US GAAP and any gains or losses are
charged to the income statement.
(j) Restructuring costs
In Tomkins consolidated ﬁnancial statements, restructuring costs are recognised when there is an unavoidable obligation as a result of a past event and
a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Under US GAAP , restructuring costs and one time termination beneﬁts are recognised as incurred.
(k) Ordinary dividends
In Tomkins consolidated ﬁnancial statements, ordinary dividends are provided for in the period in respect of which they are proposed on the basis
of the recommendation made by the directors. Under US GAAP, ordinary dividends are not provided for until formally declared.
(l) Redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares
In Tomkins consolidated ﬁnancial statements, redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares are considered to be part of shareholders’
equity. Under US GAAP, redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares are classiﬁed outside of shareholders’ equity and not included in any
presentation total of shareholders’ equity in the balance sheet.
(m) Earnings per share
The earnings per share calculated under UK GAAP does not include the gain arising on the redemption of the redeemable convertible cumulative
preference shares. Under US GAAP , this gain is included in the net earnings available to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share. 77 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
PRESENTATION AND CLASSIFICATION DIFFERENCES
In addition to the recognition and measurement differences between UK and US GAAP there are a number of differences in the manner in which
amounts are presented and classiﬁed in the accounts. The principal presentation and classiﬁcation differences are summarised below:
(1) Balance sheet and proﬁt and loss account presentation
General
The format of a balance sheet prepared in accordance with UK GAAP differs in certain respects from US GAAP. UK GAAP requires assets to be
presented in ascending order of liquidity in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, whereas under US GAAP assets are
presented in descending order of liquidity. In addition current assets under UK GAAP include amounts that fall due after more than one year,
whereas under US GAAP such assets are classiﬁed as non-current assets.
Pensions
Under UK GAAP assets and liabilities relating to different plans are not offset in presentation. Under US GAAP, assets and liabilities of different
plans are offset in presentation.
Exceptional items
UK GAAP requires proﬁts and losses in relation to the disposal of ﬁxed assets to be shown separately on the face of the proﬁt and loss account
below operating proﬁt. In addition, items that result from the ongoing activities of the business but are signiﬁcant because of their size or nature
may be separately highlighted on the face of the proﬁt and loss account. Under US GAAP, the items described above are included in operating
income. Items that form part of operating activities and are signiﬁcant in size or nature may be separately highlighted on the face of the proﬁt
and loss account or in the accompanying notes.
Discontinued operations
Under UK GAAP, discontinued operations are deﬁned as those where the sale or termination is completed either in the period or before the earlier
of three months after the year end or the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements. The disposal must have a material effect on the nature of
operations resulting from its withdrawal from a particular market or from a material reduction in turnover from continuing markets. Sales and
operating proﬁt are disclosed separately on the face of the proﬁt and loss account. Assets and liabilities are not separately distinguished. Under US
GAAP, the results of a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classiﬁed as held for sale are separately reported in a single caption.
Furthermore the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classiﬁed as held for sale are presented separately in the balance sheet.
(2) Consolidated statement of cash ﬂow
The consolidated statement of cash ﬂow prepared under UK GAAP presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
Cash ﬂow under UK GAAP represents increases or decreases in “cash,” which comprises cash in hand, deposits repayable on demand and bank
overdrafts. Under US GAAP, cash ﬂow represents increases or decreases in “Cash and Cash Equivalents”, which includes short-term, highly liquid
investments with original maturities of less than three months, and excludes overdrafts.
Under UK GAAP, cash ﬂows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investment and servicing of ﬁnance, taxation, capital
expenditure and ﬁnancial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends, management of liquid resources and ﬁnancing activities. Under
US GAAP, only three categories of cash ﬂow activity are presented, being cash ﬂows relating to operating activities, investing activities and
ﬁnancing activities. Cash ﬂows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of ﬁnance are, with the exception of servicing of
shareholder ﬁnance, included as operating.
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following is condensed consolidated ﬁnancial information presented in accordance with US GAAP, which reﬂects the reconciliation
adjustments and the presentation and classiﬁcation differences discussed above. This ﬁnancial information is presented in US dollars using the
current rate method. Accordingly, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate at the dates on which those elements are recognised or at an appropriately
weighted average exchange rate for the period. Differences arising from the translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income. 78 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

Tomkins adopted SFAS No. 142 with effect from 1 May 2002. As a result there was no goodwill amortisation charged to operating proﬁt in the
twelve months ended 3 January 2004 under US GAAP , whilst the twelve months ended 31 December 2002 included goodwill amortisation of $17.7
million (eight months ended 31 December 2002 – $nil). For the twelve months ended 3 January 2004 there was a goodwill impairment charge 
of $53.9 million (eight months and twelve months ended 31 December 2002 – $49.7 million), following the initial impairment charge on adoption
of the standard discussed in note C. $41.4 million (eight months and twelve months ended 31 December 2002 – $19.6 million) of this impairment
relates to discontinued operations, and therefore is not included in operating proﬁt from continuing operations.
B) Net income per common share
Basic net income per common share is calculated on net income attributable to common shareholders of $401.1 million (December 2002 
(12 months) – $145.6 million and December 2002 (8 months) – $81.3 million), representing the net income for the period after adjusting for the
preference dividend of $47.1 million (December 2002 (12 months) – $51.6 million and December 2002 (8 months) – $37.5 million), and on
771,037,499 ordinary shares being the weighted average in issue during the period (December 2002 (12 months) – 770,569,165 and December
2002 (8 months) – 770,927,221).
Diluted net income per common share is calculated on an adjusted weighted average number of ordinary shares of 953,988,852 (December 2002
(12 months) – 996,233,827 and December 2002 (8 months) – 996,606,935) after allowing for the exercise of 2,034,111 share options (December
2002 (12 months) – 1,470,913 and December 2002 (8 months) – 1,498,374) and is calculated on net income of $430.8 million (December 2002 
(12 months) – $197.2 million and December 2002 (8 months) – $118.8 million). The weighted average number of shares also allows for the
conversion of preference shares equating to 180,917,242 ordinary shares for the year ended 3 January 2004 (December 2002 (12 months) –
224,193,749 and December 2002 (8 months) – 224,181,340) and income was adjusted for the preference dividend of $47.1 million (December 2002
(12 months) – $51.6 million and December 2002 (8 months) – $37.5 million) and the gain on redemption of the redeemable convertible cumulative
preference shares of $17.4 million. 
C) Changes of accounting principle
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
With effect from 1 May 2002, Tomkins adopted SFAS No. 142, which requires, inter alia, that goodwill should no longer be amortised but should
be subject to an impairment review initially on adoption of the standard and, thereafter, at least on an annual basis.
As a result of the initial impairment review, an impairment loss of £32.7 million ($47.3 million) was recognised as a cumulative effect of 
change in accounting principle on 1 May 2002. Since the initial impairment review, further impairment losses of £30.0 million ($53.9 million) 
(31 December 2002 – £30.9 million ($49.7 million)) have been recognised. 82 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

General Information Overview
Product and Service Overview
incadea has focused on developing a product 
portfolio specifically for the automotive retail 
industry and today that portfolio covers all 
business processes for the full range of car 
dealer networks, from franchised dealers on 
a single site with five users, to dealer groups 
with over 100 sites servicing more than 1,000 
users. All of the Group’s products run on 
Microsoft’s enterprise technology platform 
and incorporate the Group’s own proprietary 
software to address the automotive retail 
industry requirements. The incadea product 
range is fully integrated but can also 
stand alone.
Product and 
Service 
Overview
Introduction
Dealer  
Management Solution
Products
incadea’s primary product is its dealer 
management solution (“DMS”), 
incadea.engine, which provides 
automotive dealers with the capability  
to integrate departmental functions  
and business processes with the aim of 
increasing productivity and efficiency. 
The Group has invested substantial 
resources in product development, 
with approximately €10 million invested 
during the last three years in the next 
generation of products which were 
released during 2012.
incadea.engine 
incadea.engine is a comprehensive DMS, 
and is currently installed across a 
customer base of 54,749 users in 80 
countries. incadea.engine enables car 
dealers to improve day to day operating 
ef ciency and is designed to operate 
in any vehicle dealership business 
environment across multiple languages, 
brands, branches and currencies. In 
addition to standard DMS features 
such as vehicle management, parts 
management and service management, 
the application offers:
 specialised importer management; 
 data exchange; 
 finance; 
 accounting; 
 reporting; and 
 marketing capabilities.
Flexibility is a major advantage for 
international organisations. By providing 
consistent menu structures and 
standardised data views, incadea.engine  
is designed to be user friendly thereby 
reducing training times for new users. 
incadea.engine records and monitors  
the supply chain from the OEM to the 
dealer and helps the dealer to manage  
its processes, inventory and customer 
relationships more ef ciently. The Group 
has received feedback from OEMs that, 
amongst other things, incadea.engine 
raises customer satisfaction with dealers, 
as well as promoting loyalty by reducing 
time to market for new cars and 
increasing the productivity of salespeople.
incadea.myengine
incadea.myengine is the next generation 
DMS which enhances the user experience 
and, with its new technology platform, 
enables the Group to provide “cloud” based solutions in order to generate 
signi cant software as a service 
revenues. Piloted in uly 2011,  
incadea.myengine includes an intuitive 
user interface and provides the user 
with the appropriate functions and data 
required, according to the user’s role 
within its dealership organisation.
Customer + Vehicle Relationship 
Management
incadea.cvrm is a full CRM solution for 
dealerships covering all signi cant 
customer processes and touch points 
along the customer lifecycle. The key 
functional processes covered are lead 
management, campaign management, 
contact management, vehicle sales, sales 
performance reporting and complaint 
management. During 2012 some pilot 
programmes already run prescribing the 
opportunities of the product.
Business intelligence
incadea.bi delivers ad hoc information,  
at the operational, tactical and strategic 
level, throughout the dealership 
organisation, including operational 
analyses and reports, trends and 
dashboards by individual branch or 
car make, as well as KPIs to support 
Company or even Group decisions. incadea

General Information Overview
Product and Service Overview
Service offering
The Group’s service portfolio has been 
developed not only to address product related issues but also to target what the 
Directors perceive to be its customers’ 
primary areas for improvements in 
ef ciency, for example: 
 implementation of automotive “Best 
Practices”; 
incadea’s products, being a vertical 
solution in the automotive Enterprise 
Resource Planning (“ERP”) market, have 
incorporated industry best practices in 
the processes they implement. incadea’s 
consulting teams through their extensive 
product knowledge and their experience 
in providing services in different OEM 
landscapes, have the ability to provide 
a part of the products installation and 
consultation on industry best practices 
for each of the installations they provide.
 OEM compliance assessments and 
optimisation;
An important eld for SW selection and 
implementation is the compliance of the 
installation to the OEMs requirements as 
well as the optimisation of the business 
processes re ected in the systems to be 
implemented. incadea’s solutions and 
services address the whole chain of the 
automotive’s ERP landscape (from the 
central OEM installations, to the National 
companies down to the dealer and 
service workshops), providing the ability 
for end users to be compliant with the 
central OEM requirements as well as to 
have an optimum way of operating. 
 implementation assurance for critical 
business applications;
It is a general requirement in the 
software industry for ERP software 
to inform critical business applications 
for product and services providers. 
incadea provides implementation 
assurance for the critical business 
applications, through its well de ned 
implementation methodology. This 
addresses any issues that may occur 
early and provides solutions to ensure 
the continuity of the critical operations.
 operational optimisation to maximise 
return on investments;
A major outcome that customers look for 
when selecting an ERP software is the 
optimisation of its operation. Speci cally, 
as the introduction of a new ERP is 
accompanied by a signi cant investment 
in terms of capital expenditure as well 
as operating expenditure by the end 
customer, customers want to maximise 
their investment through process 
optimisation that should lead either to 
an increase of turnover or optimisation 
of their costs. incadea products and 
services cover this need by providing 
end to end transparency to the business 
processes that run either at the local 
level of a dealer or in the whole chain 
from the central OEM down to the service 
workshop (ordering processes, resource 
optimisation, selling, marketing activities, 
vehicles handling etc are examples of 
processes or areas that are optimised 
from incadea products and services).
Speci c consulting services provided by 
the Group include: project management; 
business consulting; technical consulting; 
software implementation; and training 
and support.
The Group also intends to develop 
training and support centres in Europe, 
Latin America and Asia, with the 
cooperation of its key OEMs, in order to 
provide training related to products, OEM 
business processes, OEM methodologies 
and certi cation processes.
Cloud strategy
The Group’s cloud strategy is customer driven and also follows the current 
Microsoft strategy of shifting focus 
towards providing all applications in the 
cloud. As a result, customers have the 
option of applications being installed 
locally or provided in the cloud. The new 
generation of incadea products are all 
cloud enabled.
Sales & Marketing
Distribution channels
Historically, the Group has sold 
solutions to end customers through 
local VAR partners responsible for 
product localisation, implementation 
services, ongoing support and 
consulting. Increasingly, the Group is 
establishing its own local subsidiaries 
as it expands and intends to acquire 
its local partners where desirable in 
order to be able to provide added 
value services to its customers. The 
Directors believe that this strategy 
should also improve control over 
the product and customer base 
as the business expands.
incadea Value Added Reseller 
(“VAR”) Partner Business Model
The Group operates a VAR business 
model in various markets and the 
Company believes that this model 
will continue to contribute to the 
Group’s success in achieving rapid 
growth and increasing market 
coverage worldwide. The Group 
incentivises the better performing 
VAR partners by granting them more 
favourable terms.
Global Market Channel Strategy
A key element of the Group’s global 
expansion plan is to establish, as full 
service providers, local subsidiaries 
in all its strategically signi cant 
automotive markets, especially 
the BRIC countries. As part of this 
strategy, the Group plans to acquire 
certain existing and new local 
distribution partners that have been 
successful in satisfying the Group’s 
high operating standards as well 
as expanding the Group’s local 
customer base. incadea
Annual Report 2012

General Information Overview
Market Overview
As a result, OEMs such as VW Group and 
Opel have operated 50 to 100 different 
systems in Europe alone and up to 70 
different systems in their retail networks 
in Brazil. The cost and other inefficiencies 
associated with this approach are likely 
to result in delays in the implementation 
of strategic initiatives by OEMs to 
standardise processes and may  
also restrict the ability of the OEMs  
to have a comprehensive overview  
of dealer activities.
Addressable market
The OEMs’ franchised dealer networks 
around the world also represent a 
signi cant potential market for the 
Group and estimate that ADP (the current 
market leader) and the Group together 
currently only address approximately 
10% of this total market worldwide and 
the Group has the opportunity to sell its 
products in the global marketplace 
excluding the USA, Canada, the UK 
and Ireland. 
A Barnes report from 2011 estimates 
the total number of dealerships in BRIC 
markets to be approximately 105,000 
and incadea believes that there are 
approximately 99,000 dealerships in 
Europe (excluding the UK and Ireland).
Market Overview 
Global Potential
Significant opportunities exist for further 
penetration of the Group’s existing markets 
and expansion, with the support of OEMs, 
into high growth territories such as the 
BRIC and other emerging economies.
 
Historically, the DMS market has been 
fragmented, comprising solutions which have 
been developed locally, often by individual 
dealer groups and which are, as a result, 
bespoke to these dealer groups.
Introduction
Growth areas
The short term opportunity to increase 
scale and pro tability for the Group will 
come from the growing BRIC dealership 
marketplace and the OEMs’ expansion 
and standardisation in these regions and 
has already seen evidence of this through 
its Russian acquisition made in 2011. 
Given the Directors’ perception of 
the strategic importance to OEMs of 
globalisation and standardisation, the 
substantial growth potential of BRIC 
and other emerging markets, and the 
ability of the Group’s solutions to be 
implemented internationally, the 
Company has a window of opportunity 
to establish a leading global market 
position over the next few years.
New generation solutions
Providing DMS, CRM & BI solutions on 
a single enterprise technology platform 
with “cloud” capability to streamline 
processes across geographies, optimise 
cost, manage growth and enable new 
automotive retail concepts. This new 
generation of solutions needs to cover 
the customer lifecycle processes 
integrating internet applications, social 
media, telematics vehicle data and 
accessible with any device but also 
integrating the transactional back of ce 
ERP process across whole retail 
networks. The Microsoft Dynamics 
product family in combination with the 
Azure platform and Of ce 365 has 
been proven as extremely successful to 
support the OEM’s in this next generation 
of retail concepts.
SAAS
Following the global trend of applications 
being provided as SaaS (software as 
a service) and aligned closely with 
Microsoft Cloud strategy, incadea 
solutions transform from traditional 
on premise offering to Cloud offering, 
eliminating customer CAPEX investment, 
reducing deployment time and efforts 
with prede ned industry packages and 
con gurations, supporting the OEM 
concepts. incadea is experiencing this 
development very rapidly in the Asian 
growth countries, where most customers 
prefer a rental model versus an upfront 
investment model. In 2013 SaaS 
revenues are estimated to be 10% of 
revenues but we expect this proportion 
to grow substantially over the next 
three years.
Key trends
The Directors believe that product 
standardisation and the 
implementation of global solutions 
in retail networks are major strategic 
priorities for OEMs and perceive that 
the automotive industry is being 
driven by a few key trends, including: 
 pressure on profitability resulting 
in further standardisation in retail 
networks; 
 standardised retail and sales 
processes and solutions; 
 increasing competition in the 
automotive industry leading to 
a growing focus on the customer 
and demand for customer data; and 
 OEM growth plans targeting BRIC 
and other emerging markets, 
which necessitate standard, 
off the shelf solutions that can 
be implemented in short order. incadea

Market Overview
Europe
Over two thirds of the Group’s licence 
revenue from Europe arises from sales 
generated through established VAR 
partners. The Group has a current 
installed license base of 40,330 users in 
Europe. We expect that further growth 
will be achieved through penetration of 
markets such as Germany, Italy and 
France, with a potential licence market 
of approximately 10,000 users over the 
next three to four years.

which is now consolidated as incadea 
Russia. As a result of this transaction  
the Group’s current installed license  
base in Russia is approximately 2,800 
end users. Since becoming a wholly 
owned subsidiary, incadea Russia has 
taken over the implementation of a major 
project for BMW’s largest dealer in Russia 
offering all three products (either for 
commercial or pilot implementation):

Asia Paci c region
Currently the Group has installed a 
license base of approximately 10,000 
users in the Asia Paci c region. In late 
2011 the Group acquired its partner, 
Avanti, headquartered in New Zealand 
with a branch of ce in Taiwan, which will 
serve as the base for the Group’s growing 
Asia Paci c operations. Current key 
projects in the region are a roll out of 
licenses and implementation services for 
VW Group in Taiwan and for BMW Group 
in Malaysia, whilst tenders are being

incadea has a current installed license

China via its local VAR partner, Tectura 
and following the acquisition of a sub contractor of Tectura that undertakes 
part of Tectura’s DMS business. 
During 2012, incadea China implemented a 
contract for VW, rolling out incadea.engine 
to 1,200 end users. Subsequently, the 
scope of this €2 million service project 
was extended to additional VW Group 
brands and the Group expects that 
the relationship with VW in China will 
continue to grow further in 2013 
and 2014.
Importantly, in October 2012, incadea 
won its rst local contract with a 
Chinese OEM, Qoros, a manufacturer of 
competitively priced mid size cars for the 
Chinese and European markets. Under 
this contract, which is both for licenses 
and services, incadea is delivering its 
next generation DMS, incadea.myengine, 
to the Qoros dealer network across 
China. Initially, incadea.myengine is being 
delivered to more than 80 dealers and is 
being integrated into a distributed control 
system supplied by IBM China
India
The Group’s current installed license 
base in India is approximately 1,800 
end users. Originally, this market was 
supported by a local VAR partner. In Q3 
2011 the Group acquired a subsidiary 
in India with experienced and skilled 
personnel and it has since transferred its 
entire business to incadea India. incadea 
India is working with BMW Group and VW 
Group as strategic OEMs in the country to 
provide a roll out of the Group’s products 
and services. The subsidiary is already 
directly providing dealer support and 
rolling out incadea.engine to BMW, 
including Mini dealer networks. 
Latin America
After the acquisition of Portuguese partner 
IS Dynamics and the consolidation with 
incadea Spain into an incadea Iberia 
operation, the Group has used this vehicle 
to push forward with operations in South 
America. There, the management intends 
to establish two operational hubs – in 
Brazil and Mexico, supervised through 
incadea Iberia.
Mexico is the second largest automotive 
market in South America, at the same 
time being one of the fastest growing.  
As most OEMs have signi cant production 
plants in Mexico to supply South America 
and the USA, management expect Mexico 
to be the next most signi cant market 
for incadea, after Brazil. In 2011 incadea 
changed from its partner engagement in 
Mexico to direct business. incadea Mexico 
successfully won a signi cant upgrade 
project with BMW and is now in the 
process of establishing a full operational 
subsidiary. The Mexico operations are 
also expected to act as the hub to 
support BMW throughout Latin America. 
incadea has established an installed base 
of approximately 900 users in the Latin 
America region.

Chairman’s Letter
incadea is a leading technology provider 
of enterprise software solutions and 
services to the global automotive retail 
and wholesale market. With a proven 
industry focus and expertise, incadea 
is a prime vendor of choice for car 
manufacturers (OEMs) and their dealer 
networks around the world. The Company 
has a presence in more than 80 countries, 
serving a growing community of 56,749 
end users across 2,090 dealerships of 
market leading OEMs
We operate in a favourable business 
environment with OEMs expanding 
their dealer networks in BRIC and other 
emerging markets where demand for 
new vehicles remains strong. Whilst 
demand for our products and services 
in our home market in Europe is affected 
by a challenging macro environment, 
we have continued to perform well 
in countries such as Spain, Portugal 
and Greece.
 
During the last two years, our 
international expansion strategy has 
translated into revenue growth from 
emerging markets. Today more than  
57% of our customers are based in Asia, 
China, Latin America and Russia with  
the remainder being based in Europe.  
As a Board we are very pleased with  
the management’s success in achieving  
a robust operating performance at the 
same time as meeting the challenges  
of the Company’s international expansion 
and transition towards becoming  
a direct, end to end software and 
services business. 
In terms of business development, 
our focus remains on expanding our 
relationships with key automotive 
manufacturers and growing revenues 
in the areas of Latin America, Asia Paci c 
and China, India, Russia and Turkey, 
while cementing our position in Europe. 
2012 was a milestone year for incadea 
in which we successfully floated on AIM 
and confirmed our leadership in the global 
automotive retail and wholesale market.  
Our robust performance for the year is 
mirrored in our growing size, the increasing 
geographic spread of the business and 
significantly growing the recurring revenue 
element of business. Revenues for the year 
grew by approximately 49% to €29.3 million 
of which 73.5% came from direct sales 
network (2011: 53%). Maintenance revenues 
had an important contribution comprising 
of 27% of total revenues.

Chairman’s Letter
31.12.2012
73 . 5%
Revenue from direct sales network 
(2011: 53%)
At the same time, we continue to monitor 
opportunities to strengthen our direct 
sales network, as we have done in 
Russia and China, and continue to invest 
in our technology as we see increasing 
demand, particularly outside Europe, 
for our cloud enabled SaaS (software 
as a service) business model. We believe 
that technology standardisation and the 
implementation of global solutions in 
retail and wholesale networks are major 
strategic priorities for OEMs which are 
being driven by a number of key 
trends including:
 a pressure on profitability resulting 
in further standardisation in sales 
and services networks;
 standardised retail and sales 
processes and solutions;
 increasing competition in the 
automotive industry leading to 
a growing focus on the customer 
and demand for customer data; and
 OEM growth plans targeting BRIC and 
other emerging markets, requiring 
standard, off the shelf solutions that 
can be implemented rapidly, in the 
cloud and at low cost.
Overall, we are winning market 
share through both existing and new 
relationships with OEMs. For example, in 
September incadea China, which became 
part of the Group in uly 2012, entered 
into a strategic partnership with Qoros, 
the Chinese OEM, and has already 
become incadea’s second largest business 
unit. We are experiencing strong demand 
elsewhere in Asia and made better than 
expected progress in Latin America 
during the year.
Underpinning our growth is incadea’s 
proprietary technology and products 
which are now recognised as leading 
the global automotive dealership market. 
This is the result of maintaining a high 
level of investment in R&D, amounting 
to €3.4 million during 2012 when we 
successfully completed pilot projects for 
incadea’s next generation, cloud enabled 
dealer management, customer + vehicle 
relationship management and business 
intelligence solutions.
Financial summary and dividend
Costs related to international expansion, 
corporate development and increased 
emphasis on consulting and project 
management are constantly being 
controlled, as they tend to prolong the 
full conversion of operating pro ts into 
cash. The strategy of building a direct 
sales and service global network has 
supported the performance of all revenue 
streams with the Company taking the 
opportunity to gain incremental business 
in its key markets and to strengthen its 
revenue pipeline.
With the Company accelerating its 
international growth and delivering 
positive cash ow from operations the 
Board is con dent about incadea’s growth 
prospects and accordingly is 
recommending a dividend of € cents 1.8 
per ordinary share. The Company intends 
to offer a scrip dividend alternative for 
this distribution for those ordinary 
shareholders who wish to receive 
additional ordinary shares in lieu of 
a cash payment. Shareholders holding 
(on 31 December 2012) 54,89% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares 
(including those members of the Board 
who hold ordinary shares) have informally 
indicated their willingness to take up a 
scrip alternative. Both payment of the 
proposed dividend and the offer of a scrip 
alternative are subject to approval by the 
Company’s shareholders. Accordingly a 
further announcement will be issued and 
a circular will be sent to shareholders 
along with notice of the Company’s 
annual general meeting explaining the 
proposed record and payment dates for 
this dividend and the terms of the scrip 
alternative as soon as practicable. 
Current trading and prospects
Following a successful year in 2012, 
we have established a solid platform 
and business model for future growth 
and overall. During the rst part of 2013, 
incadea continued to perform well across 
the Group, with the Company seeing 
favourable market conditions in the BRIC 
and emerging markets due to OEMs 
experiencing sustained demand for 
vehicles in these regions.
incadea’s global expansion continues to 
translate into growth in users through 
a broadening customer base and 
penetration into new geographic markets.
Key drivers for our nancial performance 
in 2013 include:
 continuing to strengthen our position 
in existing and new geographic 
markets;
 establishing a direct presence in new 
countries including Brazil, Central 
America and Turkey;
 winning additional global OEM 
customers; 
 commercialising incadea’s new generation products outside Europe 
with a growing contribution from 
SaaS revenues;
 growing recurrent revenues as 
incadea continues its transition to 
becoming a direct, full software and 
services provider;
 our shift in business model from 
one time license revenues to annuity 
revenues being reflected in SaaS and 
other recurrent revenues accounting 
for a significant and growing 
proportion of total revenues; and
 identifying value enhancing M&A 
opportunities in line with our strategy 
of having direct control over our route 
to key markets.
The business has expanded in to 
geographical territories at a rate faster 
than had initially been anticipated. In 
addition and as previously mentioned the 
Group is seeing increased demand from 
its clients, particularly those outside 
Europe, for the Company’s cloud/SaaS 
business model.
The faster than expected expansion 
into direct service delivery within 
new geographic territories, will 
demand additional investment across 
the Group. This investment is required 
to support the Company’s accelerated 
growth pro le. incadea

Business Model 
and Strategy
In particular, increasing competition and 
pressure on pro tability, which results in 
further standardisation in retail networks, 
is having a major effect. This is 
compounded by shrinking consumer 
buying cycles and less showroom visits, 
which are leading to a growing focus 
on customer lifecycle management. In 
addition, the growing use of the internet 
in the vehicle buying process and 
ownership lifecycle continues to expand 
and forces OEMs to think about holistic 
dealer concepts, which integrate the 
internet and smartphone applications.
All these trends require OEMs to have 
dealer management, customer 
relationship management and BI 
solutions in a single enterprise technology 
platform that is connected to the cloud. 
With this, they can streamline processes 
across geographies and enable new 
automotive retail concepts. The platform 
needs to cover the entire customer 
lifecycle process, integrating internet 
applications, social media and telematics 
vehicle data, and it must be accessible 
from any device.
Today, the implementation of global 
solutions to enable new automotive 
retail concepts is a major strategic 
priority for OEMs within the 
automotive industry. This is driven 
by a few key trends.
Core Strength
The Microsoft Dynamics suite, in 
combination with Windows Azure and 
Of ce 365, are proven to support 
OEMs in succeeding in this new, 
fast paced market.
incadea has developed a product suite 
with this technology to bring together 
dealer management, customer and 
vehicle relationship management, 
and BI capabilities.
Using these solutions together, OEMs 
can improve the dealership experience 
by optimising and automating key 
operational processes; providing workers 
with role tailored dashboards to manage 
their tasks; better supporting sales team 
to optimise lead management and 
increase conversion rates; and improving 
business analysis with access to speci c 
information and reports by individual 
branch or car make across multiple 
servers, databases, companies or entire 
dealer networks.
Innovations that incadea has developed 
across the portfolio include role tailored 
user workspaces and dashboards, 
web clients, mobile clients and cloud 
enablement. These solutions can be 
deployed with prede ned industry 
con gurations and can transform from 
traditional on premise offerings to public 
cloud offerings, eliminating customer 
CAPEX investments and reducing 
deployment time and efforts.

Chief Executive Of cer
OEMs are responding to global 
competition and pressure on pro tability 
by seeking to standardise the business 
processes of their dealer networks. 
This is happening at the same time 
as OEMs are managing their expansion 
in BRIC and emerging markets. OEMs 
are also integrating web based and 
mobile technologies to enable them 
to manage the complete car sales 
and ownership life cycle.
Recognising these trends, incadea  
has developed a new generation  
of cloud enabled solutions including  
DMS (incadea.myengine), CVRM  
(incadea.cvrm) and BI (incadea.bi).
incadea is experiencing strong 
demand for its next generation solutions, 
especially in Asia where customers 
also prefer the SaaS model over the 
traditional on premise model for solutions 
delivery. In 2013 SaaS revenues are 
estimated to be 10% of revenues but 
we expect this proportion to grow 
substantially over the next three years. 
Overall, during 2012 incadea was 
successful in supporting the expansion 
of OEM customers as well as increasing 
market share by establishing new 
OEM relationships and increasing dealer 
network penetration and this trend 
is continuing.
A key element of our stated strategy is to 
support the expansion of OEM customers 
in key markets through incadea 
subsidiaries, whilst continuing to operate 
in certain territories through local 
partners. By controlling our international 
operations, we are able to enhance our 
growth prospects and pro tability by 
selling directly and delivering a full 
service to our customers.
During the year, we made signi cant 
progress in the implementation of our 
strategy, establishing a new subsidiary 
in China in uly 2012. Since then we have 
rapidly achieved signi cant success in 
China where we are experiencing very 
strong demand. incadea China already 
contributes signi cantly to the Group’s 
results and is expected to grow to our 
second largest operation worldwide.
incadea’s strong financial performance 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
reflects significant progress made in 
implementing our stated strategy which 
has been supported by a favourable 
market environment.

Strategy Overview
CEO’s Letter
We have strengthened our presence 
in India, New Zealand and Taiwan. This 
followed the establishment of incadea 
India in 2011 and the acquisition in  
2011 of our partners in Russia and New 
Zealand, the latter operating a branch 
of ce in Taiwan which is now the base  
for our growing operations in Asia Paci c 
outside China. Following the successful 
implementation of a project for BMW’s 
importer in Turkey, we plan to establish  
a direct operation for that country  
in 2013. 
We made signi cant progress with the 
development of our operations in Latin 
America and Iberia. Through our regional 
headquarters in Spain, incadea has 
implemented projects in Mexico, 
Paraguay, amaica and Colombia and  
has established a subsidiary in Mexico. 
We also acquired 100% of our former 
partner in Portugal, IS Dynamics, 
which now operates as incadea Portugal. 
We are also reviewing options for 
establishing incadea’s footprint in 
Brazil and Central America. 
Revenues generated through incadea 
subsidiaries accounted for approximately 
63% of the total for 2012 (49% for 2011) 
with the rest being generated from 
incadea Austria and we anticipate that 
this upward trend will continue over 
the next few years.
The progress we have made in the 
transition to being a direct, full software 
and service provider, is re ected in the 
growth in revenue from services which 
accounted for 46.9% of total revenue  
for 2012 (2011: 41%) which, in turn,  
is re ected in a 57% increase in 
operating margin to 16.2% for the  
year (2011: 10.3%).
Whilst BRIC and emerging economies 
represent the majority of the growth 
opportunity for incadea, we believe 
that there are strategic opportunities 
in Europe.

During 2012, incadea’s success in 
supporting existing OEM customers in 
their global expansion, as well as winning 
new OEM customers in key territories, 
resulted in 14% growth in our installed 
user base to 56,749 at 31 December  
2012 (1 anuary 2012: 49,691). Major 
achievements for 2012 included winning 
Qoros, the Chinese OEM, as well as 
developing relationships with Peugeot/
Citroën, Ford and Chevrolet.
Qoros
In September 2012 we announced a 
strategic partnership with Qoros, the joint 
venture between Chery Automobile, one 
of the largest Chinese OEMs, and Israel 
Corporation. The partnership is for the 
roll out of incadea’s full product suite to 
80 Qoros dealers in 2013 and up to a 
further 200 dealers in 2014. Qoros is also 
planning to use incadea as the strategic 
software partner for its planned entry 
into the European market in 2015. This 
partnership has signi cant strategic 
importance for the Chinese market and 
incadea is the rst international provider 
in this area to win a major deal with a 
Chinese OEM.
BMW Group
incadea is one of two global strategic 
partners of BMW Group for the 
implementation of a global initiative 
to standardise its DMS and retail 
CRM systems. Total users increased 
during 2012 by 24% to 16,486 at 
31 December 2012.
During the year pilot testing of  
next generation incadea.cvrm and  
incadea.myengine products was 
successfully completed. Roll out to  
more than 800 users at BMW Russia 
started in September 2012 with 
implementation expected to be 
completed during the rst half of 2014. 
Roll out in France will start in the rst 
half of 2013 for a total of 3,500 users 
expected by the end of 2015. Two major 
target markets for BMW in 2013 are 
Brazil and apan with others including 
 amaica, Mexico and elsewhere in  
Latin America.
Volkswagen Group
incadea is one of two global strategic 
partners of VW which we anticipate will 
grow substantially as a contributor to 
revenue and pro ts over the next few 
years. During 2012 we made signi cant 
progress with a roll out to more than 
1,800 users in several Asian countries 
(including India and China). New 
contracts have been signed in  
Malaysia and Hong Kong which will be 
implemented over the next two years. 
Strategic progress
Our strategy, outlined at the  
time of incadea’s IPO, has three  
key elements:
1. developing incadea into a global 
business by expanding our 
operations, in support of OEM 
customers and prospects, in the 
fast growing automotive markets 
of BRIC and other emerging 
economies;
2. transforming incadea from a 
pure play software company with 
a high dependency on partners 
and covering only a small part of 
the total value chain, into a full 
software and service provider with 
delivery primarily through 100% 
controlled subsidiaries; and 
3. maintaining incadea’s competitive 
advantage by delivering solutions 
based on our proprietary, 
next generation software and 
product suite, incorporating DMS, 
CRM and BI. incadea

Opel/General Motors
incadea is a strategic partner for Opel/
General Motors covering approximately 
530 dealers in 18 countries with 
approximately 14,300 users. We believe 
that there is potential to generate 
incremental revenues with Opel in Russia 
with scope for further growth with GM 
in Asia by extending our partnership 
with GM International Operations 
based in Shanghai.
Other OEMs
During 2012 incadea strengthened 
its relationship with other European 
and American OEMs and their dealer 
networks. We are currently in negotiation 
with European OEMs for contracts 
covering more than 450 dealerships in 
Europe and a similar number of dealers 
in Asia to be rolled out over the next 
two to three years. Signi cant progress 
has been achieved by leveraging our 
European relationship with American 
OEMs in Asia. We are currently 
negotiating contracts across spell Asian 
countries, such as China, apan, India, 
Thailand and others, with a total size 
of more than 1,000 dealerships.

The expansion of OEMs in BRIC and 
other emerging markets is re ected in 
the geographic analysis of revenue for 
the year. In a trend which we expect to 
continue, revenue growth is being driven 
by expansion in Asia Paci c, notably 
China, Russia and Latin America. 
Approximately two thirds of license 
revenue in Europe is through partners 
and we anticipate that we will achieve 
further growth through penetration 
of markets such as Germany, Italy 
and France.
Russia and CIS
In Russia and CIS, the growth achieved 
followed the acquisition of a controlling 
interest in our Russian partner in early 
2011, was mainly driven by BMW 
projects. Our negotiations with other 
European OEMs will also have a positive 
impact on our Russian business over the 
next years. The agreement with Qoros 
has signi cantly enhanced incadea’s 
reputation in the Chinese market, 
especially with Chinese OEMs. As a result 
we are now in discussions with importers 
of Chinese brands and their networks 
in Russia.

Strategy Overview
CEO’s Letter
China
The majority of new users in 2012 
were sold through incadea China, the 
subsidiary established during the year. 
The strategic partnership with Qoros 
is a major achievement for incadea 
whose pro le and reputation has been 
signi cantly enhanced not only in China 
but also with OEMs around the world. 
incadea China is currently working 
on potential opportunities with 
eight international OEMs.
India
incadea’s subsidiary in India is currently 
working with BMW Group and VW Group 
as strategic OEMs for the support and the 
roll out of various products and services. 
The subsidiary is also in negotiations with 
two potential European OEM customers 
for implementations all over India.
Latin America
At the time of incadea’s IPO, we identi ed
Latin America in general and Brazil in 
particular as an important potential 
market for the Group. In 2012, we 
established a subsidiary in Mexico City 
and expansion into the Brazilian market 
is planned for 2013.
Technology and product development
In 2012, €3.4 million was invested in new 
products, enhancing their functionality 
and other development to ensure that 
incadea solutions ful l the future needs 
of our OEM customers and their dealer 
networks. This has involved integrating 
internet applications, social media, 
telematics vehicle data with any device 
as well as integrating the transactional 
back of ce ERP process across entire 
dealer networks. A major competitive 
advantage for incadea results from its 
solutions running on the Microsoft 
Dynamics product family in combination 
with the Azure (Cloud) platform and 
Of ce 365, leading to signi cant bene ts 
to OEM customers from low cost, product 
standardisation and rapid deployment.
During the year, we launched our 
next generation DMS, incadea.myengine, 
and completed the development of 
incadea.cvrm (customer and vehicle 
relationship management) and incadea.bi 
(business intelligence) products with 
several pilot implementations being 
performed in Austria, Spain and Russia. 
Following the successful completion of 
pilot projects, licenses have been sold to 
end customers, providing the rst step 
towards commercial availability in 2013.
In 2012 we sold 7,058 licenses, with the 
majority of them being for our traditional 
DMS, incadea.engine. Furthermore, 
we successfully sold incadea.myengine 
projects in China, Mexico, Columbia and 
Middle East. Following the decision to 
launch in new markets such as in South 
America with incadea.myengine only, 
we expect that 2013 will be the last year 
when sales of incadea.engine exceed 
sales of incadea.myengine.
People
Global expansion and the increase in 
services delivered are re ected in growth 
in the total number of employees and a 
change in the mix of staff roles and skills. 
Total employees increased by 27.5% to 
301 at 31 December 2012 (1 anuary 
2012: 236) with the majority employed 
in Germany, Greece, Russia and China. 
This expansion primarily re ects areas 
of growing operational need, including 
the increased emphasis on consulting 
and project management to support 
the full software and service solutions 
being delivered outside Europe.
In conclusion, our business prospects 
remain very strong, supported by a solid 
customer pipeline and we are con dent 
that the Group has achieved the right 
positioning to continue generating 
pro table growth. incadea

Vendor partner
incadea solutions are based on  
Microsoft products: incadea.engine, 
incadea.myengine and incadea.cvrm 
are vertical solutions developed over 
the standard Microsoft platforms and 
complement the elements provided 
by Microsoft. So, as far as licenses 
and maintaining lines of business are 
concerned, incadea group is a major 
vendor for Microsoft.
The incadea – Microsoft relationship 
is very strong, both in the technological 
as well as commercial level as it is proven 
from both the partnership level as well as 
its ranking among Microsoft’s partners.
Because of the InnerCircle recognition, 
incadea has direct contacts into the top 
management of Microsoft and has a 
senior executive as sponsor.
With the “Certi ed for Microsoft 
Dynamics” status of incadea.myengine 
all Microsoft subsidiaries have to present 
incadea for the automotive sector.
With the regional awards (ERP Partner in 
Russia & Finalist VAR in Western Europe) 
incadea is pushed by the local Microsoft 
subsidiary into the dedicated market. 
For greater areas (like Western Europe) 
incadea gets new operational contacts.
The gold and silver status, earned in the 
Microsoft Partner Network, demonstrate 
the deep knowledge of incadea in 
these areas. 
incadea has very good connections within 
the Operations Centres of Microsoft that 
allows incadea to serve our customer 
needs at the best level.
As incadea is represented in several 
partner advisory boards, incadea is 
provided with key information before  
its partner channel. That provides a  
key advantage to incadea in developing 
its strategy.
Operational 
Review 
Partners
In order to fulfil its target  
to offer quality products and 
services, incadea maintains 
significant relationships with 
valuable partners, either from 
customer or vendor side.
Introduction incadea
Annual Report 2012

Strategy Overview
Operational Review
Contractually the relationship with 
Microsoft is determined by the following:
(i) a solution provider agreement 
(the “SPA”);
(ii) an independent software vendor 
embed agreement (the “ISV”); 
(a) Solution Provider Agreement
The SPA is the primary agreement 
between incadea and Microsoft, pursuant 
to which incadea is entitled to combine 
its software with Microsoft’s products 
and is appointed as a distribution partner 
of Microsoft. Under the SPA incadea is 
granted a non exclusive right to provide 
Dynamics NAV software and respective 
services to customers and is entitled to: 
(i) order licenses in the Dynamics NAV 
software and related services from 
Microsoft; and 
(ii) to distribute such licenses to third 
parties.
(b) Independent Software Vendor 
Embed Agreement
The ISV enables incadea to integrate the 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV software into its 
software and to distribute such software, 
either directly or indirectly, through 
resellers to end users. If the software 
is distributed by resellers, the reseller is 
only entitled to distribute the Dynamics 
NAV software, but not to grant 
sublicences to end users. In such case 
the Dynamics NAV software is then 
directly licensed by incadea to end users.
Customer Partner
To date, incadea maintains long term 
relationships with 16 VAR partners, based in:
Austria Hungary
Belgium Italy
Croatia Kenya
Cyprus Lebanon
Czech Republic Netherlands
France Norway
Germany Poland
Hong Kong Switzerland
Following the strategy of expansion, 
incadea has continuously facilitated 
direct sales, and to support this process 
acquired a number of successful partners 
over the course of 2012, thus drastically 
increasing its own share of sales in 
comparison to the previous years.
At the same time, two new partners were 
signed in 2012, enabling incadea to move 
into a completely new market of the 
Middle East as well as expand its 
presence in the Balkans.
Approach per region 
Europe 
Europe region is addressed from 
both incadea companies (af liates and 
headquarters) as well as partner channel. 
Speci cally:
Germany: 
Addressed through partner channel 
except OEM level services which are 
delivered by incadea Germany (invoiced 
through incadea Austria)
Austria:
Addressed through partner channel
Spain:
Addressed through af liate (incadea Spain)
Greece and south east Europe region:
Addressed through af liate (incadea 
Greece). incadea Greece is planned 
to be also the regional headquarters 
coordinating actions also for Turkey
Portugal:
Addressed through af liate (incadea 
Portugal)
Rest of Europe:
Addressed through partner channel. 
Russia
Being one of the most important markets 
for incadea group, Russia was the rst 
region, where the change of the partner 
to own af liate model was introduced. 
In Russia there are implementations in 
several OEMs, although the majority of 
the installed base is referred to BMW.
Latin America
Latin America, although having the 
smallest footprint in relation to the 
other regions, constitutes a key area 
for the Group.
Until the end of 2011, the LatAm region 
was served through the partner channel. 
During 2012, major activities in the area 
were shifted from the partner channel  
to incadea Spain, while in the second 
semester of 2012, the local af liate 
incadea Mexico was established to 
further strengthen the Groups’  
presence in the region.
incadea Spain, Mexico and Portugal 
constitute the operational branch of the 
Group focusing on the LatAm, Caribbean 
and Brazilian markets.
Africa
The African market is served through 
the partners. 
Asia/Paci c (inc. Middle East)
The Asia/Paci c region (inc. Middle East) 
region is approached through a hybrid 
model, depending on country, incadea 
af liate establishment and customer 
relationships.
incadea group operates in the region 
through its af liates (incadea New 
Zealand, India, China) and through the 
partner channel (mainly Tectura). In 
addition, as well as for the Middle East 
region, incadea is providing services 
through the central service organisation 
of Germany.
Being a high growth area, incadea is 
proceeding fast with its strategy to shift 
from the partner channel to own access 
to the addressed markets either through 
acquisitions (e.g. former partner Avanti, 
acquired as incadea New Zealand, China) 
or establishment (i.e. India).

contributed 57%, Russia 28% and APAC 
area 12%, already in 2012, APAC has 
increased to 30%, Russia to 22% and 
Europe has declined to 42%.  
The BRIC countries have played a 
signi cant role in revenue generation and 
growth due to rapid development of the 
automotive market in these countries. 
Revenue growth in Asia has exceeded 
expectations signi cantly, going up by 
273%, whereas the introduction in Latin 
America has also been deemed very 
successful with almost a thousand 
licences sold in 2012. Russian revenues 
grew by 38.9% thus also displaying 
satisfactory results. In total, incadea 
achieved an almost 50% revenue growth.
 
In 2012, a big part of license sales 
(approx. 45%) stemmed from incadea’s 
biggest client to date – the BMW group. A 
big achievement was winning the young 
Chinese OEM Qoros and developing 
relationships with other OEMs such as 
PSA, Ford, and Chevrolet.
Synergies exploitation within regions 
 internal development of the human 
resources and attraction of skilled, 
experienced personnel that could

Sales per region
 incadea is currently experiencing a

solutions projects in Asia with the 
focus to provide end to end

The increased rate of expansion has 
required investment and working capital 
and resulted in greater cash consumption 
than originally anticipated. However, the 
balance sheet remains strong being debt 
free and with a net cash balance as at 
31 December 2012 of €2.3 million.
The Group has recorded a 49.4% growth 
in its revenue, accompanied by a 135% 
increase in its operating pro ts, indicating 
the impact of the Group’s strategy on its 
 nancial performance. The shift from the 
indirect/partner channel business to the 
direct business in selected geographic 
areas with increased service orientation 
was a key factor for the healthy growth 
achieved. Group revenue for the year 
amounted to €29.3 million (2011: €19.6 
million) and operating pro t more than 
doubled to €4.7 million (2011: €2.0 million).
The recurring revenue stream amounted 
to approximately €13 million with 
an adjusted (normalised) EBITDA of 
€7 .1 million.

by 42.4% to €23.7 million (2011: €16.6 
million) as a result of the international 
expansion of the Group, especially in 
Asia, and increased headquarter costs 
associated with being an AIM traded 
company. We anticipate that nancial 
ratios will improve in line with the 
development of local subsidiaries and 
growth of the Group overall. Excluding 
IPO costs the selling, general and 
administration (“SG&A”) expense to 
revenue ratio was reduced to 32.2% 
(2011: 33%). 
Adjusted EBITDA 
The 67% increase in gross pro t 
excluding depreciation and amortisation 
to €15.7 million (2011: €9.4 million) 
re ects an improvement in gross margin 
to 53.7% (2011: 48%) with maintenance 
and services achieving gross margins 
of 61.6% and 42.6% respectively.
IPO costs charged to pro t for the year 
amounted to €0.7 million (2011: €N/A)
Investments
In 2012 total development expenditure 
capitalised during the year reduced  
to €3.4 million (2011: €4.1 million), 
equivalent to 12% of Group revenue 
(2011: 21%), with the higher level in 
2011 being attributed to the nalisation 
of the next generation DMS, CRM and 
BI products.
Management anticipates that 
development expenditure capitalised for 
2013 will fall further as efforts focus on 
commercialising new products following 
completion of pilot programmes. 
The Group invested a total of €2.59 
million (net of cash acquired) during 
the year in paying off New Zealand and 
Russia’s initial acquisition, acquiring the 
outstanding minority interest in incadea 
Russia and in establishing incadea China 
and acquiring 100% of incadea’s former 
partner in Portugal. 
All the other carrying values of goodwill 
arising on other acquisitions have been 
reviewed and there have been no 
impairments. 
Cash Flow and Financing 
In May 2012 the Group raised €16.7 
million (€14.6 million net of expenses) 
via the placing of new shares with UK 
and European institutional investors 
and an admission to trading on AIM. 
Cash generated from operations 
amounted to €1.2 million (€2.0 million  
in 2011) with the decrease stemming 
mainly from increased working capital 
requirements. The increase in receivables 
re ects the growth in revenues; 
expressed as a percentage of revenue, 
receivables were slightly less compared 
to 31 December 2011. Cash used in 
investing activities amounted to €5.5 
million (€9.4 million in 2011) of which €0.9 
million were used in acquisitions and €4.5 
million in capital expenditure. In addition, 
the Group invested €1.6 million for the 
acquisition of the non controlling interest 
for the Russian af liate.
Capital expenditure served the two 
main growth factors of the Group, i.e. 
expansion in new territories with a capital 
expenditure of approximately €1.1 million 
for the necessary infrastructure and 
€3.4 million for the nalisation of the 
new products. incadea’s balance sheet 
remained strong as at 31 December 2012 
with a net asset position of €30.8 million, 
no borrowings and a net cash position of 
€2.3 million, after the repayment of 
€7.2 million of borrowings.

Assessment of the Risks by Management
Management and control of risks within 
the Group is embedded within basic 
operating procedures. These procedures 
comprise a range of measures including 
corporate policies, operating rules, 
systematic reporting, external audits, 
self assessment and continuous 
monitoring by the Board of Directors 
and the executive management team.
The Group operates globally in varied 
markets and the principal risks and 
uncertainties that may exist are set  
out below.
The Directors have evaluated the 
principal business risks and uncertainties 
affecting the Group. Opposite is a 
summary of the principal business 
risks and uncertainties, together with 
mitigations in place, although it is not 
intended to be an exhaustive list. For 
each risk, the Directors have identi ed 
means by which its impact could be 
reduced or controlled in a cost effective 
way, whilst accepting that some risks 
cannot be completely eliminated and 
there may be other risks to the business 
that we have not identi ed. The Executive 
Directors actively monitor risk issues and 
report regularly to the Board on such 
matters, including progress on resolving 
risk issues.

All client accounts closely monitored for satisfaction. Special 
Attention to strategic customers, where combined local and 
HQ team is involved.
International Project Managers assigned into key projects 
(e.g. Qoros).
Inability to recruit or retain high calibre management

Strategic Risks
Operational Risks
Risk Control Presented
Sales and Marketing efforts may not lead to additional  
new business.
Enhanced relationships with major OEMs through offering 
quality, value adding services, on hands consultants and 
up to date technology.
Reliance on OEMs for existing business and entry into  
new markets.
The Group’s ability to market its products and services to 
its existing customers and, as it expands, to new customers 
in new geographical markets relies on the recommendations 
of OEMs and the compatibility of the Group’s products with 
the requirements of OEMs and vehicle dealerships.
Enhanced relationships with major OEMs through offering 
quality, value adding services, hands on consultants and 
up to date technology and on the same time change of 
business strategy in the foreseeable future (instead of 
using OEMs and Partners incadea will move forward to 
the end customer.
Relationship with Microsoft.
The Group is substantially dependent on Microsoft products 
which are integrated into the Group’s own product offering.
A change in Microsoft’s strategy, products or pricing, or the 
termination of or failure to renew existing agreements with 
Microsoft would have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s performance and prospects.
The Directors believe that the Group’s relationship with 
Microsoft is strong and the Group is protected in the short 
term against price increases under the terms of its 
agreements with Microsoft.
Although there is no guarantee that the Group’s existing 
relationship with Microsoft will continue on its current terms, 
the participation of incadea in the forums and key partnership 
meetings of Microsoft, gives a level of assurance for the proper 
handling on any changes in MS strategy.
Loss of investor con dence/inability to raise nance. Regular communication with investors/ nancial advisers/
brokers/communication consultants.
Lack of management control over acquisition/establishment 
of new companies/of ces.
Contracts structured to limit nancial risk.
Local management incentivised to ensure common goals and 
management approach.
Close involvement of all related departments in new 
companies/of ces establishment process.
Challenges to intellectual property rights. There is a risk 
that third parties will breach IP rights held by incadea. 
There is also a risk that a third party alleges patent 
infringement or other breach of intellectual property rights 
by incadea. Alleged IP breaches can be very expensive to 
defend even if there is apparently little ground for the claim 
because of the legal and technical complexities involved 
in asserting IP rights.
Ensure adequate protection of our own IP is in place.
Legal advice received on cost effective way to register 
trademarks and other IP rights in key markets.
Legal advice sought to ensure risk of potential IP 
infringement by incadea is minimised.
Litigation relating to contractual client arrangement or 
employee contract.
Ensure that legal advice is taken when any matter is likely 
to result in legal action.

Strategy Overview 
Risk Management
Risks Resulting from International 
Operations
The Group is also subject to a variety of 
other risks and challenges in managing 
an organisation operating in various 
countries, including those related to:
 Challenges caused by distance, 
language and cultural difference;
 General economic conditions in each 
country or region;
 Fluctuation in currency exchange rates;
 Frequent regulatory changes in less 
established legal systems;
 Political unrest, terrorism and the 
potential for other hostilities;
 Longer payment cycles and difficulties 
in collecting accounts receivable;
 Overlapping tax regimes;
 The Group’s ability to repatriate funds 
held by international subsidiaries at 
favorable tax rates or at all;
 Difficulties in transferring funds to 
and from certain countries; and
 Reduced protection for intellectual 
property rights in some countries.
Financial Risks
Interest Rate Risk
Although during the current year the 
interest rate risk presented immaterial 
to the Group due to non existence of 
debt obligations, Management monitors 
on a constant basis the interest rate 
variances and evaluates the need for 
assuming certain positions for the 
hedging of such risks.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of 
changes in foreign exchange rates 
relates primarily to the Group’s operating 
activities (when revenues or expenses 
are denominated in a different currency 
from the Group’s presentation currency) 
and the Group’s net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries. The Group is active 
internationally and is exposed to 
variations in foreign currency exchange 
rate which arise mainly from British 
Pound (incadea plc), Indian Rupee 
(incadea India Private Limited), Rubles 
(incadea Russia), Chinese Yuan (incadea 
China) and New Zealand Dollar (incadea 
New Zealand). The Group’s exposure to 
foreign currency changes for all other 
currencies is not material (including the 
foreign currencies of the new operations 
of the Group in Iberoamericana). 
Credit Risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk from 
its operating activities (primarily for trade 
receivables and loan notes) and from its 
 nancing activities, including deposits 
with banks and nancial institutions, 
foreign exchange transactions and 
other nancial instruments.
The Group has policies in place to ensure 
that sales are made to customers with 
a high credit standing. Long term and 
ongoing relationship with customers 
minimise the risk of bad debts.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit 
risk, due to the failure of counter parties 
to perform their obligations as of 
31 December 2012 and 31 December 
2011, in relation to each class of 
recognised nancial assets, is the 
carrying amount of those assets as 
indicated in the accompanying 
statements of nancial position.
Liquidity Risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by 
monitoring forecasted cash ows and 
ensuring that adequate banking facilities 
and reserve borrowing facilities 
are maintained.
Capital Management
The Group’s capital management 
objectives are:
 to ensure the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern
 to provide an adequate return  
to shareholders by pricing products 
and services commensurately with 
the level of risk.
The Group’s goal in capital management 
is to ensure that it maintains a strong 
credit rating with its banks and suppliers 
in order to support the expansion of the 
business and maximise shareholder 
value. The Group manages its capital 
structure according to economic 
conditions and makes adjustments to 
it in light of changes to those conditions. 
Furthermore the Group is continuously 
reviewing its working and investment 
capital needs in order to secure cash 
 ows and nancing facilities to support 
them. The Group is using equity to 
 nance its product development and 
infrastructure needs. In situations where 
new capital requirements are imposed by 
new projects that the Group is aiming 
to engage, careful planning is undertaken 
to ensure optimum spending within the 
project’s resources and within existing 
and/or new nancing facilities.
Management assesses the Group’s capital 
requirements in order to maintain an 
ef cient overall nancing structure while 
avoiding excessive leverage. This takes 
into account the subordination levels of the 
Group’s various classes of debt. The Group 
manages the capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it in the light of changes 
in economic conditions and the risk 
characteristics of the underlying assets. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Group may adjust the 
amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new 
shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. incadea

The primary aim of our financial management is to maintain liquidity in the incadea 
Group at a level that is adequate to meet our obligations at all times. Finance may 
be required to proactively sustain liquidity at that level. It may also be necessary 
to enter into financing transactions when additional funds are required that cannot 
be wholly sourced from free cash flow (for example, to finance large acquisitions).

Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare nancial statements for each 
 nancial year. The Directors have elected 
to prepare the nancial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
for use in the European Union. The 
Directors must not approve the nancial 
statements unless they are satis ed that 
they give a true and fair view of the pro t 
or loss of the Company and the Group for 
that period covered by the nancial 
statements and the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the Group at the end of 
that period. In preparing these nancial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 state whether applicable IFRS 
(as adopted in the EU) have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the nancial statements; and
 prepare the nancial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume the Group 
and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group 
and Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the 
Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Directors’ 
Responsibilities
The Directors 
are responsible for 
preparing the Annual 
Report and the 
financial statements 
in accordance with 
applicable law and 
regulations.

The work of the Committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the integrity of the Company’s 
financial statements, reviewing significant 
financial reporting issues, reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control and risk management systems, 
monitoring the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and overseeing 
the relationship with the external auditors 
(including advising on their appointment, 
agreeing the scope of the audit and 
reviewing the audit findings).
The Audit Committee comprises Philip 
Lawler, David Hobley, David Cotterell and 
Nikolaos Vardinoyannis and chaired by 
Philip Lawler. The Audit Committee meets 
as frequently as needed and in this 
current year we had eight meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining and agreeing 
with the Board the framework for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors and other designated 
senior executives and, within the terms 
of the agreed framework, determining 
the total individual remuneration 
packages of such persons including, 
where appropriate, bonuses, incentive 
payments and share options or other 
share awards. The remuneration of 
non-executive Directors is a matter for 
the chairman and the executive members 
of the Board. No Director is involved in 
any decision as to his or her own 
remuneration.
Accordingly, whilst the Corporate 
Governance Code does not apply to 
AIM companies, the Directors intend 
to observe the requirements of the 
Corporate Governance Code to the extent 
they consider appropriate in the light of 
the Group’s size, stage of development 
and resources. The Board also proposes, 
so far as practicable, to follow the 
recommendations set out in the 
corporate governance guidelines for 
smaller quoted companies published 
by the Quoted Companies Alliance.
Board
The Board is responsible for the overall 
management of the Group including the 
formulation and approval of the Group’s 
long-term objectives and strategy, the 
approval of budgets, the oversight of 
Group operations, the maintenance 
of sound internal control and risk 
management systems and the 
implementation of Group strategy, 
policies and plans. Whilst the Board may 
delegate specific responsibilities, there is 
a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for decisions by the Board; such 
reserved matters will include, amongst 
other things, approval of significant 
capital expenditure, material business 
contracts and major corporate 
transactions. The Board meet on a 
regular basis to review performance. 
In the current year we had eight 
meetings of the BoD.
Cooperation between the Board and 
other Committees
The Board has established an Audit 
Committee, a Remuneration Committee 
and a Disclosure Committee with formally 
delegated duties and responsibilities, 
as described opposite. 
Corporate 
Governance 
Policy
There are no specific 
corporate governance 
guidelines which  
apply generally 
to companies 
incorporated in Jersey, 
however the Directors 
recognise the value 
and importance of 
high standards of 
corporate governance.

The Remuneration Committee comprises

Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee has as 
primary responsibility to ensuring 
compliance with the AIM Rules and 
disclosure of information, in particular 
under AIM Rules 11, 17, 18 and 19. The 
Disclosure Committee works closely with 
the Board to ensure that the Company’s 
nominated adviser is provided with any 
information they reasonably request or 
require in order for them to carry out 
their responsibilities under the AIM 
rules and the AIM rules for nominated 
advisers.
The Disclosure Committee comprises 
David Hobley, Werner Leinauer and 
Alexandros Tsaparas and chaired by 
David Hobley. The Disclosure Committee 
meets as frequently as needed and in this 
current year we had two meetings.
Share dealing code
The Company has adopted a share 
dealing code for Directors and applicable 
employees of the Group for the purpose 
of ensuring compliance by such persons 
with the provisions of the AIM rules 
relating to dealings in the Company’s 
securities (including, in particular, rule 21 
of the AIM rules). The Directors consider 
that this share dealing code is 
appropriate for a company whose shares 
are admitted to trading on the AIM.
The Company will take proper steps to 
ensure compliance by the Directors and 
applicable employees within the terms of 
the share dealing code and the relevant 
provisions of the AIM rules (including 
Rule 21).

Directors remuneration
The Board recognises that Directors’ remuneration is of legitimate interest to the shareholders. The Group operates within 
a competitive environment, with performance depending on the individual contributions of the Directors and employees and 
believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
Policy on Executive Directors remuneration
The policy of the Board is to provide executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the 
calibre necessary to maintain the Group’s position and to reward them enhancing shareholder value and return. It aims to provide 
sufficient levels of remuneration to do this, but to avoid paying more than is necessary. The remuneration will also reflect the 
Director’s responsibility and contains incentives to deliver the Group’s objectives.

Corporate Governance
Remuneration Report
Internal controls and risk management
During the year, the Board has formally reviewed the Group’s risk profile and reported on the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls and management of Group risk in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. This review is required 
to address not only internal financial controls but other risks and controls of the business. The Directors acknowledge that they 
are responsible for the Company’s system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate business risks 
and which provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material mis-statement or loss.
The Company has established risk management procedures, which the Directors consider appropriate to a Group of incadea’s size 
and complexity, and during the year, the internal controls and risk management procedures were reviewed by the Directors. This 
is achieved through a series of reports and meetings of specific committees (those that are presented above). The Company has 
a Group Risk Manual, which sets out the key risks by region and by function and the controls in place to manage the risks and 
identifies actions to be taken to improve risk management processes. The risk review process focuses on adopting enterprise 
wide risk management techniques on a consistent basis and improving risk reporting and management. Given the size and nature 
of the business the Directors consider that the Group is compliant with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Each senior executive is responsible for managing risks in his or her region or function and making regular reports on risk issues 
to both the main Board and Group Executive Board. This risk analysis covers all business risks including commercial, financial, 
operational, legal and environmental risks. The Board is thus able to monitor the risk profile for all significant business risks. 
Recommendations on internal controls and risk improvement are reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board.
Budgetary process
Each year the Board approves the annual budget and key risk areas are identified. Performance is monitored and relevant action 
is taken throughout the year through regular reporting to the Board of variances from the budget, updated forecasts for the year 
together with information on the key risk areas.
Internal audit
The Group currently does not have an internal audit function as the Directors consider this to be inappropriate given the current 
size of the Group. However, this situation is reviewed by the Board annually. An element of internal audit assurance is achieved 
by use of internal staff working on specific projects, for example, to review the policies and procedures relating to information 
security, including the effectiveness of related internal controls. incadea

Independent Auditor’s Report
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of incadea plc
We have audited the nancial statements of incadea plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
and the related notes. The nancial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the nancial statements and for being satis ed 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the nancial statements suf cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
 Whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed
 the reasonableness of signi cant accounting estimates 
made by the Company’s Directors; and 
 the overall presentation of the nancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the nancial and non- nancial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on nancial statements
In our opinion the nancial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2012 and of the Group’s pro t for the 
year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the nancial year for which the nancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the nancial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 the nancial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.

1. Nature of operations
incadea plc was incorporated in Jersey on 8 November 2011 
and has been established as the new holding company of the 
international incadea group. Founded in 2000, the Group is 
a leading international provider of software solutions and 
services to the automotive dealership industry, with products 
including dealer management, business intelligence and 
customer and vehicle relationship management systems, 
which are used by multinational car manufacturers, OEMs, 
such as BMW Group and VW Group and their dealership 
networks. incadea’s primary product is its DMS system, 
incadea.engine, which provides automotive dealers with 
solutions to integrate departmental functions and business 
processes with the aim of increasing productivity and 
ef ciency. incadea serves a growing community of 56,749 
users in over 2,090 dealerships in 80 countries. Local services 
are guaranteed by incadea’s af liates and in-country partner 
network all around the world.
After a number of years of signi cant investment in its products 
and building relationships with major OEMs, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to bene t from the current 
and expected expansion of OEMs’ dealer networks in high 
growth countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.
2. Signi cant events and transactions
The Group’s management believes that the Group is 
well positioned despite the continuing dif cult economic 
circumstances. Factors contributing to the Group’s strong 
position are:
 no signi cant decline in order intake experienced on large 
projects. Further, the Group has several long-term 
contracts with a number of its customers
 the Group does not expect to need additional borrowing 
facilities in the next 12 months as a result of its signi cant 
 nancial resources, existing facilities and strong liquidity 
reserves. Any additional debt is not essential for nancing 
the current operations. The Group has signi cant headroom 
to comply with its debt as and when they fall due.
 the Group’s major customers have not experienced nancial 
dif culties. Credit quality of trade receivables as at 
31 December 2012 is considered to be good.
Overall, the Group is in a strong position despite the current 
economic environment, and has suf cient capital and liquidity 
to service its operating activities and working capital. The 
Group’s objectives and policies for managing capital, credit 
risk and liquidity risk are described below in summary.
E posure to economic cycle
The Group could be affected by unforeseen events outside 
its control including economic and political events and trends, 
in ation and de ation or currency exchange uctuation. The 
combined effect of these factors is dif cult to predict and an 
investment in the Company could be affected adversely by 
changes in economic, political, administrative, taxation or 
other regulatory factors in any jurisdiction in which the 
Group may operate.
Litigation risks
All industries, including the software industry, are subject to 
legal claims, with and without merit. The Group may become 
involved in legal disputes in the future. Defence and settlement 
costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that have 
no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation 
process, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any 
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements
for the period January to December 2012
particular legal proceeding will not have a material effect 
on the Group’s nancial position or results of operations.
Currency risk
Currency uctuations may affect the cash ow which the 
Group will realise from its operations, as it is likely to receive 
payment for the services it provides in the currencies of the 
countries in which it operates, whilst certain of the Group’s 
costs are likely to be incurred in other currencies.
Operations in emerging markets
A large portion of the future growth of the Group is expected 
to come from emerging markets. Emerging markets generally 
may not operate as ef ciently as those in developed countries. 
Companies based in emerging markets are not necessarily 
subject to uniform accounting and nancial reporting 
standards, practices and requirements comparable to those 
applicable to companies based in developed countries, thereby 
potentially increasing the risk of fraud or other deceptive 
practices. Moreover, the quality and reliability of of cial data 
published by the government or securities exchanges in 
emerging markets may not accurately re ect the actual 
circumstances being reported.
3. General information and basis for preparation
The consolidated nancial statements of incadea plc have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. The 
 nancial statements have been prepared under the historic 
cost convention. The preparation of nancial statements 
in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities at the date of the nancial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event 
or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those 
estimates (on paragraph 6 presented the critical accounting 
estimates and judgements that Management take on). 
The Company and its subsidiaries undertaking are referred 
to in this report as the Group.
The nancial information is presented in € (“Euros”) 
and amounts are rounded to the nearest (€k) except when 
otherwise indicated. Differences that may occur are due 
to rounding.
4. Changes in accounting policies
Standards amendments and interpretations to e isting 
standards that are not yet effective and have not been 
adopted early by the Group
At the date of authorisation of these nancial statements, 
certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to 
existing standards have been published by the IASB but are 
not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the 
Group. Management anticipates that all of the relevant 
pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting 
policies for the rst period beginning after the effective 
date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, 
amendments and interpretations that are expected to be 
relevant to the Group’s nancial statements is provided below. 
Certain other new standards and interpretations have been 
issued but are not expected to have a material impact on 
the Group’s nancial statements. Financial Statements

(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive 
Income (Amendments to IAS )
The Amendments to IAS 1 are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after July 2012 (IAS 1.91) and require entities 
to Group items presented in other comprehensive income 
(“OCI”) into those that, in accordance with other IFRSs, will 
not be reclassi ed subsequently to pro t or loss and those that 
will be reclassi ed subsequently to pro t or loss when speci c 
conditions are met. The existing option to present items of OCI 
either before tax or net of tax remains unchanged; however, if 
the items are presented before tax, then the Amendments to 
IAS require the tax related to each of the two groups of OCI 
to be shown separately.
IFRS  Financial Instruments (IFRS )
The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement” (IAS 39) in its entirety 
with IFRS 9. To date, the chapters dealing with recognition, 
classi cation, measurement and derecognition of nancial 
assets and liabilities have been issued. These chapters are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 
2015. Chapters dealing with impairment methodology and 
hedge accounting are still being developed. Further, in 
November 2011, the IASB tentatively decided to consider 
making limited modi cations to IFRS 9’s nancial asset 
classi cation model to address application issues. The Group’s 
management have yet to assess the impact of this new 
standard on the Group’s consolidated nancial statements. 
However, Management does not expect to implement IFRS 
until all of its chapters have been published and they can 
comprehensively assess the impact of all changes.
Consolidation standards
A package of new consolidation standards is effective for 
annual periods beginning or after January 2013. Information 
on these new standards is presented below. Management 
has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of these 
new and revised standards on the Group’s consolidated 
 nancial statements.
IFRS  Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS )
IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements” (IAS 27) and SIC 12 “Consolidation 
– Special Purpose Entities”. IFRS 10 revises the de nition of 
control and provides extensive new guidance on its application. 
These new requirements have the potential to affect which of 
the Group’s investees are considered to be subsidiaries and 
therefore change the scope of consolidation. However, the 
requirements on consolidation procedures, accounting for 
changes in non-controlling interests and accounting for loss 
of control of a subsidiary remain the same. Management’s 
provisional analysis is that IFRS 10 will not change the 
classi cation (as subsidiaries or otherwise) of any of the 
Group’s existing investees at 31 December 2012. 
IFRS  oint Arrangements (IFRS )
IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 “Interests in Joint Ventures” (IAS 
31). It aligns more closely the accounting by the investors with 
their rights and obligations relating to the joint arrangement. 
In addition, IAS 31’s option of using proportionate consolidation 
for joint ventures has been eliminated. IFRS 11 now requires 
the use of the equity accounting method, which is currently 
used for investments in associates. As at 31 December 2012 
the Group has no joint arrangement within the scope of IFRS 11.
IFRS  Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities  
(IFRS )
IFRS 12 integrates and makes consistent the disclosure 
requirements for various types of investments, including 
unconsolidated structured entities. It introduces new 
disclosure requirements about the risks to which an entity 
is exposed from its involvement with structured entities.
Transition guidance for IFRS   
Subsequent to issuing the new standards the IASB made some 
changes to the transitional provisions in IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and 
IFRS 12. The guidance con rms that the entity is not required 
to apply IFRS 10 retrospectively in certain circumstances and 
clari es the requirements to present adjusted comparatives. 
The guidance also makes changes to IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 
which provide similar relief from the presentation or 
adjustment of comparative information for periods prior to the 
immediately preceding period. Further, it provides additional 
relief by removing the requirement to present comparatives 
for the disclosures relating to unconsolidated structured 
entities for any period before the rst annual period for 
which IFRS 12 is applied.
The new guidance is also effective for annual periods on 
or after 1 January 2013.
Consequential amendments to IAS 27 “Separate Financial 
Statements” (IAS 27) and IAS 28 “Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures” (IAS 28)
IAS 27 now only addresses separate nancial statements. 
IAS 28 brings investments in joint ventures into its scope. 
However, IAS 28’s equity accounting methodology 
remains unchanged.
IFRS  Fair Value Measurement (IFRS )
IFRS 13 clari es the de nition of fair value and provides 
related guidance and enhanced disclosures about fair value 
measurements. It does not affect which items are required 
to be fair valued.
IFRS 13 applies prospectively for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2013. Management is in the process of 
reviewing its valuation methodologies for conformity with the 
new requirements and has yet to complete its assessment of 
their impact on the Group’s consolidated nancial statements.
Amendments to IAS  Employee Bene ts  
(IAS  Amendments)
The IAS 19 Amendments include a number of targeted 
improvements throughout the Standard. The main changes 
relate to de ned bene t plans. They:
 eliminate the “corridor method”, requiring entities to 
recognise all actuarial gains and losses arising in the 
reporting period
 changes the measurement and presentation of certain 
components of de ned bene t cost
 enhance the disclosure requirements, including information 
about the characteristics of de ned bene t plans and the 
risks that entities are exposed to through participation 
in them.
The IAS 19 Amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after January 2013 and will apply 
retrospectively. The Group will not be affected as it does 
not sponsors de ned bene t pension plans. Financial Statements

4. Changes in accounting policies continued
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
(Amendments to IAS )
The Amendments to IAS 32 add application guidance to address 
inconsistencies in applying IAS 32 criteria for offsetting nancial 
assets and nancial liabilities in the following two areas:
 the meaning of “currently has legally enforceable right  
of setoff”
 that some gross settlement systems may be considered 
equivalent to net settlement. 
The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after January 2014 and are required to be applied 
retrospectively. Management does not anticipate material 
impact on the Group’s consolidated nancial statements 
from these Amendments.
Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities (Amendments to IFRS )
Qualitative and quantitative disclosures have been added to 
IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” (IFRS 7) relating 
to gross and net amounts of recognised nancial instruments 
that are (a) set off in the statement of nancial position and 
(b) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and 
similar agreements, even if not set off in the statement of 
 nancial position. The Amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and 
interim periods within those annual periods. The required 
disclosures should be provided retrospectively. Management 
does not anticipate a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated nancial statements from these Amendments.
Annual Improvements –  
(the Annual Improvements)
The Annual Improvements 2009–2011 (the Annual 
Improvements) made several minor amendments to number 
of IFRSs. The amendments relevant to the Group are 
summarised below:
Clari cation of the requirements for opening statement of 
 nancial position:
 clari es that the appropriate date for the opening statement 
of nancial position is the beginning of the preceding period 
(related notes are no longer required to be presented)
 addresses comparative requirements for the opening 
statement of nancial position when an entity changes 
accounting policies or makes retrospective restatements 
or reclassi cations, in accordance with IAS 8.
Clari cation of the requirements for comparative information 
provided beyond minimum requirements:
 clari es that additional nancial statement information need 
not be presented in the form of a complete set of nancial 
statements for periods beyond the minimum requirements
 requires that any additional information presented should 
be presented in accordance with IFRS and the entity should 
present comparative information in the related notes for 
that additional information.
Tax effect of distribution to holders of equity instruments:
 addresses perceived inconsistency between IAS 12 
“Income Taxes” (IAS 12) and IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: 
Presentation” (IAS 32) with regards to recognising the 
consequences of income tax relating to distributions to 
holders of an equity instrument and to transaction costs 
of an equity transaction
 clari es that the intention of IAS 32 is to follow the 
requirements in IAS 12 for accounting for income tax 
relating to distributions to holders of an equity instrument 
and to transaction costs of an equity transaction.
Segment information for total assets and liabilities:
 clari es that the total assets and liabilities for a particular 
reportable segment are required to be disclosed if, and only 
if: (i) measure of total assets or of total liabilities (or both) 
is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker; 
(ii) there has been material change from those measures 
disclosed in the last annual nancial statements for that 
reportable segment.
The Annual Improvements noted above are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after January 2013. Management does 
not anticipate material impact on the Group’s consolidated 
 nancial statements from these Amendments.
5. Signi cant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation 
of this consolidated nancial information are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all previous 
years presented, unless otherwise stated.
 . Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identi ed as the Board of 
Directors that makes strategic decisions.
 . Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) 
over which the Group has the power to govern the nancial 
and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding 
of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and 
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable 
or convertible are considered when assessing whether the 
Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to 
the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control 
ceases. The purchase method of accounting is used to account 
for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. Identi able 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the 
extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost 
of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identi able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets 
of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly 
in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains 
or losses on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group. 
(b) Transactions and non-controlling interest
All transactions and balances between Group companies are 
eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and 
losses on transactions between Group companies.

Financial Statements continued
for the period January to December 2012 Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
incadea
Annual Report 2012
/53
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, 
represent the portion of a subsidiary’s pro t or loss and 
net assets that is not held by the Group.
Purchases of additional interest in subsidiary undertakings where 
the Group already has control, are treated as transactions with 
owners and result neither in pro ts or losses in the income 
statement, nor in the recognition of additional goodwill.
(c) Business combinations
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, 
the Group initially recognised any non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s net assets.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 
2010 the Group has the choice, on a transaction by transaction 
basis, to initially recognise any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree which is a present ownership interest and entitles 
its holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets 
in the event of liquidation at either acquisition date fair value 
or, at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share 
in the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identi able 
net assets.
Other components of non-controlling interest such as 
outstanding share options are generally measured at fair 
value. The Group has not elected to take the option to use 
fair value in acquisitions completed to date.
(d) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has signi cant 
in uence but not control, generally accompanying a 
shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity 
method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The 
Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identi ed 
on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition pro ts 
or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share 
of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in 
reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When 
the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds 
its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured 
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its 
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group. Dilution gains and losses 
arising in investments in associates are recognised in the 
income statement.
(e) Consolidation basis
The consolidated nancial information comprises the nancial 
information of the parent and subsidiaries of the Group. Par. 
7.3 presents all companies included in the consolidation with 
the percentage of participation of the Group, the country of 
incorporation, the consolidation method and the activity for 
each company.
(f) Merger accounting
The accounting treatment in relation to the addition of incadea 
plc as a new UK holding Company of the Group falls outside 
the scope of the IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. The Share 
Scheme arrangement constituted a combination of entities 
under common control as de ned by IFRS 3. The relative 
rights of the original shareholders remain unaltered post 
transaction. 
Paragraph 10 of IAS8 Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors requires management to 
use its judgement in developing and applying a policy that 
is relevant, reliable, represents faithfully the transaction, 
re ects the economic substance of the transaction, is neutral, 
is prudent, and is complete in all material respects when 
selecting the appropriate methodology for consolidation 
accounting. Taking this into consideration, Management look 
to the most appropriate standard which is under UK GAAP. 
Paragraph 13 of the Financial Reporting Standard 6 (“FRS”) 
Acquisitions and Mergers (UK) permits merger accounting 
as a result of a Group reconstruction when an addition of 
a new parent Company does not alter the relative rights 
of the shareholders and is facilitated entirely by a share 
for share exchange. 
Management believes that it has met the criteria as de ned by 
paragraph 13 of FRS6 and has treated the insertion of incadea 
plc as the ultimate parent entity as a Group reconstruction and 
have applied the FRS6 merger accounting principles to prepare 
the consolidated nancial statements and treated the 
reconstructed Group as if it had always been in existence.
incadea plc is incorporated in Jersey and therefore falls under 
the Jersey Corporations act. Unlike the UK Companies Act 
2006 the Jersey Corporations Act does not require a company 
balance sheet to be present in the Annual Report. There is also 
no requirement under the AIM listing rules to present a 
company balance sheet. 
In applying merger accounting the Group does not need to 
incorporate into its nancial statements the fair value of the 
subsidiary’s assets and liabilities. No goodwill arises on the 
merger and the Group incorporates incadea GmbH assets 
and liabilities at the amounts at which they were recorded in 
the books pre combination. The results and cash ows of the 
combining entities will be brought into the combined entity’s 
consolidated nancial statements from the beginning of the 
 nancial year – i.e. 1 January 2012. Consolidation effectively 
occurs as if incadea GmbH has always been part of the new 
group. In terms of the comparatives there will be no change 
as incadea plc did not exist pre 1 January 2012.
The Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) comparative for 2011 has been 
adjusted for the share exchange agreement completed on 16 
May 2012, whereby, the entire share capital of incadea Holding 
was exchanged for 32 million Ordinary shares. Financial Statements

5. Signi cant accounting policies continued
(g) Goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, 
or group of CGUs, that is expected to bene t from synergies 
of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the 
entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually 
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill 
is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher 
of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and 
is not subsequently reversed.
 . Currency translation
(a) Functional and reporting currency
Items included in the nancial information of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(“the functional currency”). The consolidated nancial 
information is presented in Euros, which is the Company’s 
functional and the Group’s reporting currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
income statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the 
income statement within “Finance income/(expenses)”.
(c) Consolidation
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are 
translated into Euros at rates approximating to those ruling 
when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities 
of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate 
ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising 
on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and 
the results of overseas operations at actual rate are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the foreign exchange reserve.
 . Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Where parts of an item 
of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, 
they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment. The depreciation 
policies for each class of asset are as follows:
Transport equipment 20%
Furniture and office equipment 10%–33%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing 
the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
within “Other income/(expenses)” in the income statement.
 . Intangible assets
(a) Trademarks
Separately acquired trademarks are shown at historical cost. 
Trademarks acquired in a business combination are recognised 
at fair value at the acquisition date. The acquired trademark 
“incadea” is linked to the name of the company and does not 
have any constraints in relation to its ownership or usage, 
however as it is related to a technological product which will 
be replaced, the assumption of a nite useful life of 10 years 
has been used. The trademark “incadea” is carried forward at 
cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method over the expected life of 
the trademark.
(b) Development Expenditure
Expenditure associated with developing and maintaining the 
Group’s software products is recognised as incurred. Where, 
however, new product development projects are technically 
feasible, production and sale is intended, a market exists, 
expenditure can be measured reliably, and suf cient resources 
are available to complete such projects, development 
expenditure is capitalised until initial commercialisation of 
the product, and thereafter amortised on a straight-line basis 
over its estimated useful life. Staff costs and speci c third 
party costs involved with the development of the software 
are included within amounts capitalised. Development costs 
previously recognised as an expense are not recognised 
as an asset in a subsequent period.
(c) Software
Software acquired in a business combination is recognised 
at fair value at the acquisition date. Software acquired in 
a business combination has a nite useful life of ve years 
and is carried forward at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method 
over the expected life of the software.
Computer software and licensed to-use technology are 
capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis 
over a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected 
to bene t from them, which is typically three to ve years.
(d) Contractual and non-contractual customer relationship
Customer relationships (contractual and non contractual) 
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair 
value at the acquisition date. Customer relationships have a 
 nite useful life, of 10 years, and are carried forward at cost 
less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method over the expected life of the 
customer relationships.

 . Impairment of non nancial assets
Assets that have an inde nite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. Non- nancial assets that suffered 
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the 
impairment at each reporting date.
 . Financial assets
At each balance sheet date included in the nancial 
statements, the Group held only items classi ed as loans 
and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative nancial assets 
with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. They are included in current assets, except 
for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date. These are classi ed as non-current assets. Loans and 
receivables are classi ed as “trade and other receivables” 
in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairments. A provision 
for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. Signi cant nancial dif culties of the debtor, 
probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or nancial 
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments 
(more than 90 days overdue) are considered indicators that 
the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision 
is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of the estimated future cash ows, discounted 
at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of 
the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, 
and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income. When a trade receivable is 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account 
for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against other income 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
 . Financial liabilities – trade and other payables
Trade and other payables
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future 
for goods and services received, whether or not billed to the 
Group. Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair 
value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair 
value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings 
are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost 
and redemption value being recognised in pro t or loss over 
the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
 . Financing costs
Financing costs are calculated using the effective interest 
method and include interest, amortisation of discounts or 
premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of ancillary 
costs incurred in connection with arrangement of borrowings 
and foreign exchange differences arising from foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an 
adjustment to interest costs.
Financing costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate 
to qualifying assets. Qualifying assets are assets which take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or 
sale. Where funds are borrowed speci cally for the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset, the amount of 
borrowing costs capitalised is the amount incurred in relation to 
that borrowing, net of any interest earned on those borrowings.
Where funds are borrowed generally, borrowing costs are 
capitalised using a weighted average capitalisation rate.
 . Offsetting nancial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the statement of nancial position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
 . Inventories and work in progress
Inventories are stated at the lower of their purchase or 
production cost and their corresponding net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is the estimated resale value of the 
inventories, reduced by the cost of disposal. The cost of 
inventories is quanti ed on the basis of the weighted average 
method and is inclusive of the costs associated with their 
acquisition or production (in the case of internally produced 
goods) and the costs incurred in bringing them to their 
present location and condition.
Expenses related to client projects which have been won 
but not yet contracted are classi ed as work in progress 
and included in inventories.
 . Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits 
held with banks and short-term highly liquid investments. 
For the purpose of the statements of cash ows, cash and 
cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand, deposits held 
with banks and short-term highly liquid investments.
 . Share capital
Ordinary shares are classi ed as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity 
share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net 
of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to 
the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled 
or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, 
any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax 
effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders. Financial Statements

5. Signi cant accounting policies continued
 . Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services 
that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers. Accounts payable are classi ed as current 
liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the 
normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, 
they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
 . Ta ation
Tax is calculated on the pro t for the year (adjusted for 
appropriate reliefs, allowances, non-deductible expenses and 
timing differences) at the expected prevailing rate. Deferred 
tax is recognised (at the current rates of taxation) in respect 
of all material temporary differences in the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen 
but have not reversed by the balance sheet date. Recoverable 
deferred tax is recognised as an asset (at the expected future 
tax rate) only to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
pro ts will be available to utilise it. It is reviewed annually.
 . Employee bene ts
There is a bonus plan in place, which depends mainly on 
achievement of Company targets. This bonus plan is agreed 
in accordance with the workers’ council. Targets are de ned 
year by year in advance. Bonuses are accrued per month 
based on the company’s and individual employee targets.
 . Earnings/(losses) per share
Basic earnings/(losses) per share are computed by dividing 
net pro t or loss attributable to equity holders of the parent by 
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
during each year, excluding the average number of common 
shares purchased by the Group as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings/(losses) per share are calculated by dividing 
the net pro t or loss attributable to equity holders of the 
parent (after deducting interest on convertible shares, net of 
tax), by the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
during the year (adjusted for the effect of dilutive convertible 
shares).
The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
during the period and for all periods presented shall be adjusted 
for events that have changed the number of ordinary shares 
outstanding without a corresponding change in resources.
 . Revenue recognition
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the signi cant 
risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred 
to the buyer. The Group follows the principles of IAS 18, 
“Revenue Recognition”, in determining appropriate revenue 
recognition policies. Revenue is recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that the economic bene ts associated with the 
transaction will ow into the Group.
Revenue comprises the value of software licence sales, 
maintenance sales, professional services (including 
installation), support services and distribution agreements. 
Revenue is recognised when; (i) persuasive evidence of an 
arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have 
been rendered; (iii) the sales price has been xed and 
determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue from standard licence products which are not 
modi ed to meet the speci c requirements of each customer 
is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
product are transferred to the customer.
Revenue from maintenance sales is invoiced quarterly 
or yearly in advance and is recognised on a monthly basis.
Revenue from rendering of services is based on the stage 
of completion determined using the percentage of completion 
method where revenue is matched with the costs incurred in 
reaching the stage of completion. The stage of completion is 
determined by comparing the proportion that costs incurred 
for work performed to date bear to the budgeted total cost of 
the services to be performed. The Group recognises revenue 
when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it 
is probable that future economic bene ts will ow to the entity. 
Amounts recoverable on such long-term contracts are included 
in other current assets.
Software and distribution agreements with third parties 
are recognised in accordance with the underlying contractual 
agreements. Where separate services are delivered, revenue 
is recognised on delivery of the service.
The excess of amounts invoiced and future invoicing over 
revenue recognised is included in deferred income. If the 
amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts invoiced, 
the excess amount is included within accounts receivable.
 . Operating leases
Leases in which a signi cant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classi ed as 
operating leases. The costs of operating leases are charged on 
a straight-line basis over the duration of the leases in arriving 
at operating pro t.
 . Dividend distribution
Dividends are recorded in the accounts of the year in which 
they are approved by the shareholders. 
 . Government grants
Government grants are considered after payment from the 
government, as soon as the Group ful ls all the necessary 
requirements to obtain such a grant.
 . Share based options
The Group operates equity-settled share-based remuneration 
plans for its employees. None of the Group’s plans feature any 
options for a cash settlement. 
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of 
any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, 
the fair value of employees’ services is determined indirectly by 
reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 
This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the 
impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example 
pro tability and sales growth targets and performance 
conditions). All share-based remuneration is ultimately 
recognised as an expense in pro t or loss with a corresponding 
credit to retained earnings. If vesting periods or other vesting

Financial Statements
incadea

/57
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting 
period, based on the best available estimate of the number of 
share options expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions 
are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are 
subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number 
of share options expected to vest differs from previous 
estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any 
expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting. Upon 
exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs up to the nominal value 
of the shares issued are allocated to share capital with any 
excess being recorded as share premium.
 . Provisions contingent assets and  
contingent liabilities
Provisions for product warranties, legal disputes, onerous 
contracts or other claims are recognised when the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an out ow of economic resources will 
be required from the Group and amounts can be estimated 
reliably. Timing or amount of the out ow may still be uncertain.
Restructuring provisions are recognised only if a detailed 
formal plan for the restructuring has been developed and 
implemented, or management has at least announced the 
plan’s main features to those affected by it. Provisions are 
not recognised for future operating losses. Provisions are 
measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle 
the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence 
available at the reporting date, including the risks and 
uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Where 
there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that 
an out ow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. Provisions 
are discounted to their present values, where the time 
value of money is material.
Any reimbursement that the Group can be virtually certain 
to collect from a third party with respect to the obligation 
is recognised as a separate asset. However, this asset may 
not exceed the amount of the related provision.
In those cases where the possible out ow of economic 
resources as a result of present obligations is considered 
improbable or remote, no liability is recognised.
6. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
When preparing the nancial statements, management 
undertakes a number of judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about recognition and measurement of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses. The actual results may differ 
from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by 
management, and will seldom equal the estimated results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the 
future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by de nition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a signi cant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next nancial year are discussed below.
Signi cant management udgements
(a) Intangible assets 
On acquisition of a business the Group is required to value 
the assets acquired and recognise possible intangible assets 
on the balance sheet. The valuation of these assets relies 
on various assumptions, including future revenues and costs 
derived from those assets and the selections of an appropriate 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of their 
expected cash ows. Further information is given in par. 10.
(b) Taxation
The Group recognises taxation assets and liabilities based 
upon estimates and assessments of many factors including 
past experience, advice received on the relevant taxation 
legislation and judgements about the outcome of future 
events. To the extent that the nal outcome of these matters 
is different from the amounts recorded, such differences 
will impact on the taxation charge made in the consolidated 
income statement in the period in which such determination 
is made.
(c) Provision impairment for doubtful receivables
The Group performs allowance for doubtful receivables 
regarding speci c customers for which certain evidence are 
shown that the collection of the relevant receivable is doubtful. 
Group’s management periodically reassess the adequacy 
of the allowance for doubtful receivables in conjunction with 
its credit policy, taking into account reports from its legal 
department, following the processing of historical data and 
recent developments of the cases they are assigned to.
(d) Capitalisation of development expenditure
The Group capitalises development costs provided the 
conditions have been met. Consequently, the Directors are 
required to continually assess the commercial potential of 
the product in development and its useful life following launch. 
Impairment of the capitalised development cost depends of the 
sales potential, market readiness and delivery in time of the 
new software products. Details of impairment tests are given 
in Note 16. Any signi cant alteration of the parameters used 
in the impairment tests could also affect them.
(e) Contingent liabilities
The Group is involved in disputes and legal cases. The Group 
reviews the status of every major case on a periodic basis and 
assesses the potential risk, based partly on the opinion of the 
legal services. If the potential damage from any litigation 
and legal matter is probable and the amount can be reliably 
estimated, the Group recognises a liability for estimated 
losses. In order to determine the probability of risk and make 
a reliable estimate, a considerable degree of management’s 
judgement is required. Further information is given in par. 34. Financial Statements

6. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Estimation uncertainty
(a) Impairment 
In assessing impairment, management estimates the 
recoverable amount of each asset or cash-generating unit 
based on expected future cash ows and uses an interest 
rate to discount them. Estimation uncertainty relates to 
assumptions about future operating results and the 
determination of a suitable discount rate.
(b) Useful lives of depreciable assets 
Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of 
depreciable assets at each reporting date, based on the 
expected utility of the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates 
relate to technical obsolescence that may change the utility 
of certain software and IT equipment. 
(c) Inventories 
Management estimates the net realisable values of inventories, 
taking into account the most reliable evidence available at 
each reporting date. The future realisation of these inventories 
may be affected by future technology or other market-driven 
changes that may reduce future selling prices. 
(d) Business combinations 
Management uses valuation techniques in determining the 
fair values of the various elements of a business combination. 
Particularly, the fair value of deferred consideration is dependent 
on the outcome of many variables that affect future pro tability. 
(e) Estimation of contract income
Estimated income receivable on contracts is judged by 
management through the application of their experience 
and knowledge of the industry in which the Group operates. 
Income for each individual contract is determined according 
to the stage of completion determined by reference to the 
cost of services performed to date as a percentage of the total 
cost of services to be performed. Management consider that 
the cost of services performed under each contract at any 
stage of completion when compared to total budgeted cost 
is an accurate measure of the work performed under those 
contracts. Total budgeted costs are continually reviewed 
throughout the contract for accuracy and costs incurred 
are closely monitored against budget.
7. Acquisition, disposals and consolidation basis
 . Acquisition of incadea China
In July 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the equity 
instruments of incadea (Beijing) ITC Ltd, thereby obtaining 
control. The acquisition was made to enhance the Group’s 
position in the Asia Paci c region following the expanding 
demand in this area.
The book acquisition values, the total price of the acquisition 
and the resulting provisional goodwill for the Group at 1 July 
2012, the effective date of the acquisition of the Company 
incadea (Beijing) Information Technology Co. Ltd, are

Establishment of incadea Beijing and asset deal with Uni 
Marketing Information Technology Co. Ltd
On 30 November 2011 incadea GmbH agreed to acquire 
100% of the share capital of incadea (Beijing) Information 
Technology Co. Ltd for a consideration of RMB 110k (€13.4k). 
The acquisition was deemed to complete on the transfer of 
RMB 3 million (€365k) to increase the Company’s issued share 
capital (on the acquiring date, the acquirer settled in cash 20% 
of this increase in Share Capital and the remaining 80% has 
the option to settle in cash within the next two years from the 
acquiring date) and the subsequent issue of a new business 
licence. This was nalised on 1 July 2012 and control for IFRS 
3 purposes was deemed to pass on this day.
On 31 July 2012 incadea (Beijing) Information Technology Co. 
Ltd completed an acquisition of the assets of Uni Marketing 
Information Technology Company Ltd for a consideration of 
3 million RMB (€365k). This has been deemed to be a separate 
asset purchase by management as the assets acquired do not 
meet the de nition of a business under IFRS 3. Please refer 
to par. 10.
The Group has recognised provisional goodwill of RMB 5.7 
million (€696k) representing the fair value of the consideration 
paid (RMB 110k) over the company’s net liabilities. The 
goodwill is deemed provisional and no fair value adjustments 
have been identi ed as at 31 December 2012. Management 
has accounted for this under the provisional accounting rules 
of IFRS 3 and the acquisition accounting will be completed 
in the next nancial period.

Identi able net assets
The fair value of the trade and other receivables acquired as 
part of the business combination amounted to €106k. As of the 
acquisition date, the Group’s best estimate of the contractual 
cash ow is expected to be of the same value. 
Goodwill
Provisional goodwill of €696k is primarily related to the sales 
force, the sales know-how of key personnel and the prospects 
that opened in new markets, along with the contracts that 
already the Company has won.
The determination of the fair value of the assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of each of the acquired companies, 
as well as the allocation of the takeover value was based on the 
provisions of IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” and the resulting 
 nal determination of the goodwill will be accomplished in a 
posterior period, because the Group has followed the provisions 
of the Standard regarding the nalisation of the above 
mentioned gures within 12 months from the acquisition.
Contribution to the Group results
incadea (Beijing) Information Technology Co. Ltd contributed 
about €1 million for the six months that included in the 
Group results.
If incadea (Beijing) Information Technology Co. Ltd had been 
acquired on 1 January 2012, pro t for the year would have 
been decreased by €236k.
 . Acquisition of incadea Portugal
In July 2012, incadea GmbH (Austria) acquired the remaining 
52% of the shares of IS Dynamics LDA for a price of €0.26 million. 
Until 30 June 2012, IS Dynamics LDA was consolidating in the 
Group with the equity method as the Group did not have control. 
Following the acquisition of the remaining 52% IS Dynamics LDA 
is consolidated using a full consolidation method as the Group had 
gained control and renamed to incadea Portugal LDA.
The book and fair acquisition values, the total price of the 
acquisition and the resulting goodwill for the Group at 1 July 
2012, the effective date of the acquisition of the company 
incadea Portugal, are as follows:
Recognised amounts of identifiable net assets
Property, plant and equipment  12

As prescribed from IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” in a 
business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer shall 
remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree 
at its acquisition-date fair value and recognise the resulting 
gain or loss.
According to that, management revalue the investment 
and conclude to a fair value of the investment about €481k. 
Following that the goodwill that arose from the transaction 
calculated to €432k and within the year nalised to an 
amount of €231k, after recognising and amortising speci c 
intangible assets.
Consideration transferred
The acquisition of incadea Portugal was settled in cash 
amounting to €274k (of this amount €24k settled from incadea 
Holding for acquiring the 48% of the equity instruments of IS 
Dynamics (after renamed to incadea Portugal) and €250k from 
incadea GmbH for acquiring the 52% of the equity instruments 
of incadea Portugal, during the year 2012.
As described above, the transaction revalued and the fair value 
is estimated at about €481k.  Financial Statements

With an effective date of 1 January 2012, incadea GmbH (Austria) took over control of the remaining 24.9% of the shares 
of incadea, Russia for a price of €1.7 million. Repayment of this amount occurred on August 2012. As this was a transaction 
of changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control, related cash ows classi ed as cash 
 ows from nancing activities in accordance with IAS 7.
Following the buyout of the remaining 24.9%, although goodwill would arise from that transaction, in accordance with the 
pronouncements of IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, the resulting goodwill has been treated against the retained earnings.

8. Segment reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, the Group 
has identi ed its reportable segment based on the nancial 
reports that internally are provided to the Group’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The chief operating 
decision maker has been identi ed as the Board of Directors. 
The information reported regularly to the CODM presents the 
Group as a single segment supplying licences, maintenance 
and services to customers. The Group’s software products 
share a common sales, development and implementation 
resource. Consequently, the Group has determined that 
there is one operating segment and therefore one reportable 
segment. Segment performance is measured based on 
segment pro t before tax.
Management review the performance of the Group by 
reference to Group-wide pro t measures and the revenues 
derived from three main product groupings:
 licences;
 maintenance; and
 services.
There is no allocation of operating expenses, pro t measures, 
assets and liabilities to individual product groupings. Accordingly 
the disclosures below are provided on an entity-wide basis.

9. Goodwill continued
The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit was 
determined based on value-in-use calculations, covering 
a detailed ve-year forecast, followed by an extrapolation 
of expected cash ows for the remaining useful lives using 
growth rates determined by management. None of the CGUs 1 
to 7 was impaired. The present value of the expected cash 
 ows of each segment is determined by applying a suitable 
discount rate.

 Discount 
rates 
Group incadea 1.3% 9.6%
incadea Russia 1.0% 12.9%
incadea Greece 3.5% 13.3%
Growth rates
The growth rates re ect the long-term average growth rates 
for the product lines and industries of the cash generating 
units (all publicly available).
Discount rates
The discount rates re ect appropriate adjustments relating 
to market risk and speci c risk factors of each segment.
Cash ow assumptions
Management’s key assumptions include stable pro t margins, 
based on past experience in this market. The Group’s 
management believes that this is the best available input for 
forecasting this mature market. Cash ow projections re ect 
stable pro t margins achieved immediately before the budget 
period. No expected ef ciency improvements have been taken 
into account and prices and wages re ect publicly available 
forecasts of in ation for the industry.

19. Equity
 . Share capital
The share capital of the Group consists only of fully paid 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.0125 or £0.01 
(exchange rate at the day of admission and creation of the 
Parent Company €1  £0.8003). All shares are equally eligible 
to receive dividends and the repayment of capital and 
represent one vote at the shareholders’ meeting. 
On 25 May 2012 the incadea Group successfully went through 
the IPO process. As part of this, incadea incorporated a Jersey-
based company, called incadea plc, as a new holding company 
for the Group.
As part of the share arrangement the original shareholders of 
incadea GmbH (“old” holding company) have transferred their 
shares in the new company.

(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
The fair values of options granted were determined using a 
variation of the binomial option pricing model that takes into 
account factors speci c to the share incentive plans, such as 
the vesting period. The performance condition related to the 
LTIP, being a market condition, has been incorporated into 
the measurement by means of actuarial modeling.
The following principal assumptions were used in the valuation:
Current share price 75,000
Exercise price 0,000
Continuous growth rate 1.88%
Dividend yield 0.00%
Volatility 67.00%
Time to maturity (years) 2
The underlying expected volatility was determined by 
reference to historical data of the Company’s shares over a 
period of time since its otation on the London Stock Exchange 
Market (AIM). No special features inherent to the options 
granted were incorporated into measurement of fair value.
Further on the share options issued to Directors and 
employees, on 21 May 2012 the Company constituted the 
Warrant Instrument pursuant to which it issued warrants 
to Cenkos Securities to subscribe at the Placing Price for up 
502,338 ordinary shares (the “Warrants”), which represent 
a number of ordinary shares equal to 1% of the share capital. 
The Warrants are exercisable in whole or in part at any time in 
the ve-year period following the date of admission and include 
provisions to the effect that, inter alia, the number of ordinary 
shares subject to the Warrants and the subscription price 
payable on exercise of the Warrants may be adjusted to re ect 
alterations to the Company’s share capital from time to time.
19. Equity continued
The Group adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) on 21 May 2012, which will be administered under the direction of the 
Board. The LTIP will allow the grant of rights to acquire fully paid ordinary shares to eligible employees, save that no LTIP awards 
can be granted more than 10 years after adoption of the LTIP. Certain Directors have been granted LTIP awards with a vesting 
date of the second anniversary of admission.
In summary, the exercise price of these share options is nil and the split between Directors and employees is as follows:

c) Lawsuits
As of the date of the nancial statements, the Group is on a legal dispute with one of the former shareholders of incadea Russia 
(Karakul Trading Limited) regarding a claimed by the counterparty delay on paying the consideration for the remaining 24.9% 
of the Company. 
The claim consists of a request for an additional value of €259k for the investment of the 24.9% participation, an upcharge 
of €19k for the total claimed delay and the relevant legal costs. Management considers that there is no reasonable base on 
that claim as the consideration of the investment was paid on time and the probability that this claim shall require settlement 
at the Group’s expense to be low. This evaluation is consistent with external independent legal advice.
35. Financial instruments risk and management
Risk management ob ectives and policies
The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to nancial instruments. The Group’s nancial assets and liabilities by category 
are summarised in par. 24. The main types of risks are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s risk management is coordinated at its headquarters, in close cooperation with the Board of Directors, and focuses 
on actively securing the Group’s short to medium-term cash ows by minimising the exposure to nancial markets. Long-term 
 nancial investments are managed to generate lasting returns.
The Group does not actively engage in the trading of nancial assets for speculative purposes nor does it write options. The most 
signi cant nancial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.
 . Market risk analysis
The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of nancial instruments and speci cally to currency risk, interest rate risk 
and certain other price risks, which result from both its operating and investing activities.
Price risk
The pricing policy, because of the specialised eld, both at Company and Group level will not change.
Foreign currency sensitivity (Exchange Rate Risk)
Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Under IFRS, foreign 
currency exchange rate risks arise on account of monetary nancial instruments denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency where the non-functional currency is the respective risk variable; translation risks are not taken into consideration. Financial Statements

35. Financial instruments risk and management continued
As a globally active enterprise, we are subject to risks associated with uctuations in foreign currencies with regard to 
our ordinary operations. Since the Group’s entities mainly conduct their operating business in their own functional currencies, 
our risk of exchange rate uctuations from ongoing ordinary operations is not considered signi cant. However, occasionally 
we generate foreign-currency-denominated receivables, payables, and other monetary items by transacting in a currency 
other than the functional currency.
Most of the Group’s transactions are carried out in Euros. Nevertheless, exposures to currency exchange rates arise 
from the Group’s overseas revenues and expenses, which are primarily denominated in Roubles (Russian currency), 
Yuan (Chinese currency) and Pound Sterling (GBP).
Generally, the Group’s risk management procedures distinguish short-term foreign currency cash ows (due within six months) 
from longer-term cash ows (due after six months). Where the amounts to be paid and received in a speci c currency are 
expected to largely offset one another, no further hedging activity is undertaken.
The Group does not enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency risk on the Group’s 
foreign currency transactions.
Foreign currency denominated nancial assets and liabilities which expose the Group to currency risk are disclosed below. 
The amounts shown are those reported to key management translated into Euros at the closing rate:

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of pro t and equity in regards to the Group’s nancial assets and nancial liabilities 
and the exchange rate GBP/EUR, RUB/EUR and RMB/EUR exchange rate “all other things being equal”. It assumes a +/-5% 
change of the exchange rates for the year ended at 31 December 2012. 
Percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months. 
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Group’s foreign currency nancial instruments held at each reporting date.
If the EUR had strengthened against the other currencies respectively then this would have had the following impact:

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risks result from changes in market interest rates, which can cause changes in the fair values of xed-rate 
instruments and in the interest to be paid or received for variable rate instruments.
At 31 December 2012, the Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates through bank borrowings at variable interest rates.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of pro t and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of +/-1% 
(2011: +/-1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. 
The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period, and the nancial instruments 
held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held constant. Financial Statements

 . Credit risk analysis
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge an obligation to the Group. The Group is exposed to this risk for various nancial 
instruments, for example by granting loans and receivables to customers, placing deposits, investment in bonds etc. The Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of nancial assets recognised at 31 December, as summarised below:
(€000s) 31.12.2012  31.12.2011 
Cash and cash equivalents 2,263 1,287
Trade and other receivables 8,931 6,989
The Group continuously monitors defaults of customers and other counterparties, identi ed either individually or by group, and 
incorporate this information into its credit risk controls. Where available at reasonable cost, external credit ratings and/or reports 
on customers and other counterparties are obtained and used. The Group’s policy is to deal only with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group’s management considers that all of the above nancial assets that are not impaired or past due for each of the 
31 December reporting dates under review are of good credit quality.
In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group is not exposed to any signi cant credit risk exposure to any single 
counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. Trade receivables consist of a large number 
of customers in various industries and geographical areas. Based on historical information about customer default rates 
management consider the credit quality of trade receivables that are not past due or impaired to be good. The credit risk 
for cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks 
with high quality external credit ratings.
 . Liquidity risk analysis
Liquidity risk is that the Group might be unable to meet its obligations. The Group manages its liquidity needs by monitoring 
scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term nancial liabilities as well as forecast cash in ows and out ows due in day-to-
day business. The data used for analysing these cash ows is consistent with that used in the contractual maturity analysis below. 
Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, as well as on the basis of a rolling 
30-day projection. Long-term liquidity needs for a 180-day and a 360-day lookout period are identi ed monthly. Net cash 
requirements are compared to available borrowing facilities in order to determine headroom or any shortfalls. This analysis 
shows that available borrowing facilities are expected to be suf cient over the lookout period.
The Group’s objective is to maintain cash and marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements for 30-day periods 
at a minimum. This objective was met for the reporting periods. Funding for long-term liquidity needs is additionally secured 
by an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Group considers expected cash ows from nancial assets in assessing and managing liquidity risk, in particular its cash 
resources and trade receivables. The Group’s existing cash resources and trade receivables signi cantly exceed the current cash 
out ow requirements. Cash ows from trade and other receivables are all contractually due within various periods, depending 
on the partner/end customer agreement.

36. Capital management policies and procedures
The Group’ s capital management objectives are:
 to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
 to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group’s goal in capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating with its banks and suppliers in order 
to support the expansion of the business and maximise shareholder value. The Group manages its capital structure according to 
economic conditions and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to those conditions. Furthermore the Group is continuously 
reviewing its working and investment capital needs in order to secure cash ows and nancing facilities to support them. The 
Group is using equity to nance its product development and infrastructure needs. In situations where new capital requirements 
are imposed by new projects that the Group is aiming to engage, careful planning is undertaken to ensure optimum spending 
within the project’s resources and within existing and/or new nancing facilities.
Management assesses the Group’s capital requirements in order to maintain an ef cient overall nancing structure while avoiding 
excessive leverage. This takes into account the subordination levels of the Group’s various classes of debt. The Group manages 
the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of 
the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid 
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The amounts managed as capital by the Group for the reporting periods under review are summarised as follows:
31.12.2012  31.12.2011 
Trade and other receivables 8,931  6,989

38. Signi cant accounting issues on the current period
During the current period the subsidiary of Group incadea New Zealand restate the Standalone Financial Statements of 2011 
(reporting period 01.01 – 31.12.2011) in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
in order to fully aligned with Group Reporting guidelines and policies. 
incadea New Zealand (former Avanti Solutions Ltd) was incorporated into incadea Group following 1 September 2011. 
The previous accounting treatment of maintenance revenue and costs from the local company was to recognise the revenue and 
expenses as they were recorded/booked. This lead to overstating 2011 maintenance revenue and costs gures and in parallel 
understating by an equal amount both positions in 2012.
Group management decided to amend this by adjusting FY 2011 nancial statements by deferring revenue and costs for the 
consequent scal year (2012).
The estimated net impact of this decision in New Zealand results (as presented in retained earnings) is approximately NZ 140k 
(effect from defer the revenue portion and effect from costs received for Maintenance).

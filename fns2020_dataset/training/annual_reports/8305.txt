Chairman’s Statement
This has been a rewarding 12 months for International Medical
Devices (“IMD”) and in this period your Company has successfully
concluded three acquisitions, establishing a growing and profitable
medical devices trading house. 
The Company’s continued focus has been to acquire high quality
product portfolio’s of established brands with proven management,
and companies with track records of sales growth, solid margins and
profits. 
The three companies acquired — Meddis, Response Medical and
EMS Medical — operate in different market sectors therefore enabling
IMD to establish a focused divisional structure which will allow the
targeting of non-discretionary spend on medical devices by the NHS
and the private sector.
During the year ahead IMD will focus on four specific sectors:
— Cardiorespiratory
— Medical Consumables
— Aged Care 
— Acute Care
A recent Association of British Healthcare Institute (ABHI) survey of
these four sectors, which account for approximately 50% of the UK
medical devices market, has shown that they are seeing an 8–10%
per annum market growth. This is due to:
● an ageing population
● increasing Department of Health spending
● rising demand for safety medical devices
● an increasing emphasis on medical innovation within the NHS
procurement process, that is driven by the need for new
products, to meet the challenges facing the delivery of higher
quality care

Chairman
Steritalc from Novatech (France)
Meddis — “Caretip” brand of suction
catheters 03 www.imd-plc.com Stock Exchange Code: INT.L
IMD’s ambition is to create a leading and profitable medical devices
distribution business. UK healthcare spending is set to increase by
more than 7% per year up to and including 2008. The NHS budget
for 2005 was a reported £84 billion which is equal to healthcare
expenditure per capita of £1,436. This is bringing the UK closer to
Germany and France in terms of per capita spend, and the
government has stated that the 2007/2008 budget for the NHS will
rise to £105 billion, a doubling of overall healthcare expenditure 
since 1997. 
IMD is well positioned to move forward, by combining innovative
Intellectual Property (‘IP’) that is controlled and owned by the Group,
with our ability to exploit its value in the marketplace by utilising the
distribution network that our acquisition programme has put in place.
Today, IMD owns a portfolio of ‘safe’ needle technology and IP , and
brands in devices including suction catheters (‘Caretip’ brands),
ureteroscopy (‘Peditrol’), plastic tubing (‘Tubicare’), head and neck
products (‘Breeze’) and incontinence care (‘Kylie’ and ‘Kanga’).
In the year ahead we intend to launch our safe needle, ‘Clip-on’, and
a range of beds for the hospital and elderly care markets. We will also
continue our acquisition programme and a detailed, investigative
process is ongoing to identify a number of target companies that
meet our strict screening criteria; these include complementary
product ranges and brands that can deliver synergies and cost
savings, particularly in logistics and administration.
IMD has achieved its first year growth objectives and has created the
opportunities for an even better next 12 months. The Board wishes to
thank all staff and executives for their exceptional effort during the
year and looks forward to providing future success to you as
shareholders. The Board is confident we will succeed.

Chief Executive’s Report
In September 2005 IMD began the construction of a new, UK-based
medical device distribution business. Following the acquisition of
Meddis Ltd (Meddis), in September 2005, IMD successfully
concluded the £6.3 million acquisition of Response Medical Group
(Response) in April. On 1 August the Group added EMS Medical as
its latest acquisition.
Response is a proven, profitable distributor with a strong, professional
management team and I regard it as IMD’s aircraft carrier. The
response busines and management are Pivotal to the Group and IMD
is now looking to develop its future business, through a combination
of acquisition and organic growth.
The IMD business model is based both on acquisitions and the
development of IP and the distribution rights acquired. By pursuing
both routes, there is a balance of risk that will ensure shareholder
value. Our approach to acquisitions is to generate cross sales of
products, cost savings via rationalisation of warehousing operations
and administration functions and, with access to the acquired IP and
distribution rights, to vigorously promote organic growth of the
business.
Chris Thomas
Chief Executive Officer
Acquisition of EMS Medical
The cornerstone of our products in aged care is the continence care
range of established brands in Kylie, Kanga and Martex.
“The IMD business model is based both on
acquisitions and the exploitation of our IP.” 05 www.imd-plc.com Stock Exchange Code: INT.L
Business Strategy
IMD’s business strategy is focused on achieving three key objectives:
1. To establish and grow niche, technically orientated, medical
device distribution capability in the UK across four target market
sectors:
● Cardiorespiratory
● Medical Consumables
● Aged Care 
● Acute Care
2. To establish channels to market for the product portfolio by
acquiring established profitable medical device distribution
companies.
3. To continue to develop and exploit the IP and technology for ‘safe’
needles, with the objective of launching the ‘Clip-on’ product range
across key target markets by the last quarter of 2006.
The challenge faced by the operational management team, led by
John Butler, founder of Response, and Matthew Root are to absorb
the new acquisitions into the four divisional structures with the benefits
of making cost savings in the logistics and administration areas. 
The procedures and logistics established by the Group have allowed
this process of absorption to happen. For example, the Meddis sales
operations have merged, in capacity terms, with the Response team,
whilst accounting functions from both Meddis and EMS Medical have
been moved to the Response head office at Chipping Campden.
For the 2006/7 financial year the Group is now organised into four
divisions as shown overleaf.
Acquisition of Patents and Distribution Rights
Safe needle technology is an important new advance in the medical
devices field and IMD has acquired patents for five product lines:
Kylie Mattress Protector Martex Washable Protection Sheet
Safe needle technology products offer key advantages over traditional
medical products and will provide a competitive edge in the global
marketplace for some time to come.
• ClipOn
• SafeLine
• AutoInjecta
• ReverSyringe
• Retralok 06 International Medical Devices plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Chief Executive’s Report
continued
Acute Care
Suction catheters for respiratory applications and wound drains
represent a market size of around £5 million for each product
segment. IMD offers its own branded range of suction catheter,
‘Caretip’, and in wound drains IMD represents Produkte fur die
Medizin AG (‘Pfm’), one of Germany’s leading independent sales
specialists for medical devices in the fields of pathology/histology,
OP/anaesthesia, infusion therapy and interventional technologies.
Other key products in the acute care portfolio include a range of
ophthalmic scalpels (Feather) and a specialist respiratory product
‘Steritalc’ from Novatech in France for the treatment of chronic
pleurisies and malignant and spontaneous pneumothorax.
Aged Care
The Ypsomed range of ‘Penfine’ diabetic needles are ‘selfcare health
solutions’, whilst the acquisition of EMS Medical provides a focus on
the aged care sector. The range of products and brands sold in the
division include a range of washable continence care protection
(‘Martex’), a foot operated irrigation system for ureteroscopy (‘Peditrol’),
tracheotomy and endotracheal care (‘Breeze’ head and neck), and
continence care products (‘Kylie’ and ‘Kanga’).
IMD intends to exploit the bed products developed by Eastland
Medical Systems Limited in Australia, and intends to launch them by
2007. Representing Salter Labs, IMD distributes an extensive range of
specialist oxygen cannulae, oxygen masks, nebulisers and oxygen
supply tubing and accessories.
Medical Consumables
A key driver in the IMD business is the development within our
product portfolio of a range of medical consumables. These
include complementary disposables sold in parallel with capital
sales like electrodes, cables, BP cuffs, Sp02, defibrillator pads and
paper. We are currently beginning to sell a range of consumables
under our own ‘Response Medical’ brand. Response Medical will
launch the ‘Clip-on’ safe needle product in the fourth quarter of
2006. 
EMS Medical contributes its ‘Tubicare’ range of disposables
including catheters, eye shields, naso-gastric bile bags, utility clips,
amniotic hooks and medical tubing.
Cardiorespiratory
The bulk of this division comprises sales of defibrillators and ECG
recorders, in particular the Welch Allyn range of Propaq monitors.
Response has recently been awarded exclusive UK rights to A&E
departments and theatre recovery for CPAP , a continuous airway
pressure system from Respironics Inc. Other brands sold include
Medicapteurs, Tyco and Medis.
Our four divisions: 07 www.imd-plc.com Stock Exchange Code: INT.L
Focus
The focus on the four key market sectors outlined above allows IMD
to exploit its portfolio of strong brands that are targeted at areas of
the NHS where procurement practices are non-discretionary. Our
ongoing aim is to continue to offer the NHS a range of quality
products and brands sought by clinicians. Our sales teams cover
every hospital in the UK where they work alongside clinicians to
provide solutions and also to develop supply relationships with PASA
(‘NHS Logistics’). 
In October 2006, NHS Logistics will be outsourced to DHL. This
contract will have an impact on procurement of NHS supplies,
particularly, I believe, where PASA will look for better prices in
commodity items. DHL will subcontract procurement outsourcing to
Novation, a US-based group procurement organisation, in order to
find better value for money contracts and engage more hospitals to
reduce local purchasing contract agreements. This will offer IMD
opportunities to act as a UK-wide ‘sales house’. In September 2006,
NHS logistics launched its ‘Home Delivery Continence Care
Catalogue’ (www.logistics.nhs.uk). EMS Medical, with its wide range
of continence products, occupies a significant part of this catalogue. 
Summary
IMD has spent the last 12 months putting in place the structures to
provide the Company with growth areas for the future. These will be:
1. Further acquisitions
2. Organic growth from acquired and existing products and brands
3. The exploitation of our IP via new product launches and
achieving fast routes to markets
4. Acquisition of new distribution agreements from ‘major’ principals
as our reputation grows
We continue to rely on our business partners both in the UK and
overseas. I hope they see IMD becoming an integral part of their sales
solutions.
Finally I would like to stress that it is individual commitment to a group
effort that makes a team work, a company work, a society work, and
a civilisation work. This is the ethic that I hope IMD will engineer
amongst employees, and which will carry the Company further on its
growth path.

Chief Executive Officer

Financial Review
I am pleased to report that the financial performance of IMD, along
with its underlying subsidiaries, has been very positive. All businesses
acquired are trading well and all have made positive operating profit
contributions in the year to 31 August 2006. There are many
opportunities in the business sectors in which IMD operates for
growth, both organically and through acquisition.
Fund-raising and Acquisitions
During the year to 31 August 2006, IMD successfully raised £3.3
million in equity. These funds have been utilised for the acquisition of
the present IMD subsidiaries, for the development of business
opportunities within the Group, and for working capital.
Consideration for all three companies acquired took the form of cash,
shares, and performance related deferred share payments. The
rationale is to incentivise the vendors to continue building the
business, and in turn profits, and to motivate them for longer term
involvement with, and the success of, the Company. This formula has
successfully been applied to all acquisitions made to date, and it is
the Company’s intention to continue with this approach where
possible. Shares have in all cases to date been issued at a premium
to the market price at the time of the transaction, while deferred share
payments will be made on the basis of the market price of IMD
shares at the time payment becomes due.
Capital reserves include expected future deferred consideration
payable in the form of shares, amounting to £1,350,000, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard 3.
Revenue
The Group achieved revenue of £3.8 million during the year to 
31 August 2006. There are no comparative figures for revenue, as
IMD had no sales in its own right, nor had it made any acquisitions 
of trading companies, in the period to 31 August 2005.
Revenue reflects sales achieved by the companies acquired during
the year, from the date of acquisition, to the year end. Therefore,
approximately eleven months’ trading has been included for Meddis,
five months’ trading for Response, and one month’s trading for EMS
Medical. As a result, revenue is anticipated to be significantly greater
for the year ending 31 August 2007, when revenue will include 12
months’ sales for all three operating companies.
Overseas revenue amounted to £40,000, arising from post-acquisition
sales by EMS Medical for one month to the year end. All other sales
were within the UK. 
Gross profit margins on revenue averaged 36% for the year, and
these levels of margins are set to continue.
Michael Acheson
Finance Director
“All businesses aquired are trading well and all have made positive
operating profit contributions in the year 31 August 2006. ” 09 www.imd-plc.com Stock Exchange Code: INT.L
Operating Profit
IMD incurred an Operating Loss before exceptional items for the year,
amounting to £222,000 (2005: Loss £323,000). This result reflects full
year central overheads for IMD, but part year operating profit
contributions from the operating subsidiaries acquired during the year,
as noted above. All three operating companies, however, produced
positive operating profit contributions following the date of acquisition
to the year end.
In addition, the Group incurred an exceptional cost of £85,000 arising
from the restructuring of one acquisition, resulting in the closure of a
warehouse and administration centre, with the operations being
consolidated into the Chipping Campden location. This closure will
result in direct savings, the benefits of which will be reflected in next
year’s operating profit.
With no corporation tax payable, the resultant loss after tax for the
year amounted to £360,000.
Pro forma Revenue and Operating Profit
Following the acquisition of the three companies during the year
ended 31 August 2006, the pro forma revenue for the Group,
assuming 12 months’ full trading of these companies is estimated 
to be £10.7 million, with an estimated operating profit of £950,000.
These figures are unaudited and do not form part of the financial
statements.
Cash and Net Debt
The Group had cash of £706,000 at the year end (2005: £363,000).
This is before the overdraft of £79,000, short-term loans of £350,000
and long-term loans of £1,300,000. Therefore, net debt amounts to
£1,023,000 (2005: £Nil). The long-term debt was assumed as part of
the Response acquisition and is repayable over a four year term. The
short-term debt also formed part of net assets acquired. Gearing, net
of cash balances, is 6.5% of net assets (2005: Nil%), and is
considered prudent relative to operational cash flow generation. Net
finance cost for the period amounted to £53,000 (2005: net income
£6,000).
Working Capital
Medical devices distribution businesses rely on having inventory
available, in most cases, for immediate delivery. The Group is focusing
on keeping inventory levels to a minimum, yet without adversely
affecting sales. Inventory at 31 August 2006 amounted to
£1,719,000.
Goodwill
IMD has Goodwill on the Balance Sheet amounting to £8,674,000
(2005: £Nil). Goodwill arises directly from the difference between the
consideration paid for the acquisition of companies, and the net
assets acquired. The nature of distribution companies is that net
assets acquired are likely to be small in relation to the Company’s
profitability, as the business by its very nature is not significantly
capital intensive. Goodwill includes expected future deferred
consideration payable in the form of shares, in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standard 3.
International Financial Reporting Standards
IMD has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards, even
though there is currently no requirement to do so. This approach has
been adopted on the basis of good practice. Restatement of 2005
comparatives based on International Financial Reporting Standards
does not result in any changes to the figures previously reported.
Dividends
IMD is not declaring a dividend for the year. Mindful of shareholder
wishes, a progressive dividend policy will be adopted in future, when
the Board of Directors considers it appropriate in relation to the
Group’s financial position. 
Taxation
There is no corporation tax charge for the year. Tax losses, subject to
HM Revenue & Customs agreement, of approximately £600,000 are
available in IMD, which will be available for future offset.
Given the short history of IMD, we are pleased with the financial
performance of the Group, and have every confidence for the future.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements
for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Group and of the income statement of the Group for that
period. In preparing those financial statements the Directors are
required to:
1. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
2. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
3. state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
4. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the IAS regulation. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors’ are responsibility for the maintainence and integrity of

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of 
International Medical Devices plc
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements
on pages 19 to 32 for the year ended 31 August 2006 which
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, Statement of Changes
in Equity, Balance Sheets, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and
the related notes. The financial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company, and the Company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use
in the European Union, and for preparing the parent Company
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and whether, in addition, the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with Article 4
of the IAS regulations. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Directors’ Report is not consistent with the accounts, if the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if the
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions with the Company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, Chief
Executive’s Statement, Financial Review, Directors’ Report, Statement
of Directors’ Responsibilities, Corporate Government Statement, and
the Report of the Remuneration Committee. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information beyond that referred to in this paragraph.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the accounts. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the accounts are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the accounts.
Opinion
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with IFRS’s as adopted for use in the European Union
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
1985, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 August 2006 and of
its loss for the year then ended.
The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985, of Article 4 of the IAS
regulation. The parent Company financial statements give a true and
fair view, in accordance with IFRS’s, as adopted for use in the
European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as
at 31 August 2006 and of its loss for the year then ended.
The parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The information
contained in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial
statements.
As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, the Group in
addition to complying with its legal obligations to comply with IFRS’s,
as adopted for use in the European Union, has also complied with
IFRS’s as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Presentation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and with those parts
of the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS regulations, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial reports have
been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount,
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. A summary of the more important accounting policies, which
have been applied consistently, is set out below:
1.1 Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and enterprises controlled by the Company
(and its subsidiaries) and are made up to 31 August each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of International Medical Devices plc have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’). Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies
used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All significant intercompany transactions and balances between Group enterprises are eliminated on consolidation.
The principal subsidiary undertakings at 31 August 2006 are as follows:
Company Activity % Ownership
Meddis Ltd Medical Distribution 100
Response Medical Equipment Ltd Medical Distribution 100
RME Holdings Ltd Holding Company 100
EMS Medical Ltd Medical Distribution 100
All companies are incorporated and registered in England.
1.3 Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the total invoice value, excluding value added tax, of sales made in the year. Interest income is accrued on a time
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable. Dividend income from investments is recognised when
the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
1.4 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that
date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that
are measured in terms of the historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at the foreign
exchange rates ruling at the dates that fair value was determined. 
1.5 Inventory
Inventory is valued to the lower of cost and net realisable value. 24 International Medical Devices plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
continued 
1. Presentation of Financial Statements continued
1.6 Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents the amount arising on acquisition of
subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of
the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is no longer
amortised but is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy 1.8).
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
1.7 Property, plant and equipment
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation or assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on
the following bases:
Fixtures, Fittings and equipment 20%
Motor Vehicles 25%
Plant and Machinery 10%
Leasehold Property Improvements straight-line over life of lease
The asset’s residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying
amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is great than its estimated recoverable
amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the
income statement.
1.8 Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than deferred tax assets (see accounting policy 1.13), are reviewed at each balance
sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated.
For goodwill, assets have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is
estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to cash-generating units (group of units) and then, to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit (group of units) on a
pro rata basis.
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of the estimated future
cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and the value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the
recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 25 www.imd-plc.com
1. Presentation of Financial Statements continued
1.8 Impairment continued
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount.
An impairment loss is only reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss as been recognised.
1.9 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of
receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
1.10Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
1.11Convertible loan notes
The Group has issued £500,000 convertible loan notes as part consideration for the acquisition of RME Holdings Limited. £250,000
becomes due on 31 March 2007, with a balance due on 31 March 2008. The vendors of RME Holdings Limited have the option to be
paid in cash, or shares based on the share price quoted at that date. £250,000 of the convertible loan notes have been included in
creditors due within one year in the Group and Company’s balance sheets, and £250,000 in the payables due after one year.
1.12 Financial Risk Management
The Group uses a limited number of financial instruments, comprising cash, short-term deposits, bank loans and overdrafts and various
items such as trade receivables and payables, which arise directly from operations. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. 
(i)  Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk,
liquidity risk and cash ﬂow interest rate risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of
financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
(ii) Market risk 
(a)  Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with
respect to the UK pound and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions.
(b)  Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk and has policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers
with an appropriate credit history.
(c)  Liquidity risk 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and available funding through an adequate amount of
committed credit facilities. The Group ensures it has adequate cover through the availability of bank overdraft and loan facilities. 
(d)  Cash flow and interest rate risk 
The Group finances its operations through a mix of cash flow from current operations together with cash on deposit and bank and
other borrowings. Borrowings are generally at floating rates of interest and no use of interest rate swaps has been made.
(e)  Fair value estimation
The nominal values less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. The
fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current
market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
1.13 Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. 26 International Medical Devices plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006

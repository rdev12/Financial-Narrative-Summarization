Chairman’s Statement
The year ended 30 September 2004
finished well. Trading in the final quarter
was particularly strong and the results 
for the year as a whole were satisfactory
after the disappointing first half. I am
pleased to report that the momentum
achieved in the second half of last year
has been maintained into the current year.
Profit before the exceptional item,
amortisation of goodwill and taxation 
for the year was £2,112,000, a marginal
increase on the equivalent figure 
for the previous year of £2,070,000.
Earnings per share, adjusted to exclude
the exceptional item and goodwill
amortisation, were 31.0p (2003: 27.4p).
The exceptional item, which amounted 
to £454,000, fell entirely within the 
first half and arose from one large
voucher promotion, details of which 
are set out below. I consider it important
to note that we met in full the high
performance standards we set for all 
of our promotions: the promotion was
successful for the client, and all of its
customers who sought to redeem their
vouchers in exchange for travel, were
promptly provided with their travel
choices. What is more, the promotion
overall was profitable for Landround,
albeit at a much reduced margin.
Dividend
The cut in the interim dividend was a
proper response to our first half results.
An increase in the final dividend is an
equally proper response to an improved
second-half performance.
The Directors will, therefore, 
be recommending a final dividend 
of 8.0p per share (2003: 7.0p) at the 
Annual General Meeting. This, together
with the interim dividend of 2.5p (2003:
3.5p), gives a maintained total dividend
for the year of 10.5p (2003: 10.5p).
The dividend will be paid on 28 February
2005 to shareholders on the register on 
7 January 2005.
Management and Staff
The executive team and all Landround’s
staff knew that we had much to 
achieve in the second half. They rose 
to the challenge quite magnificently 
and deserve thanks and praise.
Michael Crompton stood down as
Chairman on 1 April 2004. Full tribute
was paid to him at the time but this
Report and Accounts seems the proper
place finally to thank him for all that 
he did for Landround and to wish him
and his family well. 
Tony Short was appointed Commercial
Director of Landround on 1 April 2004.
His appointment completes the executive
management team at Board level for the
time being. He joined Landround in
November 2003 after a successful career
in sales and general management with
Shell UK, Ciba-Geigy and Dow Group. 
Shareholder Travel Privileges
Our package of Shareholder Travel
Privileges continues to be popular 
with our private shareholders and 
the intention is to extend the current
package. Further details will be
announced at our Annual General
Meeting on 23 February 2005.
Outlook for the Current Year
The year to 30 September 2004 finished
on a positive note and, as I said in my
opening comments, the momentum 
has continued into the current year. 
Sales prospects for Buy and Fly! are
encouraging and, for the first time, we
go into a new year with forward sales
on the books. We are also encouraged
by the prospect of extending our
international market. 
We are looking for greater returns 
from our voucher business as well as
from Buy and Fly! and we expect
another positive contribution from 
Travel Offers Limited.
I am confident of Landround’s prospects
and believe that the Group will resume
its pattern of growth.

” Landround plc Report and Accounts 2004     5
Chief Executive’s Statement
The year ended 30 September 2004 
was a year of ups and downs for
Landround but I consider that, in time, 
it will be seen as something 
of a watershed for the Company.
Landround Marketing
Landround Marketing once again had a
record year in terms of sales, finishing
marginally ahead of last year’s figures.
Significantly, for the first time Buy and
Fly! gross sales exceeded those of
Landround’s traditional voucher products
and it is clear that Buy and Fly! will see
a substantially faster growth rate than
the original Landround proposition.
Buy and Fly! has moved from strength to
strength since the announcement in
January 2004 of the signing of our first
major consumer facing contract with
Morgan Stanley.  The Morgan Stanley Buy
and Fly! MasterCard was launched on
schedule at the end of May 2004 and has
so far exceeded all of Morgan Stanley’s
own expectations.  Importantly, the launch
of the card raised consumer awareness of
the product, which has encouraged yet
more clients to sign up to Buy and Fly! 
We were pleased in the second half of
the year to sign Shop Direct Group to
Buy and Fly! on a trial basis, with a
substantial long term arrangement
currently under discussion.  Scottish
Courage has recommitted to Buy and Fly!
with a further extension of its contract
and intends also to use Buy and Fly!
with one of its four key retail brands. 
In the Republic of Ireland progress 
has been made both in the business 
to business and the consumer market
and we expect the launch of a 
major consumer-facing promotion in 
the first quarter of 2005.
Buy and Fly! continues to appeal to 
the business to business market and 
we have already signed a number of
companies to the Passport to Profit
independent retailers scheme whereby
brand manufacturers will use Buy and
Fly! points to incentivise retailers in the
sales of their particular products.  The
scheme will launch early in 2005.
Vouchers continue to make a significant
contribution to the sales and profits of
Landround Marketing, both in the 
United Kingdom and the Republic of
Ireland.  Following some excellent
promotions with clients such as Virgin
Megastores, Timberland and PC World in
the first half, we were pleased to work
on promotions with Hewlett-Packard,
Liverpool Football Club, Holiday Autos
and Samsung (amongst others in the
UK) and Renault, Coca-Cola and Irish
Sugar in the Republic of Ireland during
the second half.  Additionally, we
continue to blaze new trails in the
newspaper field with further promotions
for Associated Newspapers.
New products have been added to the
portfolio throughout the year, as we have
begun working with partners such as
Pontins and RCI, as well as developing
existing voucher themes.
The Buy and Fly! redemptions range 
has broadened with the signing of 
Iberia Airlines, our eighteenth airline
partner, during the course of the year
and the introduction of some leisure
opportunities alongside the pure travel
redemption options previously offered.
Development continues not only 
through our own efforts but also the
input of our Buy and Fly! clients.
Landround Marketing’s high margins and
rapid cash generation resulted in the
disclosure of a moderate debtors’
balance and substantial cash balances in
the Landround Group’s annual accounts.
As we move towards a greater
contribution to sales and profits from 
Buy and Fly!, the shape of the Group’s
balance sheet will change. Debtors will
increase and cash flow will slow in the
short to medium term. This is an entirely
expected consequence of Landround’s
investment in Buy and Fly! Should any
external funding be required for working
capital, we are confident that bank
finance will be readily forthcoming. 
Landround Travel
The exceptional item of £454,000 arose
from one large voucher promotion, which
“
We have become a substantial route to market for our
travel partners who continue to welcome the trade we
give them in what is a highly competitive market.
Travel remains aspirational and thus a highly effective
tool of sales promotion 
” Landround plc
ended on 30 April 2004. In accordance with our usual
accounting policy, the sale by Landround Marketing was booked
in September 2003 when the client was invoiced but the
unexpected costs fell into the first half of the year just ended.
There were unusual features to this promotion, including most
notably a short redemption period. Management made certain
assumptions as to the pattern of redemption, but for a 
number of reasons these were incorrect and significant costs
occurred.  It is important to stress that the promotion was
profitable overall, the client concerned has since placed further
business, and no further promotions with a short redemption
period will be considered.
In addition to the exceptional item, Landround Travel, which in
the past was expected to break even and in some years provided
a small but welcome contribution to Group profits, has made a
modest loss. 
It has become clear to us that the travel market is changing
and our business – travel promotions – must anticipate and
respond to those changes. There are two areas to consider: 
•
the travel industry is ever more competitive and all travel
activity is subjected to an ever increasing degree of pricing
scrutiny; and
•
the travelling public is becoming more sophisticated. For
example, the decline of the package holiday in favour of
bespoke holidays has been well documented. The availability
of low-cost flights, internet booking and a plethora of mini-
breaks have also influenced travellers’ options. 
However, these trends do not in any way diminish the
attraction of travel promotions. We have become a substantial
route to market for our travel partners who continue to
welcome the trade we give them in what is a highly
competitive market.  Travel remains aspirational and thus a
highly effective tool of sales promotion.  
We continue to ensure that our portfolio of promotions remains
attractive and cost-effective to our clients, while also
maintaining a balance between innovation and familiarity, and
we continue to work closely with our travel partners in order to
ensure that our relationships and arrangements with them
serve their needs as well as ours.
However, if we are to continue to provide quality promotions
and a high level of service, there will be an attendant 
increase in our costs and some erosion of margins. We have
provided for the cost of redemption on Buy and Fly! since its
inception. Since 1 April 2004, we have extended this policy,
albeit at a lesser level, for the redemption cost of all other
flight promotions.
We continue to monitor the performance of all our promotions
on a month by month basis, and where necessary will adjust
the redemption methodology and/or provisioning for the
promotions should it become necessary.
We are proud of the levels of customer service which we
provide to our clients and customers, both in the redemption 
of voucher products and the growing Buy and Fly! collectors’
base.  Once again, we have been awarded ABTA’s Gold Award,
which validates these service levels.
Travel Offers Limited
Travel Offers’ turnover and profits were both down on the
previous year but, that said, the company continues to 
make a welcome contribution to the Group’s cashflow and profit.  
We do not expect substantial growth in the business, 
but it remains a valuable part of the Group with a popular
consumer proposition.

Auditors’ Report
We have audited the financial statements on pages 14 to 25.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view and are
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the company is 
not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the 
Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. This other
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, 
the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s
Statement. We consider the implications for our 
report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any other information.
Basis of Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to 
obtain all the information and explanations which 
we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the company and group’s
affairs at 30 September 2004 and of the group’s profit
for the year then ended and have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

recently, it was announced on 5 October 2004 that they
had sold 550,000 shares, which were placed with certain

Share Ownership Plan and a number of institutional
investors. Following this disposal, Michael and Janet
Crompton no longer hold a notifiable interest in the
issued share capital of the Company.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association,
David Owen and Tony Short retire by rotation at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being eligible,
offer themselves for re-election.
The Company maintains insurance in respect of the
Directors and officers against any such liabilities as are
referred to in Section 310 of the Companies Act 1985.
Corporate Governance
The new Combined Code on Corporate Governance,
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003,
will come into force for Landround plc in the year ending
30 September 2005.
Landround plc, an AIM company, is not required to adopt
the new Code. However, the Board is committed to high
standards of Corporate Governance and, following a
review of the new Code, has resolved to comply with 
its provisions where appropriate. 
The Board already complies with many of the provisions
of the new Code and is reviewing those where it does
not, with a view to implementation in the current year
ending 30 September 2005, when the Board will report
against the 2003 Combined Code.
This statement describes how the relevant principles 
of Governance, as set out in the current Combined Code,
are applied to the Group.
The Board
The Board currently comprises the non-executive
Chairman, four executives and two non-executive
directors, of whom John Moxon is the senior. The Board
regards John Moxon as independent. David Owen
although independent of management, cannot be
regarded as fully independent as he provides advisory
services to the Board from time to time, for which
service he is separately rewarded.
The Board met for nine formal Board meetings in the
year. The former Chairman, Michael Crompton, missed
one meeting during his tenure, otherwise all serving
directors attended all Board meetings. Two further Board
meetings were held to approve certain documents.
Physical attendance at these further meetings was not 
demanded but all directors were provided with copies 
of the documents and a quorum was present when 
the documents were approved.
The Board has established Audit and Remuneration
Committees, each of which has its own defined terms 
of reference. Peter Carter chairs the Audit Committee and
David Owen chairs the Remuneration Committee. Both
committees comprise Peter Carter, John Moxon and David
Owen. As the Board is small, the role of a Nomination
Committee is carried out by the Board as a whole. 
The Audit Committee met twice in the year, when 
all members of the Committee were present. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee also attended 
the audit planning meeting.
The Remuneration Committee met on six occasions. 
All members of the Committee were present at the two
meetings where physical attendance was requested. 
The other four meetings were held by conference call.
Landround plc The Board is responsible for the leadership of the
Company and the Group. It delegates day-to-day
responsibility to the executive management. The balance
of the Board is such that no one individual or small
group of individuals has unfettered powers of decision.
The Board is responsible for Group strategy, setting 
and monitoring budgets, acquisition and investment
policy and consideration of any other significant 
financial matters. 
Audit Committee (Chairman Peter Carter)
The Audit Committee meets not less than twice a year.
Its function is to review reporting and accounting
procedures and policies in the Group and the conduct of
the audit. At least once a year the Committee will meet
with the auditors without other board members present.
Such a meeting has taken place in respect of the audit
for the year ended 30 September 2004.
Remuneration Committee (Chairman David Owen)
The Remuneration Committee meets as appropriate to
review and determine policy on the remuneration of the
executive directors and specific remuneration packages, 
in particular, any which may include a performance
related element.
Details of Directors’ remuneration are shown in the
Remuneration Committee Report set out overleaf.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board encourages dialogue with all shareholders.
The Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Finance
Director are available for discussions with shareholders
throughout the year and particularly at the time of
results announcements. The senior non-executive director
is also available at any time. 
The AGM is used to communicate with private
shareholders who are encouraged to attend and to
participate. The AGM is held at the Company’s head
office in Chester and all attending shareholders are
invited on a tour of inspection.
Shareholders can gain access to the Annual Accounts,
Interim Reports, announcements and other information
via the Company’s website: www.landround.com.
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
Although no system can provide absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss, the Group’s
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the safeguarding of assets against
unauthorised use or disposition, the maintenance of
proper accounting records and the reliability of financial
information used within the business or for publication.
The Directors have implemented an ongoing process for
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group. This process is regularly
reviewed by the Directors and is fully compliant with 
the internal control guidance prepared for directors by
the Turnbull Committee.
The Group has an established organisational structure
with clear lines of responsibility, operating procedures
and authority levels. A budget, approved by the Board, 
is set annually and actual performance is monitored
against the budget. Significant variances are examined
and remedial action taken where necessary.
Going Concern
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis for preparing the financial statements.
The Combined Code
With the exception of the point referred to below, 
the Directors believe that Landround plc has complied
with the provisions of the Combined Code in a manner
appropriate to its size and structure. The only area of
non-compliance is that the non-executive Directors were
not appointed for specific terms but they will retire by
rotation and may offer themselves for re-election.

In addition, options granted on 5 October 2000 to three
directors of the operating companies were exercised on 10
December 2003. In each case, the options were in respect
of 46,511 shares at an exercise price of 215p and were
realised at 380p. Subsequent to this on 18 December
2003 these same operating directors were each issued
with a further 26,315 shares at an exercise price of 380p.
Subject to cessation of employment in special
circumstances (for example, death, injury, disability,
redundancy and retirement) or an earlier take-over of the
Company, the options may not be exercised within three
years of the date of grant. The options are also subject to
a performance target equal to a 30% increase in the
earnings per share of the Company over three financial
years commencing with the financial year in which the
options were granted. The performance target is scaled
down if options are exercised within three years of the
date of the grant in the permitted circumstances. Any
options not exercised within ten years of the date of
grant will lapse. In total, options have been granted
(within the last ten years) over 660,641 ordinary shares,
equivalent to 11.54% of the issued share capital.
4. Landround plc Employee Share Ownership Plan
We adopted the ‘Landround plc Employee Share
Ownership Plan’ in January 2001 in order to extend
share ownership to all of Landround’s employees. 
Capita Registrars, the trustees for the scheme, hold
204,154 shares on behalf of the employees. Under the
terms of the trust the shares will be gifted to the
employees absolutely on completion of three years
further service since the date of gifting. The Company is
accepting the costs of the distribution over three years.
The dividends accrue to the employees.
Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
•
select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
•
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
•
state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements; and
•
prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the Group and for taking steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Substantial Shareholdings
As at 4 December 2004 the following substantial
interests (3% or more) in the Company’s ordinary share
capital had been notified to the Company:

Landround Employee Share
Ownership Plan 204,154 3.56%
Supplier Payment Policy
The Company adheres to the payment terms that have
been agreed with a supplier. Where payment terms have
not been specifically agreed, it is the Company’s policy
to settle invoices close to the end of the month
following the month of invoicing. Adherence to these
terms is dependent upon suppliers sending accurate and
adequately detailed invoices to the correct address on a
timely basis. The actual number of days taken to pay
suppliers on average was 21 days (2003: 52 days).
Annual General Meeting
A notice convening the Annual General Meeting to be
held on 23 February 2005 at 2pm at the Company’s
head office, The Quadrant, Sealand Road, Chester,
Cheshire CH1 4QR, is enclosed with this report.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 385 of the Companies Act
1985, a resolution proposing the re-appointment of
Baker Tilly as auditors to the Company will be put 
to the Annual General Meeting.

Accounting Policies for the year ended 30 September 2004
The following accounting policies have been adopted in preparing the Group’s financial statements.
1 Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, as amended, and with
applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention, no allowance having been made for changes 
in the value of money.
2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the Company and all Group undertakings. 
As a consolidated profit and loss account is published, a separate profit and loss account of the parent Company is
omitted from the Group accounts by virtue of the exemption granted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
3 Turnover
Turnover represents the net total of goods sold during the financial year excluding VAT in accord with application 
note G Revenue Recognition, Amendment to FRS 5, issued by the ASB in November 2003.
The effect of this is to recognise revenue when a client commits to purchase, except in the case of significant, long term
contracts, when the revenue is recognised in equal annual instalments over the lifetime of the contract on the
anniversary of signing the contract.
4 Cost of sales 
Cost of sales comprises the actual costs and estimates of producing vouchers, costs of flights and tours incurred and an
accrual for the potential future cost relating to Buy and Fly! points invoiced to clients and yet to be redeemed. 
The accrual for the potential future liabilities for unredeemed Buy and Fly! points has been made on the basis of the
estimated cost of redeeming Buy and Fly! points issued, using a standard costing method making certain assumptions
concerning redemption levels, destination and date of travel. The likely redemption levels are regularly reappraised in 
the light of historic and current trends.
During the year the Buy and Fly! redemption rate was reduced leading to a decrease in the charge to the Profit and Loss
account of £180,000.
5 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation has been provided so as to write off the 
cost of tangible fixed assets less estimated residual value, by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives, 
at the following annual rates: 
Short leasehold land and buildings 5%
Plant and machinery (including computers and software) 10/20/33%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 15%
Cars 25%
6 Leasing 
Rentals on operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in the periods in which they fall due.
7 Stock 
Stock is stated on a first in, first out basis at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Accounting Policies for the year ended 30 September 2004
8 Taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on the liability method on all timing differences which are expected in the
foreseeable future, calculated at the rate at which it is estimated that tax will be payable. 
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
9 Intangible fixed assets and goodwill 
From 1 October 1998, any purchased goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis to the profit and 
loss account, normally over a period of up to 20 years from the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions purchased prior to 1 October 1998 was written-off to reserves in accordance with the
accounting standard then in force. As permitted by FRS10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’, the negative goodwill
previously written off to reserves (£37,000), has not been reinstated in the balance sheet. On disposal or closure of a
previously acquired business, any attributable goodwill will be included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
10 Hire purchase commitments
Assets acquired under hire purchase agreements are capitalised and liabilities are set up for the capital portions of the
instalments. The interest portions of the instalments are charged to the profit & loss accounts in the periods in which
they fall due.
11 Foreign currency
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All differences are
taken to the Profit and Loss account.

16 Financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s activities are financed by cash at bank and short-term investments, which comprise cash placed on deposit.
The Group’s treasury policy has as its principal objective the achievement of the maximum rate of return on cash
balances whilst maintaining an acceptable level of risk. Other than mentioned above there are no financial instruments,
derivatives or commodity contracts used.
Given that there are no borrowings within the Group it is considered that the interest rate risk is not significant.
For the purposes of the following disclosures, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded, as permitted by FRS 13.
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash at bank. At 30 September 2004 the average interest rate earned on the
temporary closing balances was 2%.

20 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share on page 14 have been calculated by reference to the earnings of £1,197,000 divided by
5,672,500 being the average weighted number of ordinary shares in issue throughout the year.
Adjusted earnings per share have also been calculated excluding the goodwill amortisation and exceptional item, 
based upon the same number of shares.
Diluted earnings per share is based upon earnings of £1,197,000 divided by 5,800,665 being the number of shares that
would have been in issue if the outstanding options to exercise shares in the Group had been exercised at the average
share price during the year. Diluted adjusted earnings per share have also been calculated excluding the goodwill
amortisation and exceptional item based upon the same number of shares.
21 Profit earned for ordinary shareholders
The profit and loss account of the Company is omitted from the Group accounts by virtue of the exemption granted by
Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The profit attributable for ordinary shareholders of the parent company and
included in the accounts of the Group amounted to £1,032,009 (2003 £1,461,349).

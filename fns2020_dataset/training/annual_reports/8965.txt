At a Glance
What does K3 do?
K3 is one of the UK’s leading providers of integrated business solutions to 
the supply chain sector. Our customers are Retailers, Manufacturers and 
Distributors who are looking for global, brand leading business solutions 
from a specialist provider who is dedicated to their market sector.
We support 3,128 customers from five regional 
centres in the UK, with our international operations 
headquartered in Holland.
Increasingly our customers are considering Cloud 
Computing, to defray IT costs and to provide a more 
flexible and secure IT infrastructure that will deliver 
them a competitive edge.
We take market leading solutions from Microsoft, 
Sage and SYSPRO and add our own Intellectual 
Property (“IP”) to create industry specific solutions.
By having our own IP , we can tailor these solutions 
to our core markets and our solutions are thus more 
competitive, creating more loyal customers, whilst at 
the same time driving up margins.
We have loyal customers and once installed, our 
software systems can remain in place for 15 years 
or longer. This ensures that K3 generates very high 
levels of recurring income.
K3 has a strong and successful track record of 
growth. We have steadily grown organically and 
through acquisition over the last 10 years and will 
continue with this dual growth strategy.

Our markets
Retail
K3 entered the retail market in 2004 
with a key acquisition. This business 
unit has grown significantly since 
then and now has over £20m of sales 
annually. Our customers tend to be 
well known ‘high street’ retailers 
which select K3 because of our 
sector knowledge, track record and 
innovative solutions. In recent times, 
high street retailers have been under 
pressure but K3 has continued to 
grow thanks to a strategic investment 
in multi-channel retail (including 
internet, store and mail order) in 
2008/9 and, despite the economic 
downturn, K3 continues to win major 
new contracts year on year.
Manufacturing
With over 1,000 manufacturing 
customers, K3 is the largest provider 
of integrated business solutions 
to the manufacturing sector. We 
offer solutions for both ‘discrete’ 
and ‘process’ manufacturers, and 
our customers range from global 
multi-nationals running K3 solutions 
worldwide to small engineering 
companies.
Distribution
Distribution is the most recent 
area of K3’s expansion, with several 
acquisitions creating a dedicated 
business unit of size and scale. Whilst 
there is considerable overlap with our 
retail and manufacturing customers, 
we now have some 700 dedicated 
distribution customers relying on K3 
for their IT services and support.
International
One of the fastest growing 
parts of K3 is our International 
Operations Division based in The 
Hague. From here we support our 
international retail and distribution 
customers, with some major global 
corporate customers such as Inter 
IKEA Systems BV, the owner and 
franchisor of the IKEA concept. Our 
Pebblestone fashion distribution 
solution is managed from here, 
supporting a network of 30 
distributors in 20 countries.
Hosting and 
Managed Services
From data centres in Edinburgh, 
London and New York we support 
a global hosting and managed 
service business that looks after the 
IT infrastructures for K3 customers 
around the globe, both on-premise 
and hosted. Cloud Computing is a 
fast growing sector for industry as 
a whole and this is also one of K3’s 
fastest growing business units.

Chairman’s Statement
“The Group increased revenues to £67.96m  
(2011: £52.80m) and adjusted profit before tax
*1 
rose to £10.02m (2011: £8.68m). Existing 
customers delivered contracted recurring revenue 
of £33.74m (2011: £24.18m), accounting for  
50% of total income and up 40% on last year. ”
Overview
In tough market conditions, the business 
delivered a good performance. For 
the year to 30 June 2012, the Group 
increased revenues to £67.96m (2011: 
£52.80m) and adjusted profit before 
tax
*1
 rose to £10.02m (2011: £8.68m). 
Existing customers delivered contracted 
recurring revenue of £33.74m (2011: 
£24.18m), accounting for 50% of total 
income and up 40% on last year. This 
revenue continues to provide a good 
underpinning to K3’s earnings. A further 
39% of income came from existing 
customers through the sale of additional 
services or products, demonstrating 
the value of the customer base we 
have built over the past several years. 
The five significant acquisitions we 
made in the year also appreciably 
benefited K3’s results, contributing a 
combined £11.82m to revenues and 
£2.18m to adjusted operating profit
*2
. 
Our acquisitions have now all been 
integrated into our operations and are 
performing in line with our expectations. 
They broaden our technical skills and 
add new Intellectual Property (“IP”) as 
well as increase our base of long term 
contracted customers. 
Given market conditions, the level of major 
contract wins which the Group secured 
over the year was encouraging although 
deal slippage continued to be a feature 
of the trading environment. We closed a 
total of £13.3m of major contracts during 
the year (2011: £11.10m), the full benefits 
of which are still to come. Notable new 
customer deals included Easons, Oxfam, 
Phoenix, Grafton, Scotiabank (Canada)  
and Wynsors.
Across the Group, the performance of 
our four trading Divisions, Microsoft UK, 
SYSPRO and Sage, International and 
Managed Services, has been varied. 
Revenue contribution from all four 
Divisions is up but difficult conditions in 
the UK combined with our investment 
programme in our Microsoft AX product 
suite impacted the adjusted profit 
contribution from our Microsoft UK 
Division. Against this, the performance 
of the International Division was 
especially strong, helped by increased 
activity with Inter IKEA Systems BV 
(the owner and franchisor of the IKEA 
concept and the largest customer in the 
Group). The SYSPRO and Sage Division 
performed robustly and continued 
to generate high levels of recurring 
income. Managed Services’ performance 
has continued to improve with 
encouraging new business wins in the 
final quarter. Managed Services Division 
is still at an early stage of development 
but has significant growth potential. In 
the first half of the year, we invested in 
enhancing the Division’s platform and 
delivery capability and consequently 
slowed our intake of hosting business. 
However, with this phase of the 
investment now completed, the 
level of new deployments in the 
final quarter has been encouraging, 
including Scotiabank, a major new 
SYSPRO contract in Canada and the first 
agreement to result from our global 
collaboration with SYSPRO.
The Group’s profitability continues to 
benefit from our strategy of developing 
our own library of IP and this year we 
invested £1.91m in IP development. By 
enhancing the core business software 
products (Microsoft, SYSPRO and Sage) 
we offer with our own IP , we enrich and 
tailor these solutions to the specific 
markets we serve. This improves both 
our competitive positioning and our 
operating profit.
On 1 March 2012, following the  
approach from K3’s largest shareholder,  
Mr PJ Claesson, regarding a possible  
offer for the Company, we announced  
that the Company had received a 
number of indicative proposals and had 
commenced a formal sale process. On  
31 July, we confirmed that discussions 
with interested parties were ongoing, 
however, in a separate statement issued 
today, we have announced that the formal 
sale process has now come to an end. This 
is because the Board does not believe 
the proposals received are at a level that 
would be acceptable to shareholders 
and the proposals are therefore not 
recommendable by the Board. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Financial Results
Revenues over the year ended 30 June 
2012 rose by 29% to £67.96m (2011: 
£52.80m), with the five significant 
acquisitions completed in the year 
contributing combined sales of £11.82m. 
(The acquisitions were Azurri Retail  
(July 2011), Fifth Dimension Systems 
(July 2011), Unisoft (December 2011), 
Retail Systems Group (December 2011) 
and IBS (December 2011)). Adjusted 
profit from operations
*3
 over the year 
rose by 18% to £11.33m (2011: £9.58m) 
with acquisitions contributing £2.18m
*2
. 
After taking into account amortisation 
of intangibles, acquisition costs and 
exceptional reorganisation costs and 
exceptional income, the profit from 
operations for the year increased by 26% 
to £7.35m (2011: £5.81m). Amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets was £3.59m 
(2011: £2.83m). Acquisition costs were 
£0.59m (2011: £0.49m), exceptional 
reorganisation costs were £0.56m  
(2011: £0.45m) and exceptional income, 
relating to the sale of IP , was £0.76m 
(2011: £nil). The final six months of the 
financial year saw revenues up 23% 
to £34.61m (2011 H2: £28.13m) and 
adjusted operating profit
*4
 up 32% to 
£4.42m (2011 H2: £3.34m). 
Adjusted profit before tax

 for the 
year ended 30 June 2012 increased by 
15% to £10.02m (2011: £8.68m). After 
taking into account amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, acquisition costs 
and exceptional items listed above, 
profit before taxation rose by 23% over 
the year to £6.04m (2011: £4.91m). 
This is after the finance expense of 
£1.32m (2011: £0.94m) which included 
exchange differences of £0.26m (2011: 
£nil) and discount interest on deferred 
consideration for acquisitions of £0.09m 
(2011: £0.03m).

The tax charge for the year ended  
30 June 2012 was £0.32m (2011: 
£0.43m). The lower charge for 2012 
against 2011 reflected the credits arising 
from finalisation of tax returns in respect 
of prior years and the impact of the 
reduction of the underlying UK tax rate 
on deferred tax.
Adjusted earnings per share
*5
 increased 
by 10% over the year to 30.2p (2011: 
27.5p) and basic earnings per share 
increased by 16% to 20.3p over the year 
(2011: 17.5p).
Cash flows and banking
K3 generates good cash flows, with 
a seasonal weighting in October-
December. Cash generated from 
operations was £7.28m (2011: 
£5.64m). Operating cash flows in 
the year included £1.24m in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, £0.59m of acquisition costs, 
£0.32m of exceptional reorganisation 
costs and £0.76m of exceptional income 
relating to the sale of IP . The underlying 
adjusted cash flow from operations
*6
 
therefore was £8.77m (2011: £8.28m), 
representing 77% of adjusted profit 
from operations
*3
 (2011: 86%). The 
reduction in adjusted operating cash*
6
 
reflects tough trading conditions and 
major investment in our managed 
services hosting capabilities and our AX 
product offering. 
During the year the Group made debt 
repayments of £3.64m, paid £0.85m 
of interest, paid tax of £1.31m and 
received proceeds from a placing of 
2,564,408 new ordinary shares of £5.01m 
(net) and additional loans of £4.05m. 
Approximately £7.82m was paid to the 
vendors of the acquisitions we made in 
the year, together with outstanding earn 
out payments of £0.77m from earlier 
acquisitions. Net bank debt at 30 June 
2012 was in line with the prior year at 
£15.68m (30 June 2011: £15.49m).
In September 2012 we agreed the 
extension of existing facilities through 
to December 2013 on the same terms 
with further facilities of up to £2.0m 
committed and a further £3.0m over the 
course of the facility period available to 
fund acquisitions.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a final 
(and total) dividend for the financial 
year of 1.0p per share (2011: 0.75p). 
Subject to shareholder approval at K3’s 
General Meeting, this dividend will be 
become payable on 18 January 2013 to 
shareholders on the register at  
14 December 2012. 
K3’s Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 5 December 2012 at 10.30am, at the 
Group’s head office at Baltimore House, 
50 Kansas Avenue, Manchester M50 2GL.
Outlook
K3’s underlying robustness is 
encouraging and the acquisitions we 
have made have strengthened the Group. 
With the end of the formal sale process, 
we are now re-focusing on our strategy 
for growth. We have a number of medium 
term growth opportunities to leverage 
our large customer base and build on our 
key customer and supplier relationships, 
especially in Managed Services and our 
International operations. 
We see the new financial year as a year 
of investment and will continue to 
invest in new product offerings across 
the Group, with two areas of specific 
focus being our Microsoft Dynamics 
AX product and Managed Services. 
We anticipate that the benefits of our 
investment programme should come 
through during the course of 2013. 
Financially, the Group remains robust, 
with good cash generation and 
banking facilities extended for a  
further year.

Key Performance Indicators
The Board considers the key performance indicators by which it measures the performance of the Group 
to be revenue, recurring revenue (both the level and the percentage of total revenue), gross margin, profit 
from operations and earnings per share, both adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, acquisition 
costs, exceptional reorganisation costs and exceptional income. The performance indicators used by the 
Group are summarised below and the table sets out K3’s performance for the year under review.
Revenue is the gross revenue as reported 
in the financial statements, comprising 
software, hardware, consultancy, and 
support and managed services. This is 
a key measure of activity within each 
business segment and for the Group as 
a whole.
Gross margin percentage is calculated as 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
This measure identifies the level of 
contribution derived from each sale or 
component thereof. 
Adjusted profit from operations is 
calculated as profit from operations per 
the financial statements, adjusted for 
the impact of amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, acquisition costs, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and exceptional 
income. This is a key performance 
indicator for quoted companies.
Adjusted operating cash percentage 
is the operating cash generated after 
adding back cash flows in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, acquisition costs, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and exceptional 
income, divided by the adjusted 
operating profit. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the Group’s ability to convert 
operating profit into cash. 
Adjusted EPS is calculated as profit 
for the period, adjusted for the 
tax affected impact of acquired 
intangibles amortisation, exceptional 
reorganisation costs, acquisition costs 
and exceptional income, divided by 
the weighted average number of 
shares during the period. This is a key 
performance indicator for quoted 
companies. 
Recurring revenue is the income 
provided for annual licence renewals 
and support for software used by our 
customers. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the underlying resilience and 
growth of the business.
Percentage of recurring revenue 
measures the growth of income 
providing core stability to the business.

These contributed £7.55m of revenue.

 rose 
by 40% to £5.86m (2011: £4.17m), with

. It should 
be noted that our Sage activity typically 
delivers lower operating margins 
compared to our SYSPRO activities. 
Our SYSPRO business secured nine order 
wins in total worth £0.9m compared 
with nine worth £0.5m last year, a 
marked improvement. Lead intake is 
holding up well (235 leads compared 
with 201 last year) and the pipeline 
value is currently 76% higher than last 
year, at £4.4m. Of this, approximately 
£1.8m is new customer business and 
£2.6m is potential new orders from the 
existing user base. This compares to a 
pipeline worth £2.5m last year, where 
potential new customers represented 
£1.6m of the value.
Our SYSPRO customers continue 
to generate high levels of recurring 
revenues through annual software 
licence renewals. These are collected 
between October and December, and 
licence renewals in the year were in 
excess of 98%, in line with historic levels. 
The SYSPRO maintenance licence and 
support income is worth approximately 
£6.48m per annum (2011: £6.25m 
per annum) and 85% of the income is 
recognised in the first half of our financial 
year, giving the first half a significant 
weighting against the second half. 
We entered the Sage marketplace in 
November 2010, with the acquisition 
of Panacea and through a number of 
subsequent acquisitions have now 
established a leading position as a Sage 
supplier, providing the full range of Sage 
products, from Sage 50 to enterprise level 
Sage X3. Our Sage customer base now 
stands at 922 customers and generates 
recurring annual income of around 
£6.20m (2011: £2.19m). In July 2011, 
we acquired Fifth Dimension Systems 
Ltd and, in October 2011, the business 
secured the Sage Enterprise Partner of 
the Year award, which entitles it to higher 
margins in the next year. We are in the 
process of merging our Sage operations 
under one Managing Director. 
Our Sage operations secured 58 deals 
worth £2.20m (2011: 16 deals worth 
£0.30m). While the Sage support market 
is highly price competitive, we continue 
to attract customers from other Sage 
partners. Mirroring the model we are 
deploying for our Microsoft and SYSPRO 
customers, we will be cross-selling 
our Cloud Computing solutions to our 
new Sage customer base and have a 
deployment model already operational 
for the Sage 200 product. 
Our other two business units in the 
Division have customers who can be 
offered upgrade opportunities to our 
SYSPRO or AX solutions and hosting. 
These businesses contributed £2.71m 
(2011: £2.20m) of sales in the year, of 
which £2.08m is recurring (2011: £1.68m).

International Division
Results from the International Division, 
based in The Netherlands, were 
exceptionally good this year. Revenues 
increased by 40% year-on-year to 
£12.65m (2011: £9.05m) and adjusted 
profit from operations
*12
 rose by 57% 
to £3.67m (2011: £2.34m) excluding 
exceptional income from the sale 
of IP of £0.76 (2011: £nil), with our 
acquisition contributing £2.40m to 
revenues and £0.66m to adjusted profit 
from operations
*13
. These results are in 
part due to the strengthening of our 
relationship with Inter IKEA Systems BV 
(the owner and franchisor of The IKEA 
Concept and worldwide IKEA franchisor), 
the largest customer in the Division. 
At the end of the financial year, we 
signed an exclusive minimum five year 
agreement with the company to support 
and develop the IKEA Master Version 
software (“IMV”) used by franchisees 
outside the IKEA group. The growth 
with this customer has offset some 
weakening in the Dutch fashion market 
in the second half. 
Also contributing to the Division’s 
excellent results was the performance 
of our international partner channel for 
K3’s IP . Sales into this reseller channel 
have increased by 56% to £1.19m as a 
result of investment in the Pebblestone 
solution that was made over the last 
18 months and a rationalisation of the 
reseller base.
In December 2011, we acquired certain 
assets of Unisoft BV, a leading provider 
of retail point of sale solutions in 
Holland and Scandinavia. The solutions 
complement our existing offering and 
create cross-selling opportunities. The 
maintenance base for this business is 
weighted toward the second half of 
the K3 financial year producing post 
acquisition revenue of £2.40m and 
adjusted profit from operations
*13
  
of £0.66m.
The Division also generated excellent 
levels of services income and we 
recruited additional resource in the 
second half year in Holland and in 
our Far East office in Singapore which 
services our customers in that region.
We signed 61 new contracts in the 
period, worth a total of £3.3m (2011: 
14 contracts, £2.7m). The increase 
in deal numbers reflects the smaller 
deals prevalent in Unisoft and the 
reseller channel. Looking ahead, the 
prospects pipeline currently amounts 
to approximately £3.7m. This excludes 
potential business anticipated in the 
long term plan with Inter IKEA  
Systems BV.

Microsoft UK Division
Our Microsoft UK Division experienced 
a challenging year. Revenues increased 
to £24.92m, up 9% over the year (2011: 
£22.88m), including a combined 
contribution of £1.87m from the Azurri 
and Retail Systems Group Limited 
(“RSG”) acquisitions made in the first half 
of the financial year. However adjusted 
profit from operations
*14
 was down 20% 
year-on-year to £2.22m (2011: £2.78m), 
notwithstanding the inclusion of an 
adjusted £0.38m contribution*
15
 from 
the acquisitions. 
The decrease in operating profit (pre 
acquisitions) reflected both the tough 
trading conditions and major investment 
we are making in our retail software 
offering, in particular bringing the 
Microsoft AX product in line with our 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV portfolio. 
We also invested in our sales and 
delivery resource in advance of sales of 
this product offering. The cost of our 
investment was £0.70m with a further 
£0.22m capitalised as development costs. 
Our acquisitions of Azurri and RSG have 
brought some notable benefits to the 
Division. RSG, one of the leading providers 
of Microsoft Dynamics ‘RMS’ to retailers in 
the UK and Ireland, brings us a software 
suite suitable for smaller retailers and 
therefore widens our marketplace. It also 
has a managed service offering 
which further expands K3’s own growing 
Managed Services Division. RSG has 
closed 21 new business deals since 
acquisition, worth a total of £0.76m. Azurri, 
which supports the retail solutions used 
by several major high street retailers, 
brings us additional recurring income 
and potential customers for our Microsoft 
Dynamics products.
The Microsoft UK retail business 
secured £5.9m of new business wins 
compared to £5.6m last year after a 
slow start, closing seven major new 
deals, including our first major order for 
Microsoft’s new AX for Retail solution 
in a contract we won with Eason. The 
agreement has been structured so 
that Microsoft is the prime delivery 
contractor, with K3 providing the 
specialist retail modules required. 
Other significant AX deals include 
Grafton, Wynsors and Weird Fish, with 
the remaining deals being NAV multi-
channel offerings. The deals were closed 
late in each half year and therefore have 
resulted in low services income to date 
with the focus to date being on scoping 
and system discovery rather than on 
high levels of implementation. Our 
multi-channel offering, incorporating 
our own IP , continues to support our 
performance on NAV. The prospects 
pipeline for the UK retail business stands 
at approximately £21.0m (2011: £19.0m), 
with over 50% focused on our Microsoft 
AX Multi Channel retail solution. We are 
hopeful that a number of these deals 
will close in the first half of the new 
financial year. 
In the course of our Group 
reorganisation to create the Microsoft 
UK Division, we integrated our other 
smaller Microsoft-based software units 
under a single management team to 
achieve cost savings and efficiencies. 
This business unit closed 12 deals worth 
£0.9m in the year, including wins with 
Prices Candles, Refrigeration Vehicles, 
Sportsman Guns and High Mark. During 
the year we also established a lower-cost 
implementation process, adapting our 
model for current conditions.
In the light of the weak trading 
performance of our process 
manufacturing AX business, we took the 
decision to restructure it, reducing the 
cost base by £0.75m per annum. The 
cost of this restructuring is included in 
exceptional costs. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Managed Services Division
The Managed Services Division offers 
a range of application solutions both 
on-premises, hosted and via Software as 
a Service using hosting centres in New 
York, London, Edinburgh and Toronto. 
Revenue rose by 16% to £5.43m  
(2011: £4.70m) but more noteworthy is 
the 36% increase in the year end run rate 
of recurring income to £3.58m  
(2011: £2.64m) of which around £195,000 
per month (2011: £115,000 per month) 
or £2.34m annualised is hosting revenue. 
As expected, profits lagged revenue 
growth as we added £1.16m of additional 
resource. Divisional overheads have 
increased to £2.99m (2011: £1.41m), 
capitalised development was £0.38m and 
capital expenditure was £0.84m. Adjusted 
result from operations
*16
 was £nil (2011: 
profit of £0.54m). We now have platforms 
in place for the hosting of SYSPRO, 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Sage 200 
software and are seeing a good demand 
for these and the other complementary 
services we can offer from “the Cloud” . 
Our deployment now ranges from on-site 
managed services to fully hosted services 
provided on a multi-tenanted solution in 
the Cloud. The final quarter of the year 
saw an acceleration of new deployments 
and included a substantial new SYSPRO 
order in Canada. We are also launching 
hosting with SYSPRO Australia and have 
launched ‘mini-SYSPRO’ hosting with a 
low cost option for up to 10 users.
Currently, the prospects pipeline stands at 
£2.65m of potential income (2011: £1.30m).

Central costs for the year amounted 
to £0.41m (2011: £0.25m). These 
costs included Directors’ costs, group 
human resources, accounting and 
legal personnel, and costs associated 
with the Plc including financing. The 
costs are stated net of recovery of 
elements recharged to the operating 
units and are higher year on year due to 
additional costs arising from the acquired 
companies and foreign exchange costs.
We made a total of five significant 
acquisitions in the year and these have 
been reorganised to fit into our divisional 
structure at a cost of £0.56m (2011: 
£0.45m invested to create our new Group 
structure, following four significant 
acquisitions). In addition we rationalised 
the structure of our Sage and non-retail 
AX operations at a cost of £0.26m and 
incurred costs of £0.14m in relation to the 
strategic review and sale process.

Strategy and Objectives
The Board believes that K3 has the 
potential to build on its current position 
as a leading supplier of SME and mid-tier 
supply chain management solutions, 
with a particular emphasis on “hosted 
applications” and “cloud computing” . 
Acquisitions also form a key part of the 
growth strategy. Nearer term, the Board’s 
main objectives are to: 
•	 achiev e 	 g r o wth 	 in 	 our 	 tar get 	 mar kets;

Outlook
While the economic climate remains 
challenging, and we have to remain 
responsive to market changes, we 
view K3’s growth prospects positively. 
The acquisitions we have made in the 
financial year under review, as well as 
in the prior year, have strengthened 
the Group and added to our stream 
of annually recurring income. We also 
see substantial growth opportunities, 
especially in Managed Services and 
our International operations, which 
will drive recurring income, profit and 
cash generation in the medium term. 
We are continuing with our investment 
programme to develop our product 
offerings, especially Microsoft Dynamics 
AX and Managed Services, and see the 
new financial year as one of investment, 
with the benefits to come over the 
course of 2013 and beyond.

Trading results
Revenue for the year was £67.96m 
compared to £52.8m for the year to  
30 June 2011. The 29% increase included 
revenues from businesses acquired 
during the year of £11.82m. The Group 
registered an adjusted profit from 
operations
*17
 of £11.33m for the year 
ended 30 June 2012 (2011: £9.58m). 
Profit from operations for the year was 
£7.35m (2011: £5.81m).
Acquisition and reorganisation costs 
were £1.15m (2011: £0.94m) and 
exceptional income was £0.76m  
(2011: £nil).
The amortisation of intangible assets 
of £3.59m (2011: £2.83m) includes 
amortisation on new acquisitions 
of £0.55m and full year charges for 
acquisitions made during the previous 
period. Finance costs were £1.31m 
(2011: £0.91m). The resulting profit for 
the year was £5.72m (2011: £4.48m).
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share
*18
 was 
30.2p (2011: 27.5p). Earnings per share 
was 19.8p (2011: 17.5p).
The directors propose to pay a dividend 
of 1.0p per share (2011: 0.75p).
Cash flow and net debt
The net cash position at 30 June 2012 
was £0.02m (2011: cash of £0.11m). 
There were bank and other loans of 
£17.78m (2011: £16.30m). Repayments 
against bank and other loans during 
the year were £3.69m (2011: £2.87m). 
New loans of £4.05m were obtained to 
fund the acquisitions during the year. 
£6.36m was paid to vendors of these 
acquisitions with £0.77m of earn out 
and retention payments in relation to 
acquisitions made in the prior period. 
There was an increase in the sterling 
value of the Euro denominated loan of 
£0.38m (2011: decrease of £0.47m). 
The Group’s net cash inflow in the year 
was £0.01m (2011: £0.60m). The Group’s 
inflow from operations in the period 
was £7.24m (2011: £5.64m). However, 
this is after making payments in relation 
to acquisitions of £1.23m to regularise 
liabilities that were significantly 
outside normal statutory due dates 
and commercial terms at the date of 
acquisition, £0.59m of acquisition costs 
and £0.32m of reorganisation costs. 
£0.76 was received in respect of transfer 
of IP to a customer.
The Group adopts cash flow hedge 
accounting in respect of its interest 
collar. The effect is that £0.09m has 
been credited to the cash flow hedging 
reserve. A financial liability of £0.01m 
(2011: £0.07m) is included as derivative 
financial instruments within current 
trade and other payables. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £0.32m 
(2011: £0.43m) comprising a charge of 
£1.40m (2011: £1.42m) of current taxation 
and a credit of £1.08m (2011: £0.99m) of 
deferred taxation, of which £1.24m (2011: 
£1.07m) related to the amortisation of 
intangible assets. This credit for deferred 
tax in the prior year included £0.31m 
following the reduction of the tax rate in 
the UK from 26% to 24%. The effective 
tax rate was 19.4% (2011: 21.8%) due to 
the inclusion of profits from overseas 
subsidiaries which are taxed at lower 
rates. The effective tax rate is determined 
by applying the tax rate in each tax 
jurisdiction to the profits arising there.
Cautionary statement
This business review has been prepared 
for shareholders to provide them with 
additional information to assess the 
company’s strategies and the potential 
for those strategies to succeed. It 
should be noted that the business 
review contains certain forward looking 
statements. These statements are made 
by the directors in good faith, based on 
the information available to them up to 
the time of the approval of this report. 
Accordingly, all these statements 
should be treated with caution, due to 
the inherent uncertainties, including 
both economic and business risk 
factors, underlying any such forward 
looking information.
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks 
and uncertainties, which could have 
a material impact on the Group’s 
performance and could cause actual 
results to differ materially from expected 
and historical results. The Group’s risk 
management policies and procedures to 
deal with operational risk are included in 
the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages19 and 20. The principal business 
risks which the Group faces can be 
categorised as follows: 
Strategic
Changes in the business environment 
influence the Group’s development 
in terms of the strategies which it 
pursues and the products and services 
it offers. These changes may stem 
from market competition or economic 
and technological advancement. The 
executive directors regularly review the 
Group’s strategic progress and obtain 
market information to assist in strategic 
decisions around products, competitors 
and potential acquisitions. We recognise 
that selected acquisitions will play a key 
role in future growth of the business 
as illustrated by the major acquisitions 
made since 2003. We are expanding into 
the emerging technologies of “hosted 
applications” and “cloud computing” . 
We also recognise that the ability 
to integrate acquisitions and derive 
synergies is key and, to this end, we have 
a strong central management team to 
ensure that strategic objectives and 
targets are reached. 
On 1 March 2012, following the 
approach from K3’s largest shareholder, 
Mr PJ Claesson, regarding a possible 
offer for the Company, we announced 
that the Company had received a 
number of indicative proposals and had 
commenced a formal sale process. On 
31 July, we confirmed that discussions 
with interested parties were ongoing, 
however, in a separate statement issued 
today, we have announced that the 
formal sale process has now come to 
an end. This is because the Board does 
not believe the proposals received are 
at a level that would be acceptable to 
shareholders and the proposals are 
therefore not recommendable by  
the Board.

Business environment
The Group’s customer base is 
mainly in the retail, distribution and 
manufacturing sectors, primarily in 
the United Kingdom and Europe. The 
environment in which the Group offers 
its products and services is, therefore, 
dependent on the economic and other 
circumstances affecting these business 
sectors including competitor behaviour. 
Over the years we have developed 
a creative, innovative, competitive 
culture and a reputation for advanced 
functionality and product quality. The 
Group has made significant investment 
in its library of IP which protects 
the business from competition and 
increases the barrier to entry in our 
specialists markets. Whilst there is still 
a difficult economic backdrop in our 
core markets, the Group is well placed 
as one of Microsoft’s larger business 
partners in the UK and has high levels 
of predictable income from its existing 
customer base, both in the UK and in its 
overseas markets.
Relationships
The Group benefits from a number of 
close commercial relationships with 
key suppliers and customers. Damage 
to or loss of these relationships could 
have a direct and detrimental effect 
on the Group’s results. The key Group 
supplier relationships are secured by 
commercial agreements lasting for up 
to 5 years and management participate 
in regular product and strategy reviews 
with the supplier. On an annual basis 
our customers commit to maintenance 
and support agreements that facilitate 
availability of product upgrades and 
business support.
Delivery
Our products and services operate in 
business critical areas for our customers 
and any failure to meet contractual 
commitments and client expectations 
could damage our reputation and 
impact upon our financial position. 
To mitigate this risk we monitor our 
performance continuously against 
contractual commitments and 
expectations and deploy a wide range 
of experienced technical specialists 
and project managers to evaluate 
performance. High risk projects are 
monitored at Divisional board level, 
meetings of which are attended by main 
Board executive directors.
Financial
Whilst all risks may be considered 
to have a financial impact, the 
management of the Group’s financial 
resources represents a key area of focus. 
Financial risks are faced in ensuring 
sufficient funds are available to meet 
financial commitments as and when 
they fall due and protecting the Group’s 
financial strength against adverse 
movements in financial markets. Further 
details are provided in note 19.
•	 Cr edit	risk – The Group’s credit risk 
is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables. The amounts presented 
in the statement of financial position 
are net of allowances for doubtful 
debts, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior 
experience and their assessment of 
the current economic environment. 
The Group operates in three key 
markets and hence the credit risk is 
concentrated on retail, manufacturing 
and distribution customers. The Group 
manages credit risk by ensuring that 
outlays by the Group are matched 
with receipts from customers where 
possible and by tight control over 
contractual terms.
•	 C urr enc y	risk	– The Group’s currency 
risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables where certain customers 
are billed in US Dollars or Euros 
where these are not the functional 
currency of the Group company. 
Where possible the risk is hedged by 
amounts payable in those currencies. 
The acquisition of Landsteinar 
Netherlands in September 2007 was 
part funded by a Euro loan which acts 
as a hedge against the net assets of 
the business.
•	 P ric e	risk	– The Group does not have 
any financial instruments which are 
exposed to price risk.
•	 Liquidit y	and	cash	flo w – The Group 
has deferred contingent consideration 
and a bank loan with set payment 
dates. The Group ensures that it has 
sufficient funds to meet its obligations 
or commitments associated with its 
financial instruments by monitoring 
cash flow as part of its day-to-
day control procedures and also, 
more strategically, to ensure that 
financing is in place with manageable 
repayment periods and that 
appropriate facilities are available to 
be drawn upon when the need arises. 
The facilities from the Group’s bankers 
require the Group to meet certain 
covenants throughout the term of 
the loans and the Group’s forecasts 
indicate that the Group will remain 
within the set parameters.
•	 I n t er est	r a t e – Interest rate risk arises 
from the extent to which the Group 
holds interest rate sensitive assets or 
is exposed to interest rate sensitive 
liabilities. The Group maintains a 
balance of fixed and floating interest 
rates on its financing to manage this 
exposure and also has an interest 
rate hedge strategy set up with its 
UK bankers. The Group has a collar 
hedging arrangement to mitigate the 
risk of interest rates falling outside 
specified ranges on approximately 
2% of sterling denominated long 
term loans. Foreign currency loans 
that were taken out at the time of 
the Landsteinar Netherlands and 
Pebblestone acquisitions are not 
currently hedged for interest rates.

The acquisitions are in line with K3’s strategy to build recurring 
revenues and acquire profitable user bases with significant 
cross-selling opportunities, in particular for its hosting and 
managed services offering.

The Board supports the principles of good governance. In fulfilling their responsibilities, the directors 
believe that they govern the company in the best interests of the shareholders, whilst having due regard 
to the interests of the stakeholders in the group including, in particular, customers, employees and 
suppliers. The Combined Code has been replaced by the UK Corporate Governance Code, which applies 
to companies of the main list of the London Stock Exchange, and the Quoted Companies Alliance’s 2005 
Corporate Governance Guidelines for Smaller Companies has been superseded by new QCA Guidelines 
issued in September 2010. Although as a company quoted on AIM it is not required to comply with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors intend to comply with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code in so far as they consider it appropriate having regard to the size 
of the group and have decided to provide corporate governance disclosures comparable with those 
required of a listed company. 
The board
The group is headed by an effective 
board which meets on a bi-monthly 
basis. All meetings in the period were 
attended by all the directors, except that 
Mr PJ Claesson was unable to attend two 
of the meetings. It is supplied in a timely 
manner with information of a quality 
to enable it to discharge its duties. The 
board has determined those matters 
which are retained for board sanction 
and those matters which are delegated 
to the executive management of the 
business. The types of decisions which 
are to be taken by the Board are:
•	 appr o v al	of	the	financial	sta t emen ts	
and	pr ofit	plans	f or	the	g r oup;
•	 appr o v al	of	an y	unbudget ed	plans	in

The Board has established three standing 
sub-committees to assist in the discharge 
of corporate governance responsibilities. 
They are the nominations committee, 
remuneration committee and audit 
committee. The roles of each of the 
committees, their members and activities 
during the period are covered separately 
within this report.
The Board comprised the Chairman, 
two executive and one non-executive 
director, details of whom are included 
on page 27. The composition of the 
Board is designed to provide an 
appropriate balance of group, industry 
and general commercial experience and 
is reviewed as required to ensure that it 
remains appropriate to the nature of the 
group’s activities.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are distinct. The office of 
Chairman is held by Mr TA Milne. The 
office of Chief Executive is held by  
Mr NA Makeham.
Appointments to the Board are the 
responsibility of the Nominations 
Committee.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises 
the Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the non-
executive director, Mr PJ Claesson, and 
the Chief Executive, Mr NA Makeham, 
and is chaired by the Chairman. 
Meetings are arranged as necessary and 
none were held during the year. The 
committee is responsible for nominating 
candidates (both executive and non-
executive) for the approval of the Board 
to fill vacancies or appoint additional 
persons to the Board. Its terms of 
reference are available upon request and 
are placed on the company’s website.
All directors receive induction on 
joining the Board covering the group’s 
operations, goals and strategy, and 
their responsibilities as directors of 
the group. The company supports the 
directors in developing their knowledge 
and capabilities.
The directors have established a 
procedure, agreed by the Board, for 
directors in the furtherance of their duties 
to take independent professional advice, 
if necessary, at the company’s expense.
The Combined Code requires that the 
Board should undertake a formal and 
rigorous annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its committees 
and individual directors. However, no 
formal evaluation was conducted during 
the period although informal evaluation 
of the performance of the individual 
executive directors was conducted by 
the Chairman.
All directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity 
after their appointment. In accordance 
with the Articles of Association, all 
directors are required to retire by 
rotation and shall be eligible for re-

appointment of the non-executive 
director are available for inspection 
upon request.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
the Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the non-
executive director, Mr PJ Claesson, and 
is chaired by the Chairman. It reviews 
the remuneration and contractual 
arrangements of the executive directors. 
The remuneration of the Chairman and 
the non-executive director is determined 
by the Board as a whole, based on a 
review of the current practices in other 
companies. The committee met once 
during the year and the meeting was 
attended by both members of the 
committee. The terms of reference are 
available upon request and are placed 
on the company’s website.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Board recognises its responsibility to 
present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the group’s position 
and prospects, both within its half year 
and annual financial statements and in 
other price-sensitive public reports. The 
statement of the directors’ responsibility 
in preparing the financial statements is 
made on page 25.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors 
have formed a judgement, at the time 
of approving the financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason 
the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Internal control
The Board recognises its ultimate 
accountability for maintaining an 
effective system of internal control which 
is appropriate in relation to both the 
scope and nature of the group’s activities. 
The system covers all controls including:
•	 financial;
•	 oper a tional;
•	 c omplianc e;	and
•	 r isk	managemen t.
The responsibility for managing risks on 
a day to day basis lies with the executive 
directors. The principle business risks 
and the actions to mitigate the risks 
are included in the Financial Review on 
pages 15 and 16. Details of operational 
risks are included below.
Operational
These risks, which are inherent in all 
business activities, are those which 
mainly result from the potential 
breakdown of individual business units 
or the group’s control of its human, 
physical and operating resources. The 
potential financial or reputational loss 
arising from failures in internal controls, 
flaws or malfunctions in computer 
systems and poor product design or 
delivery all fall within this category.
There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant issues faced by the group 
which has been in place throughout the 
period and up to 17 September 2012. It 
has been regularly reviewed by the Board 
and it accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Board and senior management have 
a clear and consistent understanding of 
the key risks facing the business. Whilst 
they recognise that it is not possible 
to eliminate risk completely, they have 
established an infrastructure of controls, 
systems, staff and processes which 
aim to minimise the likelihood of risks 
occurring or reduce the impact should 
they do so. The key elements of this 
infrastructure which enable the Board to 
review the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls are as follows:
•	 establishmen t	of	a	f or mal	
management structure, including the 
specification of matters reserved for 
decision	b y	the	B oar d;
•	 setting	and	r eviewing	the	str a t eg ic	
objec tiv es	of	the	g r oup;
•	 B oar d	in v olv emen t	in	the	setting	and	
r eview	of	the	annual	budget;
•	 the	r egular	r eview	of	the	g r oup ’ s	
performance compared with budget 
and	f or ecasts;
•	 pr e	and	post	in v estmen t	appr aisal	of	
capital	expenditur e;
•	 in t eg r it y	and	c ompet enc e	of	
personnel as part of the control 
en vir onmen t;	and	
•	 g r oup	r epor ting	instruc tions	and	
procedures including delegation of 
authority and authorisation levels, 
segregation of duties and other 
control procedures, and standardised 
accounting policies. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012
22
The Board and senior management are 
aware that any significant operational 
matters which raise cause for concern 
may have arisen because of or give rise to 
material internal control issues. There is 
a process in place whereby any member 
of management who becomes aware of 
an internal control issue can bring this to 
the attention of the Chief Finance Officer. 
There were no such issues raised during 
the period under review.
The Board acknowledges its 
responsibility for the group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board is committed 
to operating comprehensive processes 
to manage the key risks which face 
the business. They have established 
a framework of policies, systems and 
procedures to ensure that the nature 
and extent of the risk undertaken is 
commensurate with the commercial 
returns and, where necessary, to 
ensure prudent risk-taking to protect 
shareholder value. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises the 
Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the non-
executive director, Mr PJ Claesson, and is 
chaired by the Chairman. The committee 
met twice during the year, although Mr 
PJ Claesson was unable to attend one of 
them. The role of the Audit Committee 
is to consider the appointment of the 
auditors, audit fees, scope of audit work 
and any resultant findings. It reviews 
external audit activities, monitors 
compliance with statutory requirements 
for financial reporting and reviews the 
interim and full year financial statements 
before they are presented to the Board 
for approval. The Chief Executive, Chief 
Finance Officer and external auditors 
attend meetings of the Audit Committee 
by invitation. The committee is also 
required to review the effectiveness of 
the group’s internal control systems, to 
review the group’s statement on internal 
control systems prior to endorsement by 
the Board and to consider, from time to 
time, the need for a “risk sub-committee” 
to assist in monitoring the group’s 
internal control systems. Its terms of 
reference are available upon request and 
are placed on the company’s website.
The Audit Committee considers and 
determines relevant action in respect 
of any control issues raised by the 
auditors. Given the size of the group and 
the close day to day control exercised 
by the executive directors and senior 
management, no formal internal audit 
department is considered necessary.
Relations with shareholders
The company seeks to maintain good 
communication with shareholders. The 
executive directors make presentations 
to institutional shareholders covering 
the interim and full year results. Whilst 
most shareholder contact is with the 
executive directors, the Chairman 
and the non-executive director are 
available to meet major shareholders if 
requested to do so. The views of major 
shareholders are obtained through 
direct face-to-face contact and analysts’ 
or brokers briefings. 
The Board considers the AGM to be an 
important opportunity to communicate 
with shareholders and encourages their 
participation. The company despatches 
the notice of AGM, with explanatory 
notes describing items of special 
business, at least 21 working days 
before the meeting. All shareholders 
have the opportunity formally or 
informally to put questions to the 
company’s AGMs. All directors attend 
the AGM and the Chairman of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees is available to answer 
questions from shareholders. At each 
AGM the Chairman advises shareholders 
of the proxy voting details on each of 
the resolutions which is dealt with on a 
show of hands. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

   137 99
During the year, the auditors provided 
non-audit services in relation to 
consultation on interim results and tax 
advice in connection with acquisitions 
and payroll taxes. The Board considered 
the proposed non-audit services in 
advance to ensure that it was satisfied 
that neither the nature nor the scale of 
the non-audit services would impair the 
auditors’ objectivity and independence.
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
Whilst the group is not required to 
comply with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, it has 
given considerable attention to the 
provisions set out therein. The group 
has not complied with all provisions 
required for listed companies, 
principally as it does not consider these 
appropriate given the size and nature 
of the group. However, the directors 
confirm that throughout the year ended 
30 June 2012 the group has been in 
compliance with the Code provisions 
set out in Section 1 of the June 2010 
FRC UK Corporate Governance Code, 
with the following exceptions:
•	 No	dir ec t or	has	been	iden tified	as	a	
senior independent director. There is 
no alternative route for shareholders

to be appropriate for the size of the 
group at present. (A.4.1)
•	 T he	Chair man ’ s	per f or manc e	has

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have elected to prepare 
the group financial statements 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union 
and the company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law. Under company 
law the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the 
group and company and of the profit 
or loss of the group for that period. The 
directors are also required to prepare 
financial statements in accordance with 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
•	 selec t	suitable	ac c oun ting	policies	
and	then	apply	them	c onsist en tly ;
•	 make	judgemen ts	and	ac c oun ting	
estimates that are reasonable and 
pruden t;
•	 sta t e	whether	they	ha v e	been	
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial	sta t emen ts;
•	 pr epar e	the	financial	sta t emen ts	on	
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Supplier payment policy
The company’s policy, which is also 
applied by the group, is to agree terms 
of payment with suppliers when setting 
the terms of each transaction, ensure 
that suppliers are made aware of the 
terms of payment and abide by the 
terms of payment. Trade creditors of 
the company at 30 June 2012 were 
equivalent to 52 (2011: 55) days’ 
purchases, based on the average daily 
amount invoiced by suppliers during 
the period.
Charitable and political contributions
Charitable contributions during the 
year amounted to £3,775 (2011: £4,096). 
There were no political contributions 
during the year.

Disabled employees
Applications for employment by 
disabled persons are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In 
the event of members of staff becoming 
disabled every effort is made to ensure 
that their employment with the group 
continues and that appropriate training 
is arranged. It is the policy of the group 
that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons 
should, as far as possible, be identical 
with that of other employees.
Employee consultation
The group places considerable value on 
the involvement of its employees and 
has continued to keep them informed 
on matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting 
the performance of the group. This is 
achieved through informal discussions 
between management and other 
employees at a local level.
Directors’ indemnity cover
All directors benefit from qualifying 
third-party indemnity provisions in place 
during the financial period and at the 
date of this report.
Environmental matters
The directors recognise that whilst the 
group’s business activities as a developer 
and supplier of software applications 
have minimal direct environmental 
impact, they acknowledge that the 
group’s actions may have an impact on 
the environment through its day to day 
activities and through its wider network. 
They acknowledge a commitment to 
the protection of the environment and 
the group’s environmental policy aims 
to raise awareness of environmental 
matters and to establish standards. 
The group’s intention is to establish 
a paperless working environment 
wherever appropriate. This is supported 
through the automation of a number of 
internal management and administrative 
processes such as timesheets and 
performance appraisals. The group also 
encourages staff to minimise unnecessary 
travel by using web exchange, telephone 
conferencing and working from home in 
appropriate circumstances. 
Events after the reporting date
These are detailed in note 30 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Website publication
The directors are responsible for 
ensuring the annual report and the 
financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and 
integrity of the company’s website is 
the responsibility of the directors. The 
directors’ responsibility also extends to 
the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
Auditors
All of the current directors have taken 
all of the steps that they ought to have 
taken to make themselves aware of any 
information needed by the company’s 
auditors for the purposes of their audit 
and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of the information. The directors 
are not aware of any relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are 
unaware.
The Notice of Annual General Meeting 
contains a resolution to re-appoint BDO 
LLP as auditors for the ensuing year.

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of this Standard in future periods may have an impact on the results and net assets of

Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into 
the Group.
Revenue comprises the value of sales to third party customers of software licences, customised software, hardware and fees 
derived from installation, consultancy, training, support and managed services. It is stated exclusive of value added tax and net of 
trade discounts and rebates. 
Revenue on the sale of software licences is recognised where there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with a customer 
(contract and/or binding purchase order), delivery of the software has taken place, collectability is probable and the fee is fixed 
and determinable. If significant post-delivery obligations exist, revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain. 
Revenue on the sale of customised software, hardware and installation is recognised on delivery to a customer or on completion 
of contractual milestones. Revenue from training and consultancy is recognised as the contract progresses. Revenue from 
support and managed services is generally invoiced in advance, termed “deferred revenue” , and taken to revenue in equal 
monthly instalments over the relevant period.
Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after charging all operating costs including those separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
unusual nature or to facilitate a more helpful understanding of the group’s results. It is stated before finance income and costs.

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the group”) as if they formed a single 
entity. Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated in the group consolidation.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists when the group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and 
liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date on which control is obtained. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the 
assets, including any intangible assets identified, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but 
is measured at cost less impairment losses. In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the 
market value of equity at the date of completion, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon the present value 
of the expected future cashflows based on whether the directors believe performance conditions will be met and thus the extent 
to which further consideration will be payable.
As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2006 (date of transition to IFRS) has been frozen at 
the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. 
The group performs its impairment reviews at the cash-generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable net book value of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss  
on disposal. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012
39
1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Impairment charges of non-financial assets (excluding deferred tax assets)
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken at the financial 
period end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (effectively the expected cash to be generated from using the asset in 
the business)), the asset is written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
asset’s cash-generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separable identifiable 
cash flows). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not 
been adjusted.
Impairment charges are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent they 
reverse gains previously recognised in total comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate (the “functional currency”) are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are similarly recognised immediately in the 
income statement except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in 
which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into forward contracts and options (see 
below for details of the group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). Where the group has 
entered into forward currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency cash flows, the group adopts hedge accounting for 
these transactions.
On consolidation, results of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. The balance 
sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the closing period end rate. Exchange differences arising, if any, are taken to 
a separate component in equity (the translation reserve). Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in 
the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Exchange differences recognised in the income statement of group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of 
long-term monetary items forming part of the group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the 
translation reserve on consolidation.

Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Directors.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset 
was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
Financial assets are recognised at fair value on the group’s statement of financial position when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers, e.g. trade receivables. Trade receivables do not carry 
any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of 
the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under 
the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present 
value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, 
such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in 
the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is 
written off against the associated provision.
The group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call and overdrafts with banks.
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see Financial liabilities section for out-of-money derivatives). They are 
carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in finance income or expense line. Other than derivative financial instruments which are not designated as a hedging 
instrument, the group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair 
value through profit or loss.
Available-for-sale
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally 
the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries or associates. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value generally recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in an available-for-sale reserve. 
Where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset (which constitutes 
objective evidence of impairment), the full amount of impairment, including any amount previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income, is recognised in profit or loss. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Financial liabilities
The group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which it was acquired. 
Other than financial liabilities in a qualifying hedging relationship (see below), the group’s accounting policy for each category 
is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives (see financial assets for in-the-money derivatives) and contingent 
consideration. They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include the following items:
•	 Bank	bor r o wings	ar e	initially	r ec og nised	a t	fair	v alue	net	of	an y	tr ansac tion	c osts	dir ec tly	a ttr ibutable	t o	the	issue	of	the	
instrument. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the 
liability carried in the statement of financial position. Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and 
pr emiums	pa y able	on	r edemption,	as	w ell	as	an y	in t er est	or	c oupon	pa y able	while	the	liabilit y	is	outstanding;	
•	 T r ade	pa y ables	and	other	shor t -t er m	monetar y	liabilities ,	which	ar e	initially	r ec og nised	a t	fair	v alue	and	subsequen tly	car r ied	
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair value measurement hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value 
using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement (see note 19). 
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
(a)	 quot ed	pr ic es	(unadjust ed)	in	ac tiv e	mar kets	f or	iden tical	assets	or	liabilities	(L ev el	1);
(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
pr ic es)	or	indir ec tly	(i.e .	der iv ed	fr om	pr ic es)	(L ev el	2);	and
(c) inputs from the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the basis 
of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in 
their entirety into only one of the three levels.
Hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates certain derivatives as either:
•	 Hedges	of	in t er est	r a t e	and	f or eig n	cur r enc y	cash	flo w	r isk	associa t ed	with	a	r ec og nised	asset	or	liabilit y	or	a	highly	pr obable	
f or ecast	tr ansac tion	(cash	flo w	hedge);	or
•	 Hedges	of	a	net	in v estmen t	in	a	f or eig n	oper a tion	(net	in v estmen t	hedge).
The group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as 
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.

Hedge accounting (continued)
The fair values of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 20. Movements on the hedging reserve 
in shareholders’ equity are shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current 
asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow 
hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the 
asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity 
are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a 
liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects 
net profit or loss.
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation 
Where the group has foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign operations arising from 
movements in the forward exchange rate, to the extent that the hedge is effective, gains and losses arising on the foreign 
currency borrowings are recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion of such hedges is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Pension contributions
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred. The group has no defined benefit arrangements in place.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, that is, share options and warrants. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of a trinomial lattice model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the group’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s 
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting 
the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the amount that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options and warrants granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether 
the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
The group has applied the exemption available under IFRS 2, to apply its provisions only to those options and warrants granted 
after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 1 January 2006. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Leased assets
Leases for which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets 
held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected 
useful lives. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. 
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant 
proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease. The capital 
element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives. The amortisation expense is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other 
contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see 
section related to critical estimates and judgements below).
The significant intangibles recognised by the group, their estimated useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the 
cost of intangibles acquired in business combinations are as follows:
Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life Valuation method
Software distribution agreements 5-9 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed
Contractual customer relationships 5-15 years Estimated discounted cash flow
Intellectual property rights 6-10 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed
Internally generated intangible assets (research and development costs)
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-generated 
intangible asset arising from the group’s software development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
•	 it	is	t echnically	f easible	t o	dev elop	the	pr oduc t	f or	it	t o	be	sold;
•	 adequa t e	r esour c es	ar e	a v ailable	t o	c omplet e	the	dev elopmen t;
•	 ther e	is	an	in t en tion	t o	c omplet e	and	sell	the	pr oduc t;
•	 the	g r oup	is	able	t o	sell	the	pr oduc t;
•	 sale	of	the	pr oduc t	will	gener a t e	futur e	ec onomic	benefits;	and
•	 expenditur e	on	the	pr ojec t	can	be	measur ed	r eliably .
The expenditure capitalised represents the cost of direct labour incurred in developing the software product. 
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives commencing from the date of first 
income recognition. The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between three and 
seven years. The amortisation expense is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. Where 
no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on intangible assets and other 
temporary differences recognised in business combinations.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
•	 the	same	taxable	g r oup	c ompan y ;	or
•	 diff er en t	g r oup	en tities	which	in t end	either	t o	settle	cur r en t	tax	assets	and	liabilities	on	a	net	basis ,	or	t o	r ealise	the	assets	
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are expected to be settled or recovered.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its 
purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable 
costs of bringing the asset into use.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset 
concerned, the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each 
reporting date. The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
•	 L ong	leasehold	buildings	 P er iod	of	lease
•	 L easehold	impr o v emen ts	 P er iod	of	lease
•	 P lan t,	fix tur es	and	equipmen t	 T hr ee	t o	fiv e	y ears
•	 M ot or	v ehicles	 F our	y ears
Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where impairment in value is deemed to 
have occurred. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The group considers all highly liquid investments with 
original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the group’s cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Employee share ownership plans
As the company is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the 
group accounts. The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the K3 Business Technology Group plc Share Incentive Plan 
are included in the financial statements. Until such time as the group’s own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the 
consideration paid for the shares is deducted in equity shareholders funds.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions 
are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and released to income statement where changes in circumstances indicate that a 
provision is no longer required.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
nature of the group’s business is such that there can be unpredictable variation and uncertainty regarding its business. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The key 
sources of estimation that have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
Valuation of intangibles acquired in business combinations
Determining the fair value of software distribution agreements and intellectual property rights acquired in business 
combinations requires estimation of the discounted royalty payments that would have to be paid to acquire the distribution 
agreement or intellectual property rights if it had not been acquired as part of the business combination. Determining the fair 
value of contractual customer relationships acquired in business combinations requires estimation of the value of the cashflows 
related to those relationships and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. More details including carrying 
values are included in note 11.

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Valuation of contingent consideration
When valuing the contingent consideration still payable on acquisitions, the group considers various factors including the 
performance of the acquired entity since acquisition together with its expected performance to the end of the earn-out period. 
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations, contingent consideration is recognised at, and carried 
thereafter at, fair value. All changes in fair value (other than measurement period adjustments) are reflected in the income 
statement. More details including carrying values are included in notes 16 and 17.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. An impairment review has been 
performed at the reporting date and no impairment has been identified. More details including carrying values are included in 
notes 11 and 12.
Useful economic lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful economic lives. Useful lives 
are based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed 
for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in changes in the carrying values and hence amounts charged 
to the income statement in particular periods which, in the case of intangible assets, could be significant. More details including 
carrying values are included in notes 10 and 11.
Capitalised development expenditure and subsequent amortisation
Where such expenditure meets the relevant criteria the group is required to capitalise development expenditure. In order to assess 
whether the criteria is met the Board is required to make estimates in relation to likely income generation and financial and technical 
viability of the relevant development projects and the period over which the group is likely to benefit from such expenditure.

5 Segment information
IFRS 8 requires identification of operating segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the entity’s 
chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’) in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. The CODM has 
been determined to be the Executive Directors as they are principally responsible for evaluating operating segment performance 
and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
As indicated in last year’s annual report, from 1 July 2011, the reporting of results reflects four trading divisions: Microsoft UK, 
International, SYSPRO and Sage, and Managed Services, together with Head Office costs. The comparatives for the year ended 
30 June 2011 have been restated accordingly. These five segments represent the group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8. Each 
reportable segment has a segment manager who is directly accountable to, and maintains regular contact with, the CODM.
Whilst there are several operating units within each reportable segment, the results of these operating units have been 
aggregated into one reportable segment as they exhibit similar economic characteristics and have one overall manager.
The Head Office segment comprises head office and other centrally incurred costs which are recharged to the units through a 
central management charge. 
The activities and products and services of the operating segments are detailed in the Business Review on pages 8 to 13.
The CODM primarily assesses the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted operating profit. This is a measure 
of divisional operating profit less an allocation of centrally incurred costs. Adjusted operating profit is profit before interest, tax, 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional costs and acquisition costs.
The segment results for the year ended 30 June 2012 and for the year ended 30 June 2011, reconciled to profit before taxation as 
included in the consolidated income statement, are as follows:

*Interest expense is reported net of interest income as this is how it is reported to the CODM. Interest income is not sufficiently 
material to disclose separately.
Segment assets and segment liabilities are reviewed by the CODM in a consolidated statement of financial position. Accordingly, 
this information is replicated in the group consolidated statement of financial position on page 31. As no measure of assets or 
liabilities for individual segments is reviewed regularly by the CODM, no disclosure of total assets or liabilities has been made, in 
accordance with the amendment to paragraph 23 of IFRS 8.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting 
policies. Transactions between segments are accounted for at cost.

Weighted average number of shares used in diluted EPS 28,920,682 26,282,120
Certain employee options and warrants have not been included in the calculation of diluted EPS because their exercise is 
contingent on the satisfaction of certain criteria that had not been met at the end of the period. 
The alternative earnings per share calculations have been computed because the directors consider that they are useful to 
shareholders and investors. These are based on the following profits and the above number of shares.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, derived from the present value of future 
cash flows generated by the CGUs. There are a number of assumptions and estimates involved in calculating the present value of 
the future cash flows, including but not restricted to the following:
•	 g r o wth	r a t es	applied	t o	pr ofit	fr om	oper a tions	used	as	the	basis	f or	the	futur e	cash	flo w s;
•	 the	disc oun t	r a t e	applied	t o	the	cash	flo w s	t o	calcula t e	their	pr esen t	v alue .
Although the directors are satisfied that the assumptions used are appropriate to the current circumstances of the group, 
changes to these key assumptions or estimates could significantly affect the result of the impairment calculation. The basis of the 
assumptions used is as follows:
•	 managemen t	estima t es	disc oun t	r a t es	using	pr e -tax	r a t es	tha t	r eflec t	cur r en t	mar ket	assessmen ts	of	the	time	v alue	of	
money and the risks specific to the business. The growth rates are based on management forecasts for the markets in which 
each CGU operates.

for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for future periods of between 5 and 14 years which is based on 
management’s assessment of the useful economic lives. In the 2 year period following the approved forecasts, growth rates 
of between 2.25% and 20% have been applied (except for the CGU relating to the small-systems division Hook). The Hook 
CGU relates to small systems and a gradual attrition of income is expected, although this is lower than in previous K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

12 Goodwill and impairment (continued)
forecasts due to the increase in CRM services now provided by the division. Hence an attrition rate of 5% has been applied. 
The most recent financial forecasts have been prepared on the assumption that gross margins will be consistent with those 
in 2012 and that overheads are in line with any changes in the level of revenues forecast. The growth rates are based on 
industry growth rates, management’s view of the observable markets as well as historical and estimated requirement by 
customers for the products and services.
•	 the	r a t e	used	t o	disc oun t	the	f or ecast	pr e -tax	cash	flo w s	is	10%	and	r epr esen ts	the	dir ec t ors ’ 	cur r en t	best	estima t e	of	the	
weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”).
As a result of the impairment testing carried out on the basis of these estimates and assumptions, no impairment provisions are 
considered necessary.

The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value at 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011.
Of the above, trade receivables of £0.59m (2011: £nil) and accrued income of £0.10m (2011: £0.27m) is due after more than one year.
The group is exposed to credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers. The group has over 3,100 customers 
spread across various industries, although predominantly in the retail sector, manufacturing and distribution sectors, and hence 
the concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse customer base. The group assesses the credit rating for 
new customers to minimise the credit risk. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are made based on management’s objective 
assessment of the risk taking into account the age of the debt and items considered to be in dispute with customers. Given that 
the large number of customers limits the concentration of credit risk, the directors consider that no further credit provision is 
required other than the provision for impairment of £1.16m (2011: £0.82m). K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

As at 30 June 2012 trade receivables of £6.09m (2011: £8.84m) were past due but not impaired. They relate to the customers against 
whom no provision is considered necessary. The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows:

As at 30 June 2012 trade receivables of £1.16m (2011: £0.82m) were past due, impaired and provided against. There are no 
individually significant receivables included within this provision. The group takes a prudent view in assessing the risk of non-
payment and considers provision for all debts more than 3 months in arrears unless there are specific circumstances to indicate 
that there is little or no risk of non-payment of these older debts.
The carrying amounts of the group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

In September 2012 the Group agreed the extension of existing facilities through to December 2013 on the same terms with further 
facilities of up to £2.0m committed and a further £3.0m over the course of the facility period available to fund acquisitions.
Finance lease creditors are secured on the assets to which they relate.
£0.24m of the sterling bank loans at 30 June 2012 (2011: £1.97m) are covered by an interest rate collar which reduces the group’s 
exposure to movements in interest rates. The maximum underlying LIBOR interest rate to which the group is exposed on this 
loan	is	5.75%;	the	minimum	is	4.75%	(see	not e	20).

Bank borrowings
The bank loans are secured by a fixed charge over the group’s long leasehold property and floating charges over the remaining 
assets of the group.
The group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 30 June 2012 of £2.93m (2011: £4.3m) for which all 
conditions have been met. It is a Revolving Credit Facility on which interest is charged at a floating rate linked to LIBOR and, 
following the renegotiation since the year end, now expires in December 2013.

Risk management
The group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks:
• Market price risk
 – Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk
 – Foreign currency risk
• Liquidity risk
•	 Cr edit	r isk
Policy for managing these risks is set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Finance Officer. Certain risks 
are managed centrally, while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre. The policy for 
each of the above risks is described in more detail below. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented 
throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes from previous periods in the group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its 
objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or methods used to measure them.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the group, from which financial risk arises, are as follows:
•	 T r ade	r ec eiv ables
•	 C ash	a t	bank
•	 T r ade	and	other	pa y ables
•	 F loa ting-r a t e	bank	loans
•	 L oans	fr om	r ela t ed	par ties
•	 I n t er est	r a t e	c ollars
•	 F or w ar d	cur r enc y	c on tr ac ts .
Market risk
Market risk arises from the group’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that 
the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), 
foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk
The group has fixed interest loans in respect of finance leases with a net book value of £0.01m (2011: £0.05m) and loans from 
related parties of £0.64m (2011: £0.64m). The fixed rates applicable are 19% and 8.5% respectively.
Bank debt totalling £15.05m (2011: £14.91m) is held under floating rates linked to monthly LIBOR and EURIBOR. The group makes 
use of interest rate collar arrangements to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR. As at 30 June 2012, 2% (2011: 13%) of 
outstanding bank debt was covered by these arrangements.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the group has operations located in Europe whose functional currency is not the same 
as the group’s primary functional currency (sterling). The net assets from overseas operations are exposed to currency risk 
giving rise to gains or losses on retranslation into sterling. The group has hedged its net investments in overseas operations by 
denominating a proportion of its bank loans in Euros so that the cash flow risk created from such hedging techniques reduces 
the volatility in consolidated net assets.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when individual group operations enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than 
their functional currency. It is group policy that such transactions should be hedged by entering into forward contracts where 
it is considered the risk to the group is significant. This policy is managed centrally by group treasury entering into a matching 
forward contract with a reputable bank.
It is group policy that transactions between group entities are always denominated in the selling entity’s functional currency 
thereby giving rise to foreign exchange risk in the income statement of both the purchasing group entity and the group. No 
external hedge is entered into as there is no exposure to consolidated net assets from intra-group transactions.
Other market price risk
Where the group has generated a significant amount of surplus cash it invests in money market over-night deposits. The 
directors believe that the exposure to market price risk from this activity is acceptable in the group’s circumstances.
Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk of each group entity is managed centrally by the group treasury function comparing to budgets and 
quarterly forecasts. 
All surplus cash is held centrally to maximise the returns on deposits through economies of scale. The type of cash instrument 
used and its maturity date will depend on the group’s forecast cash requirements. The group maintains a revolving credit facility 
with a major banking corporation to manage any unexpected short-term cash shortfalls. The facilities from the Group’s bankers 
require the Group to meet certain covenants throughout the term of the loans and the group’s forecasts indicate that the group 
will remain within the set parameters.
The principle terms of the group’s borrowings are set out in note 17.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the group. The 
group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new 
customers before entering contracts. Such credit ratings, taking into account local business practices, are then factored into any 
contractual arrangements.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer. The carrying amount of financial assets 
recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.

Capital disclosures
The group monitors “adjusted capital” which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, retained 
earnings and other reserves) other than amounts in the cashflow hedging reserve and the translation reserve. Other reserves 
comprise a merger relief reserve.

Less:  amounts in cashflow hedging reserve – 85
 amounts in translation reserve (753) (1,730)
  46,193 35,597
The group’s objective when maintaining capital is to safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it 
can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order to maintain the capital structure, 
the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell 
assets to reduce debt.
Sensitivity analysis
Whilst the group takes steps to minimise its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as described above, 
changes in interest and foreign exchange rates will have an impact on profit.
The directors consider a 0.5% movement in the interest rate to be reasonably possible as at the reporting date. Excluding the 
impact of the interest rate collar, the annualised effect of a 0.5% increase or decrease in the interest rate at the reporting date on 
the variable rate debt carried at that date would, all other variables being held constant, in the directors’ opinion, be immaterial. 
The group’s foreign exchange risk is dependent on the movement in the Euro to sterling exchange rate. The directors consider a 
1% movement in the Euro rate to be reasonably possible as at the reporting date. The effect of a 1% strengthening or weakening 
in the Euro against sterling at the balance sheet date on the Euro denominated debt at the date and on the annualised interest 
on that amount would, all other variables being held constant, in the directors’ opinion, be immaterial.

Interest rate collar
The Group had interest rate collar arrangements which expired on 31 August 2012 under which the floating LIBOR rate is capped 
at 5.75% with a floor at 4.75%. At 30 June 2012 the notional principal amount under the Group’s interest rate collar was £0.24m 
(2011: £1.97m).
Losses recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity (note 23) on the interest collar as of 30 June 2012 will be released to 
the income statement until the repayment of existing borrowings is complete.
Since the adoption of hedge accounting, given that the hedges are deemed to be highly effective, changes in the fair values of 
the collar have been taken to the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Prior to the adoption of hedge accounting changes in the fair 
values of the collar were included in financial income and expense in the income statement.
Forward foreign exchange contract
The notional principal amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 June 2012 was £nil (2011: £0.29m). The 
hedged highly probable forecast transaction denominated in foreign currency was expected to occur within one month of the 
period end. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity (note 23) on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 
the period end are recognised in the income statement in the period during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the 
income statement.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity
The group has Euro denominated borrowing amounting to £2.47m (2011: £4.13m) which is designated as a hedge of the net 
assets in the Group’s Dutch subsidiary K3 Business Solutions BV. The fair value of the borrowing at 30 June 2012 was £2.47m 
(2011: £4.09m). The foreign exchange loss of £0.23m on translation of the borrowing to the presentational currency at the 
reporting date is recognised in the Translation reserve (note 23).
21 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 24% (2011: 26%).

Finance leases
The group leases a small proportion of its office equipment and leasehold improvements (net carrying value £nil). Such assets 
are generally classified as finance leases as the rental period approximates to the estimated useful economic life of the assets 
concerned and often the group has the right to purchase the assets outright at the end of the minimum lease term by paying a 
nominal amount.
Future lease payments are due as follows:

With the exception of the property in Manchester, the group leases all of its properties. The terms of property leases vary, 
although they all tend to be tenant repairing with rent reviews every 2 to 5 years and many have break clauses. In addition, the 
group leases the majority of its motor vehicles which are generally 3 year contracts.

The group operates a defined contribution scheme and also makes contributions to personal pension schemes of certain senior 
employees and directors.
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes in period to 30 June 2012 are £0.70m (2011: £0.56m).
26 Share-based payments
As disclosed in note 22, K3 Business Technology Group plc operates an equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme for 
employees: an Executive Share Option Scheme for certain senior management including executive directors. Under the scheme 
there are two types of share options: those where the options vest based on the achievement of a share price target and those 
where the options vest on the achievement of target growth in adjusted earnings per share, i.e. adjusted for amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, cost of share-based payments and exceptional items and with the tax charge being 30% of the operating 
profit so adjusted. All options are subject to the employee having completed three years service from the date of grant.

The exercise price of options outstanding at the end of the period ranged between 62.5p and 117.5p (2011: 62.5p and 165.5p) and 
their weighted average contractual life was 4.44 years (2011: 4.45 years). 
Of the total number of options outstanding at the end of the period, 368,001 (2011: 368,001) had vested and were exercisable at the 
end of the period at an average exercise price of 88.25p (2011: 88.25p).

average weekly share prices since 1 January 2004.
Where the options vest on the achievement of a share price target, to allow for the effects of early exercise it was assumed that 
executive directors will exercise the options after the vesting date when the share price is 25% higher than the target share price 
and that other employees will exercise when the target share price is achieved.

and is included in accruals (2011: £14,000). In connection with the loan, the company issued 200,000 warrants for ordinary shares of 
25p. These are exercisable at £0.90 and until the date upon which the loan is repaid. As the loan remains outstanding, the warrants 
remain exercisable. In addition, 500,000 warrants for ordinary shares of 25p each were issued to CA Fastigheter AB during 2007 in 
recognition of the reduction in its security following the increase in borrowings from the bank to fund the acquisition of McGuffie 
Brunton Limited. The warrants are exercisable at 123.5p and until the loan is repaid upon meeting the following conditions: 300,000 
of	 the	 w ar r an ts	 ar e	 ex er cisable	 when	 the	 c ompan y ’ s	 shar e	 pr ic e	 r eaches	 £2.50;	 100,000	 ar e	 ex er cisable	 when	 it	 r eaches	 £3.25;	
100,000 have no conditions attached to them. 
On 23 June 2005 the company received a loan of £1m from Johan and Marianne Claesson AB, a company connected with  
Mr PJ Claesson, a director of the company. The loan was made in connection with the acquisition of Information Engineering Group 
Limited in June 2005 and was repaid during 2005. In connection with the loan, the company issued 400,000 warrants for ordinary 
shares of 25p. These are exercisable at an exercise price of £0.90. The warrants are exercisable until the date on which the loan due to 
CA Fastigheter AB is repaid.
On 29 July 2008 Mr DJ Bolton was appointed a non-executive director of Dawson International Plc, a company connected with  
Mr PJ Claesson, a director of the Company. During the year ended 30 June 2011, the Company charged fees to Dawson International 
Plc for the services provided by Mr Bolton of £17,000, of which £nil was outstanding at the year-end. There were no transactions 
during the year ended 30 June 2012.

31 Notes to the cash flow statement
Cash generated from operations is stated after payments to regularise liabilities that were significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at the date of acquiring companies, that the directors consider to be a cost of acquisition. In 
addition, cash flows from operations include acquisition costs and exceptional reorganisation costs arising as a result of 
acquisitions during the year. The adjusted cash generated from operations has been computed because the directors consider it 
more useful to shareholders and investors in assessing the underlying operating cash flow of the Group. The adjusted cash 
generated from operations is calculated as follows:

1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the 
preceding period.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom accounting standards. 
Intangible assets – goodwill
The group has previously hived up the trade and assets of a subsidiary undertaking into the parent undertaking at book 
value. This results in the investment in a subsidiary which has no trade and hence provision would normally be made against 
that investment under UK GAAP . The company has however transferred an amount equal to the accounting impairment from 
investments to goodwill. The Board feels that this more accurately reflects the fact that in substance there has been no loss of 
value to the company. Had the investment been written down in strict accordance with UK GAAP , this would have resulted in 
a provision, in the parent undertaking only, of £883,000 (2011: £1,104,000) which is now being amortised over the remaining 
useful economic life of five years. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of trade and assets is the difference between the value of the consideration paid and the 
value of the net assets acquired. It is amortised over the period during which the company is expected to benefit, which is 
between 9 to 10 years. Provision is made for any impairment.
Intangible assets – research and development
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development expenditure is also written off, except where the directors are 
satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In such cases, the identifiable expenditure is 
deferred and amortised over the period during which the company is expected to benefit. This period is between three and six 
years. Provision is made for any impairment. The directors do not consider the capitalised development costs are a realised loss as 
their carry forward is justifiable under the provisions of SSAP 13.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all 
tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, 
as follows:
Leasehold improvements Period of lease
Plant and machinery, office equipment and fixtures 20-33% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the 
higher of realisable value and value in use. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012
92
Notes forming part of the  
Company Financial Statements (continued)

1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements (continued)
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment except for foreign currency investments where the 
company has applied net investment hedging. Where net investment hedging is applied, the revaluation is recorded in reserves. 
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is 
measured either by reference to the nominal value or the fair value of the shares where appropriate. Any premium is ignored 
when the nominal value is used. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that resulted in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the group’s taxable profits and its results as 
stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from 
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Turnover
Turnover is calculated net of value added tax and represents the total amount receivable by the company in respect of the sale 
of software licences, customised software, hardware and fees derived from installation, consultancy, training and support.
Income on the sale of software licences is recognised where there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with a customer 
(contract and/or binding purchase order), delivery of the software has taken place, collectability is probable and the fee is 
fixed and determinable. If significant post-delivery obligations exist, income is deferred until no significant obligations remain. 
Income on the sale of customised software, hardware and installation is recognised on delivery to a customer or on completion 
of contractual milestones. Income from training and consultancy is recognised as the contract progresses. Income from support 
is generally invoiced in advance, termed “deferred revenue” , and taken to income in equal monthly instalments over the 
relevant period. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other
1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements (continued)
Pension costs
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other 
post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward 
contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Where the company enters into foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries 
arising from movements in the forward exchange rate, gains and losses arising on the foreign currency borrowings are 
recognised directly in equity. 
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to 
owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful 
lives. The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the 
profit and loss account over the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the 
prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
Share-based payment
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the profit and 
loss account over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting 
period is based on the amount that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options 
granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting 
conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
When the terms and conditions of the options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, 
measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the profit and loss account over the remaining 
vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of a trinomial lattice model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the 
directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.  K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
Please refer to notes 6 to 19 relating to entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the appointment of proxies.
1. Mr DJ Bolton was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company in August 1998. Biographical details of Mr DJ Bolton 
are set out on page 27 to these financial statements.
2. The payment of a dividend requires approval of the shareholders and that approval is sought in Resolution 4.
3. Resolution 5 would empower the directors to allot shares for any reason up to an aggregate nominal amount of £2,373,486 
representing approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of the notice of Annual 
General Meeting. 
4. Resolution 6 would empower the directors to allot equity securities for cash other than to existing shareholders pro rata 
to their existing holdings. Such power would be limited to the situations referred to in sub-paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 of that 
resolution. Sub-paragraph 6.1 refers to rights issues and similar issues, where difficulties arise in offering relevant securities 
to certain overseas shareholders or where fractional entitlements arise. Sub-paragraph 6.2 permits allotments for cash (other 
than rights issues or similar) of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £712,046 representing approximately 
one-tenth of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The resolution is proposed so as to give the directors 
greater flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. The directors have no present intention of 
exercising the authority.
5. Resolution 7 seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own ordinary shares and is proposed as a 
special resolution. If passed, the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 4,269,427 of its ordinary 
shares, representing approximately 14.99 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) 
as at 24 October 2012. The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any ordinary 
shares purchased under this authority. The authority will expire on the earlier of the Company’s 2013 annual general 
meeting and the date 15 months after the resolution.
 The directors will only exercise the authority to purchase ordinary shares where they consider that such purchases will be in 
the best interests of shareholders generally and will result in an increase in earnings per ordinary share.
 The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and 
subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury or cancel them).
6. On a show of hands every shareholder present in person has one vote, on a poll every shareholder has one vote for each 
share held by him. The necessary quorum at this meeting is two members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote 
upon the business to be transacted.
7. The Company specifies that only those members registered on the Company’s register of members at:
	 •	 6.00pm	on	3	D ec ember	2012;	or ,
	 •	 if	this	M eeting	is	adjour ned ,	a t	6.00pm	on	the	da y	t w o	da y s	pr ior	t o	the	adjour ned	meeting ,

Issued shares and total voting rights
8. As at 5.00pm on 24 October 2012, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 28,481,841 ordinary shares of 25 pence 
each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number 
of voting rights in the Company as at 5.00pm on 24 October 2012 is 28,481,841.
Documents on display
9. The following documents will be available for inspection at Baltimore House, 50 Kansas Avenue, Manchester M50 2GL from 
the date of the notice of the Annual General Meeting until the time of the Meeting and for at least 15 minutes prior to the 
Meeting and during the Meeting:

Appointment of proxies
10. If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 7 above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all 
or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the Meeting and you should have received a proxy form with this notice of 
meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
11. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting to represent you. Details of how to 
appoint the Chairman of the Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the 
proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy 
(not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
12. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. 
You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. Further copies of this form may be 
obtained by photocopying this form. Please indicate in the box next to the proxy’s name the number of shares in relation to 
which he/she is authorised to act as your proxy. Please also indicate by ticking the box provided if the proxy instruction is 
one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned in the same envelope. 
13. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against 
the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy 
will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting.
Appointment of proxy using hard copy proxy form
14. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
 To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:
	 •	 c omplet ed	and	sig ned;
	 •	 sen t	t o	C apita	R eg istr ars ,	P XS,	34	B eckenham	R oad ,	B eckenham,	Ken t	BR3	4TU	or	deliv er ed	t o	C apita	R eg istr ars	a t

	 •	 r ec eiv ed	b y	C apita	R eg istr ars	no	la t er	than	10.30am	on	3	D ec ember	2012.
In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf 
by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or 
authority) must be included with the proxy form. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Proxy voting using the Registrar’s share portal
15. You may also submit your proxy vote electronically using the Share Portal service at www.capitashareportal.com. If not 
already registered for the Share Portal, you will need your Investor Code as shown on a recent dividend tax voucher or recent 
share certificate. For an electronic proxy vote to be valid, your appointment must be received by no later than 10:30am on  
3 December 2012.
CREST proxy voting (uncertificated shareholders)
16. (a) CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members 
and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
 (b) In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’ (formerly 
CRESTCo’s) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. 
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given 
to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuers’ agent (ID 
RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice. For this purpose, the time of receipt will 
be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this 
time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through 
other means. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal 
system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility 
of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or 
has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
Appointment of proxy by joint members
17. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint 
holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior). K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012
112
Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
Changing proxy instructions
18. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the method set out above. Note that the 
cut - off	time	f or	r ec eipt	of	pr o x y	appoin tmen ts	(see	abo v e)	also	apply	in	r ela tion	t o	amended	instruc tions;	an y	amended	
proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.
Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another 
hard-copy proxy form, please contact Capita Registrars on 0871 664 0300. Calls cost 10 pence per minute plus network 
extras. Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of 
proxies will take precedence. If the Company is unable to determine which of more than one valid proxy appointment was 
deposited or delivered last in time, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the share(s) to which they relate.
Termination of proxy appointments
19. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly 
stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent 
BR3 4TU. In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal 
or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other

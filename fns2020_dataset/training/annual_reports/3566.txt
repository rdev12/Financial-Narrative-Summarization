2 Clarity Commerce Solutions plc
“We have made significant progress during the last
12 months, our fourth successive year of profit and overall
growth. Revenues from existing customers represent 92% of
the Group’s total revenue, which is a strong endorsement of
the product quality and service excellence that we offer. ” 
John O’Connell, Non-Executive Chairman
“During the year there has been a
series of strategic developments
including the Baron acquisition and
the replacement of the Ticketing
system. We are particularly excited by
the Sodexho opportunity, which will
accelerate our entry into new market
sectors. The increase in recurring
revenues also provides the Group with
increased forward visibility.
Furthermore, acquisitions completed
over the last few years continue to be
integrated, and are yielding significant
benefits across the Group. ”

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 5
clarity clients I am delighted to report on another
successful year for Clarity Commerce
Solutions. There has been continued
improvement in financial performance,
with sales having increased by 22% to
£16.3m (2004: £13.3m) for the year
ended 31 March 2005. Gross profit
accelerated by 23% to £10.16m (2004:
£8.27m) in the same period. Adjusted
basic earnings per ordinary share were
4.03p (2004: 4.1p).
Profit before goodwill impairment and
taxation was £763k (2004: £744k), including
a total research and development cost of
£1.6m (2004: £1m), heavily focused on the
replacement of our Ticketing system
solution. It is pleasing to note that the year
ended 31 March 2005 was the fourth
successive year of profitability and growth.
During the year there has also been a series
of strategic developments, which position
the business strongly for ongoing profitable
growth.
Revenues from existing customers
represented 92% of the Group's total
revenue. Recurring revenue was £6.8m
representing 42% of the total (2004: £5.6m;
42%). The Group expects these recurring
revenues to increase over time and provide
enhanced visibility for future revenues.
Acquisitions and integration
In October 2004, Clarity acquired Baron
LRMS, a company focused on solutions for
leisure resorts. Its software, installed in
hotels and resorts, includes specialist
functionality for club membership
management, golf courses and health spas,
adding further depth to our leisure sector
offering. Baron was the Group's sixth
acquisition since listing on AIM in July 2000.
This last year has culminated in the
continuing integration of the acquisitions
made to date and the increasing realisation
of value as Clarity benefits from significant
cross-selling benefits and the ability to more
rapidly access new market sectors.
During the last year, we have focused on
the integration and enhancement of our
software product portfolio. Clarity now
chairman’s statement
John O’Connell, Non-Executive Chairman
John was founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Staffware plc, the leading independent global workflow and
business process management (BPM) software company. He is a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants
(FCCA) and is recognised as one of Europe’s top IT entrepreneurs. 
6 Clarity Commerce Solutions plc provides a fully integrated solution for all
the business requirements of our hospitality,
ticketing and leisure sector customers. This
approach has already delivered sales, such
as the installation for Bracknell Forest
Borough Council, which incorporates Clarity
leisure software and smartcard systems
alongside our hospitality and retail software.
Strategy 
We are committed to delivering organic
growth using the Group's existing software
portfolio, based around our flagship
software solution, Clarity Central. Future
offerings will be based on the Microsoft
.NET development platform, helping us to
integrate solutions from additional
acquisitions and enabling the Group to
enter new market sectors and drive future
growth. The Group will continue to extend
its global footprint via direct and indirect
sales channels.
Geographic markets
UK business continues to dominate the
Group's revenue, comprising 75% of this
(2004: 81%). Notable UK successes include
the YO! Sushi restaurant contract, an
installation of Clarity Central to support over
400 Greene King pubs, a six-month Foreign
Office support services contract, further
penetration in the local authority sector,
and private sector contracts such as
London's Reebok Sports Club.
The acquisition of Baron extends the
Group's global reach, with clients such as
Jumeirah International in the Middle East.
Clarity's international sales have increased
both through our local offices and the
establishment of reseller partners in local
markets, and the Group has customers in
over 20 countries. In North America, there
has been a concerted effort to penetrate
the market for ticketing and entertainment
management software, together with
progress in the attractions and theme parks
sector. Our European office has also been
focused on growth in the existing cinema
marketplace, announcing a new
maintenance and support contract in April
2005 with cinema operator EuroPalaces,
worth €2.4m over 3 years.
Dividend policy
No dividend is recommended for this year, as
the Board has reaffirmed its dividend policy
that capital should be allocated to developing
products and driving future growth.
chairman’s statement
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 7 Board changes
I was delighted to accept the Board's
invitation to become Chairman with effect
from 7 April 2005. I look forward to
leveraging my experience in growing a
successful listed UK based software business
internationally, having been founder, CEO
and Chairman of Staffware plc, and to
helping the Board achieve the Group's
potential as a leader in its chosen markets.
Bob Morton stepped down as Chairman
this year, having been a key figure in
steering the Company through its early
phases of development. The Board, on
behalf of its shareholders, is extremely
grateful for his invaluable contribution in
these formative years.
David Shearmon, one of the founding
Directors of Clarity, has indicated his
intention to step down from his Board role
effective as of the AGM on 25 August, 2005.
I am very pleased to report that David has
expressed his willingness to continue with
the Group in a strategic and advisory role,
for which we are very appreciative.
Outlook
Clarity now offers world class software,
business intelligence solutions and IT
support services to the entertainment,
leisure and retail sectors. 
The Group is strongly positioned to
capitalise on the converging market for
entertainment software. Prospects in terms
of new business opportunities are high, due
in part to the fact that we have blue-chip
customers in Europe, the Middle East and
the US, who can provide reference points
for new customers and in so doing, help
drive further organic growth in these
markets. 
The Board will also seek to continue
generating growth through acquisition,
building on its experience of successful
integration of acquisitions over the last four
years. 
My colleagues and I are confident that the
progress reported here for last year in terms
of increased revenue and profits can be
sustained, based upon our current reading
of our markets, competitive position and
business environment generally.
John O'Connell
Group Non-Executive Chairman 
chairman’s statement
8 Clarity Commerce Solutions plc
Some of the facilities at The Reebok Sports
Club London, a Clarity software user Overview
Clarity is well on the way to achieving our
goal of being a major supplier to the leisure
industry worldwide. Our solutions span the
entertainment, leisure and retail sectors,
where we are building a reputation for our
expertise in software, business intelligence
solutions and IT support services. 
The Group is continuing to expand its
international sales network.  Sales are
increasing in the US and Europe, as well as
in the Middle East and other markets
through our growing network of reseller
partners. Furthermore, our offices in each
country are being equipped and developed
as sales outlets for the wider Clarity
portfolio, to ensure that international sales
opportunities are maximised.  The
geographical split of revenues in 2005 was
as follows:
- 75% to the UK (2004: 81%); 
- 13% to the rest of Europe (2004: 13%);
- 11% to the US (2004: 6%); and
- 1% elsewhere (2004: nil).
One of the central drivers of this success has
been our commitment to integration,
structurally as well as in our approach to
product development. We expect this
integration to add value through improved
processes and reduced costs of delivery.
In terms of our products, we are integrating
our existing software portfolio, based
around Clarity Central, and adopting
Microsoft's .NET software development
platform, as the basis for all new offerings.
This integration is a palpable source of
competitive advantage. 
This year has demonstrated clear evidence
of the benefits of cross trading across our
divisions and market sectors, including:
- Completion of an integrated hospitality
and ticketing solution, already attracting
significant interest from cinema chains. 
- Delivery of innovative solutions to local
authorities in Bracknell and Bolton,
which combine state-of-the-art
smartcard technology with point of sale
(POS) and leisure management systems. 
- Increasing recognition of the value of
our Business Intelligence division's
solutions, as witnessed by orders from
Serco Leisure and other leisure
management customers. 
- Integration of hospitality services with
our dedicated Services division.
2005 has been an exciting year for Clarity, with a series of key developments which
position the business as a leading supplier to the global leisure industry, harness
value from previous acquisitions and open up exciting sales opportunities. Our
financial performance shows a significant increase in revenues through organic
growth as well as through the acquisition of Baron LRMS, and we are in an excellent
position to increase profitability through further penetration of the growth market
sectors on which we are focusing.
chief executive’s statement
Graham York, Chief Executive
Graham has a background in the business development of software products, both in this country and abroad. His experience
includes product design, adaptation of software to new markets, and marketing. He has also acted as a Director of two leisure groups
and worked for a number of years as a journalist. The founder of Clarity, he led the development of the original software portfolio. 
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 9 Research and development
Clarity remains committed to product
development, which is underlined by our
£1.6m investment over the year in software
development and quality assurance work.
During the period, a dedicated Research
and Development department was
established which has made substantial
progress in integrating the Group's portfolio
of solutions around Clarity Central, based on
Microsoft's .NET platform. The .NET platform
offers major advantages to Clarity and its
customers and is contributing to a healthy
prospect list for our software products.  
Clarity's first .NET solutions are now installed
with clients including YO! Sushi restaurants
in the UK and Paramount Parks in the US.
A few months ago we announced our
intention to deliver a .NET-based ticketing
solution, and now Cinemagic has become
our first Ticketing division client to go live
with this software.
Market sectors and operations review
Clarity's sales increasingly combine
elements of software systems, business
intelligence solutions and IT support
services in broad ranging customer
solutions. 
Software
Clarity's markets can broadly be defined as
the hospitality, ticketing and leisure sectors.
Regardless of the specific sector where our
software is installed, the benefits are
constant - savings through operational and
management efficiencies, revenue
generation through innovative bookings
systems, increased control by corporate
management and improved customer
service levels.
The Group provides hospitality clients,
including major UK bar and restaurant
groups, with transactional systems covering
everything from electronic point of sale
(EPOS) and staff and cash management at
site level, to head office control systems.
Clients include many leading industry
names such as Greene King, Hall &
Woodhouse Brewery, Strada and YO! Sushi. 
In terms of ticketing clients, Clarity has a
very strong presence in the UK and Europe,
with 4 of the top 5 cinema operators using
our software. Ticketing solutions encompass
venue management, operation of box
offices and driving sales via the internet and
other third party channels. Clients include
Odeon, Cine UK, UCI and EuroPalaces (Pathe
and Gaumont). 
Recent sales to theme parks including
Paramount Parks in the U.S.A. underline the
potential for sales to non-cinema attractions
such as stadiums, attractions and
performance venues. Cinemagic, a U.S.
operator of stadium style theatres, became
the first cinema customer for Clarity's .NET
ticketing software (together with Clarity
POS software) in May 2005.
chief executive’s statement
10 Clarity Commerce Solutions plc chief executive’s statement
Leisure software clients include a diverse
range of operators seeking membership,
bookings and facilities management
systems, again with a strong focus on head
office control via a central platform. Clarity
continues to be a leading provider to the
public sector, with Birmingham City Council
and Serco Leisure running Clarity software
in 60 and 50 sites respectively. Our
innovative smartcard and internet bookings
solutions put us in a strong position to
capitalise on the growth potential of this
sector.
Clarity's leisure market presence has been
extended with the acquisition of Baron
LRMS in October 2004. Baron is an
established software supplier to hotels and
leisure resorts, with strong membership
management features and dedicated
applications for golf courses and health
spas. This has brought a prestigious private
sector client list on-board, with the addition
of names such as Gleneagles, St Andrews,
the Reebok Sports Club (London) and
Jumeirah International, the Middle East's
leading hotel company. Clarity is driving
software sales through an active reseller
partner programme, and is achieving
notable sales success in Spain following the
development of a Spanish language
solution.
Business Intelligence 
Clarity's Business Intelligence offering
follows the March 2003 acquisition of
Romulus Enterprises. Sales continue to
increase, with independent revenue streams
developing and standardised business
intelligence solutions for accounting, ERP
(Enterprise Resource Planning) and HR
(Human Resource) systems. Customers
operate in the Group's core hospitality,
ticketing and leisure markets, and
increasingly in the wider retail,
manufacturing, production and transport
sectors.
The integration of business intelligence
solutions to Clarity's core product has
attracted huge interest and growing sales
from existing Clarity clients in all sectors,
with several new contracts, including that
with Serco Leisure. This integrated offering
is proving a major sales feature in all
markets.
Clarity Business Intelligence division clients
include Robert Wiseman Dairies plc,
Raytheon Systems and JD Wetherspoon,
and the Group is now accredited to sell and
implement the Cognos Enterprise Planning
suite. The number and type of training
courses run in partnership with Cognos
have also been extended, with strong client
attendances driving additional revenues.
Services
Clarity acquired our Services division in
2003, offering helpdesk and training
services to support clients across the retail
and hospitality markets, as well as providing
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 11 support to Clarity's existing software clients.
It operates on a full-time, 24-hour basis and
provides support in five languages.  New
sales during the period include a one year
rolling contract to provide first level
helpdesk services to Warnaco for their 25
European Calvin Klein and Speedo retail
outlets, a contract supporting 600 network
connections for TFM's clients including
Travelodge, Officers Club, Co-op, Uniqlo and
H&M, and supporting 70 major Jarvis Hotels
on behalf of ATM, as well as multiple
contracts with Wincor Nixdorf.  
A six month Foreign Office contract
involved implementation and training
services to support Visa payment
processing software, with on-site training
delivered in 140 Visa offices, worldwide.
Further training contracts included
supporting a hotel software rollout for
Travelodge, providing training resources to
other major hotel groups including De Vere
and Hilton, and introducing new customer
booking software to staff from
approximately 500 Specsavers stores. 
We have recently announced that
BT Expedite, the retail software division of
BT, has awarded Clarity's Services division a
five year contract to the value of £2 million
for the provision of helpdesk services to one
of its major high street retail clients.
People 
Clarity has the benefit of a highly talented
and loyal workforce, delivering that rare
combination of new sales together with
improved customer service levels. The Board
would like to thank all members of our
team for their magnificent contribution to
the continued success of the Group.
The challenges of integration are also
generating opportunities to 'grow' people
into new roles, and we are helping and
training employees to seize these
opportunities. The move to integrate our
software based on the Microsoft .NET
platform demands a sharp learning curve
from our development team, to which we
have recruited a number of key new
members. For other staff there are equally
exciting challenges, with the shift from a
divisional focus to a much broader and
more integrated sales effort to maximise
cross-selling opportunities.
Clarity owes Bob Morton, who has
relinquished his role as Chairman, an
enormous debt of gratitude. He has
presided over a pivotal phase of the Group's
development, and remains an active
shareholder with a strong relationship with
the Board.
John O'Connell has been appointed as
Clarity's Non-Executive Chairman, and I
welcome his arrival. John was founder,
Chairman and CEO of Staffware plc. His
contacts and knowledge gained from the
successful development of Staffware and its
partner-based sales strategy will be of great
benefit to Clarity.
Finally, David Shearmon, one of the
founding Directors of Clarity, has indicated
his intention to step down from the Board.
He will continue in a strategic and advisory
role; functionally he will work with the CTO
and CEO on specific aspects of software
development and the technical implications
of acquisitions. 
David has been instrumental in helping the
Group achieve its aims, and the Board
would like to thank him for his dedication
chief executive’s statement
12 Clarity Commerce Solutions plc and loyalty over the past 12 years. These
changes to his circumstances are made
with the Board's support, and are designed
to satisfy the Board's continuing need for
David's abilities.
Summary
Clarity has achieved continued growth in
the past year, but more significantly I
believe, has made huge strides forward in
integrating and developing our products to
capitalise on our strengths and the
opportunities a converging market
presents. Our acquisitions have been
embedded in the business and are
performing increasingly well. New sales are
being generated on the basis of Clarity's
capability to provide broad ranging
solutions encompassing software, business
intelligence and IT services elements.
We have invested significant effort and
resources to migrate our software to the
Microsoft .NET platform, and this process
continues apace. The move to .NET will
stand us in excellent stead in the long term,
offering clear advantages to our clients as
we deliver next generation solutions that
take their business to new levels. Together
with this investment, we have a well-
established and dedicated team of people
that are relishing the prospect of
developing, selling and delivering such
innovative business solutions.
We continue to pursue our goal of
establishing Clarity as a leading IT supplier
to the global leisure industry, and look
forward to further growth in 2005/2006.

Notes to the Financial Statements 27 The Directors present their report together with the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Principal activities, review of business and future development
The principal activities of the Group are the provision of software solutions for ticketing, leisure, hospitality, business intelligence and support
services, with offices in the UK, US, France and Germany.
A review of the business of the Group and its future development is contained in the Group Chairman's Statement and the Group Chief
Executive's Statement on pages 6 to 13. On 29 October 2004 the entire share capital of Baron LRMS was acquired. Baron provide IT solutions
to the golf and spas marketplace. Details of the acquisition can be found in note 31.
Dividends
No interim dividend was proposed and the Directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend (2004: nil).
Research and development
At the year end the Group employed the services of 33 full time software developers. In the financial year ended 31 March 2005 the Group
incurred approximately £1,600,000 (2004: £1,000,000) in research and development expenditure, which has been written off to the profit and
loss account. The Group incurred 12 months expenditure in respect of the US based development team (2004: 8 months).
This development work, using the Microsoft .NET platform, will provide the Group and its clients with significant advantages. This step
change in our product, based on the use of Web Services, allows Clarity to offer a single, modular integrated solution that meets the needs
of its clients across all its market verticals.
The choice of a Web Services based approach provides the option to easily integrate with external systems and 3rd party products through
the use of integration standards such as XML.
In addition to the existing US development team, a new dedicated software development team has been formed at the new Basingstoke
office. Combined with the market and product experience of the existing staff and leading edge technical skills of the new staff, Clarity now
has the resources it needs to continue with its innovative research and development programme.

statement of directors’ responsibilities
20 Clarity Commerce Solutions plc Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders of Clarity Commerce Solutions plc
We have audited the financial statements of Clarity Commerce Solutions plc for the year ended 31 March 2005 which comprise the Profit
and Loss Account, the Balance Sheets, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Cash Flow Statement and the related notes.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the Company's Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards. It is our responsibility to audit the financial
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors' remuneration and transactions with the Company and Group is not disclosed.
We read other information contained within the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises only the Directors' Report, the Chairman's Statement and the Group Chief Executive’s Review. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. We are not required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or the risk and
control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company's and Group's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's and Group's affairs as at 31 March 2005 and of
the Group's profit for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The following accounting policies have been consistently applied in arriving at the consolidated financial information set out in
this report.
(a) Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance applicable
accounting standards.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the audited financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries made up to
31 March 2005. The acquisition method of accounting is used and the results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the
date of acquisition.
(c) Turnover and revenue recognition
Turnover, which excludes value added tax and sales between Group companies, represents amounts derived from the provision
of goods and services which fall within the Group's ordinary activities.
The Group derives its income from the following revenue streams; the sale of software licences, bespoke development projects
for clients and fees derived from support services, installation and training. Each sales stream is separately identifiable and treated
in the following manner:
Software Licences
Licence fees are recognised following delivery of software to the client.
Services
Revenue streams from installation, consultancy and training are recognised at the point at which the service or product is
delivered.
Software development
Revenue is recognised upon completion of the software project.
Maintenance income
Income is recognised evenly across the duration of the contractual period. 
(d) Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
The cost of tangible fixed assets less estimated residual value is written off using the reducing balance method at the following
annual rates:
Motor vehicles - 25% on reducing balance
Office equipment - 20 - 25% on reducing balance
Freehold property is depreciated on a straight line basis over 50 years.
notes to the financial statements
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 27 1 Accounting policies (continued)
(e) Software rights
Costs incurred in respect of software rights are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the software, which is
considered to be five years.
(f) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets of subsidiary undertakings at the date of acquisition
and their purchase price.
Goodwill is assumed to have an indefinite life and the financial statements therefore depart from the specific requirements of the
Companies Act 1985 schedule 4: 21 to amortise goodwill over a finite life in order to give a true and fair value. The departure is in
compliance with FRS10 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
In arriving at this policy the Directors consider a number of areas inclusive of the nature of the business, the durability of the
product range  and the continued expansive nature of the Group. Each acquisition is assessed with reference to the quality and
sustainability of the product range, the quality of the customer base and the potential for development and continuation of
long-term relationships and the ability to develop value for the Group across the product portfolio and network of offices.
Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable an impairment charge is reflected in the profit and loss account.
Impairment of goodwill is evaluated by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows, excluding finance and
tax (the "value in use"), to the carrying value of the underlying net assets and goodwill. If the net assets and goodwill were to
exceed the value in use, an impairment would have deemed to have occurred and the resultant write down in the goodwill
would be charged to the profit and loss account immediately.
The Directors have undertaken a detailed review of each area of the business and have as a result of this review concluded that
an impairment of goodwill has taken place. The resultant charge to the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2005
is £250,000 (2004: £233,000). This relates to the goodwill arising from the acquisition of Microtrain, the training and
implementation arm of the Group, which has seen operations combined with the other service providers within the Group and
has not traded in the year.  
(g) Investments 
Investments held as fixed assets are carried at cost less any provision required for impairment.
(h) Stocks
Stocks are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value, after due allowances for obsolete and slow moving items.
(i) Deferred taxation
Full provision is made, under the liability method, to take account of timing differences between the treatment of certain items
for financial statements purposes and their treatment for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
more likely than not that they will be recovered. The deferred tax balance is not discounted.
notes to the financial statements
28 Clarity Commerce Solutions plc 1 Accounting policies (continued)
(j) Hire purchase agreements
Assets held under hire purchase agreements are capitalised and disclosed under tangible fixed assets at their fair value. The
capital element of the future payments is treated as a liability and the interest is charged to the profit and loss account in equal
proportions over the period of the lease.
(k) Finance lease agreements
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease
is treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated in accordance
with the above depreciation policies. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included with creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account in equal
proportions over the period of the lease, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future
instalments.
(l)    Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are
charged against the profit and loss account as incurred.
(m) Capital instruments
Capital instruments are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received less issue costs in accordance Financial Reporting
Standard 4 - Capital Instruments. The difference between the net proceeds of the issue and the total amount of payments that
the issuer may be required to make is recorded as a finance cost of the instrument. Finance costs are written off to the profit and
loss account over the period of the relevant instrument in proportion to the remaining debt outstanding.
(n) Research and development
Research and development costs are written off as incurred.
(o) Liquid resources
Liquid resources are current asset investments held as readily disposable stores of value which are readily convertible into known
amounts of cash at or close to their carrying amounts.
(p) Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating profit.
For the purposes of the consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at exchange rates
ruling at the balance sheet date. Trading results are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of each month.
Differences arising on the retranslation of opening assets are dealt with through reserves.

Basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2005 is calculated by dividing the profit for the year of £393,000
(2004: £380,000) by 15,956,500 (2004: 14,957,917) being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. 
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue have been adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential
ordinary shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year of £393,000 (2004: £380,000) by the
weighted diluted average number of shares being 16,666,937 (2004: 15,246,514). 
In view of the significant impact of the impairment of goodwill on earnings per share calculated in accordance with FRS14 -
Earning per Share, an adjusted earnings per share figure has been provided. 
The adjusted basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2005 is calculated by dividing the profit for the year before
impairment of goodwill of £643,000 (2004: £613,000) by 15,956,500 (2004: 14,957,917) being the weighted average number of
shares in issue during the year. The profit for the year before impairment and amortisation is calculated by adding back £250,000
(2004: £233,000) to the retained profit for the year of £393,000 (2004: £380,000).
8 Intangible assets
Details of goodwill and software rights acquired during the year are given in note 31. 
Following the successful performance since acquisition of Romulus Enterprises Limited the deferred element of the
consideration paid has been revised causing an increase to goodwill of £315,000.

Creditors include finance capital which is due for repayment as follows:
As at 31 March 2005 loan notes still to be redeemed in respect of the consideration payable to the vendors of Flex Systems
Limited amounted to £1,421,000 (2004: £2,043,000). In the year ended 31 March 2005, £622,000 of loan notes were redeemed. 
Under the terms of the Baron LRMS acquisition agreement dated 29 October 2004 loan notes were issued in the sum of £250,000
and £300,000, redeemable in full in 12 months and 18 months respectively after the date of the acquisition agreement.
The Company has adopted a prudent policy by recognising that loan notes issued could be redeemed early and have therefore
disclosed £606,000 (2004: £538,000) as due within one year and £1,365,000 (2004: £1,505,000) as being due for repayment

The share capital issued in the year is in respect of additional consideration payable on the acquisition of Romulus Enterprises
Limited. It was dependent on the profitability of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2004 in accordance with the Sales
and Purchase Agreement in respect of the transaction. Deferred consideration of £240,000 was satisfied by the issuing of 393,443
shares at 61p. This resulted in a £115,000 adjustment to the goodwill created upon the acquisition of Romulus.
26 Related party transactions 
During the year the Group purchased air charter services to the value of £51,000 (2004: £52,000) from Direct Air Limited, a

the cost of acquisition of the equity interests in Baron LRMS Limited in relation to air charter services provided (2004: £32,000 in
respect of the acquisition of Pacer/Cats/CCS). 
At 31 March 2005 no balances were due to the Company (2004: £nil).

On 29 October 2004 the Group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Baron LRMS Limited.
Details are as follows:
The fair value adjustment arises from the alignment of the Company’s accounting policy for the amortisation of software rights
with the Group’s accounting policy.
These adjustments are provisional and under FRS7 - Fair Values and Acquisition Accounting, they will be finally determined by
the date the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2006 are approved. Any such adjustments to the fair values in this
period will result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
The turnover and operating loss for Baron LRMS for the year ended 31 August 2004 were £893,000 and £159,000 respectively. The
turnover and operating loss for Baron LRMS for September 2004 and October 2004, representing the pre-acquisition period, were
£206,000 and £73,000 respectively.
In addition to the table above there were further adjustments in the year relating to deferred elements of the consideration
payable in respect of the Romulus acquisition representing revisions to both the deferred earnout and shares issued in respect of
the satisfaction of deferred consideration. Goodwill has increased by £315,000.
Final adjustments were made to these figures after the release of the preliminary announcement.

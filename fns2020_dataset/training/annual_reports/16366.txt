In May 2011, we announced the strategic disposal of our Supply Chain 
business in a transformational move to create a focused advanced 
composites business serving high growth global end markets.
S t r o n g>s t r a t e g i c>r a t i o n a l e
Composites represent a more attractive opportunity 
with higher growth prospects, higher profit margin 
characteristics, lower working capital, and potential 
acquisition opportunities.
These prospects stem from strong market and 
structural drivers and from the benefits of using 
composite materials as an alternative to conventional 
materials due to factors such as rising energy costs 
and increasing environmental and safety concerns. 
The Composites and Supply Chain businesses  
have no material synergies and they operate with 
fundamentally different customers, processes and 
financial characteristics. We consider that each would 
benefit from independent management focus.
The proceeds of sale of the Supply Chain business will 
provide a strengthened balance sheet so that future 
growth and potential acquisition opportunities in the 
composites market can be undertaken. 3 U meco 	 p l c	 An nu a l 	 R e po r t 	 2 0 11

The advanced composites market
T h e>a d v a n c e d>c o m p o s i t e s>m a r k e t
The terms ‘advanced composites’ and ‘prepreg’ have become 
accepted as the generic names for a generation of materials 
manufactured from high performance fibres pre-impregnated with a 
suitable resin matrix. These materials are developed, manufactured 
and supplied by our Structural Materials business.
Vital to the effective processing of these materials, are the vacuum 
bagging materials which are developed, manufactured and supplied 
by our Process Materials business.
Advanced composites, prepregs and vacuum bagging materials are 
used by our customers to manufacture components, parts, structures 
and tooling designed for use in our core markets. In many cases, 
advanced composite parts and components are replacing traditional 
metallic parts and components.
A>h i g h>g r ow t h>m a r k e t
The global industry for composite materials is forecast to grow 
significantly in the coming years. The two sectors that will drive this 
growth are anticipated to be aerospace & defence and wind energy, 
where compound annual growth rates are expected to be 14 per cent 
and 8 per cent respectively.
Industry estimates show a compound growth in demand for carbon 
fibres – a key indicator in relation to the wider market for composite 
materials – of 19 per cent per annum between 2011 and 2015 followed 
by 11 per cent per annum between 2015 and 2019.
K e y>b e n e fi t s
Composites have several advantages over conventional metallic  
alloys. High strength structures can be designed, with significant 
weight savings.
Exceptional environmental degradation and corrosion   >
resistance properties. 
Damaged structures can be repaired easily. >
Ability to manufacture complex shapes at lower costs compared  >
with fabricated or machined metallic alloys. 
Time and cost reductions on tooling and manufacturing of one-offs,  >
prototypes and short length production runs. 
Excellent fatigue life, i.e. carbon fibre composites can be designed   >
to be essentially fatigue free. 
Improved energy absorbing safety structures. > 5 U meco 	 p l c	 An nu a l 	 R e po r t 	 2 0 11

Market opportunities
A e r o s p a c e>&>d e f e n c e
The growing demand for lower fuel consumption, aligned with 
advances in composite construction techniques, has led to a significant 
increase in the use of composites in civil aircraft in the last few years. 
New aircraft such as the Airbus A380XWB and the Boeing 787  
have circa 50 per cent composites compared to circa 20 per cent for 
current models. 
W i n d>e n e r g y
Previous European industry leadership in this market sector has been 
overtaken by China and we are well placed to take advantage of this 
geographical shift through our joint venture in Shanghai.
With the potential deployment of up to 29GW of additional offshore 
wind capacity by 2020, the UK is the single, largest market for offshore 
wind globally for the foreseeable future. This presents a major 
opportunity for the UK given the potential demand for bigger,  
stronger and more durable composite turbine blades. 
f ocused 	 on 	opportunity>
R e cr e ati o n
Use of composite materials, using mainly glass fibre and polyester 
resins, is long established as the main construction material for boat 
hulls, decks and superstructures in the recreational boatbuilding 
segment. A move away from open moulding to vacuum bagging is 
being accelerated by health & safety considerations.
Au to m o ti v e
As the UK moves towards a low carbon economy, more 
environmentally-friendly car designs will increasingly seek out 
lightweight materials, such as advanced composites, to cut fuel 
emissions and reduce running costs.
Industry activity and investment aimed at overcoming existing barriers 
to high volume manufacture of composite parts and components will 
influence the uptake of advanced composite materials. 6 U meco 	 p l c	 An nu a l 	 R e po r t 	 2 0 11 6 U meco 	 p l c	 An nu a l 	 R e po r t 	 2 0 11

The marine segment is influenced by the 
timing of race series such as the America’s 
Cup, resulting in periods of high market 
demand and relatively cyclical activity. 
Although the high profile racing community 
was relatively unaffected by the economic 
downturn, the wider market is recovering 
slowly after a difficult period.
We manufacture and supply prepreg and 
vacuum bagging materials across this market 
segment. We distribute glass fibre, resins and 
other materials for the general European 
marine market.
Customers include many teams participating 
in high profile events such as the America’s 
Cup and Volvo Ocean Race.
The high performance sports goods segment 
includes advanced composite materials for 
hockey sticks, the remote control hobbyist 
market, bicycles and fishing rods.
Au to m o ti v e
The superior performance and lightweight 
characteristics of advanced composite 
components and parts are having an 
increasing influence on the utilisation of 
advanced composites in the supercar and 
luxury car segments of the automotive 
market. Supercar bodies, chassis and internal 
components are typically built out of 
advanced composites. These utilise our 
prepreg and vacuum bagging films. 
Manufacturers of mid range vehicles are also 
seeking weight reduction due to European 
CO2 emissions regulations which become 
effective in 2015 and 2020.
Considerable industry activity is taking place 
to overcome manufacturing and cost 
limitations in the use of advanced composites 
and opportunities exist in the embryonic 
market for lightweight electric vehicles.
Customers include Lamborghini and 
Delta Motorsport.

The Directors of Umeco (the ‘Company’) submit their Annual Report 
and financial statements for the year to 31 March 2011.
Principal activities
Umeco is an international provider of advanced composite materials 
primarily to the aerospace & defence, wind energy, recreation and 
automotive industries. Umeco is managed through two continuing 
business streams:
Umeco Composites – Structural Materials develops, manufactures  
and supplies a broad range of advanced composite materials for a 
diverse range of industries such as aerospace & defence, wind energy, 
recreation and automotive. 
Umeco Composites – Process Materials develops, manufactures and 
supplies vacuum bagging materials to the composites industry and 
other markets, providing a wide range of materials and technical 
support to a growing number of international customers. 
Disposal of Supply Chain
On 20 May 2011, the Company announced its intention to become a 
focused advanced composites business through the sale of the Supply 
Chain business. This strategic disposal will create a business focused 
on the advanced composites market, which the Board considers has 
attractive long-term growth prospects. The Supply Chain business is 
proposed to be sold to a company established by funds advised by 
Exponent Private Equity LLP for an unadjusted cash and debt free value 
of approximately £145.8 million. The net consideration in respect of 
the disposal is expected to be approximately £109.3 million (before 
transaction costs of approximately £7.4 million), of which £8.0 million 
will be deferred and paid in four equal quarterly instalments between 
29 June 2012 and 29 March 2013.
Review of Group’s business
Under Section 417 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is 
required to produce a fair review of its business, including a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that face the Company. This is  
set out in the Business Review on pages 8 to 23, which includes the 
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Finance Director’s 
Review, together with descriptions of the principal activities. The 
Business Review is incorporated into this report by reference. The 
Business Review contains details of the key performance measures 
used to manage and control the Group’s operations, and sets out 
information on the future strategy and prospects of the Group.
The following specific issues are discussed in the sections shown  
in brackets:
key objectives and performance in the year to 31 March 2011 • 
(Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Finance 
Director’s Review);
treasury policy and risk management (note 27 to the consolidated • 
financial statements and Corporate Governance); and
corporate social responsibility, environmental matters and • 
employee issues (Corporate Responsibility and Corporate 
Governance).
Details of the results for the year are shown in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Analyses of revenue and 
adjusted operating profit by segment are shown in note 1 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Group key performance indicators
The Board has adopted various financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to measure the strategic and 
operational progress of the Group, which are measured at Group and/
or subsidiary level as appropriate. Details are shown on page 19.
Corporate governance
Under Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.2, the Company is required  
to include a Corporate Governance statement in its Directors’ Report.  
All relevant information on the corporate governance practices of the 
Company are set out in the Corporate Governance statement on pages 
79 to 85. The Corporate Governance statement is incorporated into 
this report by reference.
Profits and dividends
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is shown on 
page 33. Profit before tax from continuing operations was £8.6 million 
(2010: £6.3 million). The comparative results of the Supply Chain 
business, which was held for sale in the year, and Advanced 
Composites Group SA (Pty) Limited (‘ACG South Africa’), which was 
discontinued in the previous year have been classified as held for sale.
The Directors propose a final dividend of 11.5 pence per share, payable  
on 7 October 2011 to shareholders registered on 9 September 2011, 
making a total declared for the year to 31 March 2011 of 18.25 pence 
per share (2010: 17.5 pence).
Research & development
Expenditure on research & development was £2.1 million (2010: £2.0 
million). This expenditure relates to the research & development of 
advanced composite materials, including materials evaluation and 
prototype production. The accounting policy on research & 
development is disclosed in Group Accounting Policies.
Share capital
Details of share capital are given in note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements. At the date of this report there were 48,140,816 
ordinary shares of 25 pence each in issue, all of which are fully paid up 
and quoted on the London Stock Exchange. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well as the 
powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the Company’s  
Articles of Association (the “Articles”), copies of which can be obtained 
from the Company Secretary.

Overview Business Review Governance
Company
Information
Directors
Financial
Statements
Subject to applicable statutes (in this section the “Companies Acts”), 
any resolution passed by the Company under the Companies Acts and 
other shareholders’ rights, shares may be issued with such rights and 
restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide, or  
(if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not make specific 
provision) as the Board (as defined in the Articles) may decide. Subject 
to the Articles, the Companies Acts and other shareholders’ rights, 
unissued shares are at the disposal of the Board.
Voting
Every member and every duly appointed proxy present at a general 
meeting or class meeting has, upon a show of hands, one vote and 
every member present in person or by proxy has, upon a poll, one  
vote for every share held by him. In the case of joint holders of a share 
the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by 
proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other  
joint holders and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined  
by the order in which the names stand in the register in respect  
of the joint holding.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of any share held by him if any call or other sum 
then payable by him in respect of that share remains unpaid or if a 
member has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in  
the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under  
the Companies Acts. The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on  
voting rights.
Dividends and other distributions
The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare 
dividends not exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. 
Subject to the Companies Acts, the Board may pay interim dividends, 
and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial position of  
the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If  
the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of shares with 
preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the payment of 
interim or fixed dividends on other shares. The Board may withhold 
payment of all or any part of any dividends or other moneys payable  
in respect of the Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25 per cent 
interest (as defined in the Articles) if such a person has been served 
with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after failure to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Acts, rights attached to any class of shares 
may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less  
than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares), or with the 
sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting 
(except an adjourned meeting) the quorum shall be two persons 
holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares 
held as treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights 
attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or 
issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Restrictions on transfer of securities in the Company
There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the Company, 
except:
that certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws • 
and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority • 
whereby certain employees of the Company require the approval of 
the Company to deal in the Company’s ordinary shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the transfers of securities and/or 
voting rights. No person holds securities in the Company carrying  
special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Articles may 
be amended by special resolution of the Company’s shareholders. 
Share allotment
A general allotment power and a limited power to allot in specific 
circumstances for cash otherwise than pro-rata to existing 
shareholders were given to the Directors by resolutions approved at 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 28 July 2010. 
These powers will expire at the conclusion of the 2011 Annual General 
Meeting and resolutions to renew the Directors’ powers are therefore 
included within the notice of the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Directors shall be not less than two and not more than 15 in 
number. The Company may by ordinary resolution vary the minimum 
and/or maximum number of Directors. A Director shall not be required 
to hold any shares in the Company. Directors may be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed 
by the Board holds office only until the next following Annual General 
Meeting of the Company and is then eligible for re-appointment. The 
Board or any committee authorised by the Board may from time to 
time appoint one or more Directors to hold any employment or 
executive office for such period and on such terms as they may 
determine and may also revoke or terminate any such appointment.
At every Annual General Meeting of the Company any Director who has 
been appointed by the Board since the last Annual General Meeting,  
or who held office at the time of the two preceding Annual General 
Meetings and who did not retire at either of them, or who has held 
office with the Company, other than employment or executive office,  
for a continuous period of nine years or more at the date of the meeting, 
shall retire from office and may offer himself for re-appointment by the 
members. The Company may by special resolution remove any Director 
before the expiration of his period of office. The office of a Director shall 
be vacated if: (i) he resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolve to 
accept such offer; (ii) his resignation is requested by all of the other 
Directors and all of the other Directors are not less than three in number; 
(iii) he is or has been suffering from mental or physical ill health and the 
Board resolves that his office be vacated;   28 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
(iv) he is absent without the permission of the Board from meetings  
of the Board (whether or not an alternate Director appointed by him 
attends) for six consecutive months and the Board resolves that his 
office is vacated; (v) he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his 
creditors generally; (vi) he is prohibited by a law from being a Director; 
(vii) he ceases to be a Director by virtue of the Companies Acts; or (viii) 
he is removed from office pursuant to the Articles.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Acts and any directions given by 
the Company by special resolution, the business of the Company will 
be managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the 
Company, whether relating to the management of the business of the 
Company or not. In particular, the Board may exercise all the powers of 
the Company to borrow money, to guarantee, to indemnify, to 
mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, property, assets (present 
and future) and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other 
securities and to give security for any debt, liability or obligation of the 
Company or of any third party.
Directors
The names of Directors at the date of this report, together with 
biographical details, are shown on pages 24 and 25. The remuneration of 
the Directors, together with details of their share options and share 
interests, is disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 86 to 93.
The appointment of a Director is a matter for resolution by the  
Board as a whole, acting through the nomination committee.  
Re-appointment is subject to review and is not automatic. Details  
of the appointment and replacement of Directors is disclosed in the 
Corporate Governance statement. Where appropriate, the nomination 
committee uses the services of external recruitment consultants. 
Details of potential candidates provided by consultants may be initially 
reviewed by a sub-committee of the nomination committee and 
meetings with selected candidates are then held with Directors. 
Subsequently, the nomination committee meets to discuss and 
confirm an appointment.
On 20 May 2011, the Company announced that Andrew Moss had 
been appointed as Chief Executive, and Steve Bowers had been 
appointed as Finance Director, in each case with immediate effect. 
Andrew Moss joined the Group in 1999. He joined the Board in June 
2008 on his appointment as Chief Operating Officer, prior to which he 
was Chief Executive of Umeco Composites. He has a broad industrial 
and aerospace background, and was previously Chief Executive of the 
Automotive and Building Products Group of Invensys plc.
Steve Bowers joined the Group in 1998 having qualified as a chartered 
accountant with KPMG. He has been Company Secretary since 1999 
and was appointed Group Financial Controller in 2004.
Directors retire by rotation at intervals of no more than three years,  
in accordance with the Combined Code.
Directors’ Report continued 
Apart from service contracts and other related agreements as detailed 
in the Remuneration Report, no Director had an interest during the 
year or at the year end in any contracts with the Company or its 
subsidiaries and no Director had any beneficial interest in the shares  
of any of the Company’s subsidiaries.
Steve Bowers, having joined the Board since the last Annual General 
Meeting, retires in accordance with the Articles and offers himself for 
re-appointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Chris 
Hole, Andrew Moss and Graham Zacharias retire by rotation and, being 
eligible, offer themselves for re-appointment at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. Chris Hole and Graham Zacharias have letters 
of appointment with the Company and Andrew Moss and Steve 
Bowers have service contracts with the Company, details of which are 
set out in the Remuneration Report. 
Conflicts of interest
The Board continues to operate the procedures adopted following the 
introduction of the statutory directors’ duty to avoid conflicts of 
interest and these procedures have operated effectively during the 
year. The Articles permit the Directors to authorise conflicts of interest. 
The conflicted Director shall not count towards the quorum or vote on 
any resolution to authorise the conflict of interest and, at the Board’s 
discretion, may be excluded from any meeting at which the conflict is 
under consideration. Where a conflict of interest is authorised, the 
Board may impose such restrictions on the conflicted Director as they 
deem appropriate such as excluding the Director from receipt of 
information or discussions.

Information relating to employee numbers and remuneration is  
shown in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Details  
of employment policy and employee involvement are set out in the

Going concern
A review of Group business activities and future outlook is set out  
on pages 8 to 23 which includes the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Review and Finance Director’s Review. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position is shown in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and accompanying notes to the financial statements. The 
principal business risks associated with the business are shown on 
pages 20 to 22. In addition, note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit and liquidity risk.
The Group’s bank facilities with Lloyds Banking Group amount to 
£159.1 million. This comprises a US$150.0 million committed revolving 
facility which extends to June 2014, a US$89.0 million term loan facility 
which in September 2010 was extended until August 2012 and an 
overdraft of £10.0 million.
The Group has entered into an agreement for a new five-year 
committed multi currency revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc 
and Santander UK plc, comprising £15.0 million and US$25.0 million 
facilities. Utilisation of the facilities is conditional on, inter alia, 
completion of the disposal of the Supply Chain business and notices of 
prepayment being delivered to Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the 
facilities referred to above.
After considering the nature and duration of these facilities and 
making appropriate enquiries, based on the strength of the Group’s 
balance sheet, current expectations of future trading (based on future 
cash flow forecasts and revenue projections which the Directors 
believe are based on a realistic assessment of future business 
performance) and on the facilities available to the Group, the Directors 
believe they have reasonable grounds for stating that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Authority to make market purchases of own shares
An authority to make market purchases of shares was given to the Directors 
by a special resolution at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held 
on 28 July 2010. In the year to 31 March 2011, the Company has not 
acquired any of its own shares. The existing authority will expire at the 
conclusion of the 2011 Annual General Meeting and a resolution to renew 
the authority is therefore included within the notice of the 2011 Annual 
General Meeting.
Accordingly, it is intended to propose a Special Resolution to give the 
Company authority to make market purchases on the London Stock 
Exchange of up to 10.0 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue at the date of 
the Annual General Meeting. Any purchase therefore will be subject to the 
terms of the Listing Rules, which provide that the maximum price (exclusive 
of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share is the highest of (i) an 
amount equal to 5.0 per cent above the average market value for an 
ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of 
the purchase and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent bid on 
the trading venues where the purchase is carried out.
The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an 
ordinary share is 25 pence, its nominal value. Such market purchases  
of ordinary shares would be made from the Company’s distributable 
reserves. Ordinary shares purchased pursuant to the authority will either 
be cancelled or held as treasury shares. Shares held by the Company as 
treasury shares may be sold, transferred for the purpose of employee 
share schemes, or cancelled.
Related party transactions 
Related party transactions are set out in note 16 on page 78.
Essential contracts and significant agreements
The Company and Group have a number of significant agreements 
relating to funding and customer relationships. 
The Group’s facility agreements with Lloyds Banking Group in respect of 
the US$150.0 million five year revolving credit facility expiring in June 2014 
and the US$89.0 million credit facility expiring in August 2012 are essential 
to the Group as a whole. These agreements include change of control 
provisions and, in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, the 
provisions could result in renegotiation or withdrawal of the facilities. As 
announced on 20 May 2011, the proceeds of sale of the Supply Chain 
business will primarily be used towards the settlement of all outstanding 
indebtedness under these facilities, following which they will be cancelled.
The Group’s facility agreements with HSBC Bank plc and Santander 
UK plc in respect of the revolving credit bank facility, comprising £15.0 
million and US$25.0 million facilities, are essential to the Group as a 
whole. These agreements include change of control provisions and, in 
the event of a change in ownership of the Company, the provisions could 
result in cancellation of the facilities.
The Group has essential relationships with its key customers, with many 
of these relationships being the subject of long-term supply agreements. 
Other than as noted above, the Directors are not aware of any 
significant agreements to which the Company and/or any of its 
subsidiaries is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a  
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. 
Donations
The Group made charitable donations during the year of £1,600 (2010: 
£4,000). The Group made no political donations during the year (2010: £nil). 30 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
Throughout the year to 31 March 2011, the Company maintained liability 
insurance for its Directors and officers, and the Directors and officers of 
the Group’s subsidiaries, as permitted by the Companies Acts.
Supplier payment policy
It is the Group’s normal procedure to agree payment terms with 
suppliers in advance and to adhere to those agreed terms when 
making payments. At 31 March 2011, the Company’s outstanding 
indebtedness to trade creditors corresponded to 45 days when 
averaged over the year (2010: 52 days).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 1.00pm on Tuesday  
2 August 2011 at The Falstaff Hotel, 16-20 Warwick New Road, 
Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32 5JQ. The notice of the Annual 
General Meeting is set out on pages 98 to 102.
Auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information (as defined in section 418(3) of the Companies Act 
2006) of which the parent Company’s auditors are unaware, and each 
Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information  
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information. Resolutions for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc  
as auditors of the Company and for authorising the Directors to 
determine their remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, and  
the Group and Company financial statements, in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that  
law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law, and 
have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements  
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law  
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair  
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and  
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them • 
consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; • 
for the Group financial statements, state whether they have  • 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
for the parent Company financial statements, state whether • 
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
Company financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless  • 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent Company and to enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Acts. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance statement that comply with such 
law and regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors, namely Neil Johnson, Andrew Moss, Steve Bowers, 
Stephen Bird, Graham Zacharias, Chris Hole and Adrian Auer, confirm 
that to the best of their knowledge, the financial statements, prepared  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and income and 
expenditure of the Company (and the Group as a whole) as required  
by Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.1.12. The Annual Report includes 
a fair review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company (and the Group as a whole), together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties and a statement 
by the auditors of their responsibilities.

*Note on adjusted figures
Umeco uses adjusted figures as key performance indicators. Adjusted figures are stated before the results of discontinued operations, 
amortisation and impairment charges relating to intangible assets, significant items, the revaluation of financial instruments based on their 
market values and associated tax effects. The differences between the total and unadjusted measures of operating profit, profit before tax and 
profit attributable to owners of the Company are reconciled in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The narrative contained in the 
Business Review is based on the adjusted measures of operating profit, profit before tax and earnings per share. These provide a more consistent 
measure of operating performance.
The comparative figures for the year to 31 March 2010 have been re-presented to reflect the proposed disposal of the Supply Chain business.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity
For the year to 31 March 2011 37 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
They are prepared on the historic cost basis except that the following 
assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values – derivative financial 
instruments (IAS39), retirement benefit obligations (IAS19) and share 
based payments (IFRS2).
The accounting policies set out on pages 37 to 41 have been applied 
consistently in dealing with items which are considered material  
in relation to the Group’s financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by applying 
the accounting policies, presentation and basis of consolidation which 
were applied in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements for the year to 31 March 2010, which were 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU, except for the following accounting 
standards and interpretations which are effective for the Group from  
1 April 2010:
• IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’
• IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business combinations’
• Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Classification of rights issue’
• Annual Improvement Project to IFRS’s
The Annual Improvement Project to IFRS’s provides a vehicle for making 
non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRS’s. Amendments to a 
number of standards have been adopted.
IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ and 
IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business combinations’ include revisions in respect of 
accounting for acquisitions. The revisions require subsequent changes 
in the fair value of contingent consideration payable in respect of an 
acquisition to be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income rather than against goodwill, and require 
transaction costs attributable to an acquisition to be recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
These changes will be applied prospectively, thus acquisitions as at 1 
April 2010 will not be effected by the change in standard. This standard 
has no impact upon profit or net assets in the year to 31 March 2011.
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Classification of rights issue’ requires that 
rights, options or warrants to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s 
own equity instruments for a fixed amount of any currency are equity 
instruments if the entity offers the rights, options or warrants pro rata 
to all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non-derivative 
equity instruments. This standard has no impact upon profit or net 
assets in the year to 31 March 2011.
The following standards and interpretations had been endorsed by the 
EU by the year end but are not effective for the year to 31 March 2011:
•  Amendments to IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayment of a minimum funding 
requirement’
•  IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’
•  Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Improving disclosures about financial 
instruments’
•  Amendments to IAS 24 ‘Related party transactions’
Umeco plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.  
The address of the Company’s registered office is Concorde House, 
Warwick New Road, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32 5JG, United 
Kingdom. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year to  
31 March 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). 
The consolidated financial statements were approved for release by 
the Board of Directors on 16 June 2011.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements as approved by the Directors have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU. The Company has elected to 
prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
UK GAAP and these are shown on pages 71 to 78.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position, the financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Business Review. In addition, note 27 to 
the consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
The Group’s bank facilities amount to £159.1 million. This comprises a 
US$150.0 million committed revolving facility which extends to June 
2014, a US$89.0 million term loan facility which in September 2010 
was extended until August 2012 and an overdraft of £10.0 million.
The Group has entered into an agreement for a new five-year 
committed multi currency revolving credit bank facility with HSBC 
Bank plc and Santander UK plc, comprising £15.0 million and US$25.0 
million facilities. Utilisation of the facilities is conditional on, inter alia, 
completion of the disposal of the Supply Chain business and notices of 
prepayment being delivered to Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the 
extended term loan facility and the revolving credit facility.
After considering the nature and duration of these facilities and 
making appropriate enquiries, based on the strength of the Group’s 
balance sheet, current expectations of future trading and on the 
facilities available to the Group, the Directors believe they have 
reasonable grounds for stating that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of preparation
Comparative figures for the year to 31 March 2010 have been  
re-presented to reflect the classification of Umeco Supply Chain  
as a discontinued operation. The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company.

Information Directors 38 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
The Group has considered the impact of these new standards and 
interpretations in future periods and no significant impact is expected 
on reported profit or net assets from their adoption.
The Group has chosen not to adopt any of these new standards  
and interpretations.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements 
of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Acquisitions are accounted for 
using the purchase method, when control over the operating and financial 
policies of a company has been acquired. Control exists when the Company 
has direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain economic benefit from its activities. The existence 
and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are considered in assessing control. Consolidation of 
subsidiaries continues until that control ceases. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company.
Transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated  
on consolidation, and no profit before tax is recognised on sales made 
between Group companies until the products are sold to customers 
outside the Group.
Investments in jointly controlled entities
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint 
control, established by contractual agreement. 
The Group’s share of joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate 
consolidation method. The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and the Consolidated Balance Sheet include the Group’s share of 
the joint ventures’ income, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Divestments and assets held for sale
The results and cash flows of major lines of business that are held for 
sale have been classified as discontinued operations. Businesses that 
are divested are de-consolidated from the date on which 
control ceases.
When the carrying value of an asset will be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction expected to take place within twelve 
months of the balance sheet date rather than through continuing use, 
it is classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying value 
and fair value less costs to sell.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or 
components of a disposal group, are re-measured in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets, or 
disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is 
first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities 
on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, 
financial assets, deferred tax assets and employee benefit assets which 
continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
Group Accounting Policies continued
For the year to 31 March 2011
policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and 
subsequent gains or losses on re-measurement are recognised in profit 
or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative 
impairment loss. 
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary 
acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued 
operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria 
to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified 
as a discontinued operation, the comparative Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income is re-presented as if the operation had been 
discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In 
respect of acquisitions that have been announced since 1 April 2004, 
goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the cost  
of the acquisition (including the attributable costs of the acquisition) 
and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, and is 
allocated to cash generating units. Positive goodwill is recognised as an 
asset on the balance sheet. Negative goodwill, representing the excess 
of the fair value of assets acquired above the fair value of consideration 
paid, arising on acquisitions is recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In respect of acquisitions announced prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill is 
included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount 
recorded under UK GAAP on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses. 
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at each 
balance sheet date.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit  
or loss on disposal. 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated  
at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged  
to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income over the estimated useful life of the asset.  
The useful life of each asset is assessed based on discussions with 
management and takes account of the differing natures of each of the 
intangible assets assessed. The useful lives of order books, customer 
relationships and contracts are between one and nine years.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised as an 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income  
as incurred. 39 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
projected unit method. The charge to the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income reflects the current service cost of such 
obligations, and where applicable, past service cost. The expected 
return on plan assets and the interest cost on scheme liabilities are 
included within financial income and expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet represents the present value of the liabilities of the 
defined benefit schemes as reduced by the fair value of the assets of 
those schemes. Differences between the actual and expected returns 
on assets and experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities, 
together with differences arising from changes in assumptions, are 
recognised as other comprehensive income.
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance  
with the schemes’ rules and the recommendations of the  
schemes’ actuaries.
(b) share based payments
The fair value of options granted under share based payment schemes is 
recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair 
values of options are estimated using the Black-Scholes model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions under which the options were granted. 
The fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight line basis 
over the vesting period, with the amount recognised as an expense being 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of options that vest except where 
forfeiture is solely due to market conditions, for example the Company’s 
share price not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Any proceeds received, net of directly attributable transaction costs, are 
credited to share capital and share premium when options are exercised.
Property, plant & equipment
Items of property, plant & equipment are stated at cost or deemed 
cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditure that  
is directly attributable to the item of property, plant & equipment 
acquired. Assets held under lease finance arrangements are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the expected useful 
life of the asset. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of 
property, plant & equipment over their estimated useful economic lives 
on a straight line basis as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold 
 property improvements   50 years
Short leasehold property improvements   period of lease
Plant, machinery, fixtures & IT equipment  3–10 years
Motor vehicles   3–4 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land. 
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for 
continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, and are 
adjusted if required.
Impairment
The carrying values of all non-current assets subject to amortisation 
and depreciation are reviewed for impairment when there is an 
indication that the assets might be impaired. In addition, non-current 
assets which have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are 
tested for impairment annually to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any indication of impairment exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is 
recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash 
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in  
use. In determining the value in use, estimated future cash flows  
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that  
reflects the time value of money and risks specific to the asset being 
assessed. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and, in the case  
of goodwill, are not subsequently reversed.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. 
Recognition is made when goods or services are supplied or made 
available to customers against orders received and the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Assessments are made in respect of Supply Chain contracts to 
determine whether the Group is acting as principal or agent. Where it is 
determined that the Group is acting as principal, revenue is recognised 
on a gross basis and includes the value of goods supplied. Where the 
Group acts as agent, the agency fee is recognised as revenue. Revenue 
excludes value added tax and other similar sales taxes.
No revenue is recognised where the recovery of the consideration is  
not probable. Revenue is stated after the deduction of discounts and 
allowances for estimated future rebates and returns. The methodology 
and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored 
and adjusted in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical 
trends, past experience and projected market conditions.
Significant items
Significant items are non-recurring items which are separately 
identified by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better 
understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
Employee benefits
(a) retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final 
pensionable salaries and on contributions made by members. The assets 
of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. For defined 
contribution pension schemes, amounts payable are charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the IAS19 cost of providing 
benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
Overview Business Review
Financial
Statements Governance
Company
Information Directors 40 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
On disposal of an item of property, plant & equipment, the cost and 
related accumulated depreciation are removed from fixed assets and 
the net amount, less any proceeds, is taken to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (including, where applicable, 
raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production 
overheads) and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined on a 
first in, first out basis. The net realisable value of inventory is assessed 
by reference to historic and expected future usage patterns, with 
provision being made for obsolete or slow moving items.
Research & development
Expenditure on research is charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as incurred. Where development expenditure 
meets the criteria of IAS38, such expenditure will be capitalised and 
amortised over its useful life.
Interest
Interest receivable or payable is credited or charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective 
interest method. 
Income tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in  
other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for in full, using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the amounts used for tax purposes. No deferred tax is provided for  
in relation to temporary differences relating to goodwill that is not 
deductible for tax purposes and differences relating to investments  
in subsidiaries, except to the extent that they are expected to reverse  
in the foreseeable future, and the parent Company is not able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred 
tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Group Accounting Policies continued
For the year to 31 March 2011
Leases
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated 
as a finance lease. The asset is capitalised and recorded within 
property, plant & equipment at the lower of the fair value at the date 
of acquisition or the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
and is depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the 
lease term. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance 
charges, are included within creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned 
between the finance element, which is charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as interest, and the capital 
element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future 
instalments. All other leases are operating leases and the rental 
charges are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on a straight line basis over the life of each lease.
Provisions
A provision is recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and where it is probable that a reliably estimated outflow 
will be required to settle the obligation. 
Share capital
The share capital of the Company is recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of directly attributable issue costs. Consideration paid for shares  
in the Company in respect of share based payments are deducted  
from retained earnings. Where such shares subsequently vest in the 
employees under the terms of the Group’s share option schemes or  
are sold, any consideration received up to the value that has been 
recognised for such shares is included in retained earnings. Any excess 
consideration is credited to share premium.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit 
attributable to owners of the Company. Goodwill and intangible assets 
relating to overseas operations are denominated in the currency of the 
foreign operations’ primary economic environment and are translated 
using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date with gains or 
losses on translation taken to other comprehensive income.
Subsidiaries account in the currency of their primary economic 
environment of operation, determined having regard to the currency 
that mainly influences revenue and expenses. Statements of 
comprehensive income and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are 
translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year.  
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation into sterling 
of equity interests in overseas subsidiary undertakings are treated as  
movements in the translation reserve. 41 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
The currencies which most influence the Group’s financial statements 
are the US dollar and Euro. The relevant exchange rates for these 
currencies were:
   2011  2010
Average rate
Sterling:US dollar  1.556 1.596
Sterling:Euro  1.177 1.130
Closing rate

Sterling:Euro  1.130 1.121
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
de-recognised when the rights to receive benefits have expired or have 
been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised 
when the obligation is extinguished. The principal financial assets and 
liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are then  
stated at amortised cost, net of any provision. A provision is made 
where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment, taking into account 
ageing, previous experience and general economic conditions. When  
a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable it is written off, 
either against a provision or to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
(b) cash
Cash is carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. For the 
purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash comprises 
cash at bank and in hand together with bank overdrafts, as these items 
are an integral part of the Group’s cash management. The Group does 
not have any short-term deposit instruments.
(c) trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are then stated 
at amortised cost.
(d) bank loans & other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised  
at fair value less attributable transaction costs. All borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between  
the initial proceeds and the repayment value being recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period  
to repayment.
(e) derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage  
financial risks associated with the Group’s business activities and the 
financing of those activities. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently 
re-measured in future periods at their fair value, with any change  
in value being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The Group does not apply hedge accounting  
in respect of these financial instruments.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to provide a 
hedge against foreign currency exposures. Interest rate swap contracts 
are used to hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in interest rates.
Fair values are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments  
for speculative purposes.
(f) hedge of net investment in foreign operation
Where a foreign currency liability is a formally designated hedge of a  
net investment in a foreign operation, foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation of the foreign currency liability are recognised 
directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective. The Group  
assesses the effectiveness of its net investment hedge based on fair  
value changes of its net assets, including relevant goodwill designated  
as a foreign currency asset and the fair value changes of the debt 
designated as a hedge.
At the inception of a hedging transaction the Group documents the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument 
together with its risk management objective and the strategy 
underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and 
subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge.

1 Segmental reporting
The Group has two continuing reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units. The strategic business 
units offer different products and services, and are managed separately as they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each 
of the strategic business units, the Chief Executive reviews internal management reports on a monthly basis. The following summary describes 
the operations of each of the Group’s reportable segments.
Details of business segments can be found on page 95 and details of the calculation of adjusted operating profit are set out in note 8.  
A reconciliation of reportable segment adjusted operating profit to total operating profit is set out in note 8. 
There are no material transactions between the Group’s two reportable segments.
The continuing operations’ biggest customer accounts for 3.3 per cent (2010: 1.7 per cent) of net revenue from continuing operations.

The effective tax rate on profit before tax from continuing operations is 22.4 per cent (2010: 34.9 per cent). The effective tax rate on adjusted 
profit before tax from continuing operations was 27.6 per cent (2010: 34.1 per cent), based on a tax expense on adjusted profit before tax of 
£4.5 million (2010: £4.4 million).
The deferred tax effects of actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations have been recognised directly in equity, and comprised  
a deferred tax charge of £0.4 million (2010: £0.3 million credit).
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries of continuing operations of the Company for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £41.1 million (2010: £54.2 million). The unprovided deferred tax liability in relation to these 
temporary differences is minimal as the majority of these earnings are either from UK subsidiaries or they are overseas earnings which would 
qualify for the UK dividend exemption.

The final dividend for 2011 of 11.50 pence per share was proposed by the Board on 16 June 2011 and has not been included as a liability as  
at 31 March 2011 as it is subject to approval by shareholders. The amount expected to be paid in respect of this dividend is £5.5 million.  
The dividend is payable on 7 October 2011 to shareholders registered on 9 September 2011.
The terms of the Umeco Bonus Plan, details of which are set out in the Remuneration Report, require that dividends are waived by participants  
in respect of deferred shares. Consequently, the final dividend declared in respect of the year to 31 March 2010 and the interim dividend declared  
in respect of the year to 31 March 2011 were each waived in relation to 183,597 shares.

Continuing operations
Each year, or whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of  
goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units. Tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash generating unit. The 
recoverable amount of goodwill attaching to cash generating units is based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flows. Those 
calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent forecast for the year to 31 March 2012 (2010: year to 31 March 2011) 
approved by management and strategic plans for the subsequent two years. These forecasts provide cash flow projections covering the three 
year period ending on 31 March 2014 (2010: 31 March 2013). In order to produce projections for a 25 year horizon period, the cash flow forecast 
for the year to 31 March 2014 (2010: year to 31 March 2013) was then extrapolated for a further 22 years, using growth rates appropriate to each 
cash generating unit. For the calculation of discounted cash flows made as at 31 March 2011, a terminal value was included in respect of forecast 
cash flows arising after the end of the 25 year horizon period. The following growth rates were used to derive the forecast for the year to 31 
March 2015 (2010: year to 31 March 2014) and to derive the forecast for subsequent years:

Umeco Composites – Process Materials
Years four to ten       2.0-7.0 2.0-7.0
Years 11 to 25       2.0 2.0
These growth rates are considered to be consistent with the long-term average growth rates for the industries which the cash generating  
units serve. Growth rates are considered separately for each cash generating unit and are benchmarked against externally prepared industry 
growth projections. Management believe that the forecast period is appropriate given the long-term nature of the build programmes within  
the relevant industries.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates, achievement of future revenues and 
expected changes in direct costs during the period. These assumptions have been reviewed in light of the current economic environment which  
has resulted in a more conservative estimate about the future.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the cash generating units. Whilst the Group has a number of cash generating units, the risks and rewards associated with Umeco Composites’ operations 
are consistent and therefore the same market risk premium has been applied for these cash generating units.

10 Intangible assets continued
In cash generating units within Umeco Composites – Structural Materials, a pre-tax discount rate of between 12.3 per cent and 15.8 per cent  
has been applied in determining the recoverable amounts of cash generating units (2010: between 12.6 per cent and 16.6 per cent). For cash 
generating units within Umeco Composites – Process Materials, a pre-tax discount rate of between 9.6 per cent and 13.6 per cent has been 
applied (2010: between 12.3 per cent and 13.8 per cent). The discount rates are estimated based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, 
using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and 
debt. In calculating the cost of equity a market risk premium was used with a Beta value of 0.9 (2010: 0.9). A market premium of 5.0 per cent 
(2010: 5.0 per cent) was used to calculate a pre-tax discount rate reflecting market information and risk. 
Management believe that the calculations and assumptions on which the carrying value of goodwill is based are appropriate and any reasonable 
change in the assumptions would not lead to a materially different conclusion. The Group’s estimate of impairments is most sensitive to 
increases in the discount rate used and reductions in forecast cash flows. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out in relation to the discount rate 
assumption, which demonstrated that 3.1 per cent would need to be added to the pre-tax discount rate used for Umeco Composites – Structural 
Materials, and 2.7 per cent added to the pre-tax discount rate used for Umeco Composites – Process Materials before any impairment would 
exist. Management do not consider such an increase in discount rates to be likely.
Although cash forecasts into perpetuity have been considered, the impairment tests at 31 March 2011 show that for Umeco Composites – 
Structural Materials, the number of years required to recover the carrying value of goodwill ranged from two to 11 (2010: two to 18 years). The 
equivalent period for Umeco Composites – Process Materials was five years (2010: nine years). Management consider that these payback periods 
are not excessive given the long-term strategic benefits arising from the acquisitions that have given rise to goodwill.
There were no impairments recognised in the year to 31 March 2011. Cumulative impairment recognised in relation to goodwill is £0.8 million  
(2010: £0.8 million).
The Group made no acquisitions in the years to 31 March 2011 or 31 March 2010.
Discontinued operations
During the year the Group announced the proposed disposal of Umeco Supply Chain and therefore its goodwill has been classified as held  
for sale, as shown in note 22. An impairment of £12.5 million has been recognised on this goodwill as a result of reclassifying it as a held for  
sale asset.
In the prior year, growth rates of zero to 7.0 per cent in years four to ten and 2.0 per cent from years 11 to 25 were applied in testing for impairment 
of the goodwill balance. A pre-tax discount rate of between 8.1 per cent and 14.7 per cent was used to determine its recoverable amount. The 
impairment test showed that the number of years required to recover the carrying value of goodwill ranged from one to 13 years.
11 Investment in joint venture
During the year the Group acquired an interest of 51 per cent in Shanghai Umeco Composites Co., Limited. The joint venture has been accounted 
for using the proportionate consolidation method.

On 23 March 2011 the Chancellor announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 26.0 per cent with effect from 1 April 2011. 
This change became substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction creates a reduction in the deferred 
tax liability which has been included in the figures above.
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by one per cent per annum to 23.0 per cent by 1 April 
2014, but these changes have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore are not included in the figures above.  The overall effect of the 
further reductions from 26.0 per cent to 23.0 per cent will be to reduce the deferred tax liability in future years.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on tax losses of £nil (2010: £1.2 million), which relates entirely to the Supply Chain business due to 
the lack of certainty concerning the quantum and timing of future years’ taxable profits of the companies concerned.

On 20 May 2011, the Group announced the proposed disposal of the Supply Chain business to a company established by funds advised  
by Exponent Private Equity LLP, for a cash consideration of £145.8 million. The net consideration in respect of the disposal is expected t 
o be approximately £109.3 million. The disposal is expected to be completed in July 2011. The Supply Chain business was not a discontinued  
operation or classified as held for sale at 31 March 2010 and the results and cash flow for the comparative period have been re-presented  
to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations. The Supply Chain business is treated as held for sale at  
31 March 2011 in line with IFRS5 as management consider the disposal to be highly probable.

Off-balance sheet arrangements
In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not 
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors are trade receivable balances that 
have been subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements. 
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivable balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange  
for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees. All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements  
are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such 
arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables. As at 31 March 2011, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet included £18.4 million (2010: £17.3 million) of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables  
if these arrangements were not in place, all of which relates to Umeco Supply Chain. Factoring fees incurred during the year to 31 March 2011, 
which are written off to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income within ordinary finance costs, amounted to £0.3 million  
(2010: £0.1 million).

24 Retirement benefit obligation
As explained in the Group Accounting Policies, the Group operates several pension schemes, the details of which are disclosed in this note.
The Umeco Pension and Life Assurance Plan (‘the Umeco Scheme’) has two sections. The defined benefit section of the Umeco Scheme, which 
was closed to new entrants in 2000, provides benefits based on final pensionable pay with contributions being charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working lives with the Group. The contributions are 
determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of valuations, conducted at least every three years, using the attained age method. 
Contribution rates are determined on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary, with the objective of providing 
the funds required to meet pension obligations as they fall due. The most recent valuation was at 1 April 2007. The assumptions which have the 
most significant effects on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments before retirement (6.7 per cent per 
annum), the rate of return on investments after retirement (5.2 per cent per annum), the rate of increase in salaries (4.5 per cent per annum) and 
the rate of pensions increases (0.0–3.2 per cent per annum). The valuation adopted the PMA92 and PFA92 year of birth medium cohort tables as 
the basis for determining members’ mortality assumptions. The valuation showed that the actuarial value of the defined benefit section’s assets 
was £8.1 million which represented 77.5 per cent of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected 
future increases in earnings. 
Regular contributions of the Group during the year were 26.3 per cent of earnings. Regular contributions of employees ranged from 4.5 per cent  
to 6.5 per cent of earnings. Regular contributions payable in respect of the year were £0.2 million (2010: £0.3 million). As part of the deficit 
recovery plan agreed with the trustees of the Umeco Scheme, additional contributions of £0.9 million (2010: £0.9 million) were payable. On 
completion of the disposal of the Supply Chain business the Company will pay £0.7 million to reduce the deficit. Total contributions outstanding 
at the year end were £0.5 million (2010: £0.6 million). The next actuarial valuation is due as at 1 April 2010. In the year to 31 March 2012, the Group 
expects to pay regular contributions of approximately £0.2 million, representing 26.3 per cent of pensionable salaries, additional contributions of 
£0.9 million and a special lump sum contribution of £0.7 million payable within 60 days of completion of the disposal of the Supply Chain business.
The Umeco Scheme also has a defined contribution section. Members of this section contribute between 2.0 per cent and 6.0 per cent of pensionable 
earnings with the Group making contributions of between 4.0 per cent and 10.0 per cent. Contributions amounting to £0.6 million (2010: £0.4 million) 
were payable to this section of the Umeco Scheme in the year, of which £23,000 (2010: £21,000) was outstanding at the year end.
The trustees of the Umeco Scheme are chaired by John Harper, formerly one of the Company’s Non-executive Directors, and an independent 
expert in pension matters attends meetings of the trustees. Responsibility for investment of the Umeco Scheme’s funds has been delegated  
by the trustees to professional investment managers.
The Advanced Composites Group of companies participate in the Advanced Composites Group Pension Scheme (‘the ACG Scheme’), which 
provides benefits on a defined benefit basis. The ACG Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2001. The assets of the ACG Scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group and responsibility for investment of the ACG Scheme’s funds has been delegated by the trustees to 
professional investment managers. Contribution rates are determined on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified 
actuary, with the objective of providing the funds required to meet pension obligations as they fall due. The trustees of the ACG Scheme are 
chaired by Jon Mabbitt, Group Managing Director of Umeco Composites – Structural Materials, and an independent expert in pension matters 
attends meetings of the trustees.
Contributions to the ACG Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of valuations, conducted at least every three 
years, using the projected unit method. The most recent valuation was as at 1 June 2008. The assumptions which have the most significant 
effects on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments before retirement (7.2 per cent per annum), the rate 
of return after retirement (5.45 per cent per annum), the rate of increase in salaries (4.8 per cent per annum) and the rate of pension increases 
(3.8 per cent per annum). The valuation adopted the PMA92 and PFA92 year of birth medium cohort tables as the basis for determining members’ 
mortality assumptions. The valuation showed that the actuarial value of the ACG Scheme’s assets was £6.9 million which represented 83.6 per 
cent of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The contributions  
of the Group and employees are 15.7 per cent and 8.7 per cent of earnings respectively. Regular contributions payable in respect of the year were 
£0.3 million (2010: £0.3 million). As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the trustees of the ACG Scheme, additional contributions of  
£0.4 million (2010: £0.4 million) were made. Total contributions outstanding at the year end were £25,000 (2010: £52,000). The next actuarial 
valuation is due as at 1 June 2011. In the year to 31 March 2012, the Group expects to pay regular contributions of approximately £0.3 million, 
representing 15.7 per cent of pensionable salaries, and additional contributions of approximately £0.4 million.
Certain of the Group’s UK businesses operate separate defined contribution arrangements for qualifying employees. Employer contributions are  
a maximum of 10.0 per cent and employees are encouraged to contribute at similar rates. Total contributions of £0.6 million (2010: £0.4 million) 
were payable in respect of the year.

The Group participates in defined contribution arrangements in respect of certain of its businesses outside the UK. Contributions to these 
schemes during the year totalled £0.9 million (2010: £0.6 million).
As described in the Remuneration Report, the Company makes payments to defined contribution arrangements in respect of the Executive 
Directors. In respect of Clive Snowdon, contributions of £147,000 (2010: £142,000) were payable to these arrangements, £12,000 of which  
was outstanding at the year end (2010: £12,000). In respect of Doug Robertson, contributions of £40,000 (2010: £38,000) were payable to these 
arrangements, £3,000 of which was outstanding at the year end (2010: £3,000). In addition in the year to 31 March 2011, Doug Robertson elected 
to have a proportion of his salary converted to additional pension contribution entitlement. Details of this conversion are set out in the 
Remuneration Report. Andrew Moss’ total pension contribution entitlement was £62,000 (2010: £60,000). Of this entitlement, pension 
contributions of £33,000 (2010: £33,000) were paid to the Umeco Scheme. Of the remaining entitlement of £29,000, £27,000 was paid into  
an independent SIPP arrangement, £nil of which was outstanding at the year end (2010: £2,000). The remaining pension contribution entitlement 
of £2,000 was converted to additional salary at Andrew Moss’ request. Details of this conversion are set out in the Remuneration Report.
IAS19
The information required for accounting in accordance with the requirements of IAS19 has been obtained by updating the actuarial valuations 
referred to above, which were carried out by independent qualified actuaries. Combined values are shown for the Umeco Scheme and the  
ACG Scheme.
The assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities are as follows:
       2011 2010 
       Per cent Per cent
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries       4.3 4.6
Rate of increase of pensions in payment – RPI      3.5 3.6
Rate of increase of pensions in payment – CPI      3.0 –
Discount rate       5.4 5.5
Inflation       3.5 3.6
The mortality basis used for these disclosures is in line with the basis used by the respective trustees at the most recent valuations, adjusted to 
reflect members’ dates of birth.
The mortality assumptions imply the following expected future lifetimes from age 65:
         2011 2010 
       Years Years
Males currently aged 65        22.4 22.1
Females currently aged 65        24.8 25.0 
Males currently aged 45        24.3 23.1
Females currently aged 45        26.7 25.9
The assumptions have been chosen by the Directors from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may 
not be borne out in practice.
The market values of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term, may be subject to significant change before 
they are realised. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on corporate bonds. The 
assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

31 March 2011 amounted to £1.8 million (2010: £0.9 million).
A claim for €3.2 million has been made against Advanced Composites Group (‘ACG’), part of the Structural Materials business stream, from 
MultiOne Design S.A. (‘MOD’) in respect of material supplied by ACG. ACG does not admit liability and the Group considers the likelihood of  
the claim being successful to be remote.

27 Financial risk management and financial instruments
(a) financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Directors review and agree the broad policies for all 
significant areas of financial management. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity 
risk and credit risk. The aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance 
and net assets. The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
(b) capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns  
for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure. The Group considers capital to be £245.9 million  
(2010: £258.0 million), being the sum of equity attributable to owners of the Company and net debt.
Overview Business Review
Financial
Statements Governance
Company
Information Directors 66 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
27 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) and 
interest cover. These measures are the principal financial covenants under the terms of the Group’s committed facilities with Lloyds Banking 
Group. The calculation of the net debt to EBITDA covenant involves the translation of both net debt and EBITDA at the average exchange rates  
for the period. For the purposes of these facilities, the value of these measures was as follows:
       2011 2010
Net debt to EBITDA  
Ratio of net debt to EBITDA       2.08 times 2.14 times
Covenant – ratio of net debt to EBITDA not to exceed      3.00 times 3.25 times
Interest cover  
Ratio of interest to profit before interest       5.78 times 4.97 times
Covenant – ratio of interest to profit before interest not to be less than    4.00 times 4.00 times
(c) market risk – foreign currency risk and exposure
The Group puts in place forward foreign exchange contracts where it is thought necessary to use such instruments to manage the exposure  
to foreign exchange movements. At 31 March 2011, the Group had 29 forward currency contracts outstanding (2010: 32 contracts) which had  
a total principal value of £6.0 million (2010: £4.6 million).
The principal foreign currencies in which the Group transacts and holds assets and liabilities are the US dollar and the Euro. A change in value of 
the US dollar resulting in a 5.0 per cent rise in the sterling: US dollar exchange rate would result in a decrease of £0.1 million (2010: £0.2 million 
decrease) in reported profit after tax and a reduction of £1.2 million (2010: £1.6 million reduction) in net assets. A change in value of the Euro 
resulting in a 5.0 per cent rise in the sterling: Euro exchange rate would result in a reduction of £0.1 million (2010: £nil) in reported profit before 
tax and a reduction of £0.6 million (2010: £0.5 million reduction) in net assets.
The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings denominated in foreign currencies is as follows:
       2011 2010 
       £m £m
US dollar       79.7 75.0
Euro       2.3 33.5
       82.0 108.5
Of the total foreign currency borrowing of £82.0 million (2010: £108.5 million), the amount of borrowing used for hedging the currency risk on 
retranslating overseas operations amounted to £77.0 million (2010: £81.4 million). The foreign exchange gain of £0.5 million (2010: £1.0 million) 
has been recognised in the translation reserve and in Other Comprehensive Income.
(d) market risk – interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. The effects of changes in interest rates 
could affect the Group’s future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments. It is the Group’s policy to maintain an appropriate balance 
between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide certainty as to the level of interest expense in the short-term and to 
reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term. Interest rate risk arises on floating rate debt, which comprises bank loans, 
on which interest is based on LIBOR, and cash at bank and overdrafts, on which interest is related to bank base rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge the Group’s exposure to movements in interest rates. At 31 March 2011, the Group had  
one such contract outstanding (2010: one contract). The notional amount of debt covered by the interest rate swap contract was £46.8 million 
(2010: £49.4 million). At 31 March 2011, the effective interest rate on the Group’s bank loans was 3.4 per cent (2010: 3.3 per cent) and the 
effective interest rate on lease finance obligations was 6.4 per cent (2010: 5.4 per cent).
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual financial expense charge 
by approximately £0.8 million (2010: £0.9 million), however the effect of the Group’s interest rate swap contracts would reduce this impact and 
would lead to a net increase of £0.5 million (2010: £0.2 million). A similar rise in respect of sterling denominated borrowings would increase the 
annual financial expense charge by approximately £0.4 million (2010: £0.5 million).

27 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued
(e) liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to 
ensure that sufficient cash and undrawn committed facilities are available to fund ongoing operations and to meet its medium term capital  
and funding obligations, and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
Management monitor liquidity in terms of meeting the banking covenants described in note 27(b). The committed borrowing facilities available 
to the Group are reviewed regularly and are designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels. At 31 March 2011, the principal borrowing 
facilities available to the Group comprised a US$150.0 million revolving credit facility due for repayment in June 2014, a US$89.0 million term  
loan facility due for repayment in August 2012 and a £10.0 million overdraft facility that is renewable annually.
(f) credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables and derivative financial instruments. Policies and procedures exist to ensure 
that customers have an appropriate level of credit according to their trading history. Derivative financial instruments are executed only with 
highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Trade & other receivables included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are stated net of a provision for impairment which has been estimated by 
management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. 
Receivables are written off against the provision when management consider that the debt is no longer recoverable. Details of changes in the 
provision are set out in note 14. For all financial instruments that are not impaired, a full recovery of their value is expected.
There are no indications as at 31 March 2011 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables 
recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that have not been provided for. For continuing operations there are £7.5 million (2010: £5.8 million) of 
trade receivables that are past due at 31 March 2011 that have not been provided against. While uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased 
due to the current economic climate, the Group considers that debtors will meet their payment obligations in respect of trade receivables recognised in

(h) total financial assets and liabilities
The table below sets out the Group’s accounting classification of its financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Under IAS39,  
all derivative financial instruments are derivatives at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. All transactions in 
derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage risks arising from underlying business activities.
For cash, the fair values are the same as the carrying value. For derivative financial instruments, fair values are obtained from the counterparty 
providing the instrument. For floating rate borrowings, fair values have been calculated by discounting the cash flows at appropriate prevailing 
market rates. Other assets and liabilities reflect management’s estimate of value on an appropriate basis.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value according to their valuation method. The different levels have been defined as 
follows:
Level 1: •  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: •   inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either as a direct price or indirectly 
derived from prices; and
Level 3: • inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

28 Accounting estimates and judgements
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk  
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of assumptions have been made, notably in 
relation to the expected return on plan assets, inflation and discount rates, mortality, salary increases and pension increases. These assumptions 
are largely dependent upon factors outside the Group’s control. Details of these assumptions are set out in note 24.
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of whether goodwill is impaired requires the conducting of an impairment test. Such tests involve an estimation of the future cash 
flows expected to be derived from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is attached, discounted using appropriate interest rates. These cash 
flows are dependent upon future trading performance, which in turn are partially dependent upon prevailing market and economic conditions that are 
outside the Group’s control. The impairment tests are therefore inherently judgemental and future events could cause the assumptions used in the 
impairment tests to change, with a consequent adverse effect on the future results of the Group. Details of impairment testing are set out in note 10.

Disposal of Supply Chain business
In accordance with IFRS5, the Supply Chain division of Umeco has been re-presented as held for sale. At 31 March 2011, the disposal group was 
deemed available for immediate sale in its current condition and the sale was highly probable, evidenced by the announcement made in February 
2011 regarding management’s intention to sell the disposal group and the sale announcement on 20 May 2011. On re-presentation as held for 
sale, the disposal Group was measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Management identified the fair value 
of the disposal Group to be £5.1 million less than its carrying amount and, along with costs to sell of £7.4 million, resulted in a loss on 
re-measurement of £12.5 million.
Valuation of inventories
The Group has a formal policy for making appropriate reserves to ensure inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. This 
policy requires assumptions to be made regarding future demand levels and these assumptions are partly dependent upon prevailing market and 
economic conditions, which are outside the Group’s control.
Valuation of intangible assets
A review is conducted in respect of each acquisition made by the Group to identify separable intangible assets. These may include customer 
relationships, contracts or orders on hand and product qualifications or approvals. The valuation of these assets is set out in note 10.
Provisions
The carrying value of the disposal provision is assessed at each balance sheet date based upon the latest available information in relation to 
expected future outflows regarding the environmental issues referred to in note 18. This information includes reports from the Group’s 
environmental consultants.

Information Directors 72 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and law and under historical cost 
accounting rules, except for derivative financial instruments which  
are stated at their fair values. A cash flow statement has not been 
presented as permitted by FRS1 (revised) ‘Cash Flow Statements’.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained in 
FRS8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ and has not disclosed transactions  
or balances with entities which form part of the Group. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, 
less provision for any impairment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost or valuation of 
tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives on a 
straight line basis as follows:
Freehold buildings   50 years
Plant, machinery, fixtures & IT equipment  3-10 years
Motor vehicles   3-4 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land.
Tax
The charge for tax is based on the profit for the year and takes into 
account tax deferred because of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes except as 
otherwise required by FRS19 ‘Deferred Tax’. Liabilities are calculated on a 
non-discounted full provision basis. Assets are recognised on the same 
basis, but only to the extent that it is probable they will be recovered.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
The Company has adopted the requirements of FRS29 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’ and has taken the exemption under that 
standard from disclosure on the grounds that the Group’s financial 
statements contain disclosures in compliance with IFRS7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’. The Company does not hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and the principal 
financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps. 
These instruments are used for managing interest rate exposures in 
line with the Group’s risk management policy. 
(a) bank loans & other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised  
at fair value less attributable transaction costs. All borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between 
the initial proceeds and the repayment value being recognised in the 
profit and loss account over the period to repayment.
(b) derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage  
financial risks associated with the Company’s business activities  
and the financing of those activities. Derivatives are initially  
recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into  
and subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair value,  
with any change in value being recognised in the profit and loss 
account. The Company does not apply hedge accounting in respect  
of these financial instruments.
The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to 
provide a hedge against foreign currency exposures. Interest rate swap 
contracts are used to hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in 
interest rates.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
(c) fair value hedge
Foreign currency borrowings (the hedging instrument) are treated as a 
fair value hedge against foreign currency investments (the hedged 
item). The hedging instrument is measured at fair value with changes 
in the fair value recognised in the profit and loss account. The hedged 
item is also re-measured with any change in the carrying value also 
being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Provisions
A provision is recognised on the Company Balance Sheet when the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and where it is probable that an outflow will be required to 
settle the obligation.
Impairment
The carrying values of investments are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any 
such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An 
impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an 
asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the 
value in use. In determining the value in use, estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that 
reflects the time value of money and risks specific to the asset being 
assessed. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss account and are not subsequently reversed.
Company Accounting Policies
For the year to 31 March 2011 73 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
Retirement benefit obligation
Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in accordance 
with the requirements of FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. The Company  
is a member of the defined benefit section of the Umeco Scheme. 
Since the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets 
and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the scheme is 
accounted for by the Company as if it was a defined contribution 
scheme. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are set out in note 24 
to the consolidated financial statements.
For defined contribution schemes, amounts payable by the Company 
are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
Share based payments
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 and not yet 
vested by 31 March 2004 are not recognised as an employee expense. 
Those granted since 1 April 2004 are expensed with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread 
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number  
of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to  
share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. Details of the 
Company’s share option schemes are set out in note 26 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the 
employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of 
investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share 
based payment charge recognised in its subsidiary’s financial 
statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly  
in equity. Amounts recharged to the subsidiaries are recognised as  
a reduction in the cost of investment in that subsidiary.

Fair values
Under FRS26, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are derivatives at fair value through the profit and loss account.  
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage risks arising from underlying business activities.
For cash, the fair values are the same as the carrying value. For derivative financial instruments, fair values are obtained from the counterparty 
providing the instrument. For floating rate borrowings, fair values have been calculated by discounting the cash flows at appropriate prevailing 
market rates. Other assets and liabilities reflect management’s estimate of value on an appropriate basis.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued
For the year to 31 March 2011 79 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
Non-executive Directors are encouraged to become familiar with  
the Group’s businesses and there is regular communication between 
executive management and Non-executive Directors. The Chairman  
is responsible for ensuring that Board meetings operate to an 
appropriate agenda and that adequate information is provided 
sufficiently in advance of meetings to allow proper consideration.  
He is supported by the Company Secretary, to whom all Directors  
have access. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board  
and audit committee. 
The Board has an agreed procedure for any Director to obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. Directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance is held by the Company and details have 
been circulated to the Directors.
The Board membership and that of its committees is designed to 
ensure that no one individual or group of individuals dominates 
proceedings and that the wide variety of skills allows effective 
leadership across the Group’s business activities. In view of the nature 
of the Group and the details shown in this Corporate Governance 
statement, the Board believes that the current number and balance  
of Directors is appropriate.
The Chairman and Directors regularly discuss matters informally 
outside of Board meetings. In addition, meetings of the Non-executive 
Directors are held annually, both with and without the Chairman being 
present. Such meetings are chaired by the Senior Independent Director.
The Senior Independent Director is responsible for appraising the 
performance of the Chairman and is available to meet shareholders to 
discuss concerns that they may have.
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman  
and Chief Executive, which is reflected in the Board’s Practices and 
Procedures document. In summary, the Chairman is responsible for the 
leadership and running of the Board but does not have any executive 
powers or responsibilities. The Chief Executive leads the executive 
management team in running the Group’s businesses and in 
implementing operating and strategic plans under authority delegated 
by the Board. During the year, the Group’s executive committee was 
comprised of Clive Snowdon, Doug Robertson and Andrew Moss as 
Executive Directors, Mike Giles as Group Operations Finance Director 
and Steve Bowers as Company Secretary.
Standing committees of the Board
The principal standing committees of the Board are the audit 
committee, the remuneration committee and the nomination 
committee. Each of these committees operates under written terms  
of reference which clearly set out their respective delegated 
responsibilities and authorities, copies of which are available from the 
Company Secretary or on the Company’s website www.umeco.com.
Statement of compliance
The Board is firmly committed to ensuring business integrity and  
high ethical values across the Group’s operations. As an essential  
part of this commitment, the Board supports high standards of 
corporate governance and has a policy of seeking to comply with  
the recommendations of the Combined Code (the ‘Code’). Details of 
the mechanisms used by the Company to achieve compliance with  
the Code are shown in this Corporate Governance statement  
and in the Remuneration Report.
The Company was fully compliant with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year, except that the Company did not have a Senior 
Independent Director from 1 April 2010 until 30 April 2010, when 
Adrian Auer was appointed as a Non-executive Director and new 
Senior Independent Director.
The Board
Following the appointment of Adrian Auer as Non-executive Director 
on 30 April 2010, the Board consisted of eight Directors: five Non-
executive and three Executive. 
During the period from 1 April 2010 to 29 April 2010, the Board 
consisted of seven Directors: four Non-executive and three Executive. 
The names, roles and biographical details of the Directors are set out 
on pages 24 and 25. 
Each of the Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, is free 
from any business or other relationship which could materially 
interfere with the exercise of his judgement. Each of the Non-executive 
Directors is considered by the Board to be independent.
The Board maintains a Practices and Procedures document which  
sets out the Board’s key administrative processes used to ensure 
information is provided to the Board and its committees to enable 
them to fulfil their roles properly. The Practices and Procedures 
document was updated by the Board in February 2008. The document 
contains the list of matters reserved for the Board which has been 
compiled to ensure that the Board is made aware of all matters that 
are appropriate for it to consider, and has also been communicated to 
the management of the Group’s companies to enable them to manage 
their operations within a clearly defined framework of control. Matters 
reserved for the Board include major investment decisions and changes 
in the composition of the Group. The Board approves the Group’s 
strategic plan, which includes financial and operational objectives, and 
considers detailed financial and operational reports on the progress of 
the Group. Senior executives below Board level are invited to attend 
certain Board meetings to make presentations and participate  
in discussions. Authority has been delegated to the executive 
management team to deal with specific matters, including capital 
expenditure, contract approval, acquisitions and disposals at certain 
levels as determined by the Board.

Disposal of Supply Chain
The disposal of the Supply Chain business has been managed by an independent committee of the Board, established during the year to  
31 March 2011. This committee comprised all Board members other than Clive Snowdon and Doug Robertson. This composition was a 
consequence of Clive Snowdon and Doug Robertson having expressed an interest in participating in a management buy-out of the Supply Chain 
business supported by one of the bidders for the business whose bid was ultimately unsuccessful. The Company is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and, to ensure no conflicts of interest arose, the independent committee was established with responsibility for all 
matters relating to the disposal process. The independent committee was advised by N M Rothschild & Sons Limited. 
The disposal process has involved the commitment of significant resources to ensure the process and associated risks have been properly 
managed. This has led to the Chairman committing significant additional time to his work with the Group. There have been no changes in the 
Chairman’s external commitments which have affected his ability to perform his role with the Group and Neil Johnson has therefore been able  
to commit a significantly higher proportion of his time to the Group in order to manage and support the disposal process. Neil Johnson is 
chairman of the independent committee and Steve Bowers is secretary to the independent committee.
The independent committee met on 14 occasions during the year to 31 March 2011. Each meeting was fully attended, other than by Stephen Bird 
who attended 11 of the 14 meetings.
Meetings and attendance
The Directors ensure the effectiveness of the Board through the holding of regular Board meetings and by having open lines of communication 
between all Board members. During the year to 31 March 2011, the Board met nine times. The audit committee met on three occasions and  
the remuneration committee met four times. The nomination committee met twice during the year.
The following table shows the level of attendance by each of the Directors at meetings of the Board and its principal standing committees in the 
year to 31 March 2011:

Audit committee
The audit committee is chaired by Graham Zacharias. At 31 March 2011, the committee‘s other members are Stephen Bird and Adrian Auer. 
Adrian Auer was appointed a member of the committee on 30 April 2010. Graham Zacharias is a chartered accountant with recent and relevant 
financial experience and Stephen Bird and Adrian Auer are senior business executives who have significant experience of corporate financial 
matters. The members of the audit committee ensure that their knowledge of relevant legislation and best practice developments is maintained. 
The committee received reports from the external auditor who attended the committee’s meetings. The committee also calls upon the Finance 
Director and Company Secretary to attend portions of its meetings. The committee’s work included reviewing the financial statements, 
accounting policies and significant areas of judgement. The committee also assessed the proposed external audit approach and the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor. In assessing auditor independence the committee obtained confirmation from the external 
auditor that its ethics and independence policies complied with the requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and 
Wales. The use of the auditor for non-audit work is monitored by the committee. The Board’s approval is required prior to the Company’s external 
auditor undertaking significant due diligence or similar project-based advisory work for the Group. The Board and audit committee continue to 
believe that there are certain non-audit services where it is more efficient and more cost effective for the external auditor to be used. These 
include conducting financial due diligence in respect of potential acquisition opportunities and vendor due diligence in relation to the disposal  
of the Supply Chain business. Details of the amounts paid to the auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 46. During the year, the Company appointed Deloitte LLP as its tax advisor.
Corporate Governance continued  81 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
Nomination committee
The Board recognises the need to refresh its membership and properly 
manage the process by which new Directors are appointed. The 
nomination committee is responsible for identifying and selecting 
candidates to fill Board vacancies for both Executive and Non-
executive positions. The committee also keeps under review the 
structure, size and composition of the Board, to ensure the Board 
continues to have an appropriate balance of skills and experience.  
The committee comprises all members of the Board, other than the 
Director whose replacement is being selected. The Chairman of the 
Company is normally chairman of the committee, other than when  
the Chairman’s replacement is being selected, in which case the  
Senior Independent Director shall chair the committee. 
Where appropriate, the nomination committee uses the services  
of external recruitment consultants. Details of potential candidates 
provided by consultants may be initially reviewed by a sub-committee 
of the nomination committee and meetings with selected candidates 
are then held with Directors. Subsequently, the nomination committee 
meets to discuss and confirm an appointment.
In conjunction with the Company Secretary, the committee will ensure 
that on appointment to the Board, Non-executive Directors receive a 
formal letter of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of 
them in terms of time commitment, including committee service and 
involvement outside Board meetings, and will ensure they receive an 
adequate introduction to the Group and its activities, including site 
visits to the Group’s principal operations. The nomination committee 
also reviews the Company’s succession plans. 
The Board as a whole also considers this subject and considers 
succession planning for senior Corporate executives, with the 
nomination committee focusing specifically on succession planning  
for members of the Board.
The nomination committee met twice during the year. The committee 
met once in relation to the appointment of Adrian Auer as a Director. In 
addition, the committee met in relation to the potential changes in the 
constitution of the Executive Directors resulting from the disposal of the 
Supply Chain business. These meetings were chaired by Neil Johnson.
Investor relations
The Annual General Meeting is recognised by the Board as an 
important opportunity to meet and communicate with shareholders, 
particularly private investors. The 2010 Annual General Meeting  
was held on 28 July 2010 and was chaired by Neil Johnson. The 
meeting was attended by all of the Directors. The Chairman of the 
meeting encouraged debate and questions at the formal meeting and 
informally during refreshments afterwards.
The responsibilities and objectives of the audit committee are set  
out in the committee’s terms of reference, which are summarised  
as follows:
to review the financial statements of the Group and report on • 
matters of significance to the Board, particularly any changes in 
accounting policies and practices, major judgemental areas and 
significant adjustments arising from the external audit;
to be responsible for the appointment, re-appointment and removal • 
of the Company’s external auditor, subject to consultation with the  
Board and shareholder approval, and to oversee the relationship 
with the external auditor;
to review the audit planning process and scope of work performed • 
by the external auditor; and
to review the Company’s internal financial control system and risk • 
management systems and to periodically review the need for an 
internal audit function, unless these have been expressly addressed 
by the Board itself.
An annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s system  
of internal controls was conducted in March 2011. The Board reviewed 
changes in significant risks, the scope and quality of the ongoing 
monitoring of risks, the extent and frequency of the communication  
of the results of the monitoring to the Board and the incidence of 
significant control failings.
Three audit committee meetings were held during the year. These 
considered the results of the interim and full year audit processes,  
and also considered the planning and scope for the auditor’s work  
in respect of these financial statements. 
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by Stephen Bird. The committee’s 
other members are Graham Zacharias and Chris Hole. In order to avoid any 
compromise in the activities of the remuneration committee, the 
chairman of the committee takes responsibility for minuting meetings. 
The committee’s main responsibilities are to determine the specific 
remuneration packages of the Chairman, Executive Directors and 
Company Secretary including salaries, annual bonus and longer term 
incentive schemes, pensions and other benefits. Further information on 
the structure of remuneration implemented by the committee is 
contained in the Remuneration Report, which also contains further details 
of the work of the committee. There is a separate Non-executive Directors’ 
remuneration committee which has responsibility for reviewing the 
remuneration of the Non-executive Directors. The members of the 
Non-executive Directors’ remuneration committee are the Chairman, 
Chief Executive and Finance Director. This committee met four times 
during the year. Until 30 April 2010, there was a separate Chairman’s 
remuneration committee which had responsibility for reviewing the 
remuneration of the Chairman. The Chairman’s remuneration committee 
comprised the Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director and chairman 
of the remuneration committee. This committee met once on 30 April 
2010. Since that date, responsibility for the Chairman’s remuneration has 
been transferred to the remuneration committee.

Each substantially separate issue was put to the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting as an individual motion and the meeting was invited to adopt 
and approve the financial statements and the Directors’ Report for the 
year to 31 March 2010. A separate resolution for the approval of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report was also put to the meeting. Notice of 
the 2010 Annual General Meeting was sent to shareholders more than 
twenty working days in advance of the meeting and the level of proxy 
votes lodged for and against each resolution, together with details of 
abstentions, were disclosed at the meeting. After the conclusion of 
each Annual General Meeting the results in respect of every resolution 
are published through a Regulatory Information Service and on the 
Company’s website. Full details are also available upon request from 
the Company Secretary. In addition to the Annual Report, the Company 
produces an interim report which is sent to shareholders and publishes 
interim management statements in the second and fourth quarters  
of its financial year. The Group’s website, www.umeco.com, includes 
copies of certain key presentations made by senior management, 
recent annual and interim reports, press releases and links to the 
websites of the Group’s businesses.
The Board as a whole seeks to maintain a thorough understanding of 
the issues and concerns of major shareholders. Dialogue is maintained 
with shareholders and the Executive Directors regularly meet with 
institutional investors. The Chief Executive and Finance Director have 
primary responsibility for investor relations and updates on this subject 
are provided at all Board meetings. In addition, copies of analyst 
research notes and regular reports from the Company’s corporate 
broking advisors are provided to the Board. The Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and other Non-executive Directors will consider 
requests for meetings with shareholders.
Board induction, development, evaluation and re-appointment
The Company ensures that all new Directors receive a tailored 
introduction to the Group and its activities, including site visits to the 
Group’s principal operations. In addition to the reporting contained in 
papers provided to the Board each month, members of the executive 
committee provide regular input at meetings to help keep the Board 
up-to-date with matters of significance to the Group. Board meetings 
are held at the Group’s principal operating units on a rolling basis, most 
recently in May 2011 at the facilities of Advanced Composites Group in 
Heanor and Non-executive Directors are encouraged to make 
additional visits to the Group’s operations in order to ensure their 
knowledge remains current. The training and continuing professional 
development needs of Directors are kept under review with ongoing 
training being provided as necessary. The Group seeks to ensure that 
the composition of the Board results in Board members having a 
diverse mix of backgrounds, including executive and non-executive 
positions, and with perspectives of relevance to the Group, including 
experience of the Group’s markets, financing and investor experience.
Formal evaluations of the performance of the Board and its 
committees are conducted annually. The most recent evaluation  
was made in March 2011 by the Chairman in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary. The evaluation took into account the views  
of each of the Directors on a wide range of matters, including the 
performance of the Board, its committees and the Directors, and 
matters relating to the leadership and culture of the Group. The  
results of the evaluation process are compiled and summarised by  
the Company Secretary, and then reported to the Board. Where 
required, the Board has then acted in order to enhance further the 
effectiveness of the Board’s procedures and working practices.
Each new appointee to the Board is required to stand for re-appointment 
at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. In 
addition, any Director who held office at the time of the two preceding 
Annual General Meetings and who did not retire at either of them, and 
any Non-executive Director who has been in office for a period of nine 
years or more will automatically stand for re-appointment.
The re-appointment of Graham Zacharias, which will be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting, has been rigorously reviewed by the 
nomination committee. Graham has been a Non-executive Director 
since September 2005.
The Board considers that each of the Directors seeking re-appointment 
at the 2011 Annual General Meeting should be supported by 
shareholders since each of these Directors continues to be effective and 
demonstrates commitment to his role.
Financial reporting
Nature of the Group
The Group has a clear organisational structure and well established 
reporting and control disciplines. Directors of the Group’s operating 
companies assume responsibility for, and exercise a high degree of 
autonomy in, running day-to-day trading activities. These activities  
are conducted within a framework of clear rules, authority limits and 
policies regarding business conduct, which are documented in the 
Group’s Policies & Procedures Manual. The Manual sets out minimum 
standards for accounting systems and controls, and has been made 
available on the Group’s intranet to ensure all appropriate staff have 
ready access to its content. Certified quarterly reports are required 
from operating company management which confirm compliance  
with the Group’s key internal controls.
In view of the devolved nature of the Group, and the disciplines 
referred to above, the Company does not require an extensive  
head office function nor is it appropriate for it to operate with  
a large number of Executive Directors. The Board considers these  
to be commercial strengths for the Group and they have been 
important factors in the Board’s assessment of its Corporate 
Governance arrangements.
Through monthly Board meetings held by each operating company, the 
Executive Directors maintain close and frequent contact with 
operating company management. In addition to financial performance, 
the reporting made by operating companies covers non-financial 
matters, notably health & safety and the environment. The reporting 
includes key performance indicators relevant for each operating 
company. Summaries of the Group’s key performance indicators are 
provided to the Board each month.
Corporate Governance continued  83 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
All operating companies prepare rolling forecasts extending for four 
calendar quarters and a strategic plan, which includes projections for 
the next three financial years. These are reviewed in detail by the 
Executive Directors and are consolidated for review and approval  
by the Board. Performance against forecast is continually monitored  
by the Executive Directors, reviewed at monthly meetings of the 
executive committee and reported to all meetings of the Board.
Systems of internal control
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied 
with the Combined Code provisions on internal control. The Company 
has in place risk assessment processes and established procedures 
necessary to implement the Turnbull Committee guidance, as updated 
by the Financial Reporting Council, and for reporting in accordance 
with that guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of  
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role  
of management is to implement Board policies on risk and control.  
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can  
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group, which has been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls during the year, including strategic, operational,  
legal and compliance, risk management and financial controls. The 
processes used by the Board for their review include the following:
the Board receives regular reports from management which • 
highlight any material control weaknesses and discusses actions 
taken on weaknesses identified by management;
the audit committee, based on reports provided by the external • 
auditor, reviews the effectiveness of the internal financial control 
system, and any significant matters are referred to the Board for 
consideration. The chairman of the audit committee reports the 
outcome of the audit committee meetings to the Board; and 
the Board considers all significant financing and investment • 
opportunities relating to the Group, including the granting of 
guarantees, and monitors policy in respect of managing treasury  
and exchange risks.
Consistent with the Turnbull Committee guidance, the Group’s 
management operated a risk management process during the year 
which identifies the key risks facing each of the Group’s businesses, 
and reports to the Board on how those risks are being addressed. This 
is based on each business producing a report on business development 
policy and a risk register, which identifies the key risks facing the 
business, the probability of those risks occurring and the actions being 
taken to mitigate those risks to the desired level.
These reports are combined to provide the Board with a report of the 
significant risks faced by the Group as a whole, together with details  
of the controls in place over those risks.
Whistleblowing policy
The Group is committed to the highest standards of openness and 
accountability and encourages its members of staff to raise genuine 
concerns about malpractice at the earliest practicable stage rather 
than wait for proof. The Group Policies & Procedures Manual 
encourages concerns to be disclosed, in confidence, orally or in writing, 
to the Group Operations Finance Director or the Company Secretary. 
The Group will take appropriate action against any person victimising 
another for using this procedure or deterring any person from 
reporting genuine concerns under it.
Internal audit
The Group does not have a separate internal audit function, however 
the central finance department conducts detailed reviews of the 
financial records and controls of the Group’s operating companies.  
The results of these reviews are provided to the Board and the external 
auditor. The Board periodically reviews the need for a separate internal 
audit function and has done so during 2011. In light of the reviews 
carried out by the central finance department, the current conclusion  
of the Board is that a separate internal audit function is not necessary.
Through the procedures outlined above, the Board has considered all 
significant aspects of internal control for the year and up to the date  
of this Annual Report. The Board believes that the Group’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
risk, provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Corporate social responsibility
The Board takes account of social, environmental and ethical 
considerations when managing the Group and when considering new 
investment opportunities. This is monitored as part of the Group’s 
annual risk assessment process. The direct environmental impact  
of the Group’s activities is limited, however the Group considers the 
environmental impact of all significant investment opportunities  
and is engaged in a continuing effort to improve the environmental 
performance of all of its businesses. The Group aims to reduce its 
impact on the environment by controlling energy usage, which  
may be achieved by avoiding any unnecessary expenditure,  
improving cost-effectiveness or taking any other appropriate  
steps to reduce energy consumption levels.

Health & safety remains a key component of the Group’s corporate 
social responsibility strategy. Reporting of health & safety matters is 
made to the Board every month. The Group’s health & safety policy 
statement is regularly updated and circulated to the Group’s operating 
companies. Specialist staff at each of these companies ensure 
compliance with this statement. Root cause analysis and similar 
investigative work is carried out following all health & safety incidents. 
The Group maintains accident reporting systems which are primarily 
used to identify trends with a view to developing strategies for 
reducing the number of accidents. There were no major health & 
safety incidents during the year to 31 March 2011.
The Group’s current system of risk management and control, which 
includes social responsibility matters, is led by each of the Group’s 
operations. Senior staff at these companies are responsible for 
complying with the relevant environmental regulations in all the 
geographical areas in which they operate. During the year they 
reported to the Board on such issues through the Chief Operating 
Officer, who has ultimate responsibility for such matters, as part of the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management reporting. 
Overall the Group continues to believe that its activities have a limited 
environmental impact. However, the Group recognises that it has a 
responsibility to understand the impact that its activities have at local, 
national and global level. These have been monitored and assessed, 
and solutions have been implemented as appropriate according to best 
practice, local legal and other requirements.
The Group continues to focus attention on areas where its impact on 
stakeholders is most beneficial, by delivering an improved and more 
secure environment for our employees, customers and suppliers, and 
by operating ethically as an international Group. The Group’s values 
statements, set out below, are key to the Group’s success and the way 
in which it conducts business:
build with integrity, fairness and trust; •

Employment
Employment policies throughout the Group have been established  
to comply with relevant legislation and codes of practice relating  
to employment, health & safety and equal opportunities. The  
Group provides high quality working environments and facilities for 
employees, and training and development appropriate to each of their 
roles. The Group does not discriminate against employees in any way 
and provides a competitive range of employee benefits. The Group 
keeps employees informed on matters relating to their employment 
and on financial and economic factors affecting the Group. This is 
achieved through management briefings, the Group’s website and  
by distribution of press releases and internal announcements. This 
enables employees to gain a better understanding of the Group’s 
business objectives and their roles in achieving them. Building and 
developing the skills, competencies, motivation and teamwork of 
employees is recognised by the Board as being key to achieving the 
Group’s business objectives. The Group places importance on the 
contributions to be made by all employees to the progress of the  
Group and aims to keep them informed by the use of formal and 
informal meetings.
The Group’s commitment to rewarding employees and valuing 
qualities such as determination are enshrined in the Group’s values 
statements. Encouragement is given to all UK employees to participate 
in the Group’s SAYE Share Option Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) under which 
options over the Company’s shares are granted to employees who 
enter into contracts to save agreed amounts each month. The most 
recent invitation under the Scheme was made in July 2009 and further 
invitations are planned.
Ability and aptitude are the determining factors in the selection, 
training, career development and promotion of all employees. The 
Group provides a range of training and development opportunities for 
employees, including induction training, health & safety training and 
support with programmes leading to relevant professional or academic 
qualifications, in addition to specific training related to the role of  
each employee. The Group recognises its responsibility under the UK’s 
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and does not discriminate against 
disabled people. If an employee is, or becomes, disabled during their 
period of employment, the Group will, if necessary and to the extent 
possible, adapt the working environment to enable the employee to 
continue in their current position or retrain the employee for duties 
suited to their abilities following disablement. It continues to be the 
Group’s policy to consider applications for employment from disabled 
people on the same basis as other potential employees.
Corporate Governance continued  85 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
Health & safety training is part of the induction process for new 
employees. Specific training is given where relevant, for example 
regarding forklift truck operation and chemical handling, as well  
as fire safety and first aid matters.
Risk assessments are used in all parts of the Group, with these  
being updated on a regular basis and also when new equipment  
or machinery is acquired or new processes are introduced.
Going concern
A review of Group business activities and future outlook is set out  
on pages 8 to 23 which includes the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Review and Finance Director’s Review. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position is shown  
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and accompanying notes to the financial statements. The 
principal business risks associated with the business are shown on 
pages 20 to 22. In addition, note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s bank facilities with Lloyd’s Banking Group amount to 
£159.1 million. This comprises a US$150.0 million committed revolving 
facility which extends to June 2014, a US$89.0 million term loan facility 
expiring in August 2012 and an overdraft facility of £10.0 million. 
The Group has entered into an agreement for a new five-year 
committed multi currency revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc 
and Santander UK plc, comprising £15.0 million, US$15.0 million and 
US$10.0 million facilities. Utilisation of the facility is conditional on, 
inter alia, completion of the disposal of the Supply Chain business and 
notices of prepayment being delivered to Lloyds Banking Group in 
respect of the facilities referred to above.
After considering the nature and duration of these facilities and 
making appropriate enquiries, based on the strength of the Group’s 
balance sheet, current expectations of future trading (based on future 
cash flow forecasts and revenue projections which the Directors 
believe are based on a realistic assessment of future business 
performance) and on the facilities available to the Group, the Directors 
believe they have reasonable grounds for stating that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Environment
Umeco operates at the leading edge of environmental change in its 
principal markets, with the Group’s advanced composite materials and 
services being used to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.  
The Group’s customers operate in industries that demand high 
environmental standards from their suppliers and the Group 
continually raises its standards in response. 
Well established environmental management systems and 
comprehensive policies are in place. The Group strives to make 
continuous improvements to its usage of natural resources, in areas 
such as recycling and the efficient use of energy and water. Recycling 
processes have been in use in the Group for many years, and recycled 
materials are used where possible. Improvements to reduce the 
environmental impact of the Group’s operations are regularly 
implemented. Further details are set out on page 23.
Community impact and involvement
The Group encourages employees to support local worthwhile causes 
and charities, and ensures that the Group’s operations cause minimal 
negative impact within the community. In common with all 
companies, the Group has limited resources and the amount of money 
available for charitable purposes varies over time.
Relationships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders
The Group recognises the obligations it has towards the parties with 
whom it has business dealings including customers, shareholders, 
employees, suppliers and advisors. Dealings with these parties  
depend upon the honesty and integrity of the Group’s staff and every 
effort is made to ensure that a high standard of expertise and business 
principles is maintained in such dealings. Where appropriate, training  
is given to maintain and to raise standards.
The Group’s policy towards suppliers is that each operating company is 
responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions under which they 
trade with suppliers. Once terms are agreed, payments to suppliers are 
made in accordance with those terms and conditions, subject always 
to the supplier having complied with them.

Governance 86 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board 
and sets out the remuneration policy and details of the remuneration 
of each Director in respect of the year to 31 March 2011. The Report 
will be put to the 2011 Annual General Meeting for approval  
by shareholders.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by Stephen Bird and the 
committee’s other members are Graham Zacharias and Chris Hole.  
The committee has access to the Company’s professional advisors and 
is empowered to seek further independent professional advice if this is 
required. The committee is responsible for all aspects of the 
remuneration packages of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and 
certain other members of senior management. The members of the 
committee have no personal financial interest in the Company, other 
than as shareholders and in respect of the fees received in their 
capacity as Non-executive Directors. They have no day-to-day 
involvement in the management of the Group nor do they have any 
potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and they 
do not participate in any form of performance related pay or pension 
arrangements. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Company Secretary 
may attend meetings of the remuneration committee by invitation.  
No Executive Director or other attendee participates in discussions 
relating to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy is set by the Board as a whole with the 
remuneration committee then working within this policy to set 
individual levels of remuneration. The aim of the policy is for the Group 
to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives by rewarding 
them with competitive salary, benefit and incentive packages which 
are linked to performance and which are designed to enhance the 
business and the creation of shareholder value. The remuneration 
committee uses the services of Deloitte LLP, whom it appoints to 
provide remuneration advice and salary benchmarking data. During 
the year, Deloitte LLP also provided corporate tax advisory services to 
the Group.
During the year to 31 March 2010, the remuneration committee 
reviewed the structure of Executive Directors’ remuneration and 
concluded that changes be made for the year to 31 March 2011 and 
beyond. These changes are designed to strengthen alignment of 
management and shareholder interests, as well as to bring the total 
remuneration package more in line with market practice. These 
changes have been implemented during the year to 31 March 2011  
and comprised: 
the introduction of a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), which was • 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2010 Annual General 
Meeting. Typically the PSP will operate with an annual award of 50 
per cent of salary in performance shares. It is currently intended 
that, in respect of awards made under the PSP, half will be subject 
to EPS growth targets and half will be subject to relative Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance;
the introduction of a shareholding guideline of 1 x salary for • 
Executive Directors. Holdings of deferred shares will be taken into 
account when determining status against this guideline; and
a reduction in the maximum opportunity under the annual • 
performance related bonus (the ‘Umeco Bonus Plan’) from  
150 per cent of salary to 125 per cent of salary. The amount 
deferred under the Umeco Bonus Plan has been reduced from  
three fifths of the total bonus entitlement to two fifths of the  
total bonus entitlement.
Taken together, the remuneration committee considers that these 
changes in remuneration package for Executive Directors will create 
greater alignment with shareholders interests.
The following sections set out the elements of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors. Senior managers below Board level 
have similar arrangements.
Basic salaries
The basic salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually with 
effect from 1 April, or when a change in the scope of an Executive 
Director’s role occurs. The remuneration committee does not have
a formal positioning policy for basic salary levels as it is aware of the 
issues arising from the setting of salary levels solely by reference to a 
benchmark. Instead, when reviewing salaries, the committee
uses external salary information and also takes into account the 
performance of the Group, the calibre of the individual and their 
contribution to the success of the Group. The committee considers
market data for executives of comparable status and skills in 
companies of similar size and complexity. At the Executive’s choosing 
and subject to the approval of the remuneration committee, salary 
may be converted into additional employer pension contributions.
Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind provided are primarily a fully expensed company car 
and private medical insurance. Directors may choose to forego the 
company car benefit in return for an additional payment of salary,  
such payment being calculated so as to leave the Company no worse 
off from the change.
Annual performance related bonus
Executive Directors participate in the Umeco Bonus Plan. The 
performance targets set under the Umeco Bonus Plan are integrated 
with financial projections, prepared at the start of the year. 
Performance targets are reviewed in detail to ensure that they are 
sufficiently stretching and that they continue to be aligned with the 
Group’s strategy and the creation of shareholder value. Performance 
targets used in respect of the year to 31 March 2011 comprise targets 
in respect of the Group’s adjusted profit before tax (50 per cent of 
total entitlement), the Group’s working capital to sales ratio (25 per 
cent of total entitlement) and personal objectives determined with 
regard to the responsibilities of each Executive Director (25 per cent  
of total entitlement). Certain of the personal objectives include 
financial targets.
Remuneration Report  87 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
For the year to 31 March 2011, in line with the changes to the structure 
of remuneration referred to earlier, Executive Directors were eligible for 
a maximum award of 125 per cent of basic salary. Three fifths of the 
total value of any award is paid in cash (i.e. up to a maximum of  
75 per cent of basic salary) and the remaining two fifths is delivered  
in the form of a deferred award in the Company’s shares (i.e. up to a 
maximum of 50 per cent of basic salary).
Although awards of deferred shares will have been earned as a result 
of performance in a particular year, full entitlement to these shares is 
deferred, normally until the third anniversary of the award date. An 
Executive Director whose employment ceases during this three year 
period, other than for reasons acceptable to the committee, will forfeit 
their right to the deferred shares. Payments under the Umeco Bonus 
Plan are non-pensionable. Any shares required in respect of these 
deferred share arrangements will be acquired in the market and no 
new shares will be allotted.
PSP
Following shareholder approval at the Company’s 2010 Annual General 
Meeting, Executive Directors will participate in the PSP. Typically, an 
award of 50 per cent of salary will be made annually in performance 
shares under the PSP. It is intended that for initial awards, half of the 
award will be subject to EPS growth targets and half of the award will 
be subject to relative TSR performance against an appropriate 
comparator group, in each case adopting stretching performance 
criteria. Performance against these targets will be assessed over a 
three year period.
Initially, it is intended that the following targets will apply to PSP 
awards:
for the EPS portion, 25 per cent will vest for EPS growth of RPI + 5.0 • 
per cent per annum over the three year performance period and 100 
per cent will vest for EPS growth of RPI + 10.0 per cent per annum 
over the same three year performance period; and
for the TSR portion, 25 per cent will vest for median performance • 
over the three year performance period against the FTSE Industrial 
Goods and Services index and 100 per cent will vest for upper 
quartile performance. 
Straight-line pro-rating will apply for EPS and TSR performance 
between these points.
The PSP enables executives to earn shares in the Company based on 
the achievement of stretching performance conditions. Participation  
in the PSP will be offered to Executive Directors and certain selected 
members of the Group’s senior executive management team. Award 
levels to participants below Executive Director level will be 
appropriately scaled to reflect their role.
It had been intended that the first awards under the PSP would be 
granted in July 2010, immediately following shareholder approval. 
However work ongoing at that date in relation to the disposal of the 
Supply Chain business meant that, following the guidelines of the 
Model Code, the granting of awards at that time was not possible. No 
PSP awards have therefore been made in the year to 31 March 2011. In 
order that executives are not disadvantaged as a result of the delay in 
making the first PSP awards, it is intended that these awards will be 
made following the publication of the Company’s results in respect of 
the year to 31 March 2011. These awards will be structured on the 
same basis as they would have been had the awards been granted in 
July 2010, i.e. they will have a value of 50 per cent of executives salary 
levels at that date and the number of shares comprising the award will 
be calculated using share price levels prevailing at that time. These 
initial awards will include performance targets based upon the three 
year period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013. 
A second grant of PSP awards is intended to be made following 
publication of the Company’s results in respect of the year to  
31 March 2011, and will represent the 2011 grant cycle. These awards 
will be determined based upon 50 per cent of salary at the date of 
grant, using the share price prevailing at that time. These second 
awards will include performance targets in line with the terms set out 
earlier in this report, with these targets being assessed based upon the 
three year period from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2014.
Under the rules of the PSP , the maximum face value of PSP awards 
granted to a participant in any financial year may not exceed 100 per 
cent of their salary at the date of grant, other than in exceptional 
circumstances as determined by the remuneration committee, in which 
case the maximum would be 150 per cent. The committee considers 
that the delay in granting first awards under the PSP due to the disposal 
of the Supply Chain business represents an exceptional circumstance.
Chairman’s 2010 Share Award Plan (‘SAP’)
At the Company’s 2010 Annual General Meeting, shareholders 
approved the SAP which is a specific share incentive arrangement  
for the Chairman. This new share matching plan is designed to align 
the Chairman’s interests with shareholders and also to incentivise  
him and reward him for superior performance of the Company. The 
remuneration committee consider that the targets are challenging and 
any rewards for the Chairman will thus be linked to material increases 
in shareholder value. Conditional on the Chairman purchasing 50,000 
ordinary shares in the Company (which he has already purchased), he 
will receive a matching share award up to 300,000 shares. In order for 
these shares to vest both a share price condition and a TSR condition 
must be satisfied and he must continue to hold his own shareholding 
and generally remain appointed by the Company until 19 October 
2012, which is the normal vesting date for the award. The award does 
not form part of pensionable earnings. No further similar awards can 
be made under the SAP.
The award will normally vest on 19 October 2012 subject to continued 
appointment, and the satisfaction of the share price and TSR 
performance conditions. The share price condition is that the average 
closing share price over the period of 60 consecutive days ending on 
19 October 2012 exceeds the share price in the table below (‘Share 
Price Condition’):

The number of Award Shares will be calculated on a straight line basis 
for other share prices (based on an additional 619 shares for every 1p rise 
in the share price above the relevant threshold). The final number of 
Award Shares is then subject to scaling pursuant to the TSR Condition. 
The TSR condition is that the Company’s performance measured 
against the TSR for the FTSE Small Cap Index over the three year period 
ending on 19 October 2012 will be as follows (‘TSR Condition’):
Top decile (91-100)    100 per cent
76-90    75 per cent
61-75    62.5 per cent

In common with the PSP, it had been intended that the award to  
be made under the SAP would be granted in July 2010, immediately 
following shareholder approval. However work ongoing at that date 
in relation to the disposal of the Supply Chain business meant that, 
following the guidelines of the Model Code, the granting of the 
award at that time was not possible. The award under the SAP has 
therefore not been made in the year to 31 March 2011. It is intended 
that this award will be made following the publication of the 
Company’s results in respect of the year to 31 March 2011.
Share options
Executive options
Executive Directors have been eligible to participate in the Umeco 
2001 Share Option Plan (‘2001 Plan’) under which options were 
granted at the prevailing market price at the time of grant, and were 
not normally exercisable before the expiry of three years from the date 
of grant. Options were not exercisable more than ten years after the 
date of grant. In line with the remuneration policy detailed in this 
report, no further grants of options are planned to be made under the 
2001 Plan and no options were outstanding as at 31 March 2010 or 
31 March 2011. When granting options under the 2001 Plan, the 
remuneration committee took into account the salary level of the 
individuals concerned.
SAYE Share Option Scheme
The Group’s SAYE Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE Scheme’) is open to 
Directors spending at least 25 hours per week on Group business. 
Options under the SAYE Scheme are exercisable during a six month 
period commencing three years from the date of grant.
Directors’ pension entitlements
Details of Executive Directors pension entitlements are shown  
below. Executive Directors may convert an element of their pension 
entitlement into salary, or convert an element of their salary into 
pension contributions. All such conversions are subject to the approval 
of the remuneration committee. 
Clive Snowdon
Clive Snowdon was entitled to employer’s pension contributions 
equivalent to 39.0 per cent of basic salary. The Company was the 
principal employer under a funded unapproved retirement benefits 
scheme (FURBS) in respect of Clive Snowdon.
Doug Robertson
Doug Robertson was entitled to employer’s pension contributions 
equivalent to 15.0 per cent of basic salary. At his choosing, these 
contributions are being paid into an independent SIPP arrangement.
Andrew Moss
Andrew Moss was entitled to employer’s pension contributions 
equivalent to 20.0 per cent of basic salary. Andrew Moss is a member 
of the defined benefit section of the Umeco Scheme which is 
approved by HM Revenue & Customs. Until normal retirement date, 
members currently contribute 6.5 per cent of pensionable salary and 
the Group contributed 26.3 per cent of pensionable salary in the year 
to 31 March 2011. The Umeco Scheme had a cap on pensionable 
salary of £123,600 during the year. The Scheme provides members 
with a pension of up to two thirds of pensionable salary on 
retirement. It also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and 
pensions for dependants of members on their death in service or 
following retirement. Normal retirement age is 65. 
Remuneration of Non-executive Directors
The policy of Non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate  
fee based on each Director’s time and work on the Board and its 
committees. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is 
determined by the Non-executive Directors’ remuneration committee. 
No Non-executive Director is involved in setting his own remuneration.
Policy on external appointments and retention of fees
Subject to the approval of the Board in each case, Executive Directors 
may accept external appointments as Non-executive Directors of other 
companies and retain any related fees paid to them, provided always 
that such external appointments are not considered by the Board to 
prevent or reduce the ability of the Executive to perform their role to 
the required standard. Such appointments are seen as a way in which 
Executive Directors can gain a broader business experience and, in 
turn, benefit the Company. During the year to 31 March 2011, Clive 
Remuneration Report continued  89 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
Snowdon was a Non-executive Director of Hill & Smith Holdings PLC and has retained the fees paid to him for his services in that year, which 
were £44,000 (2010: £41,000). 
Service contracts
The Company has agreed service contracts with Executive Directors which are considered consistent with normal practice in quoted companies 
wishing to attract and retain suitably qualified executives. The dates of these service contracts and the letters of appointment of the Non-
executive Directors, copies of which are available from the Company Secretary, are as follows:
Neil Johnson  16 October 2009
Adrian Auer  30 April 2010
Stephen Bird  26 September 2006
Chris Hole  30 May 2007
Andrew Moss  29 September 1999, amended 23 August 2006 and 20 May 2011
Doug Robertson  19 July 2007
Clive Snowdon  21 April 1997
Graham Zacharias  23 September 2005
In the year to 31 March 2011, Neil Johnson received fees totalling £125,000 per annum for his services to the Company. Of this amount, £25,000  
is a Non-executive Director fee, paid as earnings, and £100,000 is paid as consultancy fees to a consultancy company C1 (International-Consulting) 
Limited under the terms of an agreement dated 19 October 2009. Under the terms of the consultancy agreement, the Company may make payment 
of additional fees in respect of any exceptional time commitment by Neil Johnson in relation to the Company’s affairs. For his time commitment in 
relation to the disposal of the Supply Chain business, during the year to 31 March 2011 Neil Johnson was paid an additional monthly fee of £10,000, 
which was paid to C1 (International-Consulting) Limited, save for August 2010 where the additional monthly fee was £5,000.
Clive Snowdon has a contract which is terminable by the Company giving one year’s notice, or by Clive Snowdon giving six months’ notice.  
There is no obligation on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice other than basic salary and pension contributions.
Doug Robertson has a contract which is terminable by the Company giving one year’s notice, or by Doug Robertson giving six months’ notice. 
There is no obligation on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice other than basic salary and pension contributions.
Andrew Moss has a contract which is terminable by the Company giving one year’s notice, or by Andrew Moss giving six months’ notice. Under 
Andrew Moss’ service contract there is no discretion for the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice.
The letters of appointment of the Non-executive Directors require six months’ notice or, in the cases of Neil Johnson and Adrian Auer,  
three months’ notice to be given by the Director or the Company to terminate the appointment. None of the letters provide for the  
payment of compensation.
Board changes in May 2011
This report focuses on remuneration in respect of the year to 31 March 2011 relating to Directors who served during that year. On 20 May 2011, 
the Company announced that Andrew Moss (formerly Chief Operating Officer) had been appointed as Chief Executive and Steve Bowers 
(formerly Group Financial Controller) had been appointed as Finance Director, in each case with immediate effect. Steve Bowers also remains  
as Company Secretary. On the same date, the Company announced that Clive Snowdon, formerly Chief Executive, and Doug Robertson, formerly 
Finance Director, had resigned from the Board with immediate effect, though they will both remain as employees of the Company until June 
2011 to assist with the transition of the Group as part of the disposal of the Supply Chain business. Compensation for loss of office will be 
payable by the Company to Clive Snowdon and Doug Robertson in line with contractual terms, and details of this compensation will be disclosed 
in the 2012 Annual Report.
On 20 May 2011, Steve Bowers entered into a service contract with the Company which is terminable by the Company giving one year’s notice, 
 or by Steve Bowers giving six months’ notice. Under Steve Bowers’ new service contract the Company can, in its absolute discretion, make 
phased payments in lieu of notice equal to basic salary and pension contributions.

As a result of the changes in responsibilities of Andrew Moss and Steve Bowers, their salaries from 20 May 2011 have been increased to £360,000 
per annum and £190,000 per annum respectively. From that date, contractual entitlements to employer’s pension contributions are equivalent to 
25.0 per cent of basic salary for Andrew Moss and 20.0 per cent of basic salary for Steve Bowers.
Following completion of the disposal of the Supply Chain business, Andrew Moss will be paid a loyalty bonus of £360,000 consisting of £180,000 
in cash and £180,000 in deferred shares, and Steve Bowers will be paid a loyalty bonus of £190,000 consisting of £95,000 in cash and £95,000 in 
deferred shares. These deferred share awards will be subject to the rules applying to other deferred share awards and will therefore be subject to 
restrictions until the third anniversary of the award date.

Clive Snowdon and Doug Robertson will be leaving employment shortly after the granting of deferred share awards relating to the year to 
31 March 2011 and, as restrictions over this deferred share award would have been lifted immediately on cessation of their employment in view 
of their status as good leavers, it has been agreed that their total bonus entitlement for the year to 31 March 2011 will be paid in cash.
Deferred share awards
Deferred share awards are recognised as remuneration upon the lifting of the restrictions attaching to the awards. The June 2007 award vested 
in March 2010 and vesting of this award was accelerated from the normal vesting date of June 2010 in view of the higher personal income tax 
rate that would have been borne by participants at the normal date of vesting. In common with other listed companies, the remuneration 
committee considered the accelerated vesting to be equitable in these circumstances. 
As a result of this accelerated vesting no awards vested in the year to 31 March 2011. The deferred share awards held by the Executive Directors 
under the Umeco Bonus Plan are as follows:

(ii) to holders of other equity securities, as required by the 
rights of those securities, or as the Board otherwise 
considers necessary,
 and so that the Board may impose any limits or restrictions  
and make any arrangements which it considers necessary or 
appropriate to deal with treasury shares, fractional 
entitlements, record dates, legal, regulatory or practical 
problems in, or under the laws of, any territory or any other 
matter; and
(B) in the case of the authority granted under paragraph (A) of 
Resolution 10 and/or in the case of any sale of treasury shares 
for cash, to the allotment (otherwise than under paragraph  
(A) above) of equity securities or sale of treasury shares up  
to a nominal amount of £601,760.00,
 such power to apply until the end of next year’s Annual General 
Meeting (or, if earlier, until the close of business on 2 November 
2012) but, in each case, during this period the Company may make 
offers, and enter into agreements, which would, or might, require 
equity securities to be allotted (and treasury shares to be sold) after 
the power ends and the Board may allot equity securities (and sell 
treasury shares) under any such offer or agreement as if the power 
had not ended.

Explanatory notes to the Resolutions 
Resolutions 1 to 10 are proposed as Ordinary Resolutions. This means 
that for each of those Resolutions to be passed, more than half of the 
votes cast must be in favour of the Resolution. Resolutions 11 to 13 are 
proposed as Special Resolutions. This means that for each of those 
Resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must 
be in favour of the Resolution. The Board considers that all the 
Resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders as a whole. Your Board will be voting in 
favour of them and unanimously recommends that you do so as well. 
Further information on the Resolutions is as follows:
Resolution 1 
This Resolution is proposed to receive the financial statements and the 
reports of the Directors and auditor thereon for the year to 31 March 2011. 
Resolution 2
This Resolution is to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
which is included on pages 86 to 93 of the Annual Report and provides 
details of the Group’s remuneration policy for the Directors. The vote 
on this Resolution is advisory and no Director’s remuneration is 
conditional upon the passing of this Resolution.
Resolution 3
This Resolution is to approve payment of a final dividend of 11.5 pence  
per 25 pence ordinary share in respect of the year to 31 March 2011, such

the close of business on 9 September 2011.

These Resolutions concern the election and re-appointment of Directors  
retiring in accordance with the Articles. At this year’s Annual General

Graham Zacharias joined the Board as a Non-executive Director in 
September 2005. He was Group Finance Director of Rightmove Plc from 
2006 until January 2009 and remained on the Board of Rightmove Plc until 
April 2009, following which he has pursued private interests. He was

Finance Director of the Aerospace Group of BTR plc. Graham is chairman of 
the audit committee and is a member of the remuneration committee.
The Board remains satisfied that each of the Directors proposed for 
re-appointment is committed to the role and continues to be an effective 
and valuable member of the Board. 
Resolutions 8 and 9
These Resolutions are proposed to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditor to 
hold office until the next General Meeting of the Company at which 
accounts are presented and to authorise the Directors to determine the 
level of the auditor’s remuneration. 
Resolution 10
Paragraph (A) of this Resolution would give the Directors the authority  
to allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
securities into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal 
to £4,011,734.50 (representing 16,046,938 ordinary shares of 25 pence 
each). This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued 
ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company as at  
22 June 2011, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice. 
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’), 
paragraph (B) of this Resolution would give the Directors authority to 
allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
securities into ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue in 
favour of ordinary shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount 
equal to £8,023,469.00 (representing 32,093,876 ordinary shares), as 
reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued under paragraph 
(A) of this Resolution. This amount (before any reduction) represents 
approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) of the Company as at 22 June 2011, the 
latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The authorities sought under paragraphs (A) and (B) of this Resolution 
will expire at the earlier of 2 November 2012 and the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2012.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise either of the 
authorities sought under this Resolution. However, if they do exercise 
the authorities, the Directors intend to follow ABI recommendations 
concerning their use (including as regards the Directors standing for 
re-appointment in certain cases). 
As at the date of this Notice, no ordinary shares are held by the 
Company in treasury.
Resolution 11
This Resolution would give the Directors the authority to allot ordinary 
shares (or sell any ordinary shares which the Company elects to hold in 
treasury) for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders 
in proportion to their existing shareholdings. 
This authority would be limited to allotments or sales in connection  
with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities  
if required by the rights of those shares or as the Board otherwise 
considers necessary, or otherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount  
of £601,760.00 (representing 2,407,040 ordinary shares). This aggregate 
nominal amount represents approximately 5 per cent of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company as at 22 June 2011, the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this Notice. In respect of this 
aggregate nominal amount, the Directors confirm their intention to 
follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles 
regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling 3-year period 
where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5 per cent should 
not take place without prior consultation with shareholders.
The authority will expire at the earlier of 2 November 2012 and the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2012. 
Resolution 12
Authority is sought for the Company to purchase up to 10 per cent of its 
issued ordinary shares (excluding any treasury shares), renewing the 
authority granted by the shareholders at last year’s Annual General Meeting.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to 
make market purchases, however the authority provides the flexibility 
to allow them to do so in the future. The Directors will exercise this 
authority only when to do so would be in the best interests of the 
Company, and of its shareholders generally, and could be expected to 
result in an increase in the earnings per share of the Company.
Ordinary Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to this authority 
may be held in treasury or may be cancelled. The Directors will consider 
holding any Ordinary Shares the Company may purchase as treasury 
shares. The Company currently has no Ordinary Shares in treasury.  
The minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an 
Ordinary Share is 25 pence. The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, 
which may be paid for an Ordinary Share is the highest of (i) an amount 
equal to 5 per cent above the average market value for an Ordinary 
Share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the 
purchase and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where 
the purchase is carried out.
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued 101 Umeco plc Annual Report 2011
The Company has options outstanding over 1,231,752 Ordinary Shares, 
representing 2.6 per cent of the Company’s ordinary issued share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 22 June 2011. If the Company 
bought back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to 
the existing authority given at last year’s Annual General Meeting and 
the authority now being sought by Resolution 12 and all such shares 
were cancelled, the total number of options outstanding would 
represent approximately 3.2 per cent of the Company’s ordinary  
issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) at that date.
The Company has no warrants in issue in relation to its shares. 
The authority will expire at the earlier of 2 November 2012 and the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2012.
Resolution 13
Changes made to the Companies Act 2006 by the Shareholders’ Rights 
Regulations increase the notice period required for general meetings  
of the Company to 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter  
notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days  
(Annual General Meetings will continue to be held on at least  
21 clear days’ notice).
Before the coming into force of the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations on 
3 August 2009, the Company was able to call general meetings other 
than an Annual General Meeting on 14 clear days’ notice without 
obtaining such shareholder approval. In order to preserve this ability, 
Resolution 13 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until 
the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that 
a similar Resolution will be proposed. 
Note that the changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order 
to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, 
the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all 
shareholders for that meeting.
Explanatory Notes for Annual General Meeting
The following notes explain your general rights as a shareholder and 
your right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting to be  
held on Tuesday 2 August 2011 or to appoint someone else to vote  
on your behalf.
1.  A member entitled to attend and vote at the above Annual General 
Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak 
and vote on his/her behalf. Such proxy need not be a member of 
the Company. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in 
relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy  
is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by that shareholder. The return of a completed proxy 
form, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as 
described in paragraph 10 below) will not prevent a shareholder 
attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/
she wishes to do so. 
2. A shareholder may register the appointment of a proxy or proxies 
and vote on the resolutions electronically, by using the Share Portal 
service at www.capitashareportal.com and following the on-screen 
instructions. Shareholders will need their Investor Code, which has 
previously been provided to them or may be obtained by 
contacting the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, on 0871 
664 0300 (calls cost 10 pence per minute plus network extras. Lines 
are open 8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday) (+44 208 639 3399 if 
calling from outside the UK).
3.  To be valid, any proxy form or other instrument appointing a  
proxy must be received by post or (during normal business hours 
only) by hand at the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, PXS, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, no later than 
1.00pm on Sunday 31 July 2011. Electronic proxy appointment(s) 
and instructions must be received by Capita Registrars by 1.00pm 
on Sunday 31 July 2011.
4. Copies of all service contracts of Directors and copies of letters  
of appointment of the Non-executive Directors will be available  
for inspection at the registered office of the Company and at the 
offices of Slaughter and May, One Bunhill Row, London, EC1Y 8YY 
during normal business hours from the date of this notice until the 
date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual 
General Meeting from 12.30pm until its conclusion.
5.  To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
(and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the 
votes they may cast), shareholders must be registered in the register 
of members at 6.00pm on Sunday 31 July 2011 (or, in the event of 
any adjournment, on the date which is two days before the time  
of the adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the register of 
members after 6.00pm on Sunday 31 July 2011 shall be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend the Annual 
General Meeting.
6. The total number of shares of the Company in issue as at  
22 June 2011 (being the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of this Notice) is 48,140,816 carrying one vote each. 
Therefore, the total voting rights as at 22 June 2011 are 48,140,816.

7.  Any person who has sold or transferred his/her shares in the 
Company should pass this document and its enclosures to the 
person through whom the sale or the transfer was effected for 
transmission to the purchaser or the transferee. 
8.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated 
under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information 
rights (a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement between 
him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, 
have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) 
as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person 
has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise 
it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give 
instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. 
The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the 
appointment of proxies in paragraph 1 above does not apply  
to Nominated Persons. The rights described in these paragraphs 
can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
9.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal 
Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST 
members who have appointed a service provider(s), should refer  
to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be 
able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
10. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST 
Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance 
with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications, and must 
contain the information required for such instruction, as described 
in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a 
proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to 
be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by 1.00pm on Sunday 31 
July 2011. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the message 
by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is 
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to 
proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means.
11. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or 
voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for 
any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations 
will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned 
to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or 
sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to 
procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is 
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 
 In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
12. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the 
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
13. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to 
the same shares.
14. Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 members meeting 
the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right  
to require the Company to publish on a website a statement 
setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s 
accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the 
audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or  
(ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company 
ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual 
accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of 
the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the 
shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its 
expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on 
a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must 
forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the 
time when it makes the statement available on the website. The 
business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting 
includes any statement that the Company has been required under 
section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
15. Any member attending the Annual General Meeting has the right 
to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any 
such question relating to the business being dealt with at the 
Annual General Meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to 
do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the Annual 
General Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential 
information, (b) the answer has already been given on a website in 
the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the 
interests of the Company or the good order of the Annual General 
Meeting that the question be answered. If you are unable to attend 
the Annual General Meeting, but have a specific question you 
would like to ask at the Annual General Meeting, you are invited  
to send the Chairman an email via the Company’s website at  
www.umeco.com or write to him at the registered office address. 
16. A copy of this notice, and other information required by section 311A 
of the Companies Act 2006, can be found at www.umeco.com.

Annual Report 2013 3 BANK OF GEORGIA ENJOYED ANOTHER 
YEAR OF RECORD RESULTS AND THIS 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS  
WILL PROVIDE THE DETAILS ABOUT  
OUR STRATEGY, EXECUTION AND 
OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE. IN THIS YEAR’S LETTER 
I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON GEORGIA 
AND SUMMARISE DEVELOPMENTS IN 
THE YEAR 2013, WHICH CAPS THE MOST 
FORMATIVE DECADE IN THE COUNTRY’S 
RECENT HISTORY. 
Ten years ago, Georgia embarked upon  
a path of transforming its Soviet-legacy 
political and economic system into a 
market-oriented democracy. As the Group’s 
Board Chairman for nearly four years, I have 
had a remarkable opportunity to observe 
and appreciate how Georgia succeeded in 
tackling the main challenge for a post-Soviet 
country – corruption, virtually eliminating  
the country’s Soviet-era bureaucracy and 
replacing it with efficient and functioning 
administrative bodies. Among the most 
noteworthy free-market-oriented reforms 
behind Georgia’s economic success were 
simplification of the tax regime, cutting red 
tape, creating business and an investor 
friendly environment. We became witnesses 
to how effectively these measures translated 
into the turnaround of the country’s economy 
and the evolution of the private sector into a 
dynamic business environment. Georgia’s 
liberal economic regime and ample growth

Real GDP growth rate, % 
opportunities have been attracting foreign 
direct investment and pleasantly surprising 
foreign visitors, the number of which grew 
from a mere 300,000 in 2003 to an 
estimated 5.4 million in 2013, exceeding  
the 4.5 million population of Georgia.  
Quite impressively, Georgia enjoyed an 
average annual growth of 5.9% of its real 
GDP from 2004 to 2013. 
Excluding the Eastern European states, 
Georgia started 2013 as the first post-Soviet 
country to change power through peaceful 
and democratic parliamentary elections. 
These elections were held in October 2012. 
The change of power through elections was 
a new experience for Georgia’s young 
democracy. 2013 was also a transitional 
year from a presidential to a parliamentary 
system of government, which came into 
force with the Presidential elections at the 
end of October 2013. Georgia’s Presidential 
elections were the most free and uneventful 
elections for the country during its two 
decades of independence. Although the 
composition of the new Parliament, with  
an effective opposition, stalled decision-
making processes and therefore, economic 
growth for the most part of the year, it has, 
more importantly, resulted in greater political 
pluralism, debate in the Parliament and 
overall involvement of the non-governmental 
sector, which are essential components of  
a functioning democratic state.
It pleases me to note that despite the 
challenges associated with the transitional 
period and the change of power, last year 
has demonstrated the sustainability of  
the earlier reforms, institutional strength  
and the maturity of the Georgian society. 
Democratic values and practices have 
become a norm for businesses and society 
in general. Government’s effectiveness 
during the transition year is evidenced  
by the continued tight grip on corruption, 
further improvements in the business 
environment and stepping up the overdue 
reform of the judicial system. With the 
elections and the uncertainties associated 
with them left behind, the return of 
Government investment into the economy 
and increase in business and consumer 
confidence has led to recovery of economic 
growth with 7.1% real GDP growth in the 
fourth quarter of 2013 and 6.7% average 
growth rate in the first two months of 2014. 
Georgia has come a very long way since 
2003, and 2013, with its remarkable 
breakthrough in the political sphere has set 
the stage for Georgia’s further development, 
building upon the achievements and 
strengths of the previous years to ensure  
its economic progress and the continuing 
modernisation of the country. To this end, 
one of the key encouraging signs that  
I would like to point out is the enactment of 
the Economic Liberty Act as of 1 January 
2014, which will ensure the continuation of 
the country’s credible fiscal and monetary 
policy framework. In addition, Georgia is 
expected to strongly benefit from the 
signing of the Association Agreement  
with the European Union, expected in  
June 2014. This agreement is expected  
to include a deep and comprehensive  
free trade agreement that should support 
Georgia’s economic development and bring 
the country closer to the West. This may  
be the most interesting time for Georgia,  
the Georgians and for those who are  
investing in Georgia’s future. 
Bank of Georgia, the country’s market- 
leading franchise, is in the right place at  
the right time to play an important role in 
Georgia’s unfolding progress and benefit 
from the economic development of the 
country. We believe in the effectiveness of 
our business model and the ability of the 
management team to execute our strategy 
and continue delivering high-quality 
diversified growth. 
In conclusion, as a Chairman of the Board 
of Directors, I would like to note the 
changes we made on our Board in line  
with our commitment to the continuous 
improvement of our corporate governance 
practices. In 2013, the Board of Directors  
of BGH resolved to ensure that our  
Non-Executive Board members would all  
be fully independent under UK standards. 
As a result, two Non-Independent Directors, 
Ian Hague and Hanna Loikkanen resigned, 
as did Allan Hirst, an Independent Director 
also left the Board after a nine-year tenure. 
We are deeply grateful for the devoted 
services of all three. They have been 
replaced with three new Independent 
Non-Executive Directors – Bozidar Djelic, 
Tamaz Georgadze and Kim Bradley.  
Please refer to the Governance section  
of this Annual Report or our website to read 
about the array of experience and skills 
these three individuals bring to our team.
I would like to thank my fellow Board 
members for their support and commitment 
and congratulate the management team for 
the strong performance in 2013 and I look 
forward to new achievements in 2014.

OF UNDERLYING BUSINESSES, BALANCE 
SHEET STRENGTH, EFFICIENCY GAINS 
AND STRONG PROFITABILITY IN SPITE  
OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH 
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE YEAR. 
Economic growth in Georgia, which has for  
a number of years been a tailwind for us, was 
lower than expected and resulted in a slower 
start to the year. However, we witnessed a 
significant pick-up in business activity after the 
Presidential elections in October 2013, which 
saw the candidate of the ruling Georgian 
Dream Party win a landslide victory. GDP 
growth was estimated at 1.7% for the first 
nine months of 2013, but picked up after  
the elections to reach 7.1% in the fourth 
quarter. The future also seems optimistic  
as the IMF forecasts 5% GDP growth in 
2014. The state budget was run at a surplus 
for the first nine months of 2013. In Q4 2013, 
in order to reach the target level of deficit for  
the year, spending accelerated particularly  
on infrastructure projects, resulting in a large 
increase in the supply of Lari. This in turn 
caused a small correction in the GEL/US 
Dollar exchange rate. In February 2014, 
however, the Lari reversed some of its 
losses against the major currencies and 
started to appreciate. In 2013, the National 
Bank of Georgia (NBG) remained a net 
buyer of US Dollars, purchasing US$335 
million during the year.
In this letter, I would like to review 2013  
by highlighting certain key performance 
measures, analysing the drivers of the 
results and the underlying strategic 
initiatives that we believe are fundamental  
to our success. Our medium-term strategy 
continues to centre around the 3x20 story 
that aims at achieving a 20% growth rate  
in our loan book, 20% Return on Average 
Equity and a 20% Tier I Capital ratio.

Below, I will start with three strategic 
initiatives launched over the last several 
years, which are now driving the 
diversification of our revenue that  
shapes our performance.
Revenue Diversification
Payments business
We began implementing our Express 
Banking strategy in 2012 by rolling out 
small-format, Express branches offering 
predominantly transactional banking services 
to clients through ATMs and Express Pay 
Terminals. The aim was to make banking 
relationships simple, faster, cheaper and 
convenient for both our existing customers 
and for the emerging bankable population. 
A Self-Service Terminal can be described  
as a small bank by itself as it allows a wide 
array of payment services ranging from 
current account top-ups and loan 
repayments to utility bill payments and  
metro ticket purchases. In 2013, we installed 
764 new Express Pay Terminals throughout 
Tbilisi resulting in 985 total Express Pay 
Terminals as of the end of the year. We are 
now leaders in Georgia in the payment 
systems market. We have combined our 
travel card for the Tbilisi bus and metro (of 
which we are the sole provider) and our 
contactless card with a loyalty programme 
linked to the customer’s current account to 
create an “Express Card” and have issued 
over 240,000 such cards in 2013. At the end  
of the year we had more than 430,000 
Express cards outstanding. The effects  
of the successful execution of our Express 
Banking strategy are numerous and far 
reaching and are now expressed in our 
financial performance that I will be  
describing below.
Real Estate
Started in 2010 from bad loans, our real 
estate strategy was to transform those loans 
into a successful business, and the process 
has been a textbook case of turning a 
problem into an opportunity. Our m2 Real 
Estate operation, which develops real  
estate property previously repossessed  
by the Bank, had a 40% IRR in 2013  
and has become an integral part of the 
Bank’s mortgage strategy, supporting  
the mortgage loan book development. 
Healthcare
During the past few years, with a view  
to diversifying our revenue streams and 
growing our non-interest income, we have 
taken decisive steps to grow and vertically 
integrate our Insurance and Healthcare 
businesses. BGH and Aldagi are currently 
preparing to list Aldagi’s Healthcare-related 
business on an international stock exchange.
In 2013, Aldagi, our Insurance and Healthcare 
subsidiary, contributed 10.9% to our 
Company’s revenue and 12.0% to its profit. 
As a result mainly of these, but also of less 
visible strategic actions, we delivered another 
exceptional year in terms of profitability, 
despite the backdrop of a slower-growth 
economic environment. At 7.8%, NIM held 
up better than we expected, withstanding the 
downward pressure from excess liquidity 
throughout the year that was largely a function 
of the subdued loan demand prevailing for 
most of the year. We attribute the resilience 
of our NIM to a number of factors, including 
our established market leadership that 
translates into superior distribution capability 
and pricing power. The most important 
contributor to our strong NIM in 2013, 
however, was the markedly reduced Cost  
of Funding. In the first half of 2013, we 
substantially reduced deposit rates, which 
significantly drove down our overall Cost of 
Deposits from 7.3% to 5.6%. It is important 
to note, however, that these deposit rate 
cuts have not compromised the inflow of 
deposits as the client deposit balances 
increased by 18.5% year-on-year. In 
addition, despite the lower deposit rates 
offered by the Bank compared to the 
market, our market share in retail deposits 
declined by only 0.7%. We consider these 
developments to be a true testament to the 
strength of our franchise and the brand 
name of our company. The reduction of 
deposit costs, combined with the superior 
access to capital markets demonstrated  
by the issuance of the 2017 Eurobond tap  
of US$150 million, enabled us to price the 
oversubscribed placement with a low 
interest rate level of 6.125%. Last, but  
not least, the increase in current account 
balances was made possible by the roll-out 
of the Express Banking strategy. Compared 
to last year, Retail Banking current account 
balances grew by GEL 89.6 million, up by 
45.7%. We intend to continue decreasing 
our Cost of Funding, one of the main 
competitive advantages and central to our 
profitability. Our Express Banking strategy  
is expected to further increase our current 
account balances – the cheapest source of 
funding. In addition, our superior access to 
capital markets will enable us to maintain our 
flexibility in optimising our liability structure. 
Cost Control
2013 was the fourth straight year that we 
have combined business growth with 
improved efficiency as evidenced by a 
declining Cost to Income ratio. This year, 
our revenue growth of 9.5% compares to 
2.0% growth of our operating expenses, 
certainly a result of the overall vigilance with 
our costs across the board. More importantly, 
the improved efficiency is linked to our 
Express Banking strategy. We became  
a formidable player on the retail market 
through expansion by means of low-cost 
Express branches that has paved the way 
for transactional banking. The existing 
full-scale branches are now focusing on 
offering value-added products, while 
technology-intensive Express branches 
enable us to offer basic banking products 
and services at minimal cost. In addition, 
one of the strategic objectives of Express 
Banking, which is to bring the previously 
un-banked/emerging bankable population 
to Bank of Georgia, is now bearing fruit.  
The tailor-made products and services that 
became accessible for our new clients at 
our Express branches is a powerful and 
low-cost client acquisition method. In 2013, 
the number of new clients joining the Bank 
exceeded 190,000, up 18% from last year. 
Our improved cost efficiency is one of the 
main reasons our banking operation was 
able to service its substantially increased 
client base without growing its headcount, 
which focuses on IT and remote banking 
services. On a stand-alone basis, Bank of 
Georgia’s full-time employees decreased  
by 4.3%.
Going forward, cost discipline will remain  
a main focus. We are targeting to reduce 
our Cost to Income ratio to approximately 
37% in the next three years. We believe the 
Express Banking strategy will be the main 
contributor to the further improvement.  
The development of Express Technologies 
will allow us to scale up the business with 
minimum operating costs.

Loan Book Growth and Improving  
Asset Quality
The strength and the efficiency of this 
growing franchise is the cornerstone of our 
solid competitive position and is also linked 
to our ability to grow our loan book in the low 
loan demand cycle in 2013. As the largest 
bank in the country, Bank of Georgia is best 
positioned to benefit from the de-dollarisation 
trends that have translated into a pick-up of 
Lari denominated credit growth. In addition, 
our competitive strength on the liability side 
as evidenced in the ability to reduce funding 
costs without compromising deposit funding, 
allowed us to achieve 13.9% loan book growth 
that cost us 130 bps on the Loan Yield, 
which compares to the 170 bps reduction  
of our Cost of Deposits. The result was that 
we didn’t compromise our profitability as 
demonstrated by the continuing strength  
of our NIM. We are constantly keeping a 
watchful eye on asset quality by following 
prudent risk management policies. Strongly 
supported by our diversified loan book,  
our NPLs grew by only 14.7%, comparing 
favourably to the loan book growth rate.  
Our Cost of Risk for the year stayed at the 
top of our targeted range at 1.4%, while  
our Q4 2013 Cost of Risk of an annualised 
0.9% was a noteworthy improvement over 
the Q3 2013 Cost of Risk of 1.6%, also 
attributable to the slowdown of the  
economy in the first half of the year.
Strategic Initiatives Going Forward
Building upon our 3x20 strategy adopted  
in 2011, we are set to deliver on our key 
strategic priorities for the next three years. 
We are determined to maintain our market 
leadership, which gives us economies of  
scale as well as superior distribution and 
pricing power. Our market leadership is built 
on our strong Retail Banking and Corporate 
Banking businesses, which together are the 
backbone of the Bank of Georgia franchise. 
We see the strong growth potential of Solo 
Banking, our premier banking business, by 
means of increasing our currently relatively 
low penetration in the mass affluent segment. 
The expansion of our Solo Banking will be 
strongly supported by the offerings of our 
Investment Management products and 
services. The further development of our 
Express Banking business, which is at the 
heart of our retail strategy, is directly linked  
to Express Technologies, and we intend to 
continue investing in IT, which we consider 
pivotal for the future of the banking industry. 
We plan to build the growth on the back  
of further diversified revenue sources. 
Knowledge and understanding of the 
market, both Georgian and regional, and 
proven superior access to international 
capital will be the drivers of our Investment 
Management business growth. In 2013,  
we have combined our wealth management, 
research, advisory, and brokerage 
businesses under Investment Management. 
We intend to launch our first Investment 
Management products during 2014 and 
plan to continue to build upon them with the 
aim to create an important fee-generating 
business. Expansion through our payments 
business in Georgia has already started, 
and the newest addition is the Express 
Merchant business, which is an additional 
revenue source of income from small 
retailers that are not yet part of the card 
payment system. We will be focusing on 
turning payment systems into a significant 
base for our revenue generation and we are 
also preparing to leverage our knowledge  
of IT and payment business by beginning  
to export IT and payment business outside  
of Georgia.
Looking back, I am proud of how much has 
been achieved. Entrepreneurial spirit is at 
the heart of Bank of Georgia’s culture and is 
one of our strongest assets. It has resulted in 
the creation of a very strong franchise that 
will be very difficult to match and even 
harder to displace. Such success in turn 
has created a new important task for us.  
We now have to manage the size, which in 
our case means striking the right balance  
as we seek to maintain our entrepreneurial  
spirit as we further institutionalise our

achievements. In 2014, this will be one  
of our main tasks. Our first step to this  
end is the recently launched Bank of 
Georgia University that will help with the 
identification and development of talent 
within the Group.
2013 was a momentous year in terms of share 
price performance, which increased 113% 
since year-end 2012, outpacing most of our 
peers. In 2013, Bank of Georgia was the 
third largest growth stock in the FTSE 250. 
Average daily liquidity increased by more 
than 65% to 200,000 shares in 2013. Our 
long-term investors, namely East Capital 
and Firebird, significantly reduced their 
holdings, which led to the widening of our 
institutional shareholder base, contributing 
to the improvements in stock liquidity and 
free float. Our shareholder base is now  
far more diversified than a year ago: 
non-emerging market focused institutional 
shareholders make up c. 36% of our 
shareholder base compared to just 15%  
a year ago. 
At the 2014 AGM, the Board intends to 
recommend an annual dividend of GEL 2.0 
per share payable in British Pounds Sterling 
at the prevailing rate. This represents an 
increase of 33.3%, compared to the annual 
dividend of GEL 1.5 per share last year, a 
payout ratio of 33.7% and a dividend yield  
for shareholders of 2.9%, calculated on  
the basis of the year-end 2013 results and  
using the 31 December 2013 share price  
of £23.95. 
I would like to thank the members of our 
Board for their engagement and invaluable 
input and congratulate the management 
team and more than 11,000 employees of 
the Group for the strong performance this 
year. We are looking forward to a busy and 
exciting year ahead of us. The key strategic 
initiatives that we undertook a few years  
ago are gaining momentum and while we 
made considerable progress this past year, 
I believe we have much more work ahead  
of us to realise the great potential of the 
Bank of Georgia Group. We are confident  
in our competitive position and remain 
focused on delivering value to our 
shareholders, lenders, customers  
and employees.
As part of a number of significant changes 
in regulations in the UK, this Annual Report

STRATEGIC REPORT
STRATEGIC REVIEW:  
MARKET OVERVIEW
OVER A DECADE OF GROWTH-ORIENTED 
REFORMS AND ONGOING ECONOMIC 
LIBERALISATION IN GEORGIA HAVE 
RESULTED IN ONE OF THE RARE SUCCESS 
STORIES IN POST-SOVIET ECONOMIES. 
 
A string of business-friendly reforms, which 
included the eradication of administrative 
corruption, downsizing bureaucracies, 
reforming public services and improving the 
business environment have transformed 
Georgia into one of the most business 
friendly economies in the world. Economic 
growth reached an annual average growth 
rate of 5.9% over the last decade, outpacing 
much of Eastern Europe. 
The liberal economic and social reforms, 
combined with substantial investments  
in infrastructure have driven FDI to fresh 
highs – over the past decade FDI averaged 
c. 10% of GDP. Georgia has also significantly 
benefited from strong tourist inflows as the 
number of foreign visitors has grown at a 
CAGR of c. 33% from 2005 to 2013, with  
c. 5.4 million visitors to Georgia in 2013 
(2005: 0.6 million). Net remittances have 
also remained robust supporting growth  
in the country throughout the last decade 
and totalling c. 7.9% of GDP over the last  
five years. 
Georgia’s Liberty Act, which came into effect 
in January 2014, ensures continuation of the 
country’s credible fiscal and monetary policy 
framework. This Act caps Government 
expenditure at 30% of GDP, budget deficit 
at 3% of GDP and Government debt at 60% 
of GDP. It also requires a referendum to be 
held before initiating new taxes and raising 
existing tax rates, subject to certain 
exceptions. Georgia is already one of the 
world’s most friendly tax regimes, with  
only six taxes imposed of which corporate 
income tax and personal income tax are 
15% and 20%, respectively.
Georgia’s geographic location between 
land-locked energy rich countries in the East 
and the European markets in the West has 
largely determined Georgia’s role as an 
important transit corridor, hosting several 
pipelines one of which is BP’s Baku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhan pipeline, transporting Azerbaijani 
crude oil through Georgia to Turkey. One of 
the three ports on Georgia’s Black Sea coast 
is owned and managed by Denmark’s A.P. 
Moeller-Maersk. The Georgian economy is 
well positioned to become a hub for regional 
trade to benefit from significant FDI, largely 
in the hydro energy sector, and to capitalise 
on its still significantly untapped potential in 
the tourism and agricultural sectors. Georgia 
is well positioned to accelerate its growth- 
oriented reforms, particularly following the 
expected signing of the Association 
Agreement with the European Union by 
June 2014, which is expected to include  
a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade 
Agreement (DCFTA).
The Georgian Economy in 2013
Georgia’s economy in 2013 was largely driven 
by domestic factors. Much of the year was 
sandwiched between two very significant 
elections: Parliamentary elections at the end 
of 2012, which saw a smooth democratic 
transfer of power for the first time in the 
country’s history, and Presidential elections 
in October 2013. Both foreign and domestic 
businesses maintained a fairly cautious 
stance, with regard to new investments  
until the end of this election phase. 
In the first nine months of 2013, the economy 
grew at a meagre 1.7%. The decisive victory 
of the ruling Georgian Dream coalition party’s 
candidate in the October 2013 Presidential 
elections removed political uncertainty 
resulting in a significant acceleration of GDP 
growth to an annualised 7.1% in the last 
quarter of 2013. Geostat estimates 3.2% 
GDP growth rate for the full year 2013. 
Strong growth continued into 2014, reaching 
an annualised 8.0% in January and 5.4%  
in February, although this was partially 
attributable to a favourable base effect. 
The pick-up in growth was also driven by  
an increase in Government spending in Q4 
2013, following conservative fiscal policy  
in the first nine months of 2013. The 
expansionary fiscal policy in the fourth 
quarter, as well as a higher demand for 
foreign currency due to a pick-up in imports 
in Q4 2013, resulted in a 4.8% depreciation 
of Lari against the US Dollar in 2013, 
although the NBG smoothed this trend via 
market interventions. In the absence of 
these issues, the Lari regained some of its 
losses in the beginning of 2014 prompting 
the NBG to buy foreign currency through 
currency auctions. Despite the exchange

rate volatility and NBG interventions, 
Georgia’s gross international reserves 
remained strong throughout 2013 and 
amounted to US$2.8 billion at the end  
of the year. 
Georgia is experiencing deflation for a 
second year in a row. Despite a pick-up in 
annual inflation at the end of the year, annual 
average inflation remained below zero,  
mainly on the back of a drop in food prices. 
The current account deficit for the year was 
an estimated 5.9%, compared to 11.7% in 
2012. The significant improvement was a 
result of a 23.2% increase in exports compared 
to 0.1% increase in imports for the year, 
although imports picked up as the economic 
growth accelerated towards the end of the 
year. The deficit was comfortably financed 
with foreign inflows of capital. Net remittances 
grew by 7 .8% in 2013 reaching US$1.3 billion 
and FDI for the year totalled an estimated 
US$914 million (2012: US$912 million). 
In December 2013 the Parliament of Georgia 
approved Georgia’s state budget for 2014.  
Real GDP growth is projected to be 5.0% 
and average inflation 3.5% in 2014. 
Georgian Banking Sector Overview
The Georgian financial services sector has 
been one of the fastest growing sectors in 
the country, growing at a CAGR of 29% 
during the past decade. Despite the high 
growth rate, banking penetration remains 
low with gross loans to GDP and deposits 
to GDP at 39% and 36%, respectively, as  
of year-end 2013, indicating a substantial 
growth potential should Georgia achieve 
penetration rates more in line with its peers. 
The banking sector is entirely privately 
owned and is quite concentrated with the 
two largest banks accounting for 58% of 
total assets. 
The banking sector is well regulated with 
the National Bank of Georgia maintaining 
strict banking prudential requirements. 
Given this tight regulation, the Georgian 
banking sector remains extremely well 
capitalised with very low leverage. Despite  
a high level of capital, the banking system 
has remained very profitable with a system 
wide average return on average equity of 
13% over the past three years. 
Georgian Insurance and Healthcare Sectors
Historically, the healthcare market in Georgia 
has been fragmented with a limited number 
of managed healthcare chains operating in 
the country as compared to individually 
managed hospitals and clinics, many of 
which were older, Soviet-era facilities. Total 
healthcare spending has been increasing 
over the last 10 years and, in 2011, which is 
the most recent data available, represented 
GEL 2.3 billion (US$1.3 billion), according to 
the National Health Accounts published by 
the Ministry of Labour, Health and Social 
Affairs of Georgia (MOH). Strongly 
supported by private investments, especially 
from insurance companies, in 2011 and 
2012, numerous new healthcare facilities 
were opened contributing to 5,800 new 
beds, by 2013 representing approximately 
65% of Georgia’s total bed capacity
 
by end 
of 2013. These new hospitals are replacing 
the antiquated and dilapidated facilities from 
the Soviet period.
Georgia has one of the highest relative  
total expenditures on healthcare (9.9% of 
GDP) according to the World Bank 2011 
health expenditure report. Georgia also  
has one of the lowest general Government 
expenditures on healthcare as a percentage 
of total Government expenditure, recording 
6.9% in 2011 according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) 2012 country report.  
In 2011, Government total expenditure  
on healthcare equalled 22.1% of total 
healthcare expenditure in Georgia. 
Additionally, insurance penetration is still 
quite low in Georgia. Health, life and Property 
and Casualty (P&C) insurance gross premiums 
written (GPW) represented only 1.7%, 0.1% 
and 0.5% of GDP respectively, in Q3 2013.
On 28 February 2013, MOH launched  
a Universal Healthcare Programme (UHP), 
which reaches all citizens of Georgia. Prior 
to the UHP launch, only half of Georgia’s 
population was insured. The shift to the 
universal Government-financed UHP is  
seen as a significant opportunity for the 
short- and medium-term growth of the 
industry which will strongly benefit from  
the increased accessibility of the population  
to health insurance.

WE CALL OUR 3X20 STRATEGY THAT 
ENTAILS A 20% METRIC FOR OUR 
RETURN ON AVERAGE EQUITY, TIER I 
CAPITAL STRENGTH AND BUSINESS 
GROWTH, THE LATTER DRIVEN BY LOAN 
BOOK GROWTH AS WELL AS 
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR 
SYNERGISTIC BUSINESSES.
Three years later, we remain confident in  
our strategy and while we take a long-term 
view, the agility and lean structure of the 
Group enables us to be prepared to make 
adjustments to respond rapidly to market 
developments. As an example, in 2013, we 
came short in terms of the targeted loan 
book growth for the year, in line with the 
slowdown of the economic growth of the 
country in the first nine months of the year. 
Despite the 13.9% relatively subdued 
growth rate of our loan book, the resilience  
of our franchise was demonstrated by the 
robust profitability and efficiency indicators 
such as NIM of 7.8% and the reduction of 
our Cost to Income ratio to the record low 
41.4% as we continued to grow our revenues 
at a faster rate than our costs. The expected 
return of Georgia’s economic growth rate to 
more than 5% gives us the confidence to 
return to delivering our 20% metric for the 
growth of our loan book, on the back of  
Tier I Capital Adequacy ratio of 23% and 
Return on Average Equity of 18.6% in 2013.
The Group’s ultimate objective is to 
maximise Return on Average Equity by 
delivering long-term shareholder value.  
We believe we can continue to deliver 
exceptional results by implementing our 
strategy as laid out below.

OUR STRATEGY How We Are Going to Achieve our Targets
1. Strengthen market leader position
How are we doing this: 
 – Expand our product offering through 
continuous innovation to remain at  
the forefront of meeting the growing 
funding and investment needs of our 
extensive retail customer and corporate 
client base.
 – Expand our Express Banking strategy  
to increase our number of customers  
by attracting the currently unbanked

towards transactional banking.
 – Leverage our superior distribution 
network and local expertise across 
various business lines to step up our 
cross-selling strategies.
 – Shift from current segment approach  
to client-centric approach with an aim  
to capture growth opportunities and 
increase penetration through cross-
selling, to be measured primarily by an 
improvement in product/client ratio.
Progress so far: 
 – Attracted more than 190,000  
Retail Banking customers in 2013, 
predominantly through the  
Express Banking service.
 – Added 764 new Express Pay  
Terminals resulting in a total of 985.
 – Increased the share of Aldagi, our 
Insurance and Healthcare subsidiary,  
to 29.0% of the Georgian insurance 
market. Aldagi’s Healthcare business 
grew from a 1,041 hospital bed 
operation from year-end 2012 to 1,907 
hospital bed operation across the 
country as of 31 March 2014, accounting 
for 20.5*% of total hospital beds in 
Georgia in the first quarter of 2014.

Returns KPIs
Diversified revenue sources, improved 
funding and operating costs were the main 
drivers of the exceptional results in terms  
of profitability against the backdrop of 
slower-growth environment in 2013. 
The resilience of NIM is a function of our 
distribution capabilities and pricing power. 
The substantial reduction of our funding 
costs during the year enabled our NIM to 
withstand downward pressures from higher 
excess liquidity levels than in 2012. The 
double digit growth of the loan book in 
2013, the further increased contribution of 
non-interest income to our revenue, strong 
margins and improving cost efficiency 
translated into 16.6% growth in profit.  
As a result of strong capital generation,  
the Board intends to recommend a 33.3% 
increase in annual dividend payment to  
GEL 2.0 per share paid in GBP in respect  
of 2013 (2012: GEL 1.5), which is subject to 
shareholder approval at the AGM.
In 2014 and beyond, we will continue to 
focus on profitable earnings growth,  
to be driven by good levels of customer 
lending growth without compromising asset 
quality, an increase in the share of non-
interest income in the revenue as we grow 
our fee generating businesses and expand 
our Insurance and Healthcare operations. 
Net Interest Margin is calculated as net interest 
income divided by monthly average interest earning 
assets. Interest earning assets include amounts due 
from credit institutions, debt securities and net loans 
to customers and net finance lease receivables.
Profit is calculated in accordance with IFRS and 
represents revenue less operating expenses, cost 
of credit risk, net non-operating expenses and 
tax expense.

Efficiency KPIs
The significant reduction of the Cost to Income 
ratio for the fourth consecutive year indicates the 
successfully combined business growth with 
improved efficiency. The shift to technology 
intensive transactional banking at Express 
branches is at the centre of the efficiency 
improvements. Other measures such as various 
investments in IT aimed at optimisation of 
workflow processes, introduction of cost centre 
reporting procedures as well as our strong 
focus on cost control across the board, have 
contributed to the decline of the Cost to Income 
ratio to its lowest level in the recent past.
Strongly supported by diversified sources, 
revenue grew at a rate of more than four 
times the growth rate of costs (9.5% 
compared to 2.0%). 
Positive operating leverage is one of the key 
execution priorities for the management in 
order to ensure that revenues increase at a 
faster rate than costs on an ongoing basis.
Growth KPIs 
The double digit loan book growth was 
boosted by the increased credit demand in 
the fourth quarter of 2013, reversing the trend 
of subdued demand for corporate credit 
during the first nine months of 2013. Retail 
Banking had a strong lending momentum 
throughout the year and saw a 19.6% 
growth in its loan book. Pick-up in 
Corporate Banking lending in the fourth 
quarter of 2013 led to the 7 .2% growth of 
Corporate Banking. We expect double digit 
growth of the net loan book over the 
medium term. 
In 2013, we comfortably financed the loan 
book growth by increasing our Client 
Deposits in spite of reduced deposit funding 
costs. The Loan to Deposit and DFI ratio 
stood at a comfortable level of 96.2% as of  
31 December 2013. The borrowed funds 
grew due the issuance of Eurobonds in 
November 2013, adding to the high liquidity 
pool, while strongly contributing to the 
improvement of Cost of Funding to 5.9% 
compared to 7.3% last year, thus allowing 
repayments of more costly international 
subordinated debt funding. 
Capital KPIs
In 2013, our capital position was further 
strengthened to a robust Tier I Capital 
Adequacy ratio of 23.0% from 21.2% in 
2012. Strong capital generating capability 
led to an increase in the annual dividend 
payment recommendation for 2013. The 
risk weighted assets increase of 7.0% 
reflects the 11.1% increase in interest 
earning assets during the year. In 2014 and 
beyond, we intend to maintain strong capital 
ratios, well above the regulatory requirements.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 19 Macroeconomic Risks and Political 
Risks Related to Georgia 
Difficult global economic conditions 
have had, and may continue to have,  
a material adverse effect on the Group
The Group’s business and performance are 
affected by macroeconomic and market 
conditions in Georgia and globally. In recent 
years, the global economy has experienced 
a severe downturn, with the financial services 
industry facing unprecedented turmoil. A 
shortage of liquidity, limited availability of 
funding, pressure on capital, deteriorating 
asset quality and significant price volatility 
across a wide range of asset classes put 
financial institutions, including the Group, 
under considerable pressure. Many developed 
economies entered into recession and growth 
slowed in many emerging economies, 
including Georgia. There continue to  
be concerns that certain countries and 
markets may experience “double-dip” or 
prolonged recessions, with certain markets 
experiencing heightened volatility over  
an extended period of time.
The financial crisis was accompanied by a 
number of related developments, including 
an erosion of confidence in financial 
institutions, increased currency volatility, 
increased counterparty risk and the risk  
of systemic failures. Such circumstances 
have caused disruptions in financial markets 
worldwide, leading to liquidity and funding 
difficulties in the international banking system. 
Access to capital, the credit markets, foreign 
direct investment and other forms of liquidity 
were significantly impaired and the cost of 
financing for financial institutions increased 
considerably. As a result, the cost of 
borrowing in wholesale debt markets 
increased for the Group and there were 
periods when it was not possible to raise 
finance in debt capital markets. The 
financial crisis also had a significant  
adverse effect on the valuation of assets 
and the capital position of many financial 
institutions globally.
The persistence or re-emergence of these 
conditions and their effects could create 
new dangers for the banking sector, both 
globally and in Georgia, which is ongoing 
and could have a material adverse effect  
on the Group’s business, its financial 
condition and the results of its operations.
Regional tensions could have an 
adverse effect on the local economy 
and the Group
Georgia, which is bordered by Russia, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey, could be 
adversely affected by social, political and 
military unrest within its borders and in 
surrounding countries. In particular, Georgia 
has had ongoing disputes in the breakaway 
regions of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali 
Region/South Ossetia and with Russia 
since the restoration of its independence  
in 1991. In the past, these disputes have  
led to sporadic violence and breaches of 
peace-keeping operations. In August 2008, 
the conflict in the Tskhinvali Region/South 
Ossetia escalated as Georgian troops 
engaged with local militias and Russian 
forces that crossed the international border, 
and Georgia declared a state of war (the 
2008 Conflict). Although Georgia and 
Russia signed a ceasefire, Russia has 
recognised the independence of the 
breakaway regions and tensions remain  
as Russian troops continue to occupy 
Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region/South 
Ossetia. Russia is also opposed to the 
eastward expansion of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation, potentially including 
ex-Soviet republics such as Georgia and 
Ukraine. In November 2013, Georgia’s 
Association Agreement with the EU, which 
includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free 
Trade Agreement, was initialled at the 
Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius. The 
signing of the agreement, which is expected 
in June 2014, could potentially be met with 
strong opposition from Russia. 
In addition, relations between Georgia’s 
principal neighbours, Azerbaijan and 
Armenia, remain tense, and there are 
sporadic instances of violence between 
these two countries. Any future deterioration 
or worsening of Georgia’s relationship with 
Russia, including those related to border 
and territorial disputes, any major changes 
in Georgia’s relations with Western 
governments and institutions (in particular  
in terms of national security), any changes  
in Georgia’s importance to Western energy 
supplies, any changes in the amount of aid 
granted to Georgia or the ability of Georgian 
manufacturers to access world export 
markets, or any significant deterioration in 
relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, 
may have a negative effect on the political 
and economic stability of Georgia.
 
In addition, the Group may be affected  
by social, political and military unrest in 
relations between Russia and Ukraine in 
relation to Crimea or otherwise. The social 
unrest in Ukraine in early 2014 resulted  
in an escalation of military tensions between 
Russia and Ukraine in February and March 
2014. This resulted in international uncertainty 
and periods of heightened volatility in financial 
markets and impacted the economic stability 
of Russia and Ukraine, and have resulted in 
political and economic sanctions being 
imposed by Western Governments against 
Russia. Russia and Ukraine accounted for 
6.5% and 6.6%, respectively of Georgia’s 
total exports in 2013. While the direct impacts 
on Georgian economy are not likely to be great, 
the indirect impact of increased tensions, 
sanctions or even war could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business,  
its financial condition and the results of  
its operations.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 As most of the Group’s businesses 
operate only within Georgia, the 
Group’s success is dependent on  
a number of economic, political and 
other factors affecting Georgia that  
are beyond its control 
Georgia accounted for over 90% of the 
Group’s total consolidated revenue in 2012 
and 2013. Therefore, macroeconomic 
factors relating to Georgia, such as GDP, 
inflation, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates, as well as unemployment 
and personal income have a material impact 
on loan losses, margins and customer 
demand for the Group’s products and 
services, which materially affects the Group’s 
business, financial condition and results of 
operations. Market turmoil and economic 
deterioration in Georgia can also have a 
material adverse effect on the liquidity, 
businesses or financial condition of the 
Group’s borrowers, which in turn can increase 
the Group’s non-performing loans, impair its 
loans and other financial assets and result in 
decreased demand for the Group’s products. 
In such an environment, consumer spending 
can decline and the value of assets used as 
collateral for the Group’s secured loans, 
including real estate, could also decrease 
significantly, which could reduce recoveries 
on defaulting loans. Any of these conditions 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition and 
the results of its operations. 
There can be no assurance that the 
Georgian economy will return to higher 
growth rates or that it will not experience  
a further deterioration.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
the Georgian economy became highly 
dollarised. The dollarisation rate of the 
banking system has fluctuated significantly 
in recent years. Although the NBG has 
adopted measures to support the 
development of Georgia’s domestic money 
markets, the dollarisation rate could adversely 
impact the effectiveness of the implementation 
of the NBG’s monetary and exchange rate 
policies, which could negatively impact the 
purchasing power of the Lari, restrict future 
GDP growth in Georgia and depress 
Georgia’s investment climate. Any of these 
effects could have a material adverse effect 
on the Georgian economy and, therefore,  
a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, its financial condition and the 
results of its operations.
Instability or a lack of growth in the 
domestic currency market may have  
an adverse effect on the development 
of Georgia’s economy and, in turn, 
have an adverse effect on the Group
Although the Lari is a fully convertible 
currency, there is generally no market 
outside Georgia for the exchange of Lari.  
A market exists within Georgia for the 
conversion of Lari into other currencies, but 
it is limited in size. While the Government of 
Georgia has stated that these reserves will 
be sufficient to sustain the domestic currency 
market in the short term, a lack of growth  
of this currency market may hamper the 
development of Georgia’s economy, which 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
businesses of the Group’s corporate 
customers and, in turn, a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, its financial 
condition and the results of its operations.
In addition, there has historically been 
significant instability in the Lari to US Dollar 
exchange rate, although during 2012 and 
2013 the exchange rate has remained 
relatively stable but with a gradual further 
depreciation against the US dollar through 
to the end of 2013. The ability of the 
Government of Georgia and the NBG to 
limit any volatility of the Lari will depend on  
a number of political and economic factors, 
including the NBG’s and the Government’s 
ability to control inflation, the availability of 
foreign currency reserves and foreign direct 
investment and other currency inflows. Any 
failure to do so, or a major depreciation  
or further devaluation of the Lari, could 
adversely affect Georgia’s economy. 
The Group is subject to the effects of high 
and sustained inflation within the Georgian 
economy. In the period between 2010 and 
2013, according to Geostat, Georgia 
experienced periods of both inflation and 
deflation and the rate of inflation also 
fluctuated greatly. High and sustained 
inflation could lead to market instability,  
a financial crisis, a reduction in consumer 
purchasing power and erosion of consumer 
confidence. On the other hand, deflation, 
whilst increasing the purchasing power  
of the Lari, could adversely affect foreign 
investment and the Group’s profitability  
in its lending activities. Any of these  
events could lead to a deterioration in the 
performance of Georgia’s economy and 
negatively affect the businesses of the 
Group’s customers, which could, in turn, 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition  
and the results of its operations
 
Political and governmental instability  
in Georgia could have a material 
adverse effect on the local economy 
and the Group 
Since the restoration of its independence  
in 1991, Georgia has undergone a major 
political transformation from a constituent 
republic in a federal socialist state to an 
independent sovereign democracy. Georgia 
has had major recent changes in government 
and in its constitution and laws, the latter  
in connection with a transition from a 
presidential to a parliamentary system of 
government. The current President (who 
acts as head of state with only limited 
powers) and Prime Minister are both from 
the same party, which won parliamentary 
elections in 2012 and presidential elections 
in 2013, sweeping the prior government, 
which had been in place since 2004,  
from power. 
 
Continuing economic and political reform 
are important to the future of Georgia. The 
previous government and current government 
have both been committed to reform and  
to business – and investor-friendly policies, 
but there can be no assurance that such 
business – and investor-friendly policies will 
continue or will not be reversed. While the 
recent elections and transitions of power 
have been peaceful, there can be no 
assurance that future elections will also  
be peaceful. The next elections to be held  
in Georgia are municipal elections scheduled 
for May and June 2014. There can be no 
assurance that the recent constitutional 
reforms will be stable, that the government 
will pursue the necessary reforms or that  
its policies will not change. Changes in 
government policy and any political 
instability may have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, its financial 
condition and the results of its operations. 
Risks Relating to the Group’s  
Lending Activities
The Group may not be able to maintain 
the quality of its loan portfolio
The quality of the Group’s loan portfolio is 
affected by changes in the creditworthiness 
of its customers, the ability of customers to 
repay their loans on time, the statutory priority 
of claims against customers and the Group’s 
ability to enforce its security interests on 
customers’ collateral should such customers 
fail to repay their loans and whether the 
value of such collateral is sufficient to cover 
the full amounts of those loans. In addition, 
the quality of the Group’s loan portfolio may 
deteriorate for various other reasons, including 
factors beyond the Group’s control such as 
any negative developments in Georgia’s 
economy resulting in the financial distress or 
bankruptcy of the Group’s customers or the 
unavailability or limited availability of credit 
information concerning certain customers, 
and other factors, such as a failure of the 
Group’s risk management procedures or  
a rapid expansion of the Group’s loan 
portfolio. The Group’s impairment charges 
and, in turn, its cost of credit risk, could 
increase if a single large borrower defaults 
or a material concentration of smaller 
borrowers default. There can be no 
assurance that in the longer term the Group’s 
loan portfolio quality will not deteriorate and 
that the Group’s loan impairment charges 
will not increase, which could, in turn, have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, its financial condition and the 
results of its operations.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 21 The Group’s loan portfolio for its Corporate 
Banking segment is somewhat concentrated, 
with the Group’s top 10 corporate 
borrowers accounting for 16.8% of  
the Group’s total loan portfolio as of  
31 December 2013 (gross of allowance for 
impairment). To the extent that the Group 
grows its loan portfolio by entering into 
additional arrangements with existing 
counterparties, it will increase its credit  
and general counterparty risk with respect 
to those counterparties.
Collateral values may decline
The Group held collateral against 88.6%  
of the Group’s total gross loans as of  
31 December 2013. The main forms of 
collateral taken by the Group in its corporate 
lending are charges over real estate, 
equipment, inventory and trade receivables. 
The main form of collateral taken by the 
Group in its retail lending is a mortgage  
over residential property. Downturns in  
the residential and commercial real estate 
markets or a general deterioration of 
economic conditions in the industries in 
which the Group’s customers operate may 
result in illiquidity and a decline in the value 
of the collateral securing the Group’s loans, 
including a decline to levels below the 
outstanding principal balance of those loans.
In addition, declining or unstable prices of 
collateral in Georgia may make it difficult for 
the Group to accurately value collateral held 
by it. If the fair value of the collateral held by 
the Group declines significantly in the future, 
the Group could be required to record 
additional provisions and could experience 
lower than expected recovery levels on 
collateralised loans. If any of these risks 
materialise, they could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business,  
its financial condition and the results of  
its operations.
Significant changes or volatility in the 
Group’s Net Interest Margin could have 
an adverse effect on the Group
The Group derives the majority of its total 
net income from net interest income. As a 
result, the Group’s operations are affected 
by fluctuations in its NIM. In particular, the 
Group’s banking operations depend on the 
management of key factors that affect the 
Group’s NIM, such as interest rates, 
competition for loans and deposits, 
customer demand and costs of funding. 
These key factors are influenced by factors 
beyond the Group’s control, such as global 
and local economic conditions, the 
resources of the Group’s competitors and 
consumer confidence. Interest rates are 
highly sensitive to many factors beyond the 
Group’s control, including monetary policies 
and domestic and international economic 
and political conditions and the reserve 
policies of the NBG.
A mismatch of interest-earning assets and 
interest-bearing liabilities in any given period 
resulting from changes in any of the key 
factors outlined above, or otherwise, could 
reduce the Group’s NIM. Any reduction in 
the Group’s NIM caused by changes in the 
key factors outlined above, or otherwise, 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s net interest income, which could,  
in turn, have a material adverse effect on  
the Group’s business, its financial condition 
and the results of its operations. 
In addition, any increase in interest rates 
may result in an increase in the periodic 
instalment amounts paid by the Group’s 
customers. Such an increase may result  
in difficulties related to the repayment of  
the assumed loans, which, in turn, may lead 
to a decrease in the quality of the Group’s 
loan portfolio and an increase in impairment 
provisions for loans extended to the Group’s 
customers, which could, in turn, have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, its financial condition and the 
results of its operations.
Currency fluctuations have affected, 
and may continue to affect, the Group
A substantial portion of the total assets of 
the Group, especially its loan portfolio, is 
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily 
US dollars, while the majority of customers 
who have their loans denominated in foreign 
currencies earn their income in Lari. Those 
customers are usually not protected against 
the fluctuations of the exchange rates of the 
Lari against the currency of the loan. 
Consequently, any depreciation of the Lari 
against the currency of the loan may result 
in difficulties in repayment of the loans, 
which, in turn, may lead to a decrease in the 
quality of the Group’s loan portfolio and an 
increase in impairment provisions for loans 
extended to the Group’s customers, which 
may have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition and 
the results of its operations.
In addition, the Group’s operations are 
affected by the Lari to Belarusian Rouble 
exchange rates as these affect the value of 
the Group’s equity interests in Joint Stock 
Company Belarusky Narodny Bank (BNB), 
its Belarusian subsidiary, on a consolidated 
basis and a depreciation of the Belarusian 
Rouble against the Lari has the effect of 
reducing BNB’s contribution to the Group’s 
consolidated capital. Such changes could 
affect its ability to comply with contractual 
covenants based on the Basel I Total 
Capital Adequacy ratio, calculated on  
a consolidated basis. 
The Group’s risk management methods 
may prove ineffective at mitigating 
credit risk
Losses relating to credit risk may arise if the 
risk management policies, procedures and 
assessment methods implemented by the 
Group to mitigate credit risk and to protect 
against credit losses prove less effective 
than expected. The Group employs 
qualitative tools and metrics for managing 
risk that are based on observed historical 
market behaviour. These tools and metrics 
may fail to predict future risk exposures, 
especially in periods of increased volatility 
or falling valuations, or in periods in which 
there is a rapid expansion of the Group’s 
loan portfolio. In addition, even though the 
Group requires regular financial disclosure 
by its corporate customers, customer 
financial statements may not always present 
a complete and accurate picture of each 
customer’s financial condition. Furthermore, 
some of the Group’s corporate customers 
may not have extensive or externally verified 
credit histories, and their accounts may not 
be audited by a reputable external auditor. 
Therefore, notwithstanding the Group’s 
credit risk evaluation procedures, the Group 
may be unable to evaluate effectively the 
current financial condition of each 
prospective corporate borrower and to 
evaluate effectively the ability of such 
corporate borrower to repay its loans  
when due. Similarly, the financial condition 
of some private individuals transacting

STRATEGIC REPORT
STRATEGIC REVIEW: 
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED business with the Group is difficult to 
assess and predict, as some retail 
borrowers have no or very limited credit 
history. Accordingly, the risk management 
systems employed by the Group may prove 
insufficient in measuring and managing risks 
and this may have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, its financial 
condition and the results of its operations.
Additional Risks Arising Principally from 
the Group’s Banking Activities
The Group faces liquidity risk
The Group becomes exposed to liquidity risk 
when the maturities of its assets and liabilities 
do not coincide. Liquidity risk is inherent in 
banking operations and can be heightened by 
a number of factors, including an overreliance 
on, or an inability to access, a particular 
source of funding, changes in credit ratings  
or market-wide phenomena such as financial 
market instability and natural disasters. 
Substantially all of the Group’s amounts due 
to customers have maturities of one year or 
less or are payable on demand. The Group 
seeks to manage its liquidity risk by, among 
other things, maintaining a diverse funding 
base comprising short-term sources of 
funding (including retail and corporate 
customer deposits, inter-bank borrowing  
and borrowing from the NBG) and longer- 
term sources of funding (including borrowing 
from international credit institutions, sales  
and purchases of securities and long-term 
debt securities).
 
The Group’s current liquidity may be 
affected by unfavourable financial market 
conditions. If assets held by the Group in 
order to provide liquidity become illiquid or 
their value drops substantially, the Group 
may therefore be required, or may choose 
to rely on other sources of funding to 
finance its operations and expected future 
growth. However, there is only a limited 
amount of funding available on the Georgian 
inter-bank market and the Group’s recourse 
to other funding sources may pose additional 
risks, including the possibility that other 
funding sources may be more expensive 
and less flexible. In addition, the Group’s 
ability to access such external funding 
sources is directly connected with the level 
of credit lines available to the Group, and 
this, in turn, is dependent on the Group’s 
financial and credit condition, as well as 
general market liquidity.
In addition, the Group is exposed to the  
risk of unexpected, rapid withdrawal of 
deposits by its customers in large volumes. 
Circumstances in which customers are 
more likely to rapidly withdraw deposits  
in large volumes include, among others,  
a severe economic downturn, a loss in 
consumer confidence, an erosion of trust  
in financial institutions or a period of social, 
economic or political instability. If a 
substantial portion of the Group’s customers 
rapidly or unexpectedly withdraw their 
demand or term deposits or do not roll  
over their term deposits upon maturity,  
this could have a material adverse effect  
on the Group’s business, its financial 
condition and the results of its operations.
The Group is subject to certain 
regulatory capital requirements
The Bank, in common with other regulated 
financial institutions in Georgia, is required 
to comply with certain capital adequacy and 
regulatory ratios set by the NBG. The Bank 
believes it is currently in compliance with all 
such ratios. 
In December 2010, the Basel Committee  
on Banking Supervision published the  
Basel III rules setting out certain changes  
to capital requirements applicable to banks. 
Implementation of the new combined 
regulation based on Basel II and Basel III  
will occur at a national level in 2014. The 
NBG is currently in the process of 
implementing Basel II and Basel III in 
Georgia. On 28 October 2013, the NBG 
published a regulation for capital adequacy 
based on Basel II and Basel III, which makes 
adjustments to certain Basel II and Basel III 
rules, including those relating to foreign 
currency additional risk weights, specific 
measurements and risk estimates. As 
notified by the NBG, the Group expects  
the implementation of BII and BIII on  
30 June 2014 for Pillar I and 30 September 
2014 for Pillar II. 
 
In addition, BNB is licensed by the NBRB 
and is required to comply with certain 
capital adequacy ratios and minimum  
share capital requirements set by the 
NBRB. BNB has not been in compliance 
with the minimum level of regulatory capital  
required by NBRB in order to hold deposits 
from individuals (set at the equivalent of  
€25 million for this purpose) since May 2011  
and had received a temporary waiver in 
respect of this breach. As of 31 March 2014, 
BNB was in compliance with the minimum 
capital requirements set by NBRB however, 
there is no assurance that BNB will be  
able to comply with the minimum level of 
regulatory capital in the future that it will  
be able to obtain a further waiver from  
the NBRB thereafter. 
The Group’s ability to comply with applicable 
capital adequacy and regulatory ratios 
could be affected by a number of factors, 
some of which are beyond the Group’s 
control, including:
 – the Group’s ability to raise capital;
 – losses resulting from a deterioration  
in the Group’s asset quality, a reduction 
in income levels, an increase in expenses 
or a combination of some or all of  
these factors;
 – a decline in the values of the Group’s 
securities portfolio;
 – changes in accounting rules or in the 
guidelines regarding the calculation  
of the capital adequacy ratios; and
 – increases in minimum capital adequacy 
ratios imposed by the NBG.
Failure to maintain the minimum capital 
adequacy and other regulatory ratios may 
have a material adverse effect on the Group. 
Moreover, a breach of regulatory requirements 
relating to the minimum capital adequacy 
and other regulatory ratios may result in 
entities in the Group being subject to 
regulatory or administrative sanctions, 
which could impact the Group’s ability  
to conduct its business, and result in an 
increase in the operating costs of the Group 
and loss of reputation, all of which could, in 
turn, have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition and 
the results of its operations.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 23 The Group’s businesses are subject to 
substantial regulation and oversight 
and future changes in regulation, fiscal 
or other policies are unpredictable
The Bank is required to comply with 
Georgian banking regulations. In addition  
to mandatory capital adequacy ratios, the 
NBG is authorised to set lending limits and 
other economic ratios in Georgia, with 
which the Bank is required to comply. 
Under Georgian banking regulations, the 
Bank is required to, among other things, 
comply with minimum reserve requirements 
and mandatory financial ratios and file 
periodic reports. In addition to its banking 
operations, the Group also provides other 
regulated financial services and offers 
financing products, including brokerage and 
pension fund operations, insurance and 
healthcare products through its Insurance 
and Healthcare subsidiary and services 
such as asset management, that are 
subject to governmental supervision.  
In addition, if regulations change or if the 
Group acquires or expands its businesses, 
the Group may become subject to 
additional rules and regulations at a 
national, international or supranational level, 
which may impact the Group’s operations. 
Additionally, the business, financial 
condition and results of operations of the 
Group’s activities in Belarus are affected  
by legal regulations, instructions and 
recommendations, including those issued 
by the NBRB and the NBG. 
The Group may be unable to enforce, or 
may experience difficulties and delays in 
enforcing, the security which has been 
granted to it by its customers. For example, 
the Parliament has in the recent past 
established, or considered establishing, 
moratoriums or restrictions on enforcement 
measures over certain properties that are 
secured as collateral in financing transactions. 
Any of these actions, and any future changes 
to laws or regulations, may restrict the ability 
of the Group to enforce security granted by 
its customers and may otherwise impair the 
value of such collateral, which in turn may 
result in illiquidity of the collateral, increase 
of credit risk and emergence of bad loans 
and may have negative effects on the 
economy and the Georgian banking sector, 
including the Bank. Furthermore, such 
legislative changes may decrease the  
inflow of foreign investments in Georgia, 
which could have a negative effect on  
the economy, which could, in turn, have  
a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, financial condition and results  
of operations. If any of these risks 
materialise, they could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business,  
its financial condition and the results of  
its operations
In addition, the current Georgian Dream 
coalition government is in the process of 
preparing and finalising a range of new 
initiatives, including anti-monopoly 
regulations and changes to the regulation  
of the Healthcare sector. Certain of the 
Government’s proposals, including the 
decision adopted in the beginning of 2014 
to establish a state insurance company to 
provide a basic insurance package for every 
Georgian citizen, could have a material 
impact on the business, financial condition 
and results of operations of the Group in 
general, and on the Group’s insurance and 
healthcare subsidiary Aldagi in particular.  
The corporate income tax rate in Georgia is 
15%. Under the Economic Liberty Act which 
entered into force on 1 January 2014, 
subject to certain exceptions, referenda are 
required to be held before raising taxes and 
tax rates. However, no assurance can be 
given that there will not be a future increase 
in corporate income tax in Georgia. Any 
significant increase in the rate of corporate 
income tax in Georgia or other changes in 
taxation policy could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business,  
its financial condition and the results of its 
operations.
Future changes in regulation, fiscal or other 
policies are unpredictable and there is often 
a delay between the announcement of a 
change and the publication of detailed  
rules relating to such change. There can  
be no assurance that the current regulatory 
environment in which the Group operates 
will not be subject to significant change in 
the future, including as a result of a change 
in government in Georgia or Belarus, or that 
the Group will be able to comply with any or 
all resulting regulations. 
The Group is subject to operational 
risk inherent in its business activities, 
which includes the risk that the Group 
is highly dependent on its information 
technology systems and is subject to 
the risk of cyber attacks
The Group is subject to the risk of incurring 
losses or undue costs due to the inadequacies 
or failure of internal processes or systems  
or human error, or from errors made during 
the execution or performance of operations, 
clerical or record-keeping errors, business 
disruptions (caused by various factors such 
as software or hardware failures and 
communication breakdowns), failure  
to execute outsourced activities, criminal 
activities (including credit fraud and 
electronic crimes), unauthorised 
transactions, robbery and damage  
to assets.
The Group’s operations are highly 
dependent on its information technology 
systems. The proper functioning of the 
Group’s payment systems, financial 
controls, risk management, credit analysis 
and reporting, accounting, customer service 
and other information technology systems, 
as well as the communication networks 
within the Group, are critical to the Group’s 
operations. Any critical system failure, 
prolonged loss of service availability or 
material breach of data security (particularly 
involving confidential customer data) could 
cause serious damage to the Group’s ability 
to service its customers, could result in 
significant compensation costs, could 
breach regulations under which the Group 
operates and could cause long-term 
damage to the Group’s business and  
brand. For example, failure to protect the 
Group’s operations from cyber attacks 
could result in the loss of customer data or 
other sensitive information. The threats are 
increasingly sophisticated and there can be 
no assurance that the Group will be able to 
prevent all threats. 
Any failure of the Group’s risk management 
system to detect unidentified or 
unanticipated risks, or to correct operational 
risks, or any failure of third parties 
adequately to perform outsourced activities 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition and 
the results of its operations. 
Risks Affecting the Group’s  
Non-Banking Activities 
The Group’s Insurance and Healthcare 
subsidiary, Aldagi, is subject to the 
risks inherent in the insurance industry
Aldagi Insurance operates in the property 
and casualty, life and health insurance 
industry. In the ordinary course of business, 
Aldagi seeks to reduce losses that may arise 
from catastrophes or other events through 
reinsurance. Under such reinsurance 
arrangements, reinsurers assume a portion 
of the losses and related expenses, however, 
Aldagi remains liable as the direct insurer  
on all risks reinsured. Consequently, ceded 
24

STRATEGIC REPORT
STRATEGIC REVIEW: 
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate 
Aldagi’s obligation to pay under its insurance 
policy for losses insured, which could cause 
a material increase in Aldagi’s liabilities and a 
reduction in its profitability. Moreover, Aldagi 
is subject to its reinsurers’ credit risk and 
solvency and their willingness to make 
payments under the terms of reinsurance 
arrangements with respect to its ability to 
recover amounts due from them.
The failure of any reinsurer to meet  
its financial obligations to Aldagi could 
negatively impact Aldagi’s financial 
condition and results of operations. In 
addition, the availability, amount and  
cost of reinsurance depend on general 
market conditions which may fluctuate. 
Reinsurance may not be available to Aldagi 
at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, 
and any decrease in the amount of Aldagi’s 
reinsurance will increase its risk of loss.
Aldagi establishes reserves for reported 
claims, incurred but not reported claims  
and unearned premiums. Reserves do not 
represent an exact calculation of liability,  
but instead represent estimates of what the 
ultimate settlement and administration of 
claims will cost based on an assessment  
of facts and circumstances then known, 
review of historical settlement patterns, 
estimates of trends in claims severity, 
frequency of claims, legal theories of  
liability and other factors. There can be  
no assurance that actual claims will not 
materially exceed its claims reserves and 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition and 
the results of its operations.
The Government of Georgia undertook a 
range of new initiatives relating to the 
regulation of healthcare in Georgia. In 2013, 
under the state-funded Universal Health Care 
Programme (the Healthcare Programme),  
the Government has begun to provide a  
basic insurance package for every Georgian 
citizen not already covered by any insurance, 
including certain vulnerable groups such as 
pensioners, students and children already 
covered by the Healthcare Programme in 
place since 2007 . The coverage of the groups 
described above under the Healthcare 
Programme is currently provided through 
private insurance companies. In 2014, the 
Government announced its intention to 
establish a state insurance company to 
provide basic universal healthcare coverage 
for Georgian citizens (rather than through 
private insurance companies), under the 
Government’s Healthcare Programme. 
The Group’s insurance subsidiary, Aldagi, 
currently provides Government-funded 
insurance coverage to certain groups,  
such as the socially vulnerable, pensioners, 
students and children that fall under the 
Healthcare Programme. The establishment of 
a state insurance company to provide basic 
insurance coverage for all citizens of Georgia 
will result in the elimination in the Government-
funded insurance policies that Aldagi provides 
thereby reducing Aldagi’s revenues.
The Group’s real estate subsidiary, m2 
Real Estate, is subject to the risks of 
developing and selling real estate
The Group’s real estate subsidiary m2 Real 
Estate, is primarily engaged in developing 
affordable residential properties for sale and 
rent. Real estate property investments are 
subject to varying degrees of risk, which 
affect the level of income from the value  
of, properties including:
 – changes in the Georgian economic 
climate;
 – local conditions such as a surplus  
of similar properties or a reduction  
in demand for the property;
 – the attractiveness of the property  
to tenants and purchasers;
 – occupancy rates and the ability  
to collect rent from tenants;
 – laws and governmental regulations, 
including environmental regulation, tax 
laws and insurance regulations; and
 – acts of nature, such as earthquakes, 
floods and other extreme weather 
events that may damage property.
In addition, m2 Real Estate’s projects are 
subject to the general risks associated with 
construction and development, including:
 – cost overruns due to increased material, 
labour or other costs, which could make 
completion of the project unprofitable;
 – the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, 
required zoning, land use, building, 
occupancy, and other Governmental 
permits and authorisations, which could 
result in increased costs and delays in 
completion or could require m2 Real Estate 
to abandon a project entirely; and
 – m2 Real Estate may be unable to 
complete construction and leasing  
of a property on schedule.
Any of these factors could have a material 
adverse effect on the financial condition and 
operating results of m2 Real Estate, which 
may have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition and 
the results of its operations.
Other Risks Affecting the Group
The Group may not successfully 
implement its strategy
The Group aims to achieve long-term 
sustainable growth and profitability through 
a secure, modern and universal banking 
model, as well as to maintain and enhance 
its leading market position in Georgia.  
In addition, the Group’s strategy is to 
diversify its business through the addition  
of businesses and services that have strong 
synergies with its banking operations.  
The Group intends to exit from its other 
non-core operations, including through  
the sale of Joint Stock Company Liberty 
Consumer (Liberty Consumer), its  
remaining equity interest in BG Bank  
and, in due course, its interest in BNB.  
In addition, from time to time, the Group 
may seek to pursue selective acquisitions  
in Georgia and abroad.
There can be no assurance that the Group 
will be able to achieve its major strategic 
objectives, including in respect of its 
synergistic businesses, such as Insurance 
and Healthcare, which may be affected by 
market conditions, potential legal and 
regulatory impediments and other factors,  
or that it will be able to exit from its non-core 
operations at a satisfactory price, or at all. 
See “Description of Business – Synergistic 
Businesses – Insurance and Healthcare”. 
Any failure by the Group to achieve its 
strategic objectives could have a material 
adverse impact on the Group’s reputation, 
which could, in turn, have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, its financial 
condition and the results of its operations.
The Group faces competition
In recent years the Georgian banking sector 
has become increasingly competitive. 
According to the NBG, at 31 December 
2013, there were 21 commercial banks 
operating in Georgia, 20 of which are 
foreign controlled. Additionally, in Belarus, 
the Group competes with a wide range of 
local (including state-owned) and 
international banks.
Overview 1-9 Strategic Review 10-27 Performance 28-63 Governance 64-103 Financial Statements 104-182 Additional Information 183-188
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 25 Increased competition may have a negative 
impact on the Group’s ability to sustain its 
margin and fee levels, particularly if the 
Group’s competitors possess greater 
financial resources (especially in the case  
of banks with foreign capital investment or 
banks which are branches or subsidiaries  
of non-resident foreign banks, by way of 
access to funding from foreign capital or 
their parent entity), access to lower-cost 
funding and a broader offering of products 
than the Group, or if the Group’s 
competitors merged to significantly enhance 
their financial resources, access to funding 
and product offerings. In addition, 
increasing competition could lead to 
significant pressure on the Group’s market 
share. Increasing competition in the banking 
industry has already led to and may, in the 
future, continue to lead to increased pricing 
pressures on the Group’s products and 
services, which could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and results of operations.
There can be no assurance that the current 
regulatory environment in which the Group 
operates with respect to competition and 
anti-monopoly matters will not be subject  
to significant change in the future. Anti-
monopoly matters with respect to the 
banking services sector are currently 
handled by the NBG. However, the 
Georgian Government may, in the future, 
seek to legislate or regulate competition  
and anti-monopoly matters in the Georgian 
banking industry through a Governmental 
agency other than the NBG. The 
introduction of any anti-monopoly 
restrictions may have an effect on the 
growth rates of the Group, restrict the 
Group’s ability to make future acquisitions 
or lead to the Group being compulsorily 
required to sell some of its assets or exit  
or reduce business areas.
The Group depends on its key 
management and qualified personnel
The Group’s current senior management 
team includes a number of persons that the 
Bank Management Board believes contribute 
significant experience and expertise in the 
banking and other industries in which the 
Group operates. The Group’s ability to 
continue to retain, motivate and attract 
qualified and experienced banking and 
management personnel is vital to the 
Group’s business. There can be no 
assurance that the Group will be able to 
successfully recruit and retain the necessary 
qualified personnel. The loss or diminution 
in the services of members of the Group’s 
senior management team or an inability to 
recruit, train or retain necessary personnel 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition and 
the results of its operations.
The Group’s insurance policies may  
not cover, or fully cover, certain types 
of losses
The Group generally maintains insurance 
policies covering its assets, operations and 
certain employees in line with general 
business practices in Georgia. The Group 
seeks to insure against a range of risks, 
including fire, lightning, flooding, theft, 
vandalism and third-party liability. The 
Group also maintains Bankers’ Blanket 
Bond and Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance. However, there can be no 
assurance that all types of potential losses 
are insured or that policy limits would be 
adequate to cover them. Any uninsured loss 
or a loss in excess of insured limits could 
adversely affect the Group’s existing 
operations and could, in turn, have a 
material adverse effect on the Group's 
business, its financial condition and the 
results of its operations.
The Group faces certain risks 
associated with conducting 
international operations
The Group’s financial results have in the 
past been adversely affected by write-
downs of goodwill associated with its 
investments in Joint Stock Company BG 
Bank (BG Bank) and BNB, as well as the 
weak economic environment in Ukraine and 
a material devaluation of the Belarusian 
Rouble. As part of its revised strategy to 
concentrate on the Georgian market the 
Group disposed of an 80% equity interest in 
BG Bank in February 2011. The Group will 
continue to seek to exit from its international 
operations (including its remaining equity 
interest in BG Bank and, in due course, 
BNB) at an appropriate time. While it holds 
these assets, the Group will continue to be 
subject to risks relating to these operations, 
including certain political and economic 
risks, compliance risks and foreign currency 
exchange risks, as well as the risk of failure 
to market adequately to potential customers 
in other countries Any failure to manage 
such risks may cause the Group to incur 
increased liabilities, which could, in turn, 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, its financial condition  
and the results of its operations.
If the Group fails to comply with any 
applicable laws and regulations 
relating to money laundering, terrorist 
financing or tax compliance, this could 
have an adverse effect on the Group
The Group is subject to Georgian, foreign 
and international laws, regulations and 
practices relating to, among other things, 
money laundering, terrorist financing and 
tax compliance. The Group has implemented 
comprehensive anti-money laundering, “know- 
your-customer”, “know your corresponding 
bank” and “know your employee” policies 
and is in the process of implementing such 
policies throughout its financial subsidiaries 
(including insurance and brokerage 
subsidiaries). However, if the Group fails to 
comply with any such laws and regulations, 
this could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s business, its financial condition 
and the results of its operations. In addition, 
involvement in such activities may carry 
criminal or regulatory fines and sanctions. 
The Group is also subject to the US Foreign 
Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).  
As foreign financial institutions for purposes 
of FATCA, from 1 July 2014, entities within 
the Group will be subject to a 30%. US 
withholding tax on certain types of income 
derived from US sources (including interest 
and dividends) unless the members of  
the Group become participating foreign 
financial institutions or are otherwise 
deemed compliant with FATCA. While the 
Group believes that its preparations and 
options are sufficient to ensure compliance 
by the Group with FATCA, if entities within 
the Group suffer FATCA withholding on 
payments to them, this may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business and, 
in turn, on its financial condition and the 
results of its operations.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED Other Risks Relating to  
Emerging Markets
The uncertainties of the judicial  
system in Georgia, or any arbitrary  
or discriminatory state action taken  
in Georgia in the future, may have a 
material adverse effect on the local 
economy, which could and in turn,  
have an adverse effect on the Group
Georgia is still developing an adequate legal 
framework required for the proper functioning 
of a market economy. The recent nature of 
much of Georgian legislation and the rapid 
evolution of the Georgian legal system place 
the quality and the enforceability of laws in 
doubt and result in ambiguities and 
inconsistencies in their application. In 
addition, the court system in Georgia is 
understaffed and its judges are generally 
less experienced in the area of business 
and corporate law than is the case in certain 
other countries. The uncertainties of the 
Georgian judicial system could have a 
negative effect on the Georgian economy, 
which could, in turn, have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and operational results. 
In addition, to varying degrees, the same 
uncertainties of the judicial system in 
Georgia as discussed above apply to Belarus.
Uncertainties in the tax system in Georgia 
and Belarus may result in the Group facing 
tax adjustments or fines in the future and 
there may be changes in current tax laws 
and policies. 
In Georgia and Belarus, tax laws have not 
been in force for significant periods of time, 
are often unclear in their implementation 
and application and are subject to frequent 
changes, which results in complexities for 
the Group. Differing opinions regarding the 
interpretation of various provisions exist 
both among and within Governmental 
ministries and organisations, including  
the tax authorities, creating uncertainties, 
inconsistencies and areas of conflict. There 
can be no assurance that the current tax 
laws or Government tax policies will not be 
subject to change in the future, including 
any changes introduced as a result of a 
change of government. Such changes 
could include the introduction of new taxes, 
an increase in the tax rates applicable to the 
Group or its customers or the introduction 
of a bank levy. Any such changes in the tax 
laws or Governmental tax policies may have 
a material adverse effect on the Group. 
There are additional risks associated 
with investing in emerging markets 
such as Georgia
Financial or political instability in emerging 
markets also tends to have a material 
adverse effect on the capital markets of 
emerging economies and the wider 
economy as investors generally move their 
money to more developed markets, which 
may be considered to be more stable. 
These risks may be compounded by 
incomplete, unreliable, unavailable or 
untimely economic and statistical data  
on Georgia.

Consolidated Summary  
Income Statement
This summary compares the financial 
results for the year ended 31 December 
2013 to the year ended 31 December 2012. 
The Group reported full year 2013 record 
profit of GEL 209.3 million, a 16.6% increase 
compared to the prior year. The 2013 
performance reflects the strong profitability 
maintained during the year on the back of 
significantly reduced Cost of Funding and 
improved efficiency across the business.  
As a result, the Group posted a Return on 
Average Equity (ROAE) of 18.6%, translating 
into the earnings per share growth of 13.6% 
to GEL 5.93 per share, which compares to 
GEL 5.22 per share in 2012.
The Group’s 2013 revenue growth of 9.5% 
to a record revenue of GEL 545.5 million 
was driven by both strong net interest 
income and non-interest income growth, 
predominantly a result of solid performance 
of Aldagi, the Group’s Insurance and 
Healthcare business. The contribution of 
Insurance and Healthcare revenue to total 
revenue increased from 11.5% in 2012  
to 12.4% in 2013, which is in line with 
management’s strategy to diversify its 
revenue sources.

1.  To be approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The 10.6% year-on-year growth of a net 
interest income was primarily a result of a 
7.9% decline in interest expense and a 1.1% 
increase in interest income reflecting the 
subdued loan book growth in the first nine 
months of year. The considerable decline in 
interest expense was primarily attributed to 
the reduction in Cost of Funding to 5.9% in 
2013 from 7.3% in 2012, in line with the 
Group’s strategy of optimising its funding 
costs. The main driver of the decline of 
interest expense, the Group’s Cost of 
Deposits (amounts due to customers), was 
reduced by 170 bps to 5.6% in 2013 compared 
to the prior year following the reduction of 
contractual deposit rates on one year US 
Dollar deposits by 300 basis points on the 
back of continuous inflow of deposits. The 
reduction of funding costs compares with  
a relatively moderate decline in Loan Yields 
that were reduced from 17 .5% in 2012 to 
16.2% in 2013. 
NIM remained broadly flat in 2013 at 7.8%  
in 2013 compared to 7.9% in 2012, reflecting 
the effect of a 140 bps decline in the cost  
of funding on the back of 130 bps decline  
in the Loan Yield during the same period 
and the 52.3% year-on-year increase in 
excess liquidity. The increase in average 
liquid assets and excess liquidity, high  
levels of which were maintained throughout  
the year, was predominantly a result  
of the US$150 Eurobond tap issue in 
November 2013. The proceeds from the 
Eurobonds have not yet been deployed  
into funding loans, significantly increasing 
the liquidity pool.

The NBG’s newly introduced transitional 
additional liquidity requirement relating to 
non-resident deposits resulted in a GEL 1 18.3 
million decline in excess liquidity in 2013.  
The NBG introduced an updated liquidity 
model for a transition period starting  
1 July 2013, as the NBG moves towards a 
new liquidity framework based on Basel III 
Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR) with some 
modifications taking into account specifics 
about the Georgian banking system. Before 
the full introduction of LCR, the NBG applies 
an additional liquidity requirement for 
non-resident deposits that are in excess  
of 10% of the total deposits of a bank. 
The Group’s diversified revenue sources  
are reflected in its net non-interest income 
that reached its record GEL 231.4 million, 
accounting for 42.4% of the Group’s revenue 
in 2013. The 8.0% growth of the net 
non-interest income predominantly reflects 
the robust performance of Aldagi, the 
Group’s insurance and healthcare business, 
which posted a combined net revenue of 
GEL 67.7 million in 2013, up 17.8% year-on-
year. Net insurance premiums earned 
increased by 42.6%, with growth coming 
from all lines of insurance business, 
particularly health insurance, which saw 
particularly strong growth as the Group 
expanded into the healthcare business. Net 
insurance claims incurred also increased 
48.4% in 2013 as a result of the growth of 
business. The strong performance of the 
Aldagi Healthcare business was impacted by 
the higher growth rate of healthcare costs 
compared to healthcare revenue during  
the year. This was partially attributed to  
the lower revenue streams as the roll-out of 
new hospitals was completed in the middle 
of the year. In addition, certain accounting 
reclassifications, resulting in additional 
depreciation and utility expenses, were 
included in the cost of healthcare services  
in 2013, which in prior years were  
included in operating expenses. 
Net fee and commission income results 
reflect the slow-down in the economic 
activity of the Group’s clients across 
guarantees and letters of credit and 
brokerage advisory businesses. In addition, 
the high client acquisition rate within the 
Express Banking strategy in 2013, especially 
through the popularity of its Express Card  
a contactless travel card linked to a current 
account and its newly introduced Express 
Merchant service contributed to the 
exceptionally high fee and commission 
expense, contributing to the relatively low 
growth of 0.5% of net fee and commission 
income for 2013.

Profit 209,343 179,552 16.6%
The 14.2% increase in other operating 
non-interest income, adjusted for last  
year’s one-off FX gain by BNB, was driven 
by an increase in the net gain from trading 
and investment securities, which as of  
31 December 2013 mostly consisted of 
NBG CDs, government treasury bills and 
bonds. Other operating income increased 
primarily due to an increase of net revenue 
from the sale of goods of the Bank’s 
non-banking subsidiaries, m2 Real Estate 
and Teliani Valley, a leading Georgian 
wine-maker. 
The Group successfully continued to deliver 
positive operating leverage as management 
remains focused on keeping a tight grip on 
costs. Operating expenses increased 2.0%  
to GEL 225.6 million, which significantly lags 
behind the revenue growth rate of 9.5%.  
As a result, operating leverage stood at  
7.5 percentage points in 2013, marking the 
fourth consecutive year of positive operating 
leverage. The growth in operating expenses 
was primarily fuelled by a 10.2% growth  
in salaries and other employee benefits to  
GEL 135.1 million following an increase in 
headcount by more than 600 employees  
in 2013 to service the growth of business  
of the Bank’s subsidiaries. Benefiting from 
the success of the Express Banking 
strategy that aims to boost transactional 
banking using IT technologies, Bank of 
Georgia’s headcount on a stand-alone 
basis, declined by 4.3% to 3,574 employees 
as of 31 December 2013. 
Efficiency gains and various cost containment 
measures throughout the year, led to the 
10.0% decline in general and administrative 
expenses to GEL 60.4 million in 2013. As a 
result of the foregoing, the Cost to Income 
ratio fell to a record low 41.4% compared to 
44.4% in 2012.
The Group’s operating income before the 
cost of credit risk increased by 15.4% to 
GEL 319.9 million in 2013. 
The cost of credit risk increased to GEL 
61.8 million in 2013 from GEL 44.7 million  
in 2012, largely reflecting impairment 
charges related to both the Retail Banking 
and Corporate Banking loan portfolios, 
translating into a Cost of Risk of 1.4% for the 
year. The Cost of Risk improved markedly in 
Q4 2013 (to an annualised 0.9% from 1.8% 
in Q4 2012 and 1.6% in Q3 2013), as  
a result of lower impairment charges as well 
as higher recoveries compared to 2012.
The Group’s NPLs, defined as the principal 
and interest on loans overdue for more  
than 90 days and additional potential loss 
estimated by management, increased by 
GEL 18.6 million in 2013 and totalled  
GEL 144.9 million, reflecting a lower level  
of write-offs during the year. The NPL 
coverage ratio stood at 83.8% as of  
31 December 2013 compared to  
87.5% as of 31 December 2012.  
The NPL Coverage ratio (adjusted for  
the discounted value of collateral) stood  
at 110.6% as of 31 December 2013, 
compared to 112.7% a year before. 
The Group’s net operating income totalled 
GEL 258.1 million, up 11.1% year-on-year.  
In 2013, the Group’s net non-operating 
expenses declined to GEL 12.8 million  
from GEL 19.6 million in 2012, reflecting  
the absence of tender offer and premium 
listing fees incurred in 2012.
As a result of the foregoing, profit before 
income tax in 2013 totalled GEL 245.3 
million, an increase of GEL 32.5 million,  
or 15.3% year-on-year. After income tax 
expense of GEL 35.9 million, the Group’s 
profit for the period stood at GEL 209.3 
million, up 16.6%.

OVERVIEW OF  
FINANCIAL RESULTS
CONTINUED Balance sheet summary
The Group’s balance sheet remains well 
capitalised and highly liquid. Client deposits 
and amounts due to credit institutions 
(which includes our Eurobond issuance), 
were the main source of funding of the 
15.3% year-on-year growth of total assets  
in 2013. Remarkably (especially, as regards 
to deposits), the increase in liabilities was 
achieved in an environment of declining 
funding rates, resulting in a significant 
reduction of funding costs. 
As of 31 December 2013, the Group’s total 
assets stood at GEL 6,521.0 million, an 
increase of 15.3% since 31 December 2012. 
In addition to the loan book, the growth in 
total assets reflects growth in liquid assets,  
up by GEL 297 .4 million following the issuance 
of the Eurobonds, the proceeds from which 
have not yet been fully deployed in loans.
The main driver of the asset growth for the 
period was a GEL 430.6 million (13.9% 
year-on-year) loan book growth, as the 
demand for credit picked up in Q4 2013. 
Retail Banking loan book growth, which  
was consistent throughout the year, reached 
GEL 1,612.9 million, up 19.6% year-on-year, 
while the demand for corporate credit, which 
was subdued in the first nine months of the 
year, picked up in Q4 2013, gaining 8.6% 
quarter-on-quarter. 
Client deposits, which accounted for  
58.8% of the Group’s total liabilities, grew  
by 18.5% year-on-year to their record level of 
GEL 3, 107 .2 million at the same time as their 
cost was reduced by 170 bps to 5.6%. The 
Bank reduced its contractual interest rates 
significantly, bringing rates on the one year 
term US Dollar denominated deposits from  
8% at the beginning of the year down to 5% 
since June 2013. 
Our strong focus on liability management 
throughout the period also enabled us to 
reduce the cost of amounts due to credit 
institutions by 60 bps to 6.6% as the Group 
repaid some of its more costly subordinated 
borrowings. The issuance of lower cost 
Eurobonds in November 2013 was the main 
cause of the overall increase in amounts 
due to credit institutions, which grew by 
13.8% to GEL 1,886.1 million.
The Bank’s Book Value per share on  
31 December 2013 stood at GEL 34.85 
(US$20.07/£12.18) compared to  
GEL 30.33/(US$18.31/£11.38) as  
of 31 December 2012.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 33 De-dollarisation of both sides of the  
balance sheet remained one of the top 
priorities for management in 2013. The 
deposit rate cuts, as well as helping to  
bring down cost of funds, supported  
efforts to de-dollarise the Bank’s liabilities. 
The cuts were more pronounced on US 
Dollar denominated deposits, resulting in a 
widening differential between GEL and US 
Dollar denominated deposits encouraging  
a growth of GEL savings. Although the  
4.8% downward correction of GEL versus 
US Dollar in 2013 remained a stimulus for 
The Group’s liquidity position remained well 
above regulatory requirements in 2013. The 
Group’s liquidity ratio, as per the requirements 
of the NBG, stood at 45.7% against a required 
minimum of 30%, while liquid assets, 
(comprising of cash and cash equivalents, 
amounts due from credit institutions and 
investment securities) accounted for 29.5% 
of total assets and 36.4% of total liabilities.

BUSINESS REVIEW:
OVERVIEW OF  
FINANCIAL RESULTS
CONTINUED
the purposes of de-dollarising liabilities,  
the differential nevertheless led to a faster 
growth of GEL denominated client deposits 
compared to foreign currency deposits 
growth for the period (21.4% compared  
to 17.1%, respectively). 
Following targeted measures to de-dollarise 
the asset side of the balance sheet, Lari 
denominated loans increased 25.8% 
compared to an 8.4% increase in foreign 
currency denominated loans in 2013. The 
Lari denominated growth rate was positively 
impacted by the NBG’s Lari lending  
support programme. The programme 
entails providing financing to Georgian 
banks for GEL denominated loans linked  
to the refinancing rate. In 2013, the Bank 
issued GEL 27.0 million Lari denominated 
mortgages under the NBG programme and 
SME loans, which contributed strongly to 
the increase of the share of GEL denominated 
loans in total loans from 31.7% in 2012 to 
34.9% in 2013.

The increase in liquidity was primarily  
due to the additional Eurobond issuance  
in November 2013, which significantly 
contributed to the increased liquidity pool 
as the proceeds from the Eurobonds have 
not yet been deployed in funding loans. 
Effective 1 July 2013, the NBG introduced  
a transitional amendment to its existing 
liquidity ratio, imposing additional liquidity 
requirements relating to non-resident 
deposits. As of 31 December 2013, the 
additional impact on liquidity due to this 
transitional regulation amounted to GEL

The composition of the Group’s balance 
sheet reflects its aim to maintain a diversified 
funding base, while optimising funding  
costs. Net Loans/Customer Funds ratio 
stood at 113.0% as of 31 December 2013, 
compared to 114.8% as of 31 December 
2012. Net Loans/Customer Funds and 
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) 
however increased by 4.3 percentage points 
to 96.2%, as a result of a pick-up in lending 
and the repayment of selected loans from 
DFIs following the Eurobond issuance in 
November 2013. Borrowed funds from  
DFIs made up 10.3% of total liabilities,  
down from 14.6% as a result of repayment  
of subordinated loans. 
The Bank ended the year with a particularly 
strong capital position with a robust Tier I 
Capital ratio (BIS) of 23.0%. This is a further 
improvement from the 21.2% Tier I Capital 
ratio as of 31 December 2012. The NBG 
Capital ratios were mainly affected by  
net income, dividend payment and the 
repayment of costly subordinated loans.
The NBG approved and published a  
new capital adequacy regulation on  
28 October 2013. Pillar I requirements 
become effective 30 June 2014, although 
reporting under the new regulation is 
effective 1 January 2014. Pillar II (ICAAP) 
requirements shall become effective 30 
September 2014. A transition period is due 
to continue through 1 January 2017, during 
which the Bank will be required to comply 
with both, the new, as well as the old, 
capital regulations of the NBG. The new 
capital regulation is based on Basel II/III 
requirements, adjusted for the NBG’s 
discretionary items. The Bank has been 
already calculating its capital adequacy in 
compliance with the new regulation since 
2013. The Bank sees no particular risks 
associated with the new regulation and the 
transition period and it expects its absolute 
capital requirement to stay materially  
unchanged or even slightly reduced.
Key differences between BIS and NBG 
capital regulations are summarised below:
 – BIS is based on Bank of Georgia Group 
consolidated audited IFRS numbers, 
while NBG is based on Bank stand-
alone unaudited numbers per NBG 
standards. 
 – Per NBG standard, 175% total risk 
weighting (including both credit risk and 
market risk) is applied to loans 
denominated in foreign currency (with 
an exception for export-related income 
of a borrower), while a maximum of 
100% total risk weighting is applied to 
such loans under Basel. 
 – Current year profit per the NBG 
standard is part of Tier II Capital and 
moves to Tier I Capital at the start of the 
next year, while per BIS, current year 
profit is part of total retained earnings 
and, therefore, included in Tier I of 
current year.

CONTRIBUTING 48.4% AND 48.2% OF 
THE GROUP’S TOTAL REVENUE AND 
PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY. 
The growth was primarily driven by a 10.0% 
growth in net interest income reflecting the 
combination of 19.6% year-on-year growth 
in Retail Banking net loans with a 160 bps 
decline in retail Loan Yields. Retail Banking 
Cost of Deposits declined by 80 bps to 
5.3% in 2013 as a result of a reduction in 
contractual rates. The relatively slow growth 
of Retail Banking’s net fee and commission 
income in 2013 was mostly due to the 
increase in fee and commission expenses 
associated with the new client acquisition in 
line with the expansion of Express Banking 
strategy. The Express Banking strategy 
continued to boost the growth of current 
account balances, which increased 45.7% 
year-on-year or by GEL 89.6 million to GEL 
285.7 million in 2013 and over 190,000 
clients were added during 2013. 
Cost of credit risk increased from GEL 12.5 
million in 2012 to GEL 29.2 million in 2013 
placing a downward pressure on Retail 
Banking profit, which amounted to GEL 
100.9 million, down by 0.6% year-on-year. 
However, Retail Banking cost of credit risk 
showed signs of improvement in Q4 2013,

Bank of Georgia Research
The Bank of Georgia Research Department 
was launched in June 2012 with a view of 
supporting Investment Management and 
Corporate Banking businesses to attract 
more clients and investments into Georgia 
through Bank of Georgia. The Research 
department has initiated coverage of the 
under-researched sectors of the Georgian 
economy including Hydropower, Tourism 
and Agricultural sectors. It also provides 
corporate coverage of Georgian Railways 
and Georgian Oil and Gas Corporation, as 
well as macro coverage of the Georgian and 
Azeri economies.
Bank of Georgia Private Equity
Renewable Energy Fund
Georgia has one of the largest untapped 
hydro-potential in the world, which if 
harnessed could produce 32 TWh of 
hydropower annually, four times more than 
the current production. Electricity demand 
is growing rapidly locally as well as in the 
region, making hydro sector one of the most 
attractive sectors of the Georgian economy. 
Bank of Georgia teamed up with an 
experienced Austrian developer rpGlobal to 
launch a US$100 million renewable energy 
fund, which will develop small and medium 
size hydropower plant projects in Georgia. 
Caucasus Money Market Fund
The Caucasus region is under-researched 
and undiscovered by global asset managers, 
while it presents attractive risk-return ratio 
and diversification benefits. The spreads 
between local and hard currency are still 
high creating some arbitrage opportunities.
 
Bank of Georgia plans to launch a US$200 
million fund next year targeting high single 
digit returns for its investors. The fund plans 
to invest in bank deposits and sovereign 
treasury debt instruments in Georgia, 
Azerbaijan and Armenia.
Mezzanine Fund
Non-banking financing options are virtually 
non-existent in Georgia, although the 
demand for equity or quasi-equity financing 
is high and rapidly increasing. A relatively 
high cost of equity in Georgia, along with 
the risks associated with minority ownership 
creates an environment where providing 
well-structured capital for growth can be 
beneficial for both investors and companies.

IN 2013, INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE 
REVENUE INCREASED TO GEL 58.2 
MILLION FROM GEL 54.9 MILLION IN 
2012, REFLECTING THE GROWTH OF 
BOTH THE INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE 
BUSINESSES THROUGH ORGANIC 
GROWTH AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS. 
Gross premiums written increased by 14.6% 
year-on-year to GEL 146.6 million in 2013 
and net insurance revenue increased by 
33.0% year-on-year to GEL 48.0 million in 
2013. The 2013 healthcare operations 
reflected the roll-out of new clinics in 
mid-year, with normal start-up costs and 
initial lower utilisation not being offset by  
the full year revenue stream. See below the 
Insurance stand-alone income statement 
and Healthcare stand-alone pro-forma 
statement for more details. Operating 
expenses of the Insurance and Healthcare 
businesses decreased by 17.9% year-on-
year to GEL 28.9 million in 2013, reflecting 
increased cost efficiency, primarily due to 
the integrated hospital and health insurance 
model. The combined operating leverage 
for the Insurance and Healthcare segment 
amounted to 24.0 percentage points. As a 
result of the foregoing, total operating income 
before the cost of credit risk for the 
segment totalled GEL 29.3 million in 2013 
up 48.8% year-on-year. 
The Insurance and Healthcare segment 
(Aldagi) posted a profit before income  
tax expense of GEL 24.2 million in 2013 
compared to GEL 15.5 million in 2012. 
Aldagi’s group consolidated annual profit 
stood at GEL 25.1 million in 2013.
Aldagi, the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary, 
is the leading provider of life and non-life 
insurance as well as healthcare services in 
Georgia. Aldagi’s operations are made up  
of two distinct, but strategically aligned 
business platforms: Aldagi Insurance and 
Aldagi Healthcare. Aldagi Insurance covers 
more than 800,000 insured clients through 
its country-wide agency network and strong 
sales force. 
Aldagi Healthcare is the largest healthcare 
provider in Georgia. Its business comprises 
36 hospitals and outpatient clinics in 
Georgia, representing the largest healthcare 
provider in the country. With its largest 
chain of high quality, multi-profile hospitals 
in Georgia, the Aldagi Healthcare business 
holds 20.5% market share by bed capacity 
covering two-thirds of the population as of 
31 March 2014. 
Management believes that an integrated 
hospitals and health insurance model results 
in operating synergies which include such 
as: 1) cost advantage as a vertically 
integrated healthcare business allows a 
better control of cost of healthcare; 2) the 
organisation of hospitals in geographic 
clusters and referral hierarchy within such 
clusters provides patients a pathway from 
local doctors to multi-profile or specialised 
hospitals; and 3) revenue synergies with 
health insurance and healthcare facilities  
as insurance plays a referral role increasing 
patient volumes at affiliated hospital 
businesses.
2013 Highlights
 – Aldagi’s market share stood at 29.0%  
as of 30 September 2013 based on 
gross insurance revenue.
 – In Q1 2014, Aldagi’s Healthcare 
acquired a 100% equity interest in a 60 
bed, high-end, multi-specialty hospital 
in Tbilisi and a 100% equity interest in 
Avante Hospital Management Group,  
the second largest healthcare provider  
in Georgia following Aldagi Healthcare, 
with four hospitals located in Tbilisi  
and Batumi. 
 – Aldagi Healthcare increased the number 
of insurance clients to 827,000 as of  
31 December 2013 from 773,000 as  
of 31 December 2012. 
 – In 2013, Aldagi completed rebranding 
by changing its name from Aldagi BCI 
and the colour of its logo from orange  
to green. The decision to rebrand the 
company was based on extensive 
marketing research analysis on brand 
recognition and awareness of the 
company. The changes are in line  
with the Group’s intention to establish 
independent branding for Aldagi, to 
distinguish it from its parent company.
2014 Outlook
 – As anticipated, the Government has 
recently announced its intention to abolish 
the State Insurance Programme (SIP) 
under the management of insurance 
companies. The management of SIP will 
be fully transferred to the state during 
2014 and will be replaced with the newly 
introduced UHP , which envisions the 
provision of direct healthcare coverage  
to all Georgian citizens. As the largest 
healthcare services provider in the country, 
Aldagi Healthcare is well-positioned  
to benefit from increased healthcare 
spending by the Government over the 
next few years. 
 – Achieving one-third market share  
by continuing to grow organically and 
through acquisitions.
 – Setting quality standards for the 
healthcare services in Georgia, through 
institutionalising the industry.
 – BGH and Aldagi are currently preparing 
to list Aldagi’s Healthcare-related 
business on an international stock 
exchange.
Through its extensive network  
platform and integrated business 
model, Aldagi is strongly placed  
to tap the growth opportunity 
presented by the insurance and 
healthcare sectors of Georgia.

MILLION GAIN FROM THE REVALUATION 
OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES, MOSTLY 
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REVALUATION  
OF THREE PROPERTIES, TWO OF WHICH 
M2 STARTED TO DEVELOP IN Q4 2013.
The remainder came from the sale of 
apartments in the pilot project as well as 
rental revenue. Total revenue as a result 
totalled GEL 12.6 million in 2013, compared 
to GEL 4.6 million revenue during the same 
period last year. As a result, net profit 
totalled GEL 7.8 million in 2013 compared  
to a GEL 2.0 million net profit in 2012. 
The Affordable Housing business consists 
of the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary  
m2 Real Estate, which develops and sells 
apartments from the investment properties 
repossessed by the Bank from defaulted 
borrowers and manages those properties. 
With the aim to improve liquidity of these 
repossessed real estate assets and 
stimulate the Group’s mortgage lending 
business capitalising on the market 
opportunity in the Affordable housing 
segment in Georgia, the Group develops, 
sells or leases such real estate assets 
through m2 Real Estate. m2 Real Estate 
successfully completed its first housing 
project in 2012 and is expected to complete 
the second project in the first half of 2014.

The Risk Management Policy adopted  
by BGH sets out the manner in which the 
Group identifies, assesses, manages and 
monitors the risk programme for BGH,  
the Bank and its subsidiaries. The main 
objectives of the Risk Management  
Policy are to:
 – Formulate the Group’s risk appetite;
 – Identify and define the nature and  
extent of the Group’s significant risks;
 – Set out the Group’s risk management 
and risk reporting procedures;
 – Clearly define the Group’s risk 
management bodies and the roles  
and responsibilities of each of the  
BGH Board, Supervisory Board of the 
Bank, Bank committees as well as the 
business managers that implement  
the policy and procedures; and
 – Establish the Group’s risk management 
and risk reporting procedures in order 
to ensure that risks are properly 
identified and monitored and mitigated 
where possible as well as properly 
reported, both internally and externally.
The Role of the Bank in the Overall  
Risk Management Structure
Management of risk is fundamental to the 
banking business and is an essential element 
of the Group’s operations. The main risks 
inherent in the Bank’s operations are credit 
risk, liquidity risk, market risk (including 
currency and foreign exchange rate risks), 
operational risk and legal risk. The following 
is a description of the Bank’s risk management 
policies and procedures in respect of those 
risks. Business risks such as changes in the 
environment, technology and industry are 
monitored through the Group’s strategic 
planning process.
The main tools of risk management of the 
Bank are the establishment of specific 
procedures with respect to operations 
involving certain types of risks as well as  
the placement of various authority limits on 
certain operations. The Bank seeks to manage 
its overall risk exposure by continuously 
improving its risk management policies and 
systems. The Bank’s risk management 
procedures are designed to identify and 
analyse relevant risks to its business, prescribe 
appropriate limits to various risk areas and 
to monitor the level and incidence of such 
risks on an ongoing basis. The Bank regularly 
reviews its risk analysis processes in order 
to institute improvements which are required 
in light of the development and growth of  
its business and the varying nature of the  
risks which the Bank faces in its day-to- 
day business. 
The Bank’s risk management system is  
based on the principle of continually 
assessing risk throughout the life of any 
operation and includes such stages as:
 – risk identification;
 – quality and quantity assessment  
of a particular risk;
 – determination of an acceptable risk level;
 – placement of limits and creation of 
reserves;
 – use of collateral;
 – ongoing monitoring and control allowing 
efficient adjustments in case of any 
negative changes in the conditions on 
which the preliminary risk assessment 
was made; and
 – analysis of efficiency of the risk 
management system.
Risk Management Structure
The Bank conducts its risk management 
activities within the framework of its unified 
risk management system. 
Risk Management bodies
Responsibility for the conduct of the Bank’s 
risk management activities within the Group 
lies at all levels of the Group from the BGH 
Board of Directors to business managers 
and risk managers. The distribution of 
responsibilities ensures that risk/return 
decisions are taken at the appropriate level.
As mentioned above, ultimate responsibility 
for the Group’s risk management lies with 
the BGH Board. The BGH Board is 
responsible for setting the Group’s risk 
philosophy and appetite and approving the 
overall risk management strategy and policy 
of the Group. It is responsible for maintaining 
a sound system of internal control that 
supports the achievement of its goals and 
objectives and overseeing the establishment, 
implementation and review of the Group’s 
risk management systems. In order to 
implement the Group’s Risk Management 
Policy effectively, the BGH Board has 
delegated responsibility for risk management 
48
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 to the BGH Audit Committee, which supervises 
the Group’s financial reporting, the performance 
of both the internal audit function and the 
external auditor and the management of  
the Group’s systems of internal control  
and compliance activities. The principal risk 
management bodies of the Bank are 
Supervisory Board, Audit Committee,  
Risk Committee, Management Board, 
Internal Audit and Compliance departments, 
Treasury, the Credit Committees, the Asset 
and Liability Management Committee (the 
ALCO) and the Bank’s Legal Department. 
On 1 January 2014, BGH formed a Risk 
Committee at the BGH and Bank Board 
levels. The BGH Risk Committee, which  
is comprised of four Independent Non-
Executive Directors, is now responsible  
for advising the BGH Board on the  
Group’s overall risk appetite, tolerance  
and current and future strategy; assessing 
and approving the methodology used by 
BGH to assess risk; and overseeing the 
current risk exposures of the Group.
At least once a year, the BGH Board 
conducts a review of the effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems, including the Risk 
Management Policy. The review covers all 
material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls. 
The risk management bodies and reporting 
lines of the Bank are detailed directly below.
Risk Management bodies of Bank of Georgia*
Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board 
is responsible for the Bank’s overall risk 
management approach and for approving 
risk strategies and principles and is ultimately 
responsible for identifying and controlling 
risks. The principal risks the Bank faces are 
credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk (including 
currency and foreign exchange rate risks), 
operational risk and legal risk. The Supervisory 
Board approves the Bank’s Credit Policies, 
which outline credit risk control and monitoring 
procedures and the Bank’s credit risk 
management systems and approves certain 
decisions which fall outside the scope of the 
respective authorities of the Credit Committees 
(including approvals of single borrower lending 
exposure exceeding US$25.0 million). The 
Bank Management Board presents a 
comprehensive credit risk report and market 
risk report to the Bank Supervisory Board for 
their review on a quarterly basis.
Risk Committee. Since 1 January 2014,  
the Risk Bank Committee has the overall 
responsibility for advising the Supervisory 
Board on the Bank’s overall risk appetite, 
tolerance and strategy, taking into account 
the current and prospective macroeconomic 
and financial environment. The Risk 
Committee oversees the risk exposures  
of the Bank and advises the Supervisory 
Board on risk strategy. The Risk Committee 
reviews regularly and approves the 
parameters used by the Bank to assess risk 
and the adopted methodology and reviews 
the Bank’s capability to identify and manage 
new risk types. The Risk Committee also 
sets a standard for the accurate and timely 
monitoring of large exposures and certain 
risk types of critical importance, including, 
but not limited to credit risk, market risk  
and operational risk.
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
has overall responsibility for implementing 
principles, frameworks, policies and limits  
in accordance with the Bank’s risk 
management strategy related to the  
general control environment, manual  
and application controls, risks of intentional  
or unintentional misstatements, risk of  
fraud or misappropriation of assets, 
information security, anti-money laundering, 
information technology risks, etc. The Bank 
Audit Committee facilitates the activities  
of the internal audit and external auditors  
of the Bank. The Bank Internal Audit 
Department also reviews AML policies and 
procedures and presents audit reports on 
AML to the Bank Audit Committee on a 
quarterly basis. The Bank Audit Committee 
is elected and directly monitored by the 
Bank Supervisory Board.

RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTINUED
Management Board. The Management 
Board has overall responsibility for the 
Bank’s asset, liability and risk management 
activities, policies and procedures. In order 
to effectively implement the risk management 
system, the Management Board delegates 
individual risk management functions to each 
of the various decision-making and execution 
bodies within the Bank.
Internal Audit Department. The Internal 
Audit Department is responsible for the 
annual audit of the Bank’s risk management, 
internal control and corporate governance 
processes. It examines both the adequacy 
of and the Bank’s compliance with those 
procedures. The Bank Internal Audit 
Department discusses the results of all 
assessments with management, and 
reports its findings and recommendations  
to the Bank Audit Committee and the 
Supervisory Board.
The principal function of the Bank Internal 
Audit Department is to reduce the levels of 
operational and other risks, audit the Bank’s 
internal control systems, and detect any 
infringements or errors on the part of the 
Bank’s departments and divisions. The 
Bank Internal Audit Department provides 
reasonable assurance that the Bank’s 
policies conform to current legislation and 
regulation and professional norms and 
ethics and it is responsible for monitoring 
and assessing the adequacy of compliance 
with internal procedures at all levels of the 
Bank’s management. This Department 
regularly inspects the integrity, reliability and 
compliance with applicable law of operations 
conducted by the Bank’s risk management 
departments, and regularly reviews the 
reliability of the Bank’s information technology 
systems in accordance with a predetermined 
schedule. It also assesses the reliability and 
security of financial information and monitors 
the Bank’s internal controls and reporting 
procedures.
The Bank Internal Audit Department is 
independent of the Bank Management 
Board. The Head of the Bank Internal Audit 
Department is appointed by the Bank 
Supervisory Board and reports directly to  
the Bank Audit Committee. The Bank Internal 
Audit Department has 11 employees. The 
Bank’s Internal Audit Department audits all  
of the Bank’s subsidiaries, apart from BNB 
which has its own internal audit department 
that report to the Bank’s Internal Audit 
Department and BNB’s audit committee.
As part of its auditing procedures, the Bank 
Internal Audit Department is responsible for 
the following:
 – identifying and assessing potential  
risks regarding the Bank’s operations;
 – reviewing the adequacy of the existing 
controls established in order to ensure 
compliance with the Bank’s policies, 
plans, procedures and business 
objectives;
 – developing internal auditing standards 
and methodologies;
 – carrying out planned and random 
inspections of the Bank’s branches  
and subdivisions and auditing its 
subsidiaries;
 – analysing the quality of the Bank’s 
products;
 – participating in external audits and 
inspections by the NBG;
 – making recommendations to 
management on the basis of external 
and internal audits to improve internal 
controls;
 – monitoring the compliance of the  
Bank with the NBG regulations; and
 – monitoring the implementation of 
auditors’ recommendations.
The Bank’s internal audit department 
applies a risk-based audit approach to 
assess the significant risks that impact the 
Bank’s business, how (and how well) those 
risks are managed and controlled, what 
measures are used to monitor the process, 
the reliability of the Bank’s key performance 
indicators and management information and 
the efficiency of the process.
Treasury. Treasury is responsible for 
managing the Bank’s assets and liabilities 
and its overall financial structure and is also 
primarily responsible for managing funding 
and liquidity risks of the Bank.
Credit Committees. The Bank has three 
credit committees (together, the Credit 
Committees), one which supervises and 
manages the Bank’s credit risks in respect 
of retail and investment management loans 
and one which supervises and manages the 
Bank’s credit risks in respect of corporate 
loans. Each Credit Committee approves 
individual loan transactions and establishes 
credit risk categories and provisioning rates 
on such transactions. The Deputy Chief 
Executive Officer (Chief Risk Officer) and the 
Credit Risk Management Department 
review the credit quality of the loan portfolio, 
set provisioning rates and, in consultation 
with the Bank’s CEO and Deputy CEO 
(Finance), adopt decisions on the write-off, 
on a monthly basis, of corporate loans past 
due for more than 150 days. Each Credit 
Committee is comprised of tiers of 
subcommittees. The Credit Committee  
for retail loans comprises four tiers of 
subcommittee. (For risk management 
purposes, investment management loans  
are classified as retail loans.) The Credit 
Committee for corporate loans comprises 
three tiers of subcommittee. Each first tier 
subcommittee is chaired by the Risk Manager 
of the relevant Credit Risk Management 
Department and approves loans resulting  
in the Bank’s overall exposure of up to 
US$500,000 for corporate loans and up  
to US$150,000 for retail loans. Each second 
tier subcommittee is chaired by the Head  
of the Credit Risk Analysis Unit for corporate 
and by Deputy Head of Credit Risk 
Management Department for retail loans 
and approves loans resulting in the Bank’s 
overall exposure in the range of 
US$500,000 to US$1.5 million for corporate 
loans and US$150,000 to US$300,000 for 
retail loans. The third tier subcommittee for 
corporate loans is chaired by the CEO (and, 
in his absence, the Deputy CEO (Chief Risk 
Officer)) and approves loans resulting in the 
Bank’s overall exposure exceeding US$1.5 
million. The third tier subcommittee for retail 
loans is chaired by the Director of the Credit 
Risk Management Department and approves 
loans of up to US$2.0 million. The fourth tier 
subcommittee for retail loans is chaired by the 
CEO (and, in his absence, the Deputy CEO 
(Chief Risk Officer)) and approves loans 
resulting in the Bank’s single borrower lending 
exposure exceeding US$2.0 million. 
Participation of CEO is required for exposures 
exceeding US$8.0 million. All exposures to 
single group borrowers over US$25.0 million 
require approval by the Supervisory Board. 
The third and fourth tier subcommittees of 
the Credit Committee for retail loans meet

The Credit Committee for Micro and SME 
loans comprises three tiers of subcommittees, 
and falls under the Credit Committee for 
retail loans. The first tier Micro and SME 
Credit Committee is chaired by the head  
of the group of the Micro and SME Lending 
Department and approves loans resulting in 
the Bank’s overall exposure to a borrower of up

Credit Committee approves loans resulting 
in the Bank’s overall exposure to a borrower in 
the range of US$100,000 to US$1,200,000. 
The committee is chaired by the Risk Manager, 
with mandatory participation from either the 
Head of the Credit Risk Analysis Unit or the 
Head of the Credit Risk Management 
Department (or his or her deputy) for 
exposures exceeding US$500,000. 
Recovery Committees. The Problem Loan 
Recovery Committee is chaired by one of the 
following: (1) the heads of the Problem Loan 
Management Department; (2) the heads of 
the Risk departments, of which there are 
two; (3) the Deputy CEO (Chief Risk Officer); 
or (4) the Chief Executive Officer, depending 
on the level of exposure. The Problem Loan 
Recovery Department manages the Bank’s 
exposures to problem loans and reports to 
the Deputy CEO (Chief Legal Officer). The 
Deputy CEO (Chief Risk Officer) also chairs 
the committee which oversees loans which 
are the subject of litigation.
The Corporate Recovery Committee is 
chaired by the Deputy CEO (Chief Risk 
Officer) and is responsible for monitoring all 
of the Bank’s exposures to loans that are 
being managed by the Corporate Recovery 
Department. The Corporate Recovery 
Department reports to the Deputy CEO 
(Corporate Banking).
Asset and Liability Management 
Committee (ALCO). The ALCO is the core 
risk management body that establishes 
policies and guidelines with respect to capital 
adequacy, market risks and respective limits, 
funding liquidity risk and respective limits, 
interest rate and prepayment risks and 
respective limits, money market general 
terms and credit exposure limits, designs 
and implements respective risk management 
and stress testing models in practice and 
regularly monitors compliance with the 
pre-set risk limits, approves treasury deals 
with non-standard terms. 
Specifically, ALCO:
 – sets money-market credit exposure/
lending limits; 
 – sets open currency position limits with 
respect to overnight and intraday 
positions; 
 – establishes stop-loss limits for foreign 
currency operations and securities;
 – monitors compliance with the 
established risk management models 
for foreign exchange risk, interest rate 
risk and funding liquidity risk;
 – sets ranges of interest rates for different 
maturities at which the Bank may place 
its liquid assets and attracts funding; 
and
 – reviews different stress tests and  
capital adequacy models prepared  
by the Finance Department. 
The ALCO is chaired by the CEO and at any 
time deemed necessary, with decisions 
made by a majority vote of its members. 
ALCO members include the CEO, Deputy 
CEO Finance, Deputy CEO, Chief Risk 
Officer, Deputy CEO Corporate Banking, 
Deputy CEO, Retail Banking, Deputy CEO, 
Investment Management, the Head of the 
Financial Department, the Head of the 
Treasury Department and the Head of the 
Funding Department. The ALCO reviews 
financial reports and indices including the 
Bank’s limits/ratios, balance sheet, statement 
of operations, maturity gap, interest rate gap, 
currency gap, foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and funding liquidity risk reports, 
total cash flow analyses, customer cash flow 
analysis, concentration risk analysis, for the 
past periods as well as future projections 
and forecasts, other financial analysis and 
further growth projections on a monthly basis.
Regulatory capital requirements in Georgia 
are set by NBG and are applied to the Bank, 
on a stand-alone basis. NBG requires the 
Bank to maintain a minimum Total Capital 
Adequacy ratio of 12% of risk-weighted 
assets and a minimum Tier I Capital 
Adequacy ratio of 8% of risk-weighted 
assets, both computed based on the Bank’s 
stand-alone special purpose financial 
statements prepared in accordance with 
NBG regulations and pronouncements. The 
Bank also follows Basel I capital adequacy 
regulations on its own, having established 
respective minimal internal ratios of 16% for 
Total Capital and 10% for Tier I Capital, as

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 51 opposed to 8% and 6% of original Basel I 
pronouncement, respectively. ALCO is the 
key governing body for the Capital adequacy 
management as well as for the respective 
risks identification and management.  
ALCO establishes limits and reviews actual 
performance over those limits for both  
NBG as well as Basel I capital adequacy 
regulations. The Finance Department is in 
charge of regular monthly monitoring and 
reporting over NBG and Basel I capital 
adequacy compliance with original 
pronouncements as well as with ALCO 
policies. Capital adequacy management is 
an integral part of the Bank’s actual monthly 
reporting as well as the Bank’s annual and 
semi-annual budget approval and budget 
review processes. The Finance Department 
prepares NBG and Basel I and Basel II – III 
capital adequacy actual reports as well  
as their forecasts and budgets, as well as 
different stress scenarios for both regulations, 
while ALCO and the Management Board 
regularly review them, identify risks,  
issue recommendations or propose 
amendment measures. 
Legal Department. The Legal Department’s 
principal purposes are to ensure that the 
Bank’s activities conform to applicable 
legislation and to minimise losses from the 
materialisation of legal risks. The Legal 
Department is responsible for the application 
and development of mechanisms for 
identifying legal risks in the Bank’s activities 
in a timely manner, the investigation of the 
Bank’s activities in order to identify any legal 
risks, the planning and implementation of  
all necessary actions for the elimination of 
identified legal risks, participation in legal 
proceedings on behalf of the Bank where 
necessary and the investigation of possibilities 
for increasing the effectiveness of the Bank’s 
legal documentation and its implementation 
in the Bank’s daily activities. The Legal 
Department is also responsible for providing 
legal support to structural units of the Bank.
Anti-Money Laundering Compliance. The 
Bank’s AML Compliance Department is 
responsible for the implementation of the 
Bank’s AML programme (including the 
development of AML policies and procedures, 
transaction monitoring and reporting and 
employee training) throughout the Bank and 
its subsidiaries. The AML programme is 
based on recommendations and requirements 
of international organisations including FATF 
and OFAC recommendations. The Bank’s 
Internal Audit Department makes annual 
assessments of the Bank’s AML systems 
and provides independent assurance of 
internal controls. 
The Bank has policies and procedures 
aimed at preventing money laundering  
and terrorist financing, including a general 
anti-money laundering policy and rules  
on counteracting money laundering and 
financing of individuals and legal entities 
engaged in terrorist activities, as well as 
procedures for reporting to the FMS, a  
legal entity of public law. The FMS was 
established in 2003 and serves as  
Georgia’s Financial Intelligence Unit. These 
procedures aim to, among other things, 
mitigate the risk of the Bank being used as 
a vehicle for money laundering or terrorist 
financing, protect the Bank from financing 
and reputation risks of being associated 
with money laundering or terrorist financing 
activities and ensure that banking services 
are provided only to bona fide customers. 
The Bank has implemented specific policies 
and procedures in order to satisfy the 
requirements of the EU’s Third Directive, 
which requires financial institutions to identify 
and verify the identity of its customers and 
their beneficial owners and monitor its 
customers’ transactions, while taking into 
account a risked-based approach. Adopting 
a risk-based approach implies the adoption 
of a risk management process for dealing 
with money laundering and terrorist financing. 
This process encompasses recognising the 
existence of risks, undertaking an assessment 
of those risks and developing strategies to 
manage and mitigate the identified risks. The 
Bank uses a risk assessment matrix based 
on customer, sector, country and product 
risk. The Bank has a general AML policy; 
“know your customer” procedures that require 
it to identify its customers, verify their identity 
and their ultimate beneficial owners as well 
as the economic rationale of their transactions; 
“know your correspondent bank” procedures 
that involve careful screening of prospective 
correspondent banks’ AML policies; and 
“know your employee” procedures to  
prevent its employees’ involvement in money 
laundering and financing terrorism. The 
Bank’s risk-based approach means that it 
applies enhanced due diligence procedures  
if it determines that there is a significant risk 
that particular customers are engaged in 
money laundering or financing terrorism. 
The Bank carries out transaction monitoring 
using profiling and rules-based methodologies. 
Customer profiling is used to identify unusual 
patterns of activity by comparing current 
patterns with previous transactions by the 
same customer or peer group. Under the 
rule-based methodology, certain types  
of transactions over GEL 30,000 or its 
equivalent in foreign currencies as well  
as transactions involving certain high-risk, 
non-cooperative or suspicious jurisdictions 
are subject to monitoring and reporting.
The Bank’s transaction monitoring system  
is supported by a software application that 
enables fully automated monitoring of all 
transactions against blacklists. These 
blacklists include all sanctions lists and lists 
of banned individuals and organisations 
maintained by OFAC, the European Union, 
the United Nations and Interpol, including 
OFAC’s specially designated nationals list, 
among others. The Bank also screens 
customers to determine whether they are 
politically exposed persons or other high-risk 
customers. It applies special KYC procedures 
prior to opening an account for a politically 
exposed person and requires approval from 
a deputy CEO.
The Bank is obliged to notify the FMS of all 
transactions that are subject to monitoring. 
These reports are currently filed in electronic 
form in the offline mode by the AML 
Compliance Department, the reporting 
process is fully automated, which is supported 
by the special supporting solution.
Implementation
The Bank’s risk management system is 
implemented by the Finance Department, 
Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics Department, Treasury, Credit Risk 
Management, Operational Risk Management 
and Control, Legal, AML Compliance and 
Security departments and other departments.

Management (Retail Banking Portfolio 
Analysis) department reports to the Deputy 
CEO (Retail Banking). The Legal department, 
AML Compliance department and Problem 
Loan Recovery Department report to the 
Deputy CEO (Legal).
The Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics Department, in coordination with 
the Treasury, implements the Bank’s market 
risk policies by ensuring compliance with 
established open currency position limits, 
counterparty limits, VAR limits on possible 
losses and the interest rate policy set by  
the ALCO.
The Treasury Department manages foreign 
currency exchange, money market, securities 
portfolio and derivatives operations and 
monitors compliance with the limits set by 
the ALCO for these operations. The Treasury 
Department is also responsible for management 
of short-term liquidity and treasury cash flow 
and monitors the volumes of cash in the 
Bank’s ATMs and at its service centres.
The Credit Risk Management Department 
manages credit risks with respect to particular 
borrowers and assesses overall loan portfolio 
risks. It is responsible for ensuring compliance 
with the Bank’s Credit Policies, management 
of the quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio and 
filing and loan administration.
The Operational Risk Management and 
Control Department is responsible for 
identification and assessment of operational 
risk categories within the Bank’s processes 
and operations. It is also responsible for 
detecting critical risk areas or groups of 
operations with an increased risk level and 
developing internal control procedures to 
address these risks, through (among other 
things) business-process optimisation 
schemes, including document circulation, 
information streams, distribution of functions, 
permissions and responsibility.
The Legal Department monitors all changes 
in relevant laws and regulations, and ensures 
that those changes are properly reflected in 
the Bank’s procedures, instructions, manuals, 
templates and other relevant documentation. 
It also disseminates information on legislative 
changes to all relevant departments within 
the Bank. The Legal Department also 
participates in drafting laws and regulatory 
documents upon request of legislators and 
regulators, certain associations and other 
professional bodies. 
The Tax Compliance Unit of the Finance 
Department focuses on the Bank’s 
relationship with the tax authorities and 
provides practical advice and monitors  
tax compliance across the Group.
Each of the foregoing departments is 
provided with policies and/or manuals that 
are approved by the Bank Management 
Board and/or the Bank Supervisory Board 
(as required). The manuals and policies 
include comprehensive guidance for each 
stage of a transaction, including, but not 
limited to, manuals outlining asset and liability 
management policies, foreign exchange 
operations procedures, fixed income 
investment guidelines, Retail Banking 
operations procedures, the deposit policy 
and the Credit Policies.
Risk measurement and reporting
The Bank measures risk using a method 
which reflects both the expected loss likely  
to arise in normal circumstances and 
unexpected losses, which are an estimate  
of the ultimate actual loss based on  
different forecasting models. These models 
use probabilities derived from historical 
experience, adjusted from time to time to 
reflect the economic environment. The Bank 
also runs worst case scenarios that could 
arise in the event that extreme events, 
however unlikely, do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily 
performed based on limits established by  
the Bank. These limits reflect the business 
strategy and market environment of the Bank 
as well as the level of risk that it is willing to 
accept, with additional emphasis on selected 
industries. The Bank also conducts ongoing 
monitoring and control allowing efficient 
adjustments in case of any unexpected 
changes in the conditions on which the 
preliminary risk assessment was made. In 
addition the Bank monitors and measures 
the overall risk bearing capacity in relation  
to the aggregate risk exposure across all  
risk types and activities. 
The Group maintains a management reporting 
system which requires the Credit Risk 
Management, Finance and Funding 
departments to prepare certain reports on  
a daily and monthly basis. On a daily basis, 
a statement of operations, balance sheet 
and treasury report (which includes the 
Bank’s open foreign exchange positions, 
cash flows, limits and balances on NOSTRO 
and LORO correspondent accounts) and 
confirmation that there has been compliance 
with mandatory financial ratios must be 
provided by each department. On a monthly 
basis, a report on the structural liquidity 
gap, a report on interest rate risk, monthly 
financial statements, and a Bank Supervisory 
Board quarterly report containing analysis 
of the Bank’s performance against its 
budget are provided.
Information compiled from all the businesses 
is examined and processed in order to 
analyse, control and identify early risks.  
This information is presented and explained 
to the Management Board, and the head of 
each business division. The report includes 
aggregate credit exposure, liquidity ratios 
and risk profile changes. Senior management 
assesses the appropriateness of the allowance 
for credit losses on a monthly basis. The 
Bank Management Board and Supervisory 
Board receive a comprehensive risk report 
once a quarter which is designed to provide 
all the necessary information to assess and 
draw conclusions on the Bank’s risk exposure.
Specifically tailored risk reports are prepared 
and distributed for all levels throughout the 
Bank in order to ensure that all business 
divisions have access to extensive, relevant 
and up-to-date information. A daily briefing  
is given to the Bank Management Board and 
all other relevant employees of the Bank on 
the utilisation of market limits, proprietary 
investments and liquidity, plus any other risk 
developments.
Risk mitigation and excessive risk 
concentration
As part of its overall risk management, the 
Bank uses derivatives and other instruments 
to manage exposures resulting from changes 
in interest rates, foreign currencies, credit 
risks, and exposures arising from forward 
transactions. While these derivatives are 
intended for hedging, they do not qualify for 
hedge accounting.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 53 The Bank actively uses collateral to reduce 
its credit risks.
 
Concentrations arise when a number  
of counterparties, or related shareholders, 
are engaged in similar business activities,  
or activities in the same geographic region, 
or have similar economic features that would 
cause their ability to meet contractual 
obligations to be similarly affected by changes 
in economic, political or other conditions. 
Concentrations also involve combined, 
aggregate exposures of large and significant 
credits compared to total outstanding 
balance of the respective financial instrument. 
Concentrations indicate the relative 
sensitivity of the Bank’s performance to 
developments affecting a particular industry 
or geographical location. In order to avoid 
excessive concentrations of risks, the Bank 
focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio. 
Identified concentrations of credit risks are 
controlled and managed accordingly. See 
“Credit Risk” below.
Credit Risk 
Definition: Credit risk is the risk that a 
borrower or counterparty will be unable  
to pay amounts in full or in part when due. 
Credit risk arises mainly in the context of  
the Bank’s lending activities. 
Mitigation: The general principles of the 
Bank’s credit policy are outlined in the Credit 
Policies. The Credit Policies also outline 
credit risk control and monitoring procedures 
and the Bank’s credit risk management 
systems. The Credit Policies are reviewed 
annually or more frequently if necessary. 
As a result of these reviews, new procedures 
addressing the standards and methodology 
for loan loss provisioning pursuant to IFRS 
requirements were implemented, new loan 
restructuring tools were introduced and the 
loan terms were tightened. The Bank also 
uses the NBG’s provisioning methodology 
in order to comply with NBG requirements.
The Bank manages its credit risk by placing 
limits on the amount of risk accepted with 
respect to individual corporate borrowers  
or groups of related borrowers, liability of 
insurance companies, types of banking 
operations and by complying with the 
exposure limits established by the NBG. The 
Bank monitors the market value of collateral, 
requests additional collateral in accordance 
with the underlying agreement, and monitors 
the market value of collateral obtained during 
its review of the adequacy of the allowance 
for the loan impairment. The Bank also 
mitigates its credit risk by obtaining collateral 
and using other security arrangements. The 
exposure to financial institutions is managed 
by limits covering on and off-balance sheet 
exposures and by settlement limits with 
respect to trading transactions such as 
foreign exchange contracts, etc.
The Credit Committees approve individual 
transactions and establish their credit risk 
categories and provisioning rates. The 
Deputy CEO (Chief Risk Officer) and Credit 
Risk Management Department reviews  
the credit quality of the portfolio and sets 
provisioning rates, in consultation with the 
Bank’s CEO and Deputy CEO (Finance),  
on a monthly basis.
The Bank’s credit quality review process 
provides early identification of possible 
changes in the creditworthiness of 
counterparties, including regulator collateral 
revisions. Counterparty limits are established 
by the use of a credit risk classification 
system, which assigns each counterparty  
a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to 
regular revision. The credit quality review 
process allows the Bank to assess the 
potential loss as a result of the risks to which 
it is exposed and take corrective action. 
The Bank makes available to its customers 
guarantees/letters of credit which may 
require that the Bank make payments on 
their behalf. Such payments are collected 
from customers based on the terms of the 
guarantee/letter of credit. They expose the 
Bank to similar risks to loans and these are 
mitigated by the same control processes 
and policies.
Loan Approval Procedures
The procedures for approving loans, 
monitoring loan quality and for extending, 
refinancing and/or restructuring existing 
loans are set out in the Bank’s Credit Policies 
that are approved by the Supervisory Board 
of the Bank and/or the Management Board 
of the Bank. The Credit Committees approve 
individual transactions and establish credit 
risk categories and provisioning rates. The 
Bank evaluates Corporate Banking Clients 
on the basis of their credit history, business 
operations, market position, management, 
level of shareholder support, financial 
condition, proposed business and financing 
plan and on the quality of the collateral 
offered. The appropriate level of the relevant 
Credit Committee is responsible for making 
decision for loan approval based on credit 
memorandum, and where appropriate, credit 
risk managers’ report. The loan approval 
procedures for Retail Banking loans depend 
on the type of retail lending product. 
Applications for consumer loans, including 
credit cards, and auto loans are treated 
under the “scoring” approval procedure. 
While certain loans of up to GEL 6,000 are 
approved by the scoring system, the 
appropriate Credit Committee will determine 
the amount, terms and conditions of other 
loans. Applications for mortgage loans by 
Retail Banking clients are completed by the 
mortgage loan officer and submitted to the 
Credit Risk Manager, who evaluates the 
credit risks and determines the amount, 
terms and conditions of the loan, which  
must be approved at the appropriate  
Credit Committee level. In the case of 
microfinancing loans, officers evaluate loan 
applications, prepare a project analysis and 
submit proposals to the appropriate Credit 
Committee which makes the final decision. 
Credit Committee members have equal 
voting authority and decisions are approved 
by a simple majority of votes. 
The Bank has conservative credit 
approval processes and underwriting 
criteria, all of which are intended to 
maintain the quality of its assets as  
its loan portfolio grows.
Since 2004, the Bank, jointly with certain 
other Georgian banks and with the Credit 
information Group, a provider of Credit 
information solutions, established JSC  
Credit Information Georgia (CIG), that serves 
a centralised credit bureau in Georgia. 
Since 2009, all the participating banks 
share and contribute positive and negative 
customer credit information with CIG.
Collateral
The Bank typically requires credit support 
or collateral as security for the loans and 
credit facilities that it grants. The main forms 
of credit support are guarantees and rights 
to claim amounts on the borrower’s current 
54
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013
STRATEGIC REPORT
PERFORMANCE:  
RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTINUED account with the Bank or other assets.  
The main forms of collateral for corporate 
lending are charges over real estate 
properties, equipment, inventory and trade 
receivables and the main form of collateral for 
retail lending is a mortgage over residential 
property. In the case of corporate loans, the 
Bank usually requires a personal guarantee 
(surety) from the borrower’s shareholders. 
Under the Bank’s internal guidelines, collateral 
should be provided (where it is required) to 
cover outstanding liabilities during the entire 
duration of a transaction. As of 31 December 
2013, 88.5% of the Group’s loans to clients 
were collateralised. An evaluation report of the 
proposed collateral is prepared by the Asset 
Appraisal and Disposal department and 
submitted to the appropriate Credit 
Committee, together with the loan application 
and credit risk manager’s report. When 
evaluating collateral, the Bank discounts  
the market value of the assets to reflect the 
liquidation value of the collateral.
Measurement
The Bank’s compliance with credit risk 
exposure limits is monitored by the Credit Risk 
Management department on a continuous 
basis. Exposure and limits are subject to 
annual or more frequent review. The Bank 
establishes provisions for impairment losses  
of financial assets when there is objective 
evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. The Bank 
creates provisions by reference to the 
particular borrower’s financial condition  
and the number of days the relevant loan  
is overdue. If in a subsequent period the 
amount of the impairment loss decreases  
and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment 
was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed by an adjusted 
provision account. The determination of 
provisions for impairment losses is based 
on an analysis of the assets at risk and  
reflects the amount which, in the judgement 
of the Bank’s management, is adequate to 
provide for losses incurred. Provisions are 
made as a result of an individual appraisal 
of financial assets.
Provisions are made against gross loan 
amounts and accrued interest. Under the 
Bank’s internal loan loss allowance 
methodology, which is based upon IFRS 
requirements, the Bank categorises its loan 
portfolio into significant and non-significant 
loans. Significant loans are defined as loans 
in the amount of GEL 600,000 or more and 
non-significant loans are defined as loans 
less than GEL 600,000. The Credit Risk 
Management department makes an 
individual assessment of significant loans 
and loans with category A rating are given  
a collective assessment rate. All significant 
loans other than category A are provisioned 
individually depending on the category they 
fall in. Categories are determined according 
to borrower’s financial performance 
business performance, leverage, credit 
history, quality of management and 
shareholders’ support. In addition, the loan 
to collateral ratio and quality of collateral 
may affect the provisioning rates of 
individually assessed loans. All non-
significant loans are divided into different 
groups (for example mortgage, consumer, 
microfinancing loans).
All loans in range of GEL 100,000–600,000 
with overdue days more than 10 days are 
provisioned individually and non-significant 
loans that are overdue more than 30 days 
are provisioned individually based on overdue 
days. All non-impaired non-significant loans, 
as well as non-impaired prime rated 
significant loans, are assessed collectively 
within the sub-loan portfolio categories 
based upon historical loss rates. Non-
significant loans which are overdue for more 
than 150 days are written off automatically, 
except for mortgage loans which, since 
June 2009, are written off once overdue for 
more than 365 days. Significant loans may 
be written-off following an assessment by 
the Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer and the 
Credit Risk Management department, in 
consultation with the Bank’s CEO and 
Deputy CEO, Finance.
As of January 2014, the Bank implemented 
a new provisioning methodology that is 
based on statistical assessment of Probability 
of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) 
for each of the loan type. The management 
believes that the new methodology is a 
refinement of the existing methodology and will 
allow better allocation of Cost of Risk between 
different products. The overall impact of the 
change in methodology on provisioning rate 
and on financial statements is not going to be 
material. The new methodology was developed 
in consultation with Deloitte. Deloitte was a 
provider of IT solution – fineVare.
Liquidity Risk
Definition: Liquidity risk is the risk that the 
Bank will be unable to meet its payment 
obligations when they fall due under normal 
and stress circumstances. 
Monitoring: Liquidity risk is managed through 
the ALCO-approved liquidity framework. 
Treasury manages liquidity on a daily basis.  
In order to manage liquidity risk, it performs 
daily monitoring of future expected cash flows 
on customers’ and banking operations, which 
is a part of the assets/liabilities management 
process. The Finance Department prepares 
and submits monthly reports to the ALCO. 
The ALCO monitors the proportion of 
maturing funds available to meet deposit 
withdrawals and the amounts of inter-bank 
and other borrowing facilities that should be  
in place to cover withdrawals at unexpected 
levels of demand.
The liquidity risk management framework 
models the ability of the Bank to meet its 
payment obligations under both normal 
conditions and during a crisis situation. The 
Bank has developed a model based on the 
Basel III liquidity guidelines. This approach is 
designed to ensure that the funding framework 
is sufficiently flexible to ensure liquidity under a 
wide range of market conditions. The liquidity 
management framework is reviewed from time 
to time to ensure it is appropriate to the Bank’s 
current and planned activities. Such review 
encompasses the funding scenarios modelled, 
the modelling approach, wholesale funding 
capacity, limit determination and minimum 
holdings of liquid assets. The liquidity 
framework is reviewed by the ALCO prior to 
approval by the Bank Management Board.
The Finance Department also undertakes an 
annual funding review that outlines the 
current funding strategy for the coming year. 
This review encompasses trends in global 
debt markets, funding alternatives, peer 
analysis, estimation of the Bank’s upcoming 
funding requirements, estimated market 
funding capacity and a funding risk analysis. 
The annual funding plan is reviewed by the 
Bank Management Board and approved by 
the Bank Supervisory Board as part of the 
annual budget. The Funding and Treasury 
departments also review, from time to time, 
different funding options and assess the 
refinancing risks of such options.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 55 Mitigation: The Bank’s capability to discharge 
its liabilities is dependent on its ability to 
realise an equivalent amount of assets within 
the same period of time. The Bank maintains 
a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse 
assets that it believes can be easily liquidated 
in the event of an unforeseen interruption of 
cash flow. It also has committed lines of credit 
that it can access to meet its liquidity needs. 
Such lines of credit are available through the 
NBG’s refinancing facility. In addition, the 
Bank maintains a cash deposit (obligatory 
reserve) with the NBG, the amount of which 
depends on the level of customer funds 
attracted. As of 31 December 2013, in line 
with the NBG’s requirements, 15% of 
customer deposits in foreign currencies were 
set aside as minimum reserves. In addition, 
the Bank maintains a minimum average 
balance of 10% of its customers’ deposits in 
Georgian Lari at its correspondent account  
at the NBG. For wholesale funding, the NBG 
requires the Bank to set aside 15% of its 
unsubordinated foreign currency wholesale 
funding for borrowings with a remaining 
maturity of less than one year, 5% for 
borrowings with a remaining maturity of one 
to two years and 10% of its unsubordinated 
Georgian Lari wholesale funding for 
borrowings with a remaining maturity of less 
than one year.
Funding: In the Georgian marketplace, the 
majority of working capital loans are 
short-term and granted with the expectation 
of renewal at maturity. As such, the ultimate 
maturity of assets may be different from the 
analysis presented elsewhere. In addition, 
the maturity gap analysis does not reflect the 
historical stability of current accounts. 
The Bank’s principal sources of liquidity are 
as follows:
 – deposits; 
 – borrowings from international credit 
institutions; 
 – inter-bank deposit agreement;
 – debt issuances;
 – proceeds from sale of securities;
 – principal repayments on loans;
 – interest income; and
 – fee and commission income.
As of 31 December 2013, the Group’s total 
consolidated amounts due to customers  
was GEL 3,117.7 million (US$1,795.6 million) 
(as compared to GEL 2,693.0 million and 
GEL 2,735.2 million as of 31 December 2012 
and 2011, respectively) and represented 
59.0% (as compared to 58.6% and 71.0% as 
of 31 December 2012 and 2011, respectively) 
of the Group’s total liabilities. Included in 
amounts due to customers are term deposits 
of individuals. In accordance with Georgian 
legislation, the Bank is obliged to repay such 
deposits upon demand of a depositor.  
In case of early withdrawal, the interest  
on deposit is foregone or reduced. As of  
31 December 2013, total amounts due to 
credit institutions were GEL 1,886.1 million 
(US$1,086.3 million) (as compared to GEL 
1,657.2 million and GEL 921.2 million as of  
31 December 2012 and 2011, respectively) 
and represented 35.7% (as compared to 
36.1% and 23.9% as of 31 December 2012 
and 2011, respectively) of the Group’s total 
liabilities. Amounts due to credit institutions 
are taken from a wide range of counterparties. 
The Bank Management Board believes that 
each of the Group’s and the Bank’s liquidity 
is sufficient to meet each of their present 
requirements. For information on the Group’s 
liquid assets, liabilities and maturity profile of 
the Group’s financial liabilities as well as 
further information on the liquidity risk  
of the Group see Note 27 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements of this 
Annual Report.
Market Risk
Definition: The Bank is exposed to market 
risk (including currency exchange rate risk 
and interest rate risk), which is the risk that 
the fair value or future cash flows of financial 
instruments will fluctuate due to changes in 
market variables. Market risk exposure arises 
from mismatches of maturity and currencies 
between the assets and liabilities, all of which 
are exposed to market fluctuations. 
Mitigation: The general principles of the 
Bank’s market risk management policy are 
set by the ALCO. The Bank aims to limit and 
reduce the amount of possible losses on 
open market positions which may be 
incurred by the Bank due to negative 
changes in currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. The Bank classifies exposures 
to market risk into either trading or non-
trading positions. Trading and non-trading 
positions are managed and monitored using 
different sensitivity analyses. In order to 
address these risks, the ALCO specifically 
establishes VAR limits on possible losses for 
each type of operation (currently the VAR 
limit is set for foreign currency exchange 
operations only) and the Quantitative Risk 
Management and Risk Analytics monitors 
compliance with such limits.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 Currency Exchange Rate Risk. Currency 
exchange rate risk is the risk that the value 
of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Bank is exposed to the effects of 
fluctuation in the prevailing foreign currency 
exchange rates on its financial position. The 
Bank’s currency risk is calculated as an 
aggregate of open positions and is 
controlled by setting a VAR calculation 
(established by the ALCO) with respect to 
the Bank’s currency basket. The Bank uses 
the historical simulation method based on 
400 business day statistical data. Its open 
currency positions are managed by the 
Treasury Department on a day-to-day basis 
and are monitored by the Quantitative Risk 
Management and Risk Analytics 
Department. The ALCO sets open currency 
position limits with respect to both overnight 
and intra-day positions and stop-loss limits. 
Currently, the Bank’s proprietary trading 
position is limited by the ALCO to a 
maximum of 15.0% of the Bank’s NBG total 
regulatory capital. The open currency 
position is also limited by ALCO to a VAR of 
7 basis points of its NBG regulatory capital 
for a one-day trading period with a 95.0% 
“tolerance threshold”. The ALCO limits are 
more conservative than NBG’s 
requirements, which allow banks to keep 
open positions of up to 20.0% of regulatory 
capital. The Bank additionally limits open 
foreign currency positions other than US 
Dollars and Lari to 1% of the regulatory 
capital. The Bank also applies sensitivity 
stress tests to its open currency positions to 
estimate potential negative impact on its net 
assets and earnings.
Interest Rate Risk. The Bank has exposure to 
interest rate risk as a result of lending at fixed 
interest rates in amounts and for periods 
which differ from those of term borrowings  
at fixed and floating interest rates. Interest 
margins on assets and liabilities having 
different maturities may increase or decrease 
as a result of changes in market interest rates.
Similarly to other Georgian banks, the 
majority of the Bank’s assets and deposits 
have fixed interest rates. In order to minimise 
interest rate risk, the Bank monitors its 
interest rate (re-pricing) gap and maintains  
an interest rate margin (net interest income 
before impairment of interest-earning assets 
divided by average interest-earning assets) 
sufficient to cover operational expenses and 
risk premium. Within limits approved by the 
Bank Supervisory Board, the ALCO approves 
ranges of interest rates for different maturities 
at which the Bank may place assets and 
attract liabilities. Compliance with the Bank’s 
interest rate policy is monitored by the 
Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics Department.
As of 31 December 2013, the Group’s 
floating rate borrowings accounted for  
8.1% of the Group’s total liabilities. 
The Bank is also subject to prepayment risk, 
which is the risk that the Bank will incur a 
financial loss because its customers and 
counterparties repay or request repayment 
earlier than expected, such as fixed rate 
mortgages when interest rates fall. The 
Group reviews the prior history of early 
repayments by calculating the weighted 
average effective rate of early repayments 
across each credit product, individually, 
applying these historical rates to the 
outstanding carrying amount of each loan 
product as of the reporting date and then 
multiplying the product by the weighted 
average effective annual interest rates for 
each product. This allows the Bank to 
calculate the expected amount of unforeseen 
losses in the case of early repayments.
For further information on the Group’s  
market risk see Note 27 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements of this 
Annual Report.
Operational Risk
Definition: Operational risk is the risk of loss 
arising from systems failure, human error, 
fraud or external events. When controls fail  
to perform, operational risks can cause 
damage to reputation, have legal or 
regulatory implications, or lead to financial 
loss. The Bank cannot expect to eliminate  
all operational risks, but through a control 
framework and by monitoring and 
responding to potential risks, the Bank  
aims to manage the risks. Controls include 
effective segregation of duties, access, 
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, 
staff education and training and assessment 
processes, including the use of internal audit.
Mitigation: The Bank manages its 
operational risks by establishing, monitoring 
and continuously improving its policies and 
procedures relating to the various aspects of 
the Bank’s cash, payments, accounting, 
trading and core processing operations and 
data back-up and disaster recovery 
arrangements.
The Bank has an integrated control 
framework encompassing operational risk 
management and control, AML compliance, 
corporate and information security and 
physical security, each of which is managed 
by a separate department, and an internal 
audit function for the Bank.
The Operational Risk Management and 
Control Department is responsible for 
identification and assessment of operational 
risk categories within the Bank’s processes 
and operations, detecting critical risk areas 
or groups of operations with an increased 
risk level, developing response actions and 
the imposition of restrictions in critical risk 
zones to mitigate identified risk and 
developing business-process optimisation 
schemes, including document circulation, 
information streams, distribution of functions, 
permissions and responsibilities. The 
Operational Risk Management and Control 
Department is also responsible for 
developing and updating policies and 
procedures and ensuring that these policies 
and procedures meet legal and regulatory 
requirements and help to ensure that 
material operating risks are within acceptable 
levels. It also monitors and periodically 
reviews the Bank’s internal control systems 
to detect errors or infringements by the 
Bank’s departments and divisions. The Head 
of the Operational Risk Management 
Department, who reports to the Deputy CEO 
(Chief Risk Officer), is responsible for the 
oversight of the Bank’s operational risks.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 57 AS A LEADING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION 
IN GEORGIA, WE UNDERSTAND OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY TO 
SHAREHOLDERS BUT TO SOCIETY AT 
LARGE. THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY 
LIES AT THE HEART OF OUR BUSINESS 
AND REFLECTS OUR CONTRIBUTION TO 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – 
DEVELOPMENT THAT MEETS THE NEEDS 
OF THE PRESENT WITHOUT COMPROMISING 
THE ABILITY OF FUTURE GENERATIONS 
TO MEET THEIR OWN NEEDS.
We consider sustainability to be integral  
to the growth of our business. Our 
sustainability agenda allows us to be 
profitable as well as environmentally and 
socially responsible at the same time. By 
implementing a sustainability approach in 
our activities, we foster long-term relationships 
with our main stakeholders by providing 
high return on investment for shareholders, 
satisfying the financial needs of customers, 
developing employees and contributing to 
the economic and social welfare of local 
communities, whilst taking into account  
our environmental footprint. 
In order to effectively manage the Group’s 
direct and indirect impact on society and the 
environment, the Board of Directors adopted 
an Environmental and Social Policy in 2012. 
This policy defines the Group’s strategy to 
develop solid management controls which will 
conserve natural resources, minimise health 
and safety risks, and provide employees  
with equal development opportunities,  
fair compensation and benefits. We are 
pioneering sustainability practices in our 
operations and are constantly seeking new 
ways to improve our performance.
Social matters
The Group considers the interests of its 
main stakeholders, which include 
customers, shareholders, employees, 
lenders, and society, in the development  
of strategy and operations improvement 
processes. We strive to positively contribute 
to society through the entire scope of our 
business activities by developing socially 
oriented products and services, implementing 
responsible approaches to our business 
operations, and carrying out sponsorship 
and charity activities.
Socially Oriented Products  
and Services
Corporate Banking
In order to efficiently manage its indirect 
environmental and social impact, the Bank 
prioritised the integration of sustainable 
finance principles into its credit risk 
management procedures. In 2013, the  
Bank updated its Environmental and Social 
Risk Management Procedures in order to 
ensure the proper application of appropriate, 
risk-based and sector-specific environmental 
and social risk assessment practices to its 
commercial lending activities. These 
procedures are now being integrated into  
the Bank’s credit risk management process 
and soon will be routinely applied to all 
commercial transactions.
The Environmental and Social Policy and Risk 
Management Procedures, along with other 
tools necessary for their implementation, 
comprise the core components of the Bank’s 
Environmental and Social Risk Management 
System (ESMS). The Bank has appointed an 
Environmental and Social Coordinator, 
responsible for ensuring the proper operation 
and maintenance of the ESMS, and an 
Environmental and Social Risk Manager, who 
is responsible for the practical, day-to-day 
implementation of the Bank’s ESMS.
We implement the following procedures to 
ensure the operation and maintenance of 
the ESMS:
 – We refrain from financing environmentally 
or socially sensitive business activities 
mentioned in the exclusion lists of such 
Development Finance Institutions as 
EBRD, IFC, DEG, FMO, ADB and others.
 – We aim at assessing the relative level of 
environmental and social risk associated 
with clients’ businesses. We require 
certain customers to develop and 
implement specific environmental or 
social action plans to avoid or mitigate 
their environmental and social impact 
and adhere to specific monitoring and 
reporting requirements that we set in 
order to minimise environmental and 
social risk. These requirements are to 
be included as covenants in agreements 
between certain of our customers and 
the Bank.
 – We aim at regular monitoring of 
environmental and social risks 
associated with the Bank’s activities, 
and assessing clients’ compliance with 
the terms of respective agreements.
The Bank continues to support Georgia’s 
emerging economy by financing industries 
that are strategically important for the 
development of the nation.
Infrastructure development. In 2013, the 
Bank financed the East-West Highway 
rehabilitation project in the amount of 
US$15.7 million. East-West Highway is the 
main highway of the country, which links  
the regions between Eastern and Western 
Georgia and shortens the journey time 
needed to travel across the country. The 
Bank also provided US$2.5 million for the 
renovation of roads in the Kutaisi, Kobuleti 
and Batumi regions. 
The tourism sector has become a vital part 
of the Georgian economy as demonstrated 
by its significant growth since 2000. In 2013, 
we continued to finance the hospitality 
sector of Georgia by providing loans for 
hotel construction in Batumi (US$33.4 
million) and Tbilisi (US$23.0 million). 
Additionally, we continued to support 
construction works in the regions. In 2013, 
we granted extra guarantees, relating to the 
renovation of more than 30 public and civil 
buildings, in the total amount of US$8.9 
million and GEL 8.5 million.
Healthcare and education support. 
Continuous improvement in educational and 
medical services in Georgia remains a top

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 priority for the country’s strategic development. 
In 2013, the Bank financed the construction 
of a unique medical facility that will provide 
neurosurgery and oncology treatment in 
Tbilisi in the amount of US$9.5 million and a 
new multi-profile hospital in Gori which will 
provide high quality medical services to the 
local rural and urban population. 
One of Georgia’s leading private universities 
received US$3.5 million as a financing facility 
from the Bank in order to finance capital 
expenditures in 2013. In addition, the Bank 
participated in an EBRD programme which 
focuses on the renovation of schools, 
resulting in the improvement of schools’ 
energy efficiency.
Information and communications 
technology. In 2012, the Bank approved a 
credit facility in the amount of US$20 million 
in order to expand internet coverage in 
Georgia and, as a result, improve access to 
information and communications technology 
across the population. In 2013, US$7.3 
million of the approved credit facility was 
disbursed in relation to the construction of a 
fibre-optic backbone cable across Georgia.
Retail Banking
The Bank continues to innovate and come 
up with a wide range of socially oriented 
financial products and services that bring 
added value to individuals and small and 
medium-sized businesses (SMEs) and meet 
their respective needs.
Financial services remain inaccessible to  
a large number population in Georgia due  
to both economic and geographic reasons. 
Our Express Banking strategy, characterised 
by its simple and affordable products and 
services, seeks to address this issue. The 
principal achievements of this strategy are 
as follows: 
 – As at 31 December 2013, the Bank  
had a network of 985 Express Pay 
Terminals, 44 Express and 24 Metro 
branches which are located all over  
the country including remote  
mountain regions. 
 – Express financial products such as 
Express card, Express deposit and 
Express loan are uncomplicated 
products, which are easily accessible 
and affordable to a segment of the 
population that would not have access 
to banking products and services 
otherwise. Since the beginning of the 
Express Banking service in December 
2011, the Bank has attracted 526,376 
clients by 31 December 2013, of which 
c. 121,000 were attracted in 2013 alone.
As part of the Express Banking service, we 
prioritise improving financial literacy of our 
customers. In every Express branch, our 
current and potential customers can receive 
financial advice and educational support 
from our employees free of charge. In 2014, 
we plan to open a Centre of Financial Education 
within the Bank of Georgia University, where 
customers will have an opportunity to learn 
how to plan their budgets, set financial goals, 
assess financial risks, manage cash flow, 
and use financial instruments. 
The Bank also strives to improve the access 
to its branches for people with disabilities.  
In 2014, we plan to finance the adapting  
of 14 service centres to their needs in an 
amount of GEL 180,000. 
Youth support. We have developed a wide 
range of financial products to support young 
people in Georgia. For example, through the 
special conditions of the Child deposit, we 
provide parents with an opportunity to open 
deposit accounts for their children, starting 
with only GEL 10. These deposit accounts 
can be opened for two years minimum at any 
time from a child’s birth until the age of 18. 
The annual interest rate (9.25% for GEL and 
5.25% for foreign currency) is added to the 
initial deposit. In 2013, we opened 16,769 
child deposit accounts.
The Bank also offers special products that 
allow the youth to access secondary and 
higher education. Examples of such products 
are school and student loans with favourable 
terms that do not require any financial 
guarantees and collateral. The total amount of 
school and student loans granted in 2013 was 
GEL 56,747 and GEL 925,757 respectively.
Another example of a product supporting 
youth is a student card which provides 
special benefits for students of Georgian 
universities. The benefits include discounts 
for public transportation, 5% interest rate for 
savings on the card, free distance banking 
services and others. In 2013 the Bank 
issued 93,994 of these cards. In addition, 
every three months, the Bank awards 20 
holders of student cards with three-month 
scholarships to support them financially 
during their study. 
SME support. We continue to provide 
financing to SMEs, a backbone of the 
Georgian economy that ensures sustainable 
development of our country. Apart from  
our own microfinancing and SME loan 
programmes, we also participate in various 
programmes that support entrepreneurs. In 
2013, the Bank partnered with a non-profit 
Agricultural Projects Management Agency 
which supports agricultural SMEs together, 
the Bank co-financed agricultural loans at 
fixed annual interest rates which were 
significantly lower than previous loans  
SMEs received from other institutions.  
In 2013, the total amount of Bank loans  
to SMEs was GEL 644,485,852, of which 
GEL 123,329,405 was issued to female 
entrepreneurs. 
Combined with supporting SMEs financially, 
the Bank also plans to organise educational 
events and provide financial and business 
knowledge related advice to entrepreneurs in 
order to enhance their finance management 
and accounting skill as well as enhance their 
knowledge and skills in connection with legal 
documentation, business development, 
sales and marketing. 
Moreover, the Bank continues to participate 
in EBRD and IFC projects aimed at 
supporting local entrepreneurs. In 2013,  
we continued our partnership with EBRD  
by providing specialised energy-efficiency 
credits to the SME sector, thus allowing 
enterprises to upgrade their machinery.  
This way, the partnership promotes efforts 
of the SME sector to decrease their energy 
use and switch to energy efficient low 
polluting technologies. Total amount of 
loans granted for these purposes in 2013 
amounted to GEL 25,757,664. 
Mass retail. Energy efficiency consumer 
and mortgage loans were also provided to 
various groups of retail customers including 
households, drivers and others committed 
to energy efficiency purposes. For example, 
the favourable terms of the instant energy 
instalment included the opportunity for a 
borrower to receive a 10% subsidy of a  
loan principal amount.
Affordable Housing 
Currently, the Georgian real estate market is 
vulnerable to various economic and financial 
uncertainties. Numerous construction 
projects remain unfinished for long periods of 
time while there is a strong growing demand 
for housing from Georgian population. In 
response to this increasing demand, the 
Group’s real estate development business, 
m2 was established in order to offer 
affordable housing to the emerging middle 
class in Georgia, especially young families, 
while at the same time holding and managing 
properties of defaulted borrowers. Currently, 
m2 is completing its second successful 
project for the development and sale of 
affordable residential apartments. m2 uses an 
innovative approach to design and construction 
processes so that each square metre is 
distributed efficiently and fits customers’ 
needs and wishes. 
Insurance and Healthcare
A network of medical centres and hospitals, 
“My Family Clinic” (MFC) comprises the 
Group’s healthcare business. MFC provides 
coverage to approximately 45% of the 
Georgian population, predominantly in 
Western Georgia. Its clinics are located 
across the country, including remote 
mountain regions, and provide access  
to high quality medical services. MFC aims  
to ensure accessibility of medical services  
is ensured by scheduling regular visits by 
specialists to small towns and villages and  
by providing patients with transportation to 
larger clinics in urgent cases and in cases 
when more specialised treatment is required. 
MFC also provides free regular medical 
examinations in various locations across the 
country, including but not limited to Batumi, 
Khulo, Keda, Shuakhevi, Poti, Kvareli and 
Telavi. In addition, MFC specialists deliver 
free medical services, including examinations 
and treatments for socially and economically 
disadvantaged parts of the population. In 
2013, free medical treatment was given to 
the elderly at various nursing homes in the 
Adjara, Kakheti and Samegrelo regions,  
and children in orphanages and large but 
low-income families across the country. 
Estimated financial value of these free 
services in 2013 amounted to GEL 90,200.
In cooperation with other healthcare 
institutions, MFC also arranges free blood 
transportation and donations for its patients.

Geographically diversified network of clinics
In 2013, as a participant of the Government 
programmes and a signing party to the 
Cooperation Memorandums with the Ministry 
of Internally Displaced Persons Accommodation 
and Refugees and the Ministry of Corrections 
and Legal Assistance, MFC conducted free 
medical examinations of 1,118 Internally 
Displaced Persons (IDPs) as well as minors 
and women prisoners. In 2014, MFC plans  
to sign another memorandum pursuant to 
which it will provide free medication and 
extra training to personnel at orphanages 
and will facilitate transportation of minors  
to hospitals.
In addition, the Group’s insurance business 
participated in the Government insurance 
programme in 2013. Through this programme, 
Aldagi served more than 400,000 policyholders 
represented by people below the poverty 
level, the elderly, children below five years  
of age, students, teachers, and IDPs.
Sponsorship and charity
Within its sponsorship and charity activities, 
the Group focuses on promoting education, 
conserving nature and supporting children. 
The Group regularly receives requests from 
individuals and charity organisations that 
seek help and we apply our best effort to be 
responsive. Priority is given to people who 
are unable to receive any support from the 
State or any other sources. 
Currently we are developing the Group’s 
Sponsorship and Charity Policy in order to 
formulate and present our vision, goals and 
activities with respect to the defined priorities 
in this area. In order to structure and maximise 
the efficiency of our sponsorship and charity 
activities we are expanding the range of 
instruments we use to provide financial 
support. In 2014 and onwards we plan to 
channel our sponsorship and charity through 
the Bank of Georgia Future Foundation. 
Promoting education. The Bank contributes 
to the development of education via numerous 
initiatives. In 2013, the Bank became the 
first Georgian company to cooperate with 
the prestigious Chevening scholarship, in 
order to provide Georgian students with an 
opportunity to pursue higher education in 
the UK.
In 2014, the Bank plans to establish the 
Bank of Georgia University, the main goal of 
which will be to provide high quality financial 
and business education to various groups 
of the population. As part of the project, 
establishing Centre of Financial Education 
described above will improve the financial 
literacy of individual customers and SMEs, 
and the Bank is planning to grant GEL 
300,000 for these purposes. Another 
initiative of the University will be to establish 
a programme for an MBA in Finance. The 
cost of studies will be partially subsidised  
by the Bank, while successful graduates will 
receive full internship, with the opportunity 
for a subsequent permanent job or career 
within the Bank.
In total, the Bank plans to grant  
GEL 1 million for supporting educational 
programmes in 2014.
Conserving nature. Another priority of the 
Group’s charity activities is the preservation 
of wildlife diversity. Since 2010, the Bank 
has granted US$300,000 (US$75,000  
a year) to the Caucasus Nature Fund to  
cover the maintenance costs of Borjomi-
Kharagauli National Park (BKNP), one of the 
most treasured national parks in Georgia.  
In 2013, the Bank donated GEL 124,088  
for the development and implementation  
of a pilot biodiversity monitoring system in 
BKNP, which makes us the Fund’s largest 
corporate donor. In 2014 the Bank plans  
to grant an additional GEL 150,000 for 
environmental conservation programmes.

Supporting children. The Bank focuses  
its efforts on supporting children with 
disabilities. For many years the Bank has 
patronised non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) which seek to enhance the quality 
of life for children with special needs. For 
example, we supported First Step Georgia, 
an NGO dedicated to providing direct care, 
public advocacy, support services and 
training to children with disabilities and their 
families. In 2014, the Bank plans to announce 
a grant competition for NGOs which provide 
education and develop infrastructure for 
disabled children as well as integrate them 
into society. The total competition fund is 
estimated at GEL 1 million.
MFC runs a wide range of charitable activities 
on a permanent basis for children with 
leukaemia. In 2013, MFC held a charity 
Venetian carnival in Batumi in cooperation with 
the Italian Embassy and state organisations to 
support children with cancer. 
MFC also regularly donates personal 
computers to children from socially and 
economically disadvantaged large families. 
Additionally, on religious holidays we deliver 
presents to the newborns across the MFC’s 
patient network. 
Back in 2008, the Bank introduced the 
“Orange Santa” character as a part of the 
large-scale New Year campaign. The idea of 
the initiative called “Letter to Santa” was to 
give the Bank’s Facebook fans a chance to 
send their message to Santa. 
Employee Matters
A key factor to our success is a cohesive and 
professional team, capable of accomplishing 
the Group’s objectives. We are committed  
to attracting and identifying the best 
professionals, caring and planning for their 
needs, investing in their development and 
fostering their commitment.
The HR management system ensures that 
the Group attracts the best talent in order  
to guarantee the sustainable growth of our 
business. The system is managed in 
accordance with HR Policy and Procedures 
which include a wide range of supporting 
policies: 
 – employee planning and recruiting; 
 – staff administration; 
 – compensation and benefits;
 – code of conduct;
 – employee development and training;
 – human rights; 
 – grievance policy; and
 – whistleblowing policy.
HR Policy and Procedures determine key 
principles, areas, approaches and methods 
that are crucial for building HR management 
systems for all our businesses. The Bank’s 
HR management department works closely 
with HR managers and executives from our 
subsidiaries in order to ensure proper 
implementation of the main principles and 
provision of necessary support in all 
HR-related matters.
We recognise the importance of observing 
human rights and are committed to 
implementing socially responsible business 
practices. In 2013, we updated our Human 
Rights Policy which establishes priorities 
and control procedures in place to provide 
equal opportunities and prevent any sort of 
discrimination or harassment.
In order to improve the working environment 
and effectively address grievances or other 
employee related issues we conduct regular 
employee satisfaction surveys. Above all, 
employee feedback is used to improve our 
customer focus orientation and client 
servicing approach.
Talent attraction
Sustained development of the Group’s 
businesses requires the strengthening of 
the teams of our subsidiaries both by using 
the Group’s own significant internal 
resources through staff development and 
rotation, and by attracting external 
candidates. Our recruitment policy and 
relevant control procedures ensure an 
unbiased hiring process that provides equal 
opportunities for all candidates. According 
to the HR Policy, internal candidates have 
priority when filling vacant positions, 
especially in situations where there are 
vacancies in top and middle management. 
Thus, in 2013, 157 Group employees were 
promoted to managerial positions 
compared with 141 in 2012.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 61 In order to attract young talent, we actively 
partner with leading Georgian business 
schools and universities, participate in job 
fairs and run extensive internship 
programmes aimed at the professional 
development of young professionals and 
their further employment. In 2012, Bank of 
Georgia established a new format of its 
traditional internship programme. It attracts 
promising graduates and provides them 
with the opportunity to participate in a major 
professional training and leadership 
development programmes. Interns are 
directly coached by the Bank’s executives 
to help them on their path to gaining their 
first management positions in the near 
future. In 2013, the number of young 
professionals (under 30 years old) increased 
by 16% compared to 2012 and currently 
represents 32% of total headcount.
Training and development
To manage our employees in a way that 
best supports our business strategy, we 
seek to help our employees contribute to 
business performance through personal 
and professional development.
Following our aspiration to develop strong 
leaders, we have developed an extensive 
programme for leadership development.  
We provide a standard Induction Training 
course for employees appointed to 
managerial positions. This programme 
covers a wide range of topics including 
corporate values, strategy and objectives, 
organisational structure, HR management 
policies, history of the Group, specific 
courses for development of communication, 
presentation, management and leadership 
skills, among others. Selected mid-level  
and senior-level employees are provided 
the opportunity to receive external training 
in well-known training institutions outside 
of Georgia. 
The Group’s corporate learning system is 
comprised of a wide range of internal and 
external training sessions specifically 
designed to meet the needs of front and 
back office employees at the Group’s 
subsidiaries including banking, healthcare, 
insurance and real estate development. 
Every Group’s business has developed  
an extensive training programme for front 
office employees in order to provide them 
with relevant skills, such as effective 
communication and building strong and 
valued client relationships. For example, the 
Bank’s mentoring programme is part of a 
front office training process. Every new 
employee is provided with regular advice, 
guidance and practical instructions from an 
appointed mentor who later participates in 
the new employee’s performance appraisal. 
Through this programme, we aim to provide 
individual support to our employees in 
achieving their professional results and 
improving their personal effectiveness.
MFC provides additional training to its 
employees that work in the specialised field 
of healthcare. In 2013, MFC launched a 
Training-Of-Trainers programme for nurses 
in the Imereti region. In January 2014, 30 
professional nurses started conducting 
training for personnel of MFC’s hospital 
network in other regions. In March 2014 
MFC also established a unique training 
centre in the Kutaisi region that will enhance 
the professional knowledge and skills of 
local medical personnel. 
Occupational health and safety
Ensuring the safety of the workplace and 
providing healthy working conditions are 
among the Group’s fundamental HR 
management principles. The Group pays 
particular attention to preventive measures, 
such as conducting regular staff training and 
medical check-ups, certifying workplaces, 
and promoting healthy lifestyle.
The Group’s real estate development 
business is associated with high health and 
safety risks for contractors on sites. In order 
to minimise such risks, m2 established a 
Health and Safety Policy and management 
procedures ensuring implementation of the 
health and safety measures at all worksites. 
The policy contains a range of precautions 
that seek to prevent any accidents related to 
the m2’s contractors or community member 
injuries, as well as property damage and 
incidents caused by the equipment failure.
In order to enhance the awareness of 
employees and contractors regarding  
health and safety risks associated with the 
construction process, m2 conducts regular 
training and educational seminars. In 2013, 
the number of health and safety training 
hours amounted to approximately 500.  
In addition, m2 publishes brochures and 
booklets with warnings and special rules  
to be followed when working on sites. 
Respective control procedures include 
quarterly audits by external health and 
safety consultants and internal monthly 
inspections of m2 worksites. In addition, m2 
has a comprehensive reporting procedure 
for health and safety concerns. In 2012 and 
2013, no work-related fatalities occurred at 
the company’s construction sites whilst 
injury incidents dropped from three in 2012 
to zero in 2013. 
With regard to emergency preparedness 
and response, m2 established an Emergency 
Management Plan. It outlines possible 
scenarios during emergency situations  
and determines specific strategies for  
the Company’s employees, contractors  
and visitors on how to react when in a  
crisis situation. 
Environmental Matters
The Group recognises that its operations have 
both an indirect and direct impact on the 
environment and therefore seeks to establish 
management approaches which will help it 
become a more environmentally friendly 
institution. Being the largest financial 
institution in Georgia, the Bank produces 
significant indirect environmental impact 
through the projects which it finances. In 
order to properly manage this impact, the 
Bank has implemented an Environmental and 
Social Policy and Environmental and Social 
Policy and Risk Management Procedures,  
as described in the “Social matters” section.
As for direct environmental impact, we 
believe that the impact of the banking and 
insurance businesses is not significant. 
Nevertheless, we undertake a number of 
measures to reduce electricity, paper, water, 
and fuel consumption. For example, in 2013 
we upgraded our lighting system in the 
Bank’s headquarters by installing energy-
saving bulbs and implemented KNX (EIB) 
System management, which not only 
helped us minimise our environmental 
impact but also reduced our energy costs 
by GEL 4,000-GEL 5,000 per month.  
We plan to implement this system in all  
of the Bank’s branches during 2014. 
The Group is also in the process of 
automating its operational processes in 
order to reduce the volume of printed 
documents and consequently minimise the 
overall use of paper. The Bank continues to 
acquire new printers which offer double-
sided printing by default.
We are considering replacing part of our  
car fleet, which runs on petrol, with electric 
vehicles. In 2013, we acquired two Tesla cars, 
which are more environmentally friendly.
We aim to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions resulting from our operations. 
Refer to the Directors’ report for more 
detailed information on the issue.

The most significant direct impact on the 
environment within the Group is created by 
our real estate development business, m2. 
m2 addresses industry-specific environmental 
issues and undertakes appropriate measures 
to manage them. 
Focusing on enhancing resource efficiency of 
its apartment buildings, m2 started two new 
development projects with financial support 
from IFC. m2 not only follows high environmental 
standards that IFC imposes on its borrowers 
but has also become a participant of the 
IFC-Canada Climate Change Program
1
 and 
thus meets all mandatory requirements  
of the programme regarding green building 
construction. Aiming at increasing the efficient 
use of energy, water, and materials, m2 
installs energy efficient lighting systems and 
uses double glazed windows and other 
modern insulation materials, thus reducing  
the U-value of constructed buildings to 0.21 
W/m
2
K. It is expected that utility costs for 
these buildings will be reduced up to 23% 
compared to an average residential building  
in Georgia.
In order to minimise negative impact to  
the environment caused by construction 
process, m2 has adopted an Environmental 
and Social Management Plan which helps 
identify the environmental impacts of its 
activities and define measures to prevent 
them as outlined below.
m2 is currently working on establishing 
management reporting systems on 
environmental aspects. We expect that 
environmental data will be available for the 
2014 reporting year.
MFC’s direct environmental impact is mainly 
characterised by medical waste which 
needs special treatment and safe disposal. 
MFC implemented procedures that are in 
line with the Georgian legislation which 
defines risk categories of medical waste and 
establishes appropriate procedures for its 
treatment, storage and disposal. MFC strives 
to improve its efficient and thus outsources 
medical waste management to a company 
specialising in medical waste disposal. The 
total amount of generated medical waste in 
2013 amounted to 55 tonnes compared 
with 30 tonnes in 2012, an increase which 
correlated with the significant expansion of 
MFC’s hospital network. 
1.    The IFC-Canada Climate Change Program, 
established in 2011, is a partnership between  
the Government of Canada and IFC to promote 
private sector financing for clean energy projects, 
through the use of concessional funds to 
catalyse investments in renewable, low-carbon 
technologies that would not otherwise happen 
(www.ifc.org).

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 65 Dear Shareholder,
AS A FTSE 250 COMPANY WITH  
A PREMIUM LISTING ON THE LONDON 
STOCK EXCHANGE, IT IS OUR BOARD’S 
RESPONSIBILITY BOTH TO PRACTISE 
HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
PROMOTING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE 
ROBUST PROCESSES ARE IN PLACE. 
Such processes need to be underpinned by 
the right culture, values and behaviours 
permeating throughout the Group, based 
on openness, transparency and 
accountability, as well as constructive 
challenge and collaboration. Our Board and 
its Committees play a particularly important 
role by setting the tone at the top, and our 
CEO and other key executives are 
responsible for seeing that this culture 
trickles down.
We do not see governance as a box-ticking 
exercise or simply related to processes and 
controls, but rather as a guide to ensure we 
do the right things in the right way.
Here are a few of the core ideas that underpin 
our Board and governance philosophies:
 – Our Chairman and CEO positions  
are separate and will not be filled  
by a single person.
 – We want our senior executives focused 
on our business and not involved in 
potential conflicts, so they are not 
allowed to hold equity interests in any 
Georgian company without express 
Board approval.
 – We want a diverse Board both in  
terms of experience, geographic  
origin and gender.
A ROBUST 
GOVERNANCE 
STRUCTURE 
UNDERPINS THE 
DELIVERY OF  
OUR STRATEGIC 
OBJECTIVES
GOVERNANCE:  
CHAIRMAN AND DIRECTOR’S  
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
66
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013  – Board members should do site visits 
and attend an off-site meeting with 
Management at least once a year to 
better understand the business and 
influence strategy.
 – Board succession planning is actively 
managed and performance reviews  
are conducted regularly. 
During 2013, our governance framework 
has been amended to take into account the 
changes introduced by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) and the 
commencement of The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013 (the Regulations). As a result of the 
strength of our embedded corporate 
governance framework and our existing 
policies, procedures and processes, only 
minor enhancements were required.
The main change has been how we report 
these activities within the Annual Report  
and Accounts. The most significant reporting 
changes have been to our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, together with the 
introduction of the binding vote on our 
Remuneration Policy. This additional reporting 
also includes the statement made by the 
Directors on page 100 that they consider  
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken  
as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. The processes that underpin 
and support the Directors’ confidence in 
making this statement are long-established. 
Additional disclosures in respect of how our 
Audit Committee addresses the key issues it 
has considered during the year can be found 
on pages 76 to 79.
As mentioned earlier in this Annual Report 
we welcomed three Independent Non-
Executive Directors in December last year. 
Our new Directors bring a wealth of 
experience in retail and commercial 
banking, real estate, asset management 
and finance. We believe their expertise will 
further enhance the effectiveness of the 
Board and our Committees. Mr Bradley,  
Mr Georgadze and Mr Djeclic will be 
proposed to shareholders for election as 
Directors at our next Annual General Meeting 
on 28 May 2014. We are pleased to say that 
all of our six Independent Non-Executive 
Directors are independent. While we have 
maintained our interesting diversity of 
professional experience and geographic 
focus and origin, we lost our sole female 
Board member in 2013. We are committed 
to gender diversity and will be seeking to 
add one or more women to the Board in  
the near term.
Good corporate governance contributes  
to the long-term success of a company, 
creating trust and engagement between  
the company and its stakeholders. The 
Group is committed to its customers and 
clients and works hard to act ethically and 
responsibly in all of its business dealings. 
We also strive to create an inclusive 
environment for all employees which helps 
us attract, retain and develop the best talent, 
and encourages an environment where a 
diverse range of people are motivated to be 
at their best every day. We have a performance- 
based culture, which enables us to sustain 
strong business performance for the long term.
Engagement with our shareholders. We 
meet regularly with institutional investors 
and analysts throughout the year and the 
Board receives regular reports from the 
Investor Relations department on its 
activities, and in particular on the feedback 
being received from investors, analysts and 
advisers. In the first quarter of this year,  
our Remuneration Committee met with 
shareholders as well as shareholder 
advisory groups to discuss its remuneration 
structure and seek feedback. 
We firmly believe our Board is committed  
to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and will continue to develop  
its skills and capabilities, as well as promote 
the long-term success of the Group, over 
the course of 2014 and beyond.

CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE 
PROCESSES
ONE OF THE BOARD’S PRIMARY 
RESPONSIBILITIES IS TO ENSURE  
THAT THE COMPANY IS RUN IN THE  
BEST LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF  
OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND WIDER 
STAKEHOLDERS. WE BELIEVE THIS CAN 
ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF THE ACTIVITIES  
OF THE GROUP ARE SUPPORTED BY 
APPROPRIATE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
PROCESSES. OUR FRAMEWORK OF 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS 
REGULARLY REVIEWED IN LIGHT  
OF CHANGES IN BGH’S STRATEGY  
AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
DEVELOPMENTS.
Application of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
In September 2012, the Financial Reporting 
Council published the 2012 edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code), 
which contains broad principles and specific 
provisions to help boards operate in the best 
interests of their companies. The Financial 
Conduct Authority requires all listed 
companies to disclose how they have 
complied with the provisions of the Code. 
This Corporate Governance Statement, 
together with the Director’s Responsibility 
Statement, the Going Concern Statement 
and the Statement of Compliance, all of 
which are set out on pages 100 and 101, 
indicate how BGH has complied with the 
principles of good governance of the Code 
and its requirements for internal control.
The Board
What is the role of the Board?
Our principal duty, collectively, is to promote 
the long-term success of the Group by 
directing management in creating and 
delivering sustainable shareholder value. We 
do this by setting the strategy and overseeing 
its implementation by management. While our 
ultimate focus is long-term growth, the Group 
also needs to deliver on short-term objectives 
and we seek to ensure that management 
strikes the right balance between the two.
We are mindful of our wider obligations and 
consider the impact our decisions will have 
on the Group’s various stakeholders, such 
as our employees, our shareholders, our 
customers and clients, the environment and 
our community as a whole. In setting and 
monitoring the execution of our strategy, we 
aim to ensure that we maintain an effective 
system of internal control, and that 
management maintains an effective risk 
management and oversight process across 
the Group, so that growth is delivered in a 
controlled and sustainable way.
In order to ensure that we meet our 
responsibilities, specific key decisions have 
been reserved for approval by the Board. 
These include decisions on the Group’s 
strategy, approval of risk appetite and capital 
and liquidity matters, Board membership, 
financial results and governance issues.  
A full formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to the Board can be found on

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013
GOVERNANCE:  
DIRECTORS’  
GOVERNANCE REPORT To assist us in carrying out our functions and 
to ensure there is independent oversight of 
financial, audit and internal control issues, 
review of remuneration, share plans and 
other incentives as well as oversight and 
review of Board and executive succession 
planning, the Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to Board Committees. Each 
Board Committee has agreed Terms of 
Reference, which are approved by the 
Board. Copies of each Committee’s Terms  
of Reference can be found on our website,  
at http://www.bogh.co.uk/en/corporate-
governance. The Chairman of each Board 
Committee reports to the Board on the 
matters discussed at Board Committee 
meetings. You will find later in this section 
reports from the Chairman of each Board 
Committee on the Committee’s activities  
in 2013 and priorities for 2014.
In 2013, the Board made all decisions 
regarding risk and risk management at the 
Board level. The Board confirms that there is 
an ongoing process in place for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks, 
including those risks relating to social, 
environmental and ethical matters. The Board 
develops policies and procedures and the role 
of management is to implement the Board’s 
policies on risk and control and provide 
assurance on compliance with these policies. 
For a detailed discussion of the Group’s risk 
management procedures, see pages 48  
to 57 of this Annual Report. Effective from  
1 January 2014, the Board has delegated 
certain risk management responsibility to  
the newly formed Risk Committee, which 
comprises four Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. This Risk Committee will regularly 
report to the Board.
The overall responsibility for the systems  
of internal control and review of their 
effectiveness also rests with the Board.  
The Board has undertaken a full review  
of systems of internal control with the 
assistance of the Audit Committee. In order 
to assist the Board in discharging its overall 
responsibility, the Audit Committee keeps 
under review the effectiveness of the system 
of internal control and reports regularly to 
the Board. See page 78 of this Annual 
Report for a detailed description of the 
procedures implemented by the Audit 
Committee with respect to internal control.
How does the Board operate?
We normally meet five times a year, for a 
period of two to three days. We meet more 
frequently when the need arises and, in  
2013, we arranged and held seven additional 
meetings at short notice to discuss other 
matters relevant to the Board. In total, we  
met as a Board 12 times during the year.  
All Directors make every effort to attend each 
meeting, whether in person or by telephone, 
unless circumstances, such as illness or prior 
commitments, prevent them from doing so.  
In such instances, they are able to provide  
the Chairman ahead of the meeting with any 
views or comments they may have on the 
matters to be discussed. 
The Chairman also seeks input from the 
Non-Executive Directors ahead of each 
Board meeting in order to ensure that any 
particular matters raised by Non-Executive 
Directors are on the agenda to be 
discussed at the meeting. In addition,  
the Chairman meets with the CEO after 
each meeting to agree the actions to be 
followed up and to discuss how effective 
the meeting was.
Each Director committed an appropriate 
amount of time to their duties in 2013 and 
the Non-Executive Directors met the time 
commitment specified in their letters of 
appointment.
What makes our Board effective?
Our Board has primary responsibility for 
ensuring that, as a collective body, it has the 
appropriate skills, knowledge and experience to 
perform its role effectively. We take an integrated 
approach to effective corporate governance, 
which is underpinned by openness, 
transparency and accountability, as well as 
constructive challenge and collaboration.
Key to ensuring the Board’s effectiveness is 
enabling Directors’ full access to information and 
management across the Group. The Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors frequently conduct 
site visits and interact with staff at all levels. This 
gives them opportunities to see the culture and 
values of the organisation in action, and also 
provides context to the formal information that 
they receive for Board meetings.
The Board consistently probes, questions  
and explores the logic behind management 
actions, both in formal Board meetings and 
other informal interactions. The Chairman 
plays a particularly important role by ensuring 
that all Board members have the opportunity 
to contribute fully in all Board discussions. 
Given the collaborative nature of the Board, 
Board members feel that they can speak their 
minds freely and constructively challenge 
management as well as other members of  
the Board. This atmosphere enhances the 
Board’s overall effectiveness.
Board size, composition and qualification
We have determined that the optimum 
Board size for BGH is seven to 10 members. 
In 2013 and as of the date of this Annual 
Report, we had eight Board members: the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and six 
Non-Executive Directors. A list of individual 
Directors and their biographies and 
qualifications are set out on pages 72 and 
73. Details of Board Committee membership 
are set out on page 71 of this Annual Report.
The size and composition of a board,  
the qualifications of its members and the 
balance of their skills have a significant 
impact on how effective that board is. We 
regularly review these matters, both in terms 
of what we need now and what we might 
need to be successful in the future. Our  
aim is to ensure that we have the right mix 
for constructive group discussion and, 
ultimately, effective Board decisions.
We recognise the benefits of diversity in  
the Board, and the current members of the 
Board have the wide range of skills and 
experience required to govern the Group.  
In 2013, our Board included one woman, 
and its members collectively represent five 
different nationalities. Geographic and 
gender diversity together with key technical 
expertise in banking, risk, accountancy, 
finance, technology and international 
business will form core components of  
our Board succession planning as we look 
forward. Balancing all of these factors to 
maintain an effective Board is a delicate 
matter and we do not believe that imposing 
quotas is appropriate in this context.
Director independence
We consider Non-Executive Director 
independence on a bi-annual basis as well as 
part of each Director’s performance evaluation. 
In 2013, the Board was satisfied that the 
majority of its Non-Executive Directors were 
independent. As a result of the resignations 
and appointments in December 2013, with  
the exception of our Chairman, who met  
the independence criteria of the Code on 
appointment, all of our Non-Executive  
Directors are independent under the Code.
Evaluation of Board performance
The performance of the Board and its 
Committees is a fundamental component  
of the Company’s success. The Board 
regularly reviews its own performance and 
carried out a formal evaluation in December 
2013. The evaluation was conducted 
internally, coordinated and directed  
by the Chairman. A questionnaire was 
prepared by the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary, and formed the  
basis of in-depth interviews with each 
Director. The main areas considered  
by the evaluation were performance, 
composition, expertise and strategy.
The results of the assessment were 
considered by the Board, and confirmed  
the strength of the management of the 
Company, a sound governance framework 
and practices compliant with the Code.  
The Board is satisfied that each of the 
Non-Executive Directors contributes to its 
governance and operations. Annual reviews 
of the performance of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees have also 
been carried out as part of the Board 
evaluation. These reviews have confirmed 
that each Committee continues to operate 
effectively. As a result of the reviews, the 
Board and each of the Committees agreed 
action plans, which included a number of 
steps to build relationships and improve  
its procedures and effectiveness, given  
the recent Board changes.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 69 The Board will conduct an externally 
facilitated effectiveness evaluation in 2014.
Succession planning and  
Board appointments
We believe that effective succession 
planning mitigates the risks associated with 
the departure or absence of well-qualified 
and experienced individuals. We recognise 
this, and our aim is to ensure that the Board 
and management are always well resourced 
with the right people in terms of skills and 
experience, in order to effectively and 
successfully deliver our strategy. We also 
recognise that, even though new faces 
bring fresh ideas and perspective to how 
things are done, continued tenure brings a 
depth of Group-specific knowledge that is 
important to retain.
The Board Nomination Committee is 
responsible for both Executive and 
Non-Executive Director succession 
planning, and recommends new 
appointments to the Board. There is a 
formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors to  
the Board. More detail on the role of the 
Board Nomination Committee is on pages  
96 and 97 of this Annual Report.
In December 2013, our longest-standing 
Director, Allan Hirst, as well as our Directors 
appointed by significant shareholders, Ian 
Hirst and Hanna Loikkanen, stepped down 
from the Board. Upon recommendation  
by the Nomination Committee, the Board 
appointed three new Independent Non-
Executive Directors as discussed earlier  
in this section.
Non-Executive Directors’ terms of 
appointment
On appointment, our Non-Executive 
Directors are given a letter of appointment 
that sets out the terms and conditions of 
their directorship, including the fees payable 
and the expected time commitment. Each 
Non-Executive Director is expected to 
commit approximately 25 to 35 days per 
year to the role. An additional time 
commitment is required to fulfil their roles as 
Board Committee members and/or Board 
Committee Chairmen, as applicable. We are 
confident that all Non-Executive Directors 
dedicate the amount of time necessary to 
contribute to the effectiveness of the Board. 
The Letters of Appointment for our Non-
Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at our Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours.
Directors’ external activities  
and conflicts of interest
Our Directors have a statutory duty to avoid 
situations in which they have or may have 
interests that conflict with those of the 
Group, unless that conflict is first authorised 
by the Directors. This includes potential 
conflicts that may arise when a Director 
takes up a position with another company. 
We recognise the importance of the 
experience, value and knowledge that can 
be brought to the Board by Directors 
undertaking other roles or activities. Our 
Directors are obliged to obtain authorisation 
prior to doing so, and it is their responsibility 
to ensure that they will be able to meet the 
time commitment we expect of them and 
that the additional role will not impact on 
their effectiveness as a Director.
Our Articles of Association allow the Board 
to authorise potential conflicts, and we have 
a comprehensive procedure in place to  
deal with any actual or potential conflict of 
interest. The Board takes into consideration 
all the circumstances and deals with each 
appointment on its individual merit.
All potential conflicts approved by the Board 
are recorded in an Interests Register, which 
is reviewed bi-annually by the Board. 
Following a review of the Interests Register 
in 2013, the Board concluded that all the 
potential conflicts as registered have been 
considered thoroughly and appropriately. 
Board induction and  
professional development
We have a Director induction and ongoing 
development programme in place that  
is tailored to the needs of each Director.  
We are committed to the continuing 
development of Directors in order that they 
may build on their expertise and develop an 
ever-more-detailed understanding of the 
business and the markets in which Group 
companies operate.
Our newly appointed Directors undertook 
comprehensive induction training in February 
2014 and all other Directors received ongoing 
training throughout 2013, including a full day 
of corporate governance training in December 
2013. At each Director evaluation (in the case 
of continuing Directors) or induction (in the 
case of newly joined Directors), the Chairman 
and Director agree a tailored development 
programme and the Chairman reviews the 
performance of each Director annually as 
discussed in greater detail above. Delivery 
against the agreed development programme 
is a key component of this review. The 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are 
supported by the Company Secretary and 
through specialist advice on corporate 
governance matters.

Board Committees 
In 2013, the Board had three Committees: 
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination Committee. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for  
the oversight and review of financial,  
audit and internal disclosure issues. The 
Remuneration Committee is tasked with the 
oversight and review of remuneration, share 
plans and other incentives. The Nomination 
Committee is responsible for the oversight 
and review of Board and executive 
succession planning.
Our Board has made a conscious decision 
to delegate a broader range of issues to the 
Board Committees in order for the Board to 
focus more heavily on strategy, but has 
ensured effective connections between the 
Committees and the Board so as to ensure 
openness and transparency.

compliance and looking closely at risks 
arising from our IT systems and controls.
The Audit Committee has delegated 
authority from the Board set out in its  
written terms of reference, available  
on the Company’s website at  
http://www.bogh.co.uk/en/corporate-
governance. These terms of reference

Who is on the Audit Committee?
Membership of the Audit Committee,  
which is comprised of three independent 
Non-Executive Directors, and attendance  
at meetings held in 2013 is shown in  
the table below. 
As mentioned above, in late 2013, Allan Hirst, 
the Chairman of our Audit Committee since 
our listing on the premium segment of the 
London Stock Exchange, retired from the 
Board and Audit Committee of the Company. 
Having served as a member of the Committee 
since listing, David Morrison assumed the 
position of Chairman and Kim Bradley was 
appointed to the Audit Committee in 
December 2013. 
With respect to the Committee’s qualifications 
and background, Mr Morrison is a trained 
securities lawyer who specialised in financial 
disclosure for over 25 years; Kaha 
Kiknavelidze is a trained financial analyst 
skilled in financial statement analysis and 
continues to manage his own investment 
fund; Mr Bradley served as a managing 
director at Goldman Sachs, where, 
immediately prior to joining the Company’s 
Board and Audit Committee, he sat on 
various audit committees within the 
organisation and assessed internal audit 
functions and internal controls. Our Committee 
believes that each member has recent and 
relevant financial experience in satisfaction  
of the requirements of the Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The biographies of the members of the Audit 
Committee are set out on pages 72 and 73 
of this Annual Report.
The Audit Committee meetings are regularly 
attended by the Group CFO, Bank Chief 
Financial Officer and heads of the Bank 
internal audit and Corporate and Information 
Security, Compliance and Physical Security 
departments, and occasionally by the CEO. 
The external auditor is also invited to attend 
the Audit Committee meetings. The Audit 
Committee holds regular separate private 
sessions with the heads of the Bank internal 
audit and Corporate and Information Security, 
Compliance and Physical Security departments 
and the external auditor. These sessions, 
which are not attended by management, 
allow the Audit Committee to discuss any 
issues of concern in more detail and directly 
with the audit teams. From time to time, 
other members of management are invited  
to attend meetings in order to provide a 
deeper level of insight into key issues  
and developments.
Meetings of the Audit Committee take  
place prior to the Board meeting in order  
for the Audit Committee to report the  
activity of the Audit Committee and  
matters of particular relevance to the  
Board as a separate agenda item.
How did the Audit Committee Discharge 
its Responsibilities in 2013?
Financial reporting and auditing issues 
The primary role of the Audit Committee  
in relation to financial reporting is to monitor 
the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting, 
including all financial results announcements 
and financial statements, to satisfy itself that 
any significant financial judgements made 
by management are sound, to assess and 
report to the Board on the appropriateness 
of the Group’s accounting policies and 
practices, and to address issues raised by 
EY in connection with the external audit.
With support and input from the external 
auditor, the Audit Committee considered 
the following primary areas of judgement:
Appropriateness of allowance for  
loan losses
The Audit Committee scrutinised the 
appropriateness of the allowance for loan 
losses. The main judgements arose around 
the timing of the recognition of any given 
impairment and the size of the loan loss.

challenged the underlying assumptions 
made by management with respect to 
individually and collectively impaired loans 
and the system of controls to prevent and 
detect errors in the estimation for loan losses. 
Valuation of investment properties  
and premises
Management reported to the Audit Committee 
on the methodology used in measuring the 
fair value of investment properties and 
premises and challenged the underlying 
assumptions used by management. The 
Audit Committee also discussed with 
management and the independent auditors 
the reports of independent appraisers 
engaged to value the property based on  
the values of similar locations and property 
type and the market conditions at the time 
the investment properties and premises  
were valued.
In relation to the financial reports overall:
 – The Audit Committee evaluated whether 
the going concern basis of accounting 
was appropriate by assessing the 
Working Capital Report prepared by 
management. This report covered the 
liquidity position and forecast capital 
ratios, balance sheet and leverage 
position. The report incorporated known 
or expected regulatory changes and the 
impact of possible stress scenarios. 
After examining this report, the Audit 
Committee concluded that the liquidity 
and capital position of the Group 
remained appropriate and that there 
were no material uncertainties.
 – Having been tasked by the Board to 
advise it, the Audit Committee examined 
the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 
to consider whether they are fair, 
balanced and understandable. The 
Audit Committee did this by satisfying 
itself that there was a robust process of 
review and challenge at different levels 
within the Group to ensure balance and 
consistency. In doing so, the Audit 
Committee directly reviewed with the 
CEO and Group CFO the overall 
messages and tone of the Annual 
Report. The Audit Committee also 
considered other information regarding 
the Group’s performance presented to 
the Board during the period. After 
consideration of all of this information, 
the Audit Committee advised the Board 
that it considers the 2013 Annual Report 
and Financial Statements to be fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Internal control
In accordance with the recommendations  
of the FRC’s guidance for Directors on 
Internal Control (formerly known as the 
Turnbull guidance), the Group’s systems of 
internal control are designed and operated 
to support the identification, evaluation and 
management of risks affecting the Group. 
They facilitate the effective and efficient 
operation of our business, provide assurance 
regarding the integrity of our internal reporting 
and are designed to comply with relevant 
laws and regulations, across all areas of 
operations. These systems are subject to 
continuous review as circumstances change 
and new risks emerge. See pages 48 and 
49 for a discussion of the Board’s overall 
responsibility for internal control and  
page 48 for a discussion of the Risk 
Management Policy.
At each physical Audit Committee meeting 
(on four occasions during 2013), the heads 
of our Corporate and Information Security, 
Compliance and Physical Security and 
internal audit departments made 
presentations on compliance and control-
related matters. The presentations discuss 
regulatory compliance, know your employee 
and customer programmes, information 
security, corporate security, physical 
security and operational risk management.
During 2013, key focus areas in relation  
to internal control were enhancing the 
technology used for fraud detection and 
monitoring and ensuring that the resource 
requirements of both the internal audit and 
compliance functions were met so as to 
enable each department to deliver on its 
objectives. An extensive staff development 
programme was also implemented, allowing 
employees to obtain specialised certification 
and enhanced training.
Oversight of Internal Audit and  
External Audit
Internal audit
In addition to receiving internal audit’s input 
on the control environment, we monitor the 
scope, extent and effectiveness of the internal 
audit function and seek to ensure it is 
adequately resourced and focused on the 
correct issues. We also review and approve 
the annual internal audit plan which includes 
a discussion of risk assessment. We review 
the plan on a regular basis, including any 
changes proposed to the scope of work,  
as well as discuss and approve changes  
to internal audit methodology.
At each physical Audit Committee meeting 
in 2013, we received reports from internal 
audit on audit activities, progress of the 
internal audit plan, the results of any 
unsatisfactory audits and the action plans  
to address these issues and resource 
requirements of the internal audit 
department. We also reviewed and 
monitored management’s responsiveness 
to internal audit’s findings.
We also reviewed internal audit’s self-
assessment of its performance and 
concluded that the internal audit function  
is effective and respected by management 
and conforms to the standards set by the 
Institute of Internal Auditors. 
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the performance, objectivity  
and effectiveness of the external auditor. 
At the start of the 2013 annual audit cycle, 
we received from EY a detailed Audit Plan, 
identifying their assessment of key risks and 
discussed with EY the judgements forming 
the basis of the Audit Plan. For the 2013 
financial year, the primary risks identified 
were in relation to the appropriateness of 
allowance for loan losses and valuation of 
investment properties and premises. These 
78
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013
GOVERNANCE:  
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED risks were tracked during the year and the 
Audit Committee reviewed the information 
provided by management and challenged 
the work done by EY to test management’s 
assumptions and estimates around these 
areas, in particular the findings focused on 
management judgements. 
The Audit Committee assessed the 
effectiveness of the audit process in 
addressing these matters through the reporting 
we receive from management throughout the 
year and from EY at both the half-year and 
year-end. In addition, we sought feedback 
from management on the performance of EY 
throughout the audit process. For the 2013 
financial year, management was satisfied that 
there had been appropriate focus and 
challenge on the primary areas of audit risk 
and determined that the quality of the audit 
process was good. Management also reported 
that the coordination between the EY London 
and Tbilisi teams was effective. The Audit 
Committee also considered the Audit Quality 
Inspection Report and the FRC evaluation of 
EY for 2012/2013, issued in May 2013. Over 
the course of the year, the Audit Committee 
has also scrutinised the quality and experience 
of the audit partners and senior team members 
engaged in the audit. On the basis of the 
foregoing the Audit Committee formed its 
own judgement (which was consistent with 
management’s view), that the general quality 
of the audit work conducted by EY is of a 
high standard.
The Audit Committee also held private 
meetings with EY in order to provide 
additional opportunity for dialogue and 
feedback from the auditor without 
management being present. Matters 
typically included the auditor’s assessment 
of business and financial risk and the auditor’s 
interaction with management, independence 
of the audit and the exercise of professional 
scepticism. 
Appointment and independence
Each year, the Audit Committee considers 
the reappointment of the external auditor, 
including the rotation of the audit partner 
and assesses the external auditor’s 
performance, objectivity and independence. 
The external auditor is required to rotate the 
audit partner responsible for the Group every 
five years. The current lead audit partner has 
been in place for two years. It is the Audit 
Committee’s responsibility to recommend  
to the Board the appointment or reappointment 
or removal of the external auditor.
EY was appointed as our Group statutory 
auditor by shareholders at our 2012 AGM, 
following a tender process and subsequent 
Audit Committee and Board recommendation. 
Shareholders reapproved EY’s appointment 
at the 2013 AGM. During the course of the 
year, we have discussed with EY the business 
and financial risks and have sought assurance 
that these risks have been properly addressed 
in the audit strategy and plan that has been 
reviewed by the Audit Committee. We have 
sought assurance and are comfortable that 
no undue pressure has been asserted on 
the level of audit fees so as to ensure that 
there is no risk to audit work being 
conducted effectively.
We conducted a review of the performance 
and effectiveness of EY, which included an 
assessment of its independence and 
objectivity. 
In order to further ensure independence of 
the external auditor, the Group has in place 
a policy to govern the non-audit services 
that may be provided by the external auditor, 
which sets out the circumstances in which 
the external auditor may be permitted to 
undertake non-audit services. Allowable 
services are preapproved up to £100,000. 
Any permissible non-audit service that 
exceeds this threshold requires approval 
from the Audit Committee and must be 
robustly justified and, if appropriate, 
tendered, before it is approved. 
The Audit Committee’s policy on tax 
advisory services is to not use the external 
auditor unless there is a very strong case  
for not seeking an alternative supplier.  
If non-audit services are undertaken by  
the auditor, the Audit Committee receives  
a quarterly report on such non-audit 
services so that it can monitor the types  
of services being provided and the fees 
incurred. On an annual basis, the Audit 
Committee reviews the Group policy on  
the provision of non-audit services in order 
to ensure that the objectivity and the 
independence of the external auditor is 
safeguarded and the terms of the policy  
are complied with fully by EY.
A breakdown of the fees paid to the auditor 
for audit-related services and non-audit 
work may be found in Note 24 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Further details of the non-audit services that 
are prohibited or allowed under our policy 
can be found on our website, at http://www.
bogh.co.uk/en/corporate-governance 
Following such review of the external auditor, 
the Audit Committee found that EY was 
considered to be objective and independent 
in its role as Group statutory auditor. The 
Audit Committee will recommend to the 
Board and to shareholders that EY should 
be reappointed as the Group’s auditor at 
the 2014 AGM.
Effectiveness
The performance of the Audit Committee  
is reviewed each year as part of the Board 
Effectiveness Review, both by the Audit 
Committee itself and by the Board as a 
whole. In carrying out this review, the  
Audit Committee considered best  
practice recommendations.
The 2013 review concluded that the Audit 
Committee continues to operate and 
perform effectively. 
Ongoing training and development
Over the course of the year, the Audit 
Committee received ongoing training from 
EY, the Company Secretary and other 
professional firms, including BGH’s external 
legal advisers. These sessions covered 
control effectiveness, financial reporting 
processes, corporate governance changes 
as well as best practice. The Audit Committee 
will continue its ongoing training to further 
enhance its effectiveness.

Annual Report 2013 79 DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION 
REPORT
Al Breach
Chairman of Remuneration Committee
BANK OF GEORGIA HOLDINGS PLC – 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
1. Chairman’s Statement
In 2013, the Remuneration Committee 
devoted substantial effort to a review of the 
Group’s remuneration policy for our Executive 
Management Team, which consists of our 
CEO Irakli Gilauri (who is our sole Executive 
Director) and senior officers of our key 
subsidiaries and divisions. In this report we 
refer to our Executive Management Team 
collectively as “executive management”  
and individually as an “executive”. 
Policy summary and background
Since we created our policy in 2010, it has 
been defined by two key principles:
 – When, over a sustained period, our 
shareholders do well, so should our 
executives. 
 – Banking is a services business built  
on human capital. The business will  
only reach its potential if we attract  
and retain the best talent available. 
With these as our guiding principles, the 
Group has implemented an innovative 
remuneration structure for its executive 
management that in turn is comprised  
of two key parts: 
 – Salary compensation based on the 
combination of a modest cash sum  
and deferred shares that vest over  
a five-year period. This latter feature, 
paying a majority of salary in deferred 
shares, is our main innovation. 
 – Discretionary compensation payable 
entirely in deferred shares that vest  
over a two-year period. Discretionary 
compensation is dependent on both 
Group performance and the executive 
achieving his key performance 
indicators (KPIs) in each financial year. 
The fact that we pay no cash bonuses  
is another distinguishing feature of  
our structure. 
Executives are employed under three-  
year employment contracts which fix the 
annual cash salary and the number of 
shares to be issued annually as deferred 
share salary over the three-year term. With 
discretionary compensation also in the form 
of deferred shares, the result is that, for our 
executive management, deferred share 
compensation is the dominant component 
of overall remuneration. We believe that this 
policy achieves a direct and natural 
alignment of shareholder and executive 
management interests. 
In addition, both deferred share salary and 
discretionary deferred share compensation 
may cease to vest in certain circumstances 
if the executive does not remain affiliated 
with the Group. That can happen, for 
example, if the executive is dismissed, 
resigns or does not accept a contract 
renewal. In these circumstances, however, 
the Board in its discretion may permit 
unvested discretionary deferred shares to 
vest when the executive departs on good 
terms with the Group. We believe that the 
effect of these contractual arrangements 
combined with our strong emphasis on 
deferred share compensation promotes 
loyalty and discourages executives from 
leaving in circumstances not blessed by  
us. As a result, the policy motivates our 
executives to perform to their best ability 
and to act in the long-term interest of –  
and remain with – the Group. 
I note that in contrast to other UK companies, 
the Group does not operate a long-term 
incentive plan (LTIP). We believe that, having 
built deferred share compensation into 
salary and discretionary remuneration, we 
have better achieved a similar aim. By 
focusing the executive on the Group’s 
sustainable, long-term performance, our 
policy guards against the executive taking 
risks that endanger our long-term stability. 
We believe that gearing executive 
remuneration to narrow three-year 
performance targets selected in advance 
would be less effective, especially in fast 
moving markets. Our structure instead 
naturally and directly aligns both salary and 
discretionary remuneration with long-term 
stability and share price growth.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013
GOVERNANCE:  
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
REPORT As mentioned above, our Remuneration Policy 
is not standard in the United Kingdom. We 
created it in a Georgian context in 2010, the 
period immediately after the financial crisis 
when many of the compensation practices 
and traditions in banking in the West were 
being heavily criticised. Among these practices 
were significant cash bonuses for executives, 
which unfortunately too often rewarded 
short-term results and promoted excessive 
risk-taking at stakeholder – and ultimately 
taxpayer – expense. In setting our policy  
in 2010, we sought to address the 
weaknesses in the prevailing practices  
and, in a non-UK context, we were able  
to start from scratch. We believe our  
system has worked well and has helped  
us avoid pitfalls that may remain even today 
in more common remuneration practices.
Shareholder reaction and  
recent adjustments
Over 90% of our shareholders voted in 
favour of our Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for 2012 at our AGM in 2013. While 
support was overwhelming, the few votes 
against gave us pause, and accordingly the 
Board immediately decided to review and 
evaluate our policy. Following recommendation 
by the Remuneration Committee, in June  
of 2013 the Board appointed H2Glenfern  
to review its remuneration structure for 
executive management and compare it to 
other FTSE 250 companies and the ABI 
Principles of Remuneration. After review  
of the H2Glenfern report, in the first quarter 
of 2014, we met with a number of the Group’s 
significant shareholders to discuss our 
remuneration structure. 
At these meetings, we explained the key 
components of our remuneration structure 
– deferred share compensation as part of 
salary and bonuses paid 100% in deferred 
shares. We also compared our policy to 
standard structures in the United Kingdom 
post-crisis, focusing on the key differences 
including the absence of cash bonuses and 
an LTIP in our structure. The consultations 
were positive and these shareholders were 
supportive of the manner in which we 
remunerate our executive management.
As a result of this process, the Remuneration 
Committee is reaffirming its commitment to 
the principal tenets of our policies, with the 
following three changes informed by best 
practices in the United Kingdom:
 – The maximum amount of total 
remuneration that can be awarded 
through discretionary deferred share 
compensation has been increased. 
Previously, we had limited this amount 
to less than 100% of an executive’s 
salary. With one important exception 
described below for our CEO, Irakli 
Gilauri, we have changed this limit. Our 
new policy is that excellent performance 
can be rewarded with incentive 
compensation of not more than 125%  
of total salary. This change means that, 
in conformity with best practices, an 
executive who receives the maximum 
discretionary award will receive the 
majority of total remuneration in 
discretionary compensation. Beyond 
the usual maximum, the Remuneration 
Committee has have further reserved 
the right to increase the maximum 
discretionary award to 150% of total 
salary for extraordinary performance 
that we believe has resulted in 
outstanding benefits for shareholders. 
 – A clawback mechanism will now apply 
to discretionary deferred share 
compensation in the event of a material 
misstatement in the financial results. 
 – A principle has been added that new 
shares issued in satisfaction of deferred 
share compensation will not exceed 
10% of BGH’s ordinary share capital 
over any 10-year period.
Mr Gilauri is currently beginning the second 
year of a three-year contract with the Bank 
that expires in 2016. Under that contract, it 
was agreed that Mr Gilauri would receive a 
number of deferred salary shares per year 
that is substantially higher than for the other 
executive management. Because of the 
higher number of salary deferred shares, the 
maximum amount of discretionary deferred 
share compensation in respect of Mr Gilauri 
is different from the maximum for other 
executive management. For the remainder 
of his service contract with the Bank, the 
value of discretionary share compensation 
that Mr Gilauri may be granted in a given 
year is capped at 50% of his total salary. 
The Remuneration Committee will review 
both the number of salary shares Mr Gilauri 
receives and the maximum discretionary 
compensation in relation to those shares  
for Mr Gilauri in 2016, but in the meantime 
we are convinced that the combination of 
the substantial number of deferred salary 
shares and the potential to earn discretionary 
shares of a significant value keeps Mr Gilauri 
highly motivated and aligned with shareholders. 
Rewarding achievement
We strongly believe that, while the Group’s 
executive management remuneration 
structure is innovative, it is also sensible, 
simple and fundamentally fair to executive 
management and shareholders. We have 
found that this remuneration structure

Annual Report 2013 81
entrenches a culture of hard work and 
loyalty to the Group and feedback from 
executives confirms that they view 
themselves as long-term stakeholders of 
BGH. We also believe that the structure is 
well aligned with the core ABI Principles of 
Remuneration and other leading guidance.
The KPIs for the Group and its excellent 
performance against them are set forth  
on pages 18 and 19 of this Annual Report.
I would like to thank our Executive 
Management Team – and all of the Group’s 
employees – for their hard work, dedication 
and success in 2013. I would also like to 
thank our shareholders for their support of 
our policy last year. We are gratified by the 
reaction of the shareholders we have been 
able to speak with directly so far, and look 
forward to continuing the discussion.

2.1 Basis of preparation of this 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has 
been prepared in accordance with the Act, 
the Regulations and the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules. As required by the Act, 
a binding resolution to approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy set out in section 6 
below and an advisory resolution to approve 
all other sections of this Directors’ Remuneration 
Report (other than section 3 which describes 
senior officers’ remuneration) will be 
proposed at the AGM, which is intended to 
be held on 28 May 2014 (the 2014 AGM). 
2.2 Audit
The information provided in this section  
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
has, where stated, been audited by Ernst  
& Young LLP in accordance with statutory 
and regulatory requirements.
2.3 Single total figure of remuneration 
for Executive Director (audited)
The table below sets out the remuneration 
received by BGH’s sole Executive Director, 
Irakli Gilauri, for 2013 and 2012 in respect  
of his employment with BGH and the Bank. 
Mr Gilauri’s previous contract expired in 
early 2013 and in late 2012 the Remuneration 
Committee commenced discussions with 
him on its renewal. The background for 
these discussions was:
 – Mr Gilauri’s performance under the  
prior contract (judged as excellent  
by the Committee); 
 – share price growth over the prior  
period that reflected in part Mr Gilauri’s 
performance;
 – substantially increased responsibilities 
faced by Mr Gilauri as CEO of a premium 
listed FTSE 250 company; and
 – the Committee’s judgement that  
Mr Gilauri’s overall compensation  
was out of line with his peers at  
other FTSE 250 companies.
Mr Gilauri’s new contract was signed in 
February 2013. The contract provided for  
a substantial increase in total remuneration 
opportunity. While Mr Gilauri’s cash 
compensation was held constant, the 
Remuneration Committee decided to 
maintain the number of deferred salary 
shares awarded at the 2010 contract level 
despite the increase in the market value of 
the shares between 2010 and 2013, see 
footnote 2 to the table. At the same time, 
the Committee also reduced Mr Gilauri’s 
discretionary deferred share compensation 
maximum to 50% of total salary. Within this 
maximum, Mr Gilauri’s actual discretionary 
award increased in 2013.
For an overall summary of our compensation 
philosophy as it relates to Mr Gilauri, see the 
Chairman’s letter above. Over 85% of Mr 
Gilauri’s compensation for 2013 as set forth 
in the table below is in the form of deferred 
shares for which the average vesting period 
exceeds three years.

Notes:
1)  BGH and Bank cash salaries are expressed in US Dollar but paid in GBP and Lari, converted into the respective currency as described in Note 2 of the table in 
section 6.2 of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Accordingly, there may be variations in the numbers above and those provided in the accounts.
2)  Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of BGH shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in the relevant year. The value is 
calculated by reference to the share price as of the date of the service contract which determined the number of shares underlying the award for the respective 
year. For both 2012 and 2013, the award was 90,000 BGH shares. The value is calculated by reference to the share price of US$21.71 (based on the official share 
price of £14.06 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5443, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the 
same date) as at 19 February 2013 for the 2013 award and by reference to the global depositary receipt (GDR) price of US$10.20 per GDR as at 25 May 2010 for 
the 2012 award (the dates of the relevant service contracts). Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are 
formally granted in January of the year following the year to which the award relates (the “work year”) even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in 
the contract. The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary, and an explanation of why it is not subject to performance measures, are described in 
section 6.2(a) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
3)  Discretionary deferred share compensation. The figures show the value of BGH shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of bonus awards in the 
relevant year. The value is calculated by reference to the share price as of the date of the award. For 2013, options were awarded on 25 February 2014 over 
25,000 BGH shares. For 2012, options were awarded on 15 February 2013 over 30,000 BGH shares. The share price on 25 February 2014 was US$39.79 (based 
on the official share price of £23.85 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.6682, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank 
of England on the same date) and the share price on 15 February 2013 was US$21.49 (based on the official share price of £13.84 per share converted into US 
Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5525, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). This discretionary compensation 
in respect of 2013 is deferred and vests as to 50% in January 2015 and 50% in January 2016, subject to the leaver provisions described in section 6.5(b) of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The means of determining the number of shares underlying this compensation and the terms and conditions are described in 
sections 6.2(b) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The basis for determining Mr Gilauri’s 2013 discretionary award is described in section 2.4 below. 
4) Benefits. The figures show the gross taxable value of health and disability insurance and Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. 
5) Pensions. The figures show the aggregate employer contributions for the relevant years into the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme.
6) Dividend Equivalents. The figure shows the dividend value paid in respect of nil-cost options exercised in respect of 2013.
7) Mr Gilauri was reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, on provision of valid receipts.
8)  No money or other assets are received or receivable by Mr Gilauri in respect of a period of more than one financial year, where final vesting is determined by 
reference to achievement of performance measures or targets relating to a period ending in 2013.

Mr Gilauri’s KPIs largely track the Group’s 
KPIs as he is expected to deliver on the 
Group’s strategy. In addition to the KPIs 
listed in the table above, the Remuneration 
Committee considers non-tangible factors 
such as leadership and forward-looking 
strategy development when determining  
Mr Gilauri’s discretionary compensation.
In respect of 2013, the Remuneration 
Committee determined that Mr Gilauri met 
or exceeded many of the KPIs and came 
close on most others. In light of the 
challenging operating environment for the 
Group in 2013 due to the unexpectedly  
slow growth in the Georgian economy,  
the Remuneration Committee viewed  
Mr Gilauri’s performance as excellent and 
instrumental in creating shareholder value. 
As a result, the Committee determined that 
Mr Gilauri should be awarded discretionary 
deferred share compensation valued at 
US$994,664, exceeding his target 
discretionary compensation of US$837,080, 
but less than his maximum discretionary 
compensation of 50% of total salary. Also 
see section 6.2(b) below which describes why 
the Remuneration Committee steers away 
from strict weighting of the performance 
measures and the discretion it retains in 
respect of determining the number of 
discretionary shares that may be granted.

The following table sets out details of total remuneration for the CEO, Mr Gilauri, for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013 
and his discretionary compensation as a percentage of maximum opportunity. The CEO does not participate in any LTIP and therefore the 
table does not include long-term incentive vesting rates against maximum opportunity.

US$15.61 per share (based on the official share price of £9.92 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange 
rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). The maximum opportunity in 2011 was 100% of Mr Gilauri’s salary, being US$1,293,000. 
3)  For 2010, Mr Gilauri’s cash salary was US$375,000 and the value of the salary deferred shares was calculated on the same basis as 2011 and 2012. The award

1.  In 2013, Mr. Gilauri exercised options in respect of 93,000 BGH shares and sold 220,000 BGH shares. As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr. Gilauri holds 
153,631 BGH shares held directly, 0 vested but unexercised BGH shares held under option and 322,000 unvested and unexercised BGH shares held under 
option, resulting in a total number of interests in BGH shares of 475,631, representing 1.32% of the share capital of BGH.
2.  There have been no changes in interests in BGH shares since 31 December 2013.
3. At year-end 2012 and 2013, Gemstock Growth Fund, which Mr Breach manages, held 20,000 BGH Shares.
4. At year-end 2012 and 2013, the Firebird Group, which Mr Hague manages, held 2,852,921 and 1,373,066 BGH Shares, respectively.
5. At year-end 2012 and 2013, the East Capital Group, Mr Loikannen’s employer, held 6,328,417 and zero BGH Shares, respectively.
The nature of the deferred share compensation structure results in executive management having large holdings of unvested shares. Because 
of this, the Group does not require executive management to hold a specified number of shares in BGH. On the contrary, it encourages 
executive management to diversify their financial holdings by selling a portion of their shares as they vest given that the cash salary received 
by executive management is modest. Subject to restrictions imposed by the Model Code for Share Dealing, no shares acquired by Mr Gilauri 
upon vesting and exercise of his share compensation are required to be held for any specified period of time. None of Mr Gilauri’s connected 
persons have interests in any BGH shares.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in BGH. Notwithstanding this, some  
Non-Executive Directors have chosen to become shareholders. 
2.12 Details of Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment 
Letters of appointment are entered into by BGH with each Non-Executive Director, generally for three-year terms. The letters of 
appointment require Non-Executive Directors to provide one-month notice prior to termination. New BGH letters of appointment for each 
Non-Executive Director were signed on 10 April 2014, with each Non-Executive Director subject to annual re-election at the AGM. 
A succession plan adopted by the Board provides for a tenure of six years on the BGH and Bank Supervisory Boards. Upon the expiry  
of such six-year tenure, the appointment of the relevant Director will generally cease at the next upcoming AGM. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if the Board determines that, in order to maintain the balance of appropriate skills and experience required for the Board, it is 
important to retain a Director on the Board beyond the relevant six-year period, the Board may offer the Director a letter of appointment 
for an additional one-year term. Such a one-year “re-appointment” may be renewed no more than two times, with the effect that the 
usual six-year tenure may be extended to a maximum of nine years if circumstances were to warrant such extension.

3. Senior Officer Remuneration
In addition to the CEO of BGH and the Bank, in 2013, there were seven senior officers. These individuals include the Bank’s “Deputy 
CEOs” responsible for the following directions: Finance, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Investment Management, Legal and 
Affordable Housing, as well as the CEO of Aldagi. 
Key information regarding remuneration for senior officers is disclosed below in the interest of transparency, but the remuneration of 
senior officers is not subject to the Regulations or to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy described in section 6 of this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, nor is it subject to shareholder approval. The principles and remuneration structure described in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy are currently applied in broadly the same way to senior officers. This means that, as for Irakli Gilauri, senior officers 
receive remuneration based on two components: 
 – salary, which includes both a modest cash sum and deferred share compensation which vests over a five-year period; and 
 – a discretionary award, payable 100% in deferred share compensation vesting over a two-year period, which is dependent on both 
Group performance and the executive achieving his KPIs.

Notes:
1) Bank cash salary is expressed in US Dollar but paid in Lari. 
2)  Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of BGH shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in 2013. The value is calculated by 
reference to the share price as of the date of the service contract which determined the number of shares underlying the award for the respective year. The value 
is calculated by reference to the share price of US$21.36 per share (based on the official share price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an 
exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date) as at 18 February 2013, the date of the service 
contracts. Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are formally granted in January of the year following the 
work year even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in the contract. The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary, and an 
explanation of why it is not subject to performance measures, are described in section 6.2(a) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
3)  Discretionary deferred share compensation. The figures show the value of BGH shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of bonus awards in the 
relevant year. The value is calculated by reference to the share price as of the date of the award. For 2013, options were awarded on 25 February 2014. The share 
price on 25 February 2014 was US$39.79 per share (based on the official share price of £23.85 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 
1.6682, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). The means of determining the number of shares underlying this 
compensation and the terms and conditions are described in sections 6.2(b) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

In addition to the formal meetings held during 
the year, the Remuneration Committee 
participated in various discussions by 
telephone outside of these meetings.
Neil Janin, the Chairman of BGH and a 
member of the Remuneration Committee, 
was considered independent at the time 
that he was appointed as Chairman of BGH.
Other attendees at Remuneration Committee 
meetings who provided advice to the 
Remuneration Committee on remuneration 
matters from time to time include Irakli 
Gilauri; the other Board members: Nikolaz 
Gamkrelidze (Deputy CEO, Finance at the 
Bank) and Avto Namichieshvili (Deputy 
CEO, Legal at the Bank). Attendees at 
Remuneration Committee meetings do  
not participate in discussions or decisions 
related to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee seeks and 
considers advice from independent 
remuneration advisers where appropriate.
In 2013, on the basis of their recognised 
expertise in the area, the Remuneration 
Committee recommended that the Board 
appoint H2Glenfern to review the remuneration 
policies for executive management in light  
of the new Regulations and market practice 
and compare the Group against other FTSE 
250 companies. 
H2Glenfern voluntarily operates in accordance 
with the Code of Conduct of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the United 
Kingdom. H2Glenfern has confirmed that  
it has adhered to the Remuneration 
Consultant Group’s Code of Conduct 
throughout the year for all remuneration 
services provided to BGH and the 
Remuneration Committee has therefore 
satisfied itself that all advice provided by 
H2Glenfern was objective and independent. 
H2Glenfern was paid a fixed fee of £11,700 
for its remuneration consultancy services 
and does not provide services to the Group 
other than remuneration advice. 
The Remuneration Committee also received 
advice from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer 
LLP, its legal advisors, on compliance with 
the new Regulations.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 BGH was pleased by the positive vote but 
believed that some of the votes against the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report may have 
been based on a misunderstanding of our 
remuneration structure, as it departs from 
the approach conventionally taken in the 
United Kingdom as explained in the 
Chairman’s Statement above. Accordingly, 
in anticipation of the publication of the 2013 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Director’s Remuneration Policy, we met with 
a number of significant shareholders to 
discuss our remuneration structure. As 
described in the Chairman’s Statement 
above, we were pleased by the feedback. 
We recognise that the vesting period for the 
discretionary deferred share compensation 
is not in strict compliance with the 
Corporate Governance Code’s (the Code) 
three-year vesting recommendation. As this 
Annual Report emphasises, however, our 
overall remuneration package is weighted 
heavily to deferred share compensation and 
includes deferred salary shares which vest 
over a five-year period following the work 
year. As a result, the average vesting period 
for deferred share compensation in excess 
of the Code’s recommended minimum of 
three years. In these circumstances, we 
believe that we are in compliance with the 
spirit of the Code. In addition, as mentioned 
in the Chairman’s Statement above, the total 
value of Mr Gilauri’s discretionary deferred 
share compensation in any year may not 
exceed 50% of total salary. When his 
contract expires in 2016, the Remuneration 
Committee intends to reassess the mix 
between salary and discretionary 
remuneration for Mr Gilauri. Based on the 
long-term vesting of his deferred share 
salary, however, the Remuneration 
Committee believe that his current total 
remuneration package achieves direct and 
natural alignment of Mr Gilauri’s interests 
with those of shareholders.
6. Directors’ Remuneration Policy
6.1 Statement of implementation of 
Policy in 2014
The Policy will first take effect from the  
date of the 2014 AGM and, as such,  
there will be no significant changes  
between the Policy as described in this 
Annual Report and its implementation.
The Remuneration Policy applicable to 
Directors which is described in this section 6 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report (the 
Policy) will be put to shareholders for a 
binding vote at the 2014 AGM. The Policy is 
consistent with the policy which was 
readopted by the Remuneration Committee 
in February 2013 with the three additions 
explained in the Chairman’s Statement 
above and which are included in the Policy 
table at section 6.2 below. 
Subject to shareholders’ approval, the Policy 
will take effect from the date of the 2014 
AGM and is intended to apply until the date 
of the AGM in 2017. As noted above,  
Mr Gilauri’s service contract expires in 2016. 
If the terms of Mr Gilauri’s new service 
contract differ from the Policy, we will come 
back to shareholders in 2016 for approval.
It is a provision of this Policy that the Group 
will honour all pre-existing obligations and 
commitments that were entered into prior to 
this Policy taking effect. The terms of those 
pre-existing obligations and commitments 
may differ from the terms of the Policy and 
may include (without limitation) obligations 
and commitments under service contracts, 
deferred share compensation schemes and 
pension and benefit plans. 
6.2 Elements of the policy – Executive Directors
The Policy provides for an Executive Director’s remuneration package to be comprised of the elements set forth below. 
Component
(Note 1)
Purpose and
link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Salary in the  
form of: 
 – cash; and
 – deferred shares. 
Cash salary
 – Modest yet sufficient to cover 
reasonable living expenses  
and, when combined with  
the other elements of the 
package, competitive enough  
to attract, retain and develop 
high-calibre talent.
Deferred share salary
 – Fixed compensation in the form 
of nil-cost options over BGH 
shares which vest over a five-year 
period promotes the long-term 
success of the Group by closely 
aligning the Executive Director’s 
and shareholders’ interests.
Cash salary is paid in part under the 
Executive Director’s service 
contract with the Bank and in part 
under his service contract with 
BGH, to reflect the Executive 
Director’s duties to each of BGH 
and the Bank, respectively. 
Deferred share salary is paid under 
the Executive Director’s service 
contract with the Bank.
Cash salary
 – Cash salary payable under the service contract with 
BGH is expressed in US Dollar but paid in GBP on 
each monthly payment date (Note 2). 
 – Cash salary payable under the service contract with 
the Bank is expressed in US Dollar but paid in Lari on 
each bi-weekly payment date (Note 2).
Deferred share salary
 – Awarded annually over the number of BGH shares 
that is stated in the Executive Director’s service 
contract with the Bank. 
 – Awards are formally granted in January of the first year 
following the work year, and vest as to 20% in January 
of each of the second, third and fourth years 
following the work year, and as to 40% in January of 
the fifth year following the work year.
 – At vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options), the 
Executive Director receives (in addition to the vested 
shares) cash payments equal to the dividends paid 
on the underlying shares between the date the  
award was made and the vesting date (Note 3). 
 – Unvested deferred share salary lapses upon 
termination by BGH or the Bank “for cause” or by  
the Director other than for “good reason” or if the 
Director does not remain employed by the Group  
or serve as a Director of a subsidiary of the Group 
(each as defined in the relevant service contract  
and explained, in the case of Mr Gilauri, in section  
6.5(b) below).
There is no provision for the recovery or withholding of 
cash or deferred share salary.
Cash salary
 – The amount is fixed in the 
executive’s contract with BGH 
and if applicable with the Bank. 
The total amount payable under 
Mr Gilauri’s current contracts is 
US$437,500. 
Deferred share salary
 – The number of shares underlying 
each annual award is fixed for the 
duration of the Executive Director’s 
contract with BGH and/or the 
Bank, as the case may be. The 
number of deferred salary shares 
under Mr Gilauri’s current 
contract with the Bank is 90,000 
per annum.
The level of salary for an Executive 
Director is reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee when  
the service contract is renewed. 
The next review will be in 2016.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
REPORT CONTINUED
Component
(Note 1)
Purpose and
link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Discretionary 
deferred share 
compensation
Annual performance-based 
compensation paid entirely in the 
form of nil-cost options over BGH 
shares which vest over a two-year 
period. As with the deferred share 
salary, this promotes the Group’s 
long-term success by closely aligning 
the Executive Director’s and 
shareholders’ interests. The Group 
pays no cash bonus to its Executive 
Directors and has no LTIP.
 – Awarded annually after the end of the work year in 
respect of which the award is made over a number  
of BGH shares that are determined annually by the 
Remuneration Committee based on the performance 
of the Group and the Bank and the achievement of the 
KPIs set for the Executive Director by the Remuneration 
Committee for the work year, see section 6.2(b) below.
 – Awards vest as to 50% in January of each of the 
second and third years following the work year.
 – At vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options), the 
Executive Director receives (in addition to the vested 
shares) cash payments equal to the dividends paid 
on the underlying shares between the date the award 
was made and the vesting date (Note 3). 
 – Unvested deferred share compensation lapses upon 
termination by BGH or the Bank “for cause” or by the 
Executive Director other than for “good reason” or if 
the Director does not remain employed by the Group 
(each as defined in the relevant service contract, as 
is explained for Mr Gilauri in section 6.5(b) below). 
The Board has, however, reserved the right to permit 
unvested discretionary deferred shares to vest 
irrespective of the Executive Director’s departure 
when such Executive Director departs on good 
terms with the Group. 
 – If at any time after awarding discretionary deferred 
share compensation, it has been determined that 
there was a material misstatement in the financial 
results for the financial year in respect of which the 
award was formally granted, the Board has the right 
to cause some or all of the award for that financial 
year or for any subsequent financial year that is 
unvested at the time of its determination, not to vest 
and to lapse.
Discretionary deferred share 
compensation is granted out of a 
pool of shares made available for 
such awards for executive 
management. 
The Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right to award no 
discretionary deferred share 
compensation if the Group’s 
performance is unsatisfactory or if 
the Executive Director’s performance 
is poor in light of the KPIs set by the 
Remuneration Committee for the 
Executive Director.
For Mr Gilauri, the maximum value 
of discretionary deferred share 
compensation that may be awarded 
in a given year for the remainder of 
his service contract with the Bank  
is capped at 50% of total salary, 
see section 6.2(b) below.
Discretionary deferred share 
compensation for any Executive 
Director other than Mr Gilauri will 
not comprise more than 125% of 
the Executive Director’s total salary. 
However, the Remuneration 
Committee has reserved the right to 
increase the maximum discretionary 
deferred share compensation to 
150% of the Executive Director’s 
total salary for performance that 
has resulted in outstanding benefits 
for shareholders.
Pension The provision of retirement  
benefits helps to attract and  
retain high-calibre talent. 
The Bank operates a defined contribution pension 
scheme.
The Executive Director and the Bank each contribute  
a minimum of 1% of the Executive Director’s gross 
monthly cash salary payable under his service contract 
with the Bank.
There is no provision for the recovery or withholding  
of pension payments.
The Bank will match in additional 
contributions in a proportion of 0.2 
to one, up to a maximum additional 
Bank contribution of 1% of gross 
monthly salary where the Director 
makes additional contributions up 
to 5% of gross monthly salary.
Benefits Non-cash benefits are in line with 
Georgian market practice and are 
designed to be sufficient to attract 
and retain high-calibre talent.
Benefits consist of health insurance, disability insurance 
and Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, mobile 
phone (including contract charges and costs of calls 
made during business trips abroad) and personal 
security arrangements (if requested by the Executive 
Director). 
A tax equalisation payment may be paid to a Director  
if any part of his remuneration becomes subject to 
double taxation.
There is no provision for the recovery or withholding  
of benefits.
There is no prescribed maximum 
on the value of benefits payable to 
an Executive Director. 
If the Executive Director’s personal 
circumstances do not change and 
the Bank is able to obtain benefits 
on substantially the same terms as 
at the date of the publication of this 
Policy, the aggregate cost of 
benefits for an Executive Director 
during the Policy’s life is not 
expected to change materially.
Notes:
1) Under service contracts with BGH and/or the Bank (as applicable).
2)  BGH cash salary is converted from US Dollar to GBP at the exchange rate published by the Bank of England on each monthly payment date. Bank cash salary is 
converted from US Dollar to Lari at the exchange rate published by the National Bank of Georgia on each bi-weekly payment date.
3) Dividend equivalents are paid in Lari as at the date dividends were paid to other shareholders.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 (a) Salary 
The deferred share salary comprises the 
most important element of the Executive 
Director’s fixed annual remuneration and is 
commensurate with his role within the Group. 
By heavily weighting the base salary to 
deferred share compensation rather than 
cash, the Executive Director’s day-to-day 
actions are geared towards sustained Group 
performance over the long term. The 
deferred share salary component is neither 
a bonus nor an LTIP: it is salary fixed at the 
outset of each three-year service contract 
and is therefore not subject to performance 
targets or measures. That salary, however, 
increases or declines in value depending  
on Group performance over the five-year 
vesting period, aligning the Executive 
Director’s interests directly and naturally  
with those of shareholders. 
(b) Discretionary deferred share 
compensation 
The Group does not operate an LTIP 
because it believes there is sufficient 
long-term incentive built into its deferred 
share salary and discretionary deferred 
share compensation. No cash bonuses 
 are paid to Executive Directors. Instead, 
individual and Group performance is 
rewarded through an award of discretionary 
deferred share compensation that vests 
over the two years following the work year. 
As discretionary deferred share compensation 
is awarded to reward past performance 
over the work year, it is not subject to any 
performance measures over the period from 
award to vesting.
The aggregate pool of shares available each 
year for awards of discretionary deferred 
share compensation for the Executive 
Director and all other members of executive 
management is determined annually by the 
Remuneration Committee in its discretion, 
based on a number of factors including: 
 – financial objectives (e.g. ROAE, operating 
leverage and Cost to Income ratio); 
 – business growth objectives (e.g. net 
loan book growth and deposit growth 
and fee and commission generation); 
 – risk management objectives (e.g. capital 
strength, liquidity management and cost 
of credit risk); 
 – the performance of the Bank relative to its 
competitors in Georgia and in the light 
of overall global market conditions; and 
 – (the market value of the shares at  
the time the discretionary share award  
is determined.
 
The number of shares over which an 
individual Executive Director’s discretionary 
deferred share compensation will be granted 
is determined by the Remuneration Committee 
by reference to the performance of the Group 
and the Executive Director’s KPIs, which  
are set for the Executive Director by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start of  
the financial year and which reflect the 
Executive Director’s required contribution  
to the Group’s overall key strategic and 
financial objectives for the financial year. 
See section 2.4 above for a description of 
the KPIs set for Mr Gilauri in respect of 2013 
and his performance against these targets 
as well as the KPIs that have been set for 
him in respect of 2014.
While the Remuneration Committee has 
defined the set of factors to determine the 
aggregate pool of discretionary shares and 
evaluate an Executive Director’s 
performance, it seeks to steer away from 
defining a series of narrow objectives for its 
Executive Directors and does not utilise strict 
weighting of performance measures. A high 
level of discretion is intentionally maintained 
when determining the quantum of 
discretionary deferred shares awarded to 
each Executive Director. Even in a “good” 
year for an Executive Director (e.g. 
achievement of most of his KPIs), in a  
“bad” year for the Group (e.g. poor financial 
performance by it) the Executive Director 
could receive little or no discretionary share 
compensation. 
As mentioned in the Policy table above, the 
maximum value of discretionary deferred 
share remuneration that Mr Gilauri may be 
awarded in a given year for the remainder of 
his service contract with the Bank is capped 
at 50% of his total salary. 
(c) Equity compensation trust and  
dilution limits
An equity compensation trust has been 
established for the purposes of satisfying 
deferred share compensation awarded to 
Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive Management Team. The trust 
was originally established in 2010 and 
shares committed to the trust in 2010 will 
continue to satisfy awards in respect of the 
2013 work year. In the future, BGH will need 
to issue new shares or repurchase shares,  
or a combination of both, in order to ensure 
that there are a sufficient number of shares 
are committed to the trust in order to satisfy 
awards. However, the Group has committed 
to shareholders that new shares issued in 
satisfaction of deferred share compensation 
from the time of the Company’s listing on 
the Premium Segment of the LSE will not 
exceed 10% of BGH’s ordinary share capital 
over any 10-year period.
(d) Comparison with Remuneration  
Policy for employees generally 
The components of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors (as 
provided for by the Policy) are broadly the 
same as those for non-Board members of 
the Executive Management Team. Other 
members of senior management and 
middle management receive their entire 
salary in cash and do not receive deferred 
share salary. Their bonuses may be either  
in the form of cash and/or shares which 
vest over a three-year period following the 
award. All other employees within the Group 
receive a cash salary and may be eligible to 
receive cash bonuses, portions of which 
may be deferred until the publication of the 
audited annual results for the work year 
and/or based on continuous employment 
with the Group. The deferred portion of the 
cash bonus may also be reduced if it is 
revealed, upon completion of the annual 
audit, that the annual results published by 
the department where the employee works 
were incorrect in any material respect. All 
employees receive a competitive benefit 
package in line with Georgian market 
practice and are entitled to participate in  
the pension scheme on the same terms  
as applicable to Executive Directors. 
(e) Business expenses
Executive Directors are reimbursed for 
reasonable business expenses incurred in 
the course of carrying out duties under their 
service contracts, on provision of valid receipts. 
6.3 Total remuneration opportunity  
for our sole Executive Director 
The chart below shows the remuneration 
which Mr Gilauri, our sole Executive Director, 
could receive in respect of 2014 under the 
Policy at three different performance levels.  
It should be noted that, at the maximum 
level, over 88% of Mr Gilauri’s 2014 
compensation will be in the form of deferred 
shares for which the average vesting period 
exceeds three years. At the minimum level, 
over 82% of Mr Gilauri’s 2014 compensation 
will be in the form of deferred shares for 
which the average vesting is just under  
four years.

6.4 Elements of the policy – Non-Executive Directors
In 2013, each member of the Board of BGH, with the exception of Mr Gilauri, served as a 
member of the Supervisory Board of the Bank. Fees for Non-Executive Directors on both 
the Board of BGH and the Supervisory Board of the Bank are paid solely in cash. Each 
member received a base fee and was further remunerated for membership on the Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee and/or Nomination Committee, if applicable. 
The Policy provides for a Non-Executive Director’s remuneration package to be comprised 
of the following elements: 
Component
Purpose and link to 
strategy Operation Opportunity
Base cash fee. Combined BGH 
and Bank base 
cash fee is 
competitive enough 
to attract and retain 
experienced 
individuals.
The Chairman and 
Senior Independent 
Non-Executive 
Director receive 
higher base fees 
which reflect 
increased 
responsibilities and 
time commitment.
Cash payment on  
a quarterly basis.
The amount of remuneration is reviewed 
every three years by the Remuneration 
Committee. The next review will be in 2017 . 
The combined BGH and Bank base cash 
fee currently payable to Non-Executive 
Directors and Supervisory Board members 
is US$75,000 per year (US$37,500 for 
each of BGH and the Bank).
The Remuneration Committee reserves 
the right, in its sole discretion, to amend 
and vary the fees if there are genuinely 
unforeseen and exceptional circumstances 
which necessitate such review and in 
such circumstances any significant 
increase shall be the minimum 
reasonably required.
The maximum aggregate BGH fees for 
all Non-Executive Directors which may 
be paid under BGH’s articles of 
association is £750,000.
Cash fee for 
each 
committee 
membership.
Additional fee to 
compensate for 
additional time 
spent discharging 
committee duties 
for BGH and  
the Bank.
Cash payment on  
a quarterly basis.
The amount of remuneration for committee 
membership is reviewed every three 
years by the Remuneration Committee. 
The next review will be in 2017. 
Fees for committee membership range 
from US$7,500 to US$15,000 per 
committee, depending on the committee 
and whether the Non-Executive Director 
is a committee chairman or member.
Notes:
1)  Non-Executive Directors do not receive any deferred share salary or discretionary deferred share 
compensation, pensions, benefits or any variable or performance-linked remuneration or incentives. 
2)  Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, including travel expenses, 
incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their letter of appointments, on provision of valid receipts.
3)  Non-Executive Directors who are appointed to the Board and/or to the Supervisory Board of the Bank  
by shareholders of BGH are required to waive any entitlements to fees which would otherwise be payable 
to them under the Policy for so long as they are appointees of a shareholder. 
Notes:
1)  Salary is comprised of cash, deferred share salary, 
benefits and pension contributions. Mr Gilauri’s  
total cash salary in 2014 in respect of both his 
service contract with BGH and the Bank will be 
US$437,500. The value of the deferred share salary 
payable for 2014 was calculated by reference to  
the share price as at the date Mr Gilauri’s service 
contract at the Bank was signed, being US$21.71 
per share (the official share price of £14.06 per 
share as at 19 February 2013 converted into US 
Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5503, being  
the official exchange rate published by the Bank  
of England on the same date), which is the value  
at which the shares were committed to the trust 
and underlies the determination of compensation 
expense in the Group’s income statement for the 
year. Deferred share salary in respect of 2014 will  
be formally granted in January and will vest from 
January 2016 to January 2019. For the purposes of 
this graph, we have used the value of pension and 
benefits for 2013 as we assume that pension and 
benefits in 2014 will be substantially the same.
2)  The means of determining the number of shares 
underlying the discretionary deferred share 
compensation and terms and conditions applying 
to this compensation are described in section 
6.2(b) of this Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Discretionary deferred shares in respect of 2014 
will be formally granted in January 2015 and will 
vest in January 2016 and 2017. 
3)  Minimum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr 
Gilauri receives only fixed remuneration, comprised 
of cash salary, deferred share salary, pension 
contributions and benefits and the Remuneration 
Committee considers that the Group’s and/or the 
Director’s performance in 2014 does not warrant any 
award of discretionary deferred share compensation
4)  On target opportunity reflects a scenario  
whereby Mr Gilauri receives fixed remuneration  
(as described above) and assumes a discretionary 
deferred share compensation award at 70% of the 
maximum opportunity for Group and individual 
performance which is in line with the Group’s 
expectation, which is excellent performance. 
5)  Maximum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby 
Mr Gilauri receives fixed remuneration (as described 
above) and a discretionary deferred share 
compensation award of 50% of total salary  
(i.e. the Remuneration Committee considers  
that the Group’s and the individual’s performance 
in 2014 warrant the highest possible level of 
discretionary deferred share compensation). 
6)  The value of deferred shares does not take into 
account any increase or decrease in share price over 
the vesting period or any dividend equivalents payable 
on vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options).

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 6.5 Policy on payments for loss of office 
The following paragraphs (a) to (c) describe 
the Group’s policy for payments on termination 
of Mr Gilauri’s service contracts with BGH 
and the Bank. In 2013 and as of the date of 
this Annual Report, Mr Gilauri is the sole 
Executive Director on the BGH Board. The 
Group’s policy for payments for loss of office 
for Non-Executive Directors is described in 
paragraph (d) below and its approach to 
payments for loss of office for future 
executive and Non-Executive Directors  
is described in paragraph 6.6 below. 
The Directors’ service contracts and letters 
of appointment are kept for inspection by 
shareholders at BGH’s registered office.
(a) Termination of BGH service contract 
dated 15 December 2011
Mr Gilauri’s service contract with BGH is  
for an indefinite term (subject to annual 
re-election at the AGM) and is terminable  
by either party on four months’ written 
notice. Where the service contract is 
terminated on notice, BGH may put Mr 
Gilauri on garden leave for some or all of  
the notice period and continue to pay his 
cash salary under the BGH service contract, 
provided that any accrued and unused 
holiday entitlement shall be deemed to be 
taken during the garden leave period.
BGH may terminate Mr Gilauri’s employment 
early with immediate effect and without notice 
and pay in lieu of notice in the case of, 
among other circumstances, his dishonesty, 
gross misconduct, conviction of an offence 
(other than traffic-related) or becoming of 
unsound mind.
BGH may also terminate the agreement  
with immediate effect by payment in lieu  
of notice, in which case the payment in lieu 
of notice shall be solely in respect of cash 
salary due under the BGH service contract 
as at the date of termination of employment. 
(b) Termination of Bank service contract 
dated 19 February 2013
Mr Gilauri’s service contract with the Bank 
is for an initial term of three years expiring 
on 1 May 2016, which may be renewed  
by agreement between the parties or 
terminated prior to the expiry of the term  
by either Mr Gilauri or the Bank. The Bank 
may terminate the service contract 
immediately without notice (subject to the 
terms set out below), whereas Mr Gilauri 
may terminate the contract upon three 
months’ written notice or such shorter 
period as is agreed with the Supervisory 
Board of the Bank. 
Separation payments
In the circumstances listed below where  
Mr Gilauri’s service contract is terminated, 
he is entitled only to accrued and unpaid 
cash salary, accrued but not yet paid 
dividend equivalents, benefits, holiday pay 
and reimbursement of business expenses: 
 – termination by the Bank for “cause” 
(cause being defined as gross and wilful 
misconduct, material repeated failure to 
perform his duties or breach of his 
obligations or conviction of a felony, 
among other circumstances);
 – termination by reason of death or 
disability (in which case he receives life 
or disability insurance benefits); or
 – termination by Mr Gilauri other than for 
“good reason” (good reason meaning 
uncorrected material breach of the 
service contract by the Bank which  
is not cured within 45 days upon the 
executive serving notice of breach or 
material and unremedied illegal or 
unethical behaviour by Bank employees 
which has been notified to the Board  
by the executive and the Board fails to 
react and cooperate with the executive 
in addressing the behaviour).
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract is terminated 
for any other reason, or is not renewed on 
substantially similar terms on expiry of the 
term of the service contract, he is entitled to 
a separation payment equal to 12 months’ 
cash salary under the service contract plus 
any accrued and outstanding cash salary, 
holiday pay and reimbursement of business 
expenses. He will not be entitled to any 
additional severance or leaving allowance, 
reimbursements, pay in lieu of notice, 
benefits, compensation for sick leave  
or other similar payments other than in 
respect of his deferred share salary and 
discretionary deferred share compensation 
(summarised below). 
The Bank may restrict Mr Gilauri from being 
employed in the financial industry and/or 
providing consulting or similar services to  
a competing financial institution for a period 
of up to six months following the termination 
of his employment, and will continue to pay 
him his full cash salary under the Bank 
service contract as compensation for his 
unemployment for the first four months  
of this period. In addition, the Bank may 
impose a two-year non-compete period  
in exchange for accelerated vesting of  
his deferred share compensation (as 
described below).
Deferred share compensation on 
termination
Mr Gilauri will be entitled to a pro-rata award 
of his deferred share salary in respect of any 
incomplete calendar year which he has worked, 
and may also be awarded discretionary 
deferred share compensation in respect  
of such incomplete calendar year if: 
 – his service contract expires and is not 
renewed upon substantially similar 
terms and he is not offered, or is offered 
and accepts, continued membership  
of the BGH and/or Bank Board; or
 – his service contract is terminated before 
its expiry date but he continues as a 
member of the BGH and/or Bank Board.
Mr Gilauri will not be entitled to any deferred 
share salary for calendar years covered by 
the contract period during which he has not 
worked.
Vesting and lapse of existing awards 
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract is terminated 
for cause or by him other than for good 
reason, his unvested deferred share 
compensation will, unless otherwise agreed 
with the Board, lapse on the termination date.
Any unvested deferred share compensation 
of Mr Gilauri will vest immediately if:
 – his service contract is terminated by the 
Bank other than for cause; is terminated 
by him for good reason; or expires and 
neither a renewed agreement nor  
Board membership is offered; or 
 – he ceases to be an Executive Director 
by reason of death, disability, injury, 
redundancy or retirement at normal 
retirement age; or
 – there is a change of control of the  
Bank or BGH. 
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract expires and 
he is offered but refuses membership of the 
board of a company within the Group, 50% 
of his unvested deferred share compensation 
will vest immediately and the remaining 50% 
will, at his discretion, either continue to vest 
as normal or he may acquire some or all of 
the underlying shares for a specified price 
based on the price of the shares on grant  
in accordance with the terms of the service 
contract plus a 10% annual increase from

REPORT CONTINUED
the respective grant date until the date of 
acquisition. In consideration for this vesting 
treatment, Mr Gilauri will be bound by a 
two-year non-compete period during which 
he may not be employed by, provide 
consultancy services to or otherwise found 
or be a partner or associate of a commercial 
bank in Georgia (save that he may hold less 
than 5% of shares of a publicly listed bank). 
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract expires and  
is not renewed upon substantially similar 
terms but he is offered and accepts 
continued or renewed membership of the 
BGH and/or Bank Board, 50% of his unvested 
shares vest immediately and the remaining 
50% shall continue to vest as normal.
If he subsequently ceases to be a member 
of the Bank and/or BGH Board, at Mr Gilauri’s 
discretion, unvested shares either continue 
to vest as normal or he may acquire some 
or all of the underlying shares for the 
specified price as described above.
Mr Gilauri will be paid cash payments 
equivalent to the dividends accrued on his 
deferred share compensation. Such payments 
will be made on the vesting date in respect 
of dividends paid from the date the award 
was made to the vesting date. Such cash 
payments shall accrue and be payable on 
any vested shares, even if Mr Gilauri’s 
service contract with the Bank has been 
terminated prior to vesting. The Bank will 
not pay any cash equivalent in respect of 
dividends on any deferred share 
compensation that has lapsed. 
(c) Previous service contract with the  
Bank dated 25 May 2010
Any unvested awards granted under  
Mr Gilauri’s previous service contract with 
the Bank (for the period from 25 May 2010 
until and including 30 April 2013) shall vest 
immediately on termination of his current 
service contract for any reason, except that 
(i) if his current agreement is terminated by 
the Bank for cause, any unvested awards 
shall (unless the Board determines 
otherwise) lapse, and (ii) if it is terminated  
by Mr Gilauri for any reason other than for 
good reason (and unless the Board 
determines otherwise to his advantage), 
50% of the unvested awards will vest 
immediately and the remaining 50% will,  
at his discretion, either continue to vest  
as normal or the underlying shares may be 
acquired for the specified price as above. 
(d) Termination of Non-Executive  
Directors’ appointments
The Board has developed a succession 
plan pursuant to which a Non-Executive 
Director may serve no longer than seven 
and a half years on the Board of BGH. 
Letters of appointment provide for an initial 
term of three years and are renewed for an 
additional three years or shorter period of 
time depending on the tenure of the 
Non-Executive Director. Notwithstanding  
the foregoing, each Non-Executive Director 
is required to submit himself for annual 
re-election at the AGM. The letters of 
appointment for each Non-Executive 
Director were executed on 10 April 2014. 
Details regarding Non-Executive Director 
appointments and planned resignations  
are shown in section 2.13.
The letters of appointment provide for a 
one-month notice period although BGH 
may terminate the appointment with 
immediate effect without notice or pay in 
lieu of notice if the Non-Executive Director 
has committed any serious breach or 
non-observance of his or her obligations to 
BGH, is guilty of fraud or dishonesty, brings 
BGH or him/herself into disrepute or is 
disqualified as acting as a Non-Executive 
Director, among other circumstances.  
Upon termination, the only remuneration  
a Non-Executive Director is entitled to is 
accrued fees as at the date of termination 
together with reimbursement of properly 
incurred expenses incurred prior to the 
termination date.
6.6 Policy on the appointment of 
external hires and internal 
appointments
Any new Executive Director appointed to  
the Board would be paid no more than  
the Remuneration Committee considers 
reasonably necessary to attract a candidate 
with the relevant skills and experience.  
His or her remuneration package would 
comprise the components described in 
section 6.2 above. The Remuneration 
Committee may, in its discretion and taking 
into account the role assumed by the new 
Executive Director, vary the amount of any 
component in the package. This discretion 
will only be exercised to the extent required 
to facilitate the recruitment of the particular 
individual. In addition, the terms and 
conditions attaching to any component of 
the remuneration might be varied insofar  
as the Remuneration Committee considers 
it necessary or desirable to do so in all the 
circumstances. 
Relocation support for an incoming 
Executive Director and, where relevant, his 
or her family may be provided depending on 
the individual’s circumstances. BGH has not 
set a maximum aggregate amount that may 
be paid in respect of any individual’s relocation 
support, but it will aim to provide support of 
an appropriate level and quality on the best 
terms that can reasonably be obtained.
Upon the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee, the Group may 
“buy out” incentive awards which were 
granted to an incoming Executive Director 
by a previous employer and which have 
been foregone. In these circumstances,  
the approach will be to match the estimated 
current value of the foregone awards by 
granting awards of deferred share 
compensation which vest over a similar 
timeframe to the awards being bought out. 
The application of performance conditions 
and/or clawback provisions may also be 
considered, where appropriate. Such new 
awards may be granted in addition to any 
deferred share salary and discretionary 
deferred share compensation.
Any payment upon termination of a new 
Executive Director’s service contract would 
not exceed 12 months’ cash salary under 
the relevant service contract, plus any 
accrued and unpaid cash salary, benefits 
and holiday pay and reimbursement of any 
business expenses. The Group may also 
continue to pay a former Executive Director 
his full cash salary for any period following 
the termination of his appointment during 
which he is prohibited from competing with 
the Group. 
94
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 It is expected that the following vesting 
provisions will apply to deferred share 
compensation in the case of termination of 
a new Executive Director’s service contract: 
 – Unvested deferred share compensation 
would lapse upon termination of the 
service contract by BGH or the Bank  
for cause, termination by the Executive 
Director other than for good reason or  
if the Executive Director’s employment  
is terminated for any other reason and 
he is not offered continued membership 
of the Board or the Bank’s Supervisory 
Board. 
 – Unvested deferred share compensation 
would continue to vest in the normal 
way during the respective vesting 
period(s) upon termination by BGH or 
the Bank without cause, if the Executive 
Director’s service contract expires and 
he is not offered a new service contract 
on substantially similar terms on expiration 
or if the Executive Director ceases to be 
an Executive Director by reason of 
injury, disability, redundancy or 
retirement (at normal retirement age). 
 – Unvested deferred share compensation 
would vest immediately upon death of 
the Executive Director, termination of the 
service contract by the Executive 
Director for good reason or a change  
of control. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board 
reserves the right to permit unvested 
deferred share compensation to vest 
irrespective of the Executive Director’s 
departure when such Executive Director 
departs on good terms with the Group. 
Any new Non-Executive Director appointed 
to the Board would be paid no more than 
the Remuneration Committee considers 
reasonably necessary in light of market 
practice among other FTSE 250 companies 
and the current remuneration of other 
Non-Executive Directors. His or her 
remuneration package would comprise the 
same components as for the existing 
Non-Executive Directors. 
If an existing employee of the Group is 
appointed as an executive or Non-Executive 
Director, any obligation or commitment 
entered into with that individual prior to his 
appointment will be honoured by the Group 
in accordance with the terms of those 
obligations or commitments, even where 
they differ from the terms of the Policy.
6.7 Consideration of shareholder views 
and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group 
As noted in the Chairman’s Statement, the 
Group sought the views of a number of its 
shareholders with respect to the structure 
of executive remuneration. Many of the 
shareholders consulted strongly endorsed 
the Policy and the Group believes that 
shareholder questions and concerns were 
addressed. 
The Remuneration Committee considers 
the pay and employment conditions of 
executive management (other than Directors) 
when determining an Executive Director’s 
remuneration as well as changes in pay and 
employment conditions across the Group 
as a whole in relation to the proposed pay 
for Directors. The Remuneration Committee 
consults with the Human Relations department, 
Executive Management and other employees 
during the year to seek feedback on the 
executive remuneration structure and takes 
such views into account when analysing its 
Policy. In 2013, the employees consulted 
confirmed that they were satisfied with the 
manner in which they were compensated.  
In taking this information into account in 
determining an Executive Director’s 
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee 
relies on its judgement, particularly given 
that international comparisons are the most 
relevant for senior management and the 
Georgian labour market is more relevant  
for other employees.

Chairman’s Overview
In 2013, we focused on strengthening, 
broadening, balancing and understanding 
the range of skills, experience and diversity 
on the Board and its Committees. The 
implementation of our succession plan 
developed in 2012 was a key achievement 
in 2013 and a number of significant changes 
were made to the Board in order to 
strengthen independent oversight.
When initiating our search for new Non-
Executive Directors, we developed a job 
specification for each appointment. Our 
appointment policy is predicated on appointing 
the best possible candidates based on merit, 
against objective criteria. We embrace diversity 
in all of its forms and ensured that our shortlist 
of candidates included individuals from a 
diverse range of backgrounds and that such  
a list was gender-neutral.
As a result of this year-long search, we  
were very pleased to welcome three fully 
Independent Non-Executive Directors – Kim 
Bradley, Tamaz Georgadze and Bozidar Djelic 
in December 2013 following the departure of 
Allan Hirst, Ian Hague and Hanna Loikkanen.
In conjunction with these appointments,  
we have also reviewed our Committee 
composition during the year, recommending 
the appointment of Mr Bradley as a member 
of both the Audit and Nomination Committees. 
Mr Georgadze and Mr Djelic were also 
recommended for appointment to the 
Nomination Committee. 
Who is on the Nomination Committee 
and what are its Responsibilities?

How did the Nomination Committee 
Discharge its Responsibilities in 2013?
This year, in line with our 2012-13 action plan, 
the Committee spent a significant amount  
of time discussing succession planning.  
We undertook a review of the structure, size, 
composition and balance of skills on the 
Board and Committees with a particular 
focus on tenure and independence.
As a result of this review, we determined that 
Mr Hirst, Mr Hague and Ms Loikkanen should 
each retire from the Board upon the selection 
of new fully independent Non-Executive 
Directors with the required skill set necessary 
to complement the Board. Following a 
lengthy search for suitable candidates,  
we recommended the appointment of  
Mr Bradley, Mr Georgadze and Mr Djelic  
in December 2013 in conjunction with  
the retirement of Mr Hirst, Mr Hague  
and Ms Loikannen. 
In 2013, we also discussed the appointment 
renewal for myself, Mr Morrison, Mr Gilauri, 
Mr Breach and Mr Kiknavelidze as well as 
refining our succession plan, taking into 
consideration the new composition of our 
Board, balance of skills as well as tenure of 
the Directors recommended for appointment 
renewal. The proposed retirement of each 
Board member is presented on page 87 
of this Annual Report.
The Group has historically placed a high 
emphasis on diversity and will continue  
to do so looking forward. Geographic and 
gender diversity together with key technical 
expertise in banking, risk, accountancy, 
finance, technology and international 
business all form core components of our 
Board succession planning. Balancing all  
of these factors to maintain an effective 
Board is a delicate matter and we do not 
believe that imposing quotas is appropriate 
in this context.
Throughout the year, we have also 
undertaken training in order to remain up to 
date on significant developments and how 
these might impact the Group. To ensure 
that the Committee is operating effectively, 
we carried out our Committee review at the 
time of the Board Effectiveness Review.  
The Committee is reviewed by the members 
themselves as well as by the Board as a 
whole. Following the review, the Committee 
was found to be operating effectively. 
Looking Ahead to 2014
For 2014, the Committee will continue to 
focus on succession planning and Board 
and Committee refreshment, based on a 
continuous review of Board and Board 
Committee composition against our skills 
and experience requirements and diversity 
guidance. We will also look to have greater 
visibility of potential candidates for key 
senior positions with the Group. A review  
of induction training as well as ongoing 
training and knowledge of all Directors will 
also be a priority.

Annual Report 2013 97 Principal Activities and Business Review 
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC (Company 
No. 7811410) is the holding company for the 
Group. The Group is principally engaged in 
the core businesses of Retail Banking, 
Corporate Banking and Investment 
Management, as well as the synergistic 
businesses of Insurance, Healthcare and 
Affordable Housing.
We are required to present a fair review  
of our business during the financial year 
ended 31 December 2013, our position at 
year-end, and a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that we face. This 
review enables shareholders to assess how 
the Directors have performed their duties 
under the Companies Act 2006. 
The information required for the business 
review and certain other disclosures can  
be found in this Directors’ Report and the 
following sections of the Annual Report, which 
are incorporated in this Directors’ Report.
Articles of Association
BGH’s Articles of Association may only  
be amended by a special resolution at  
a general meeting of shareholders. The 
BGH Articles of Association are available on 
BGH’s website http://www.bogh.co.uk/en/

Share Capital and Control
Information about share capital, restrictions 
on the transfer of shares or voting rights and 
special rights with regard to control of BGH 
is shown in Note 20 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements on page 156 of this 
Annual Report and is incorporated into this 
report by reference.
The powers of the Directors, including in 
relation to the issue or buy back of the 
Company’s shares, are set out in the 
Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s 
articles of association. The Directors were 
granted authorities to issue and allot shares 
and to repurchase shares at the 2013 AGM. 
Shareholders will be asked to renew these 
authorities at the 2014 AGM.
Results and Dividends
BGH may by ordinary resolution declare 
dividends provided that no such dividend  
shall exceed the amount recommended  
by BGH’s Directors. The Directors may  
also pay interim dividends as appear to  
be justified by the profits of BGH available  
for distribution. 
As BGH is a holding company, BGH relies 
primarily on dividends and other statutorily 
(if any) and contractually permissible 
payments from its subsidiaries to generate 
the funds necessary to meet its obligations 
and pay dividend to its shareholders. 
As a result of the Bank’s strong financial 
performance and condition, the BGH Board 
has recently recommended an annual 
dividend of GEL 2.0 payable in British Pounds 
Sterling, which is subject to shareholders’ 
approval at the 2014 AGM. If approved,  
the dividend will be paid on 18 June 2014  
to shareholders on the UK register of 
members at the close of business in the  
UK (6:00 pm London time) on 6 June 2014.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT Powers of Directors
The Directors may exercise all powers of BGH 
subject to applicable legislation and regulation 
and BGH’s Articles of Association.
Conflicts of Interest
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, 
the Directors have adopted a policy and 
procedure for the disclosure and authorisation 
(if appropriate) of conflicts of interest, and 
these have been followed during 2013.
Appointment and Retirement  
of Directors 
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by BGH’s Articles of 
Association, the Code, the Companies Act 
2006, related legislation and regulations. The 
Articles may only be amended by a special 
resolution of the shareholders of BGH. 
The Board has the power to appoint 
additional Directors or to fill a casual vacancy 
amongst the Directors. Under the Articles  
of Association, any such Director holds  
office only until the next AGM and may offer 
himself/herself for re-election. The Articles of 
Association also require that at each AGM  
at least one-third of the Directors retire by 
rotation. The retiring Directors are eligible  
to stand for re-election. We note that the 
Corporate Governance Code recommends 
that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies 
should be subject to annual re-election.  
We abide by this recommendation and, as  
a result, all Directors will stand for re-election 
at this year’s AGM.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 99 Relations with Shareholders 
The Code encourages a dialogue with 
shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives, a responsibility 
that the Company takes very seriously. 
The Board’s primary contact with 
institutional shareholders is through the 
Chairman, Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director, Chief Executive Officer 
and Head of Investor Relations, each of 
whom provide a standing invitation to 
shareholders to meet and discuss and 
matters they wish to raise. Our Committee 
Chairmen also make themselves available  
to answer questions from investors.
We formally communicate with our 
shareholders via our AGM, Annual Report 
and Accounts, Half-Year Report and website 
on which we publish Interim Management 
Statements. These are supported by a 
combination of presentations, conference 
calls, one-to-one meetings and investor 
meetings in the United Kingdom, Europe  
and the United States. 
In November 2013, the Company hosted an 
investor day at the Bank’s headquarters in 
Tbilisi. This investor day was open to all 
investors and provided an opportunity for 
investors to meet with the Board and raise 
matters of interest. The Company was 
pleased to host 55 institutional investors.
As mentioned in our Remuneration Report 
on pages 80 to 95 of this Annual Report, in 
the first quarter of this year, members of our 
Remuneration Committee also met with the 
Company’s significant shareholders as well 
as shareholder advisory groups to discuss 
and seek feedback on the Company’s 
remuneration structure.
The Chairman has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the Board understands the 
views of major shareholders. The Board 
also receives a regular report from the 
Investor Relations team. Feedback from 
meetings held between executive 
management, or the Investor Relations 
team, and institutional shareholders is also 
communicated to the Board.
Annual General Meeting
Our AGM will be held at 10:00 am (London 
time) on Wednesday, 28 May 2014 at 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, 65 
Fleet Street, London EC4Y 1HS. Details of 
the business to be conducted at the AGM 
are contained in the Notice of AGM.
Statement of the Directors in Respect  
of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements
As required by the Code, the Directors confirm 
that they consider that the Annual Report 
(which includes the accounts), taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
In arriving at this position the Board was 
assisted by a number of processes that  
form part of its internal control and risk 
management systems, including the following:
 – the Annual Report is drafted by 
appropriate senior management with 
overall co-ordination by the Head of 
Investor Relations to ensure consistency 
across sections;
 – an extensive verification process is 
undertaken to ensure factual accuracy;
 – comprehensive reviews of drafts of the 
Annual Report are undertaken by the 
CEO and other senior executive 
management; 
 – an advanced draft is considered and 
reviewed by BGH’s legal advisers; and
 – the final draft is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee prior to consideration by  
the Board.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
We are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Director’s Remuneration Report 
and the accompanying Consolidated and 
Stand-Alone Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Company law requires us to 
prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under the law, we have elected to 
prepare the accompanying Consolidated 
and Stand-Alone Financial Statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by  
the European Union and applicable law.
Under company law, we must not approve 
the accompanying Consolidated and 
Stand-Alone Financial Statements unless we 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and BGH 
and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
BGH for that period.
In preparing the accompanying Consolidated 
and Stand-Alone Financial Statements, we 
are required to:
a)  select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
b)  make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
c)  state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the financial statements; and 
d)  prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
We are also responsible for keeping  
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain BGH’s and  
the Group’s transactions, to disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of BGH and the Group, and to enable 
us to ensure that the Consolidated and 
Stand-Alone Financial Statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Consolidated and Stand-Alone Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have further responsibility for 
safeguarding the assets of BGH and the 
Group and for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
We are also responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of BGH’s website. Legislation  
in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of us listed in the Board of Directors 
section of this Annual Report who held 
office at the date of this Annual Report 
confirms that to the best of his knowledge:
a)  the accompanying Consolidated and 
Stand-Alone Financial Statements, 
prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of BGH and the Group 
taken as a whole; and 
b)  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of BGH and 
Group taken as a whole, together with  
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

GOVERNANCE:  
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED In accordance with section 418(2) of the 
Companies Act 2006, each of us that held 
office at the date of the approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as  
he is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which BGH’s auditors are 
unaware and each of us has taken all steps 
that he ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the  
Company’s statutory auditors are aware of  
such information.
Going Concern 
The Directors believe that the Group is well 
positioned to manage its risks successfully in 
the current uncertain economic environment. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that BGH and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Statement of Compliance 
As BGH is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, we comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, save for 
Section D.1.1, which is described in greater 
detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
of this Annual Report. The Code is publicly 
available for review on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013 (Scope 1 and 2) and 
additionally have reported on those emissions 
under Scope 3 that are applicable to our 
business. All reported sources fall within our 
Consolidated Financial Statements which 
can be found on pages 106 to 182 of this 
Annual Report. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources that are not 
included in our Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
In preparing this emission data, we have 
used the World Resources Institute/World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
(GHG): A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition) and emission factors 
from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014.
The reported data is collected and reported 
for the boundaries of four of the Group’s 
main businesses:
 – Banking (represented by the Bank), which 
includes all of its offices and retail branches 
where the Bank has operational control.
 – Real estate development (represented 
by m2), which includes its main office 
and two construction sites.
 – Insurance (represented by Aldagi), 
which includes all of its offices and retail 
branches where the Company has 
operational control.
 – Healthcare (represented by MFC), which 
includes its main office and hospitals 
where the Company has operational 
control.
Scope 1 (combustion of fuel and operation 
of facilities) includes emissions from:
 – Combustion of natural gas, diesel, and 
petrol in stationary equipment at owned 
and controlled sites.
 – Combustion of petrol, diesel, and 
aviation fuel in owned transportation 
devices (cars and aeroplane).
Scope 2 (electricity, heat, steam and cooling 
purchased for own use) includes emissions 
from:
 – Used electricity at owned and controlled 
sites; to calculate the emissions, we 
used conversion factor for Non-OECD 
Europe and Eurasia (average) 
conversion from UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2014. 
 – Used heat and steam (only applies to 
one site of Aldagi).
Scope 3 includes emissions from:
 – Air business travel (short haul and long 
haul); information on the class of travel  
is unavailable hence we used an 
“average passenger” conversion factor.
 – Ground transportation, including taxi, 
coaches, and car hire.
Data on emissions resulting from travel is 
reported for business-related travel only, 
and excludes commuting travel. Data from 
joint ventures, investments, or sub-leased 
properties have not been included within 
the reported figures. 
The data is provided by on-site delegates, 
invoices, and meter readings.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 101 Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC
We have audited the financial statements of 
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 which comprise 
the Group and Parent Company Statements 
of Financial Position, the Group Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Group and 
Parent Company Statements of Cash Flow, 
the Group and Parent Company Statements 
of Changes in Equity and the related Notes 
1 to 32. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the 
parent Company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 
100, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s  
and the parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and the overall presentation  
of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union; and 
 – the parent Company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union  
and as applied in accordance  
with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and
 – the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement and our response to  
those risks
We identified the following risks that have 
had the greatest effect on the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team:
 – The appropriateness of the allowance 
for impairment of loans.  
We documented the Group’s process 
for determining the allowance, 
performed a walkthrough to confirm the 
process was operating as expected and 
identified key controls. We examined the 
Group’s documented borrower 
assessment, recalculated the allowance, 
compared actual to planned 
repayments and considered the 
expected cash flows from collateral. We 
also performed analytical procedures 
over the reasonableness of the 
allowance. 
 – The Group’s financial accounting 
systems are highly dependent on IT 
systems and controls.  
We evaluated the design and operating 
effectiveness of the IT systems that are 
relevant to financial reporting. We 
examined the controls over programme 
development and changes, access  
to programs and data and IT operations 
in respect of those IT systems. Having 
established a basis to rely on IT general 
controls, we tested the automated controls 
relevant to the financial statements.
 – Fair value of investment properties  
and premises. 
We challenged management’s assumptions 
used in the determination of the fair value 
of investment properties and premises. 
We engaged valuations specialists to 
work with the audit team to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the valuations. 
REPORT TO 
MEMBERS
102
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013
GOVERNANCE:  
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S 
REPORT Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in both 
planning and performing the audit, and in 
evaluating the effect of misstatements on 
our audit and on the financial statements. 
For the purposes of determining whether 
the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we define materiality 
as the magnitude of misstatement that 
makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person, relying on the financial statements, 
would be changed or influenced. 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, 
we determined a magnitude of uncorrected 
misstatements that we judged would be 
material for the financial statements as a 
whole. We determined materiality for the 
Group to be GEL 12,200,000, which is 
approximately 5% of profit before tax. This 
provided a basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of risk assessment 
procedures, identifying and assessing the 
risk of material misstatement and determining 
the nature, timings and extent of further 
audit procedures.
On the basis of our risk assessments, 
together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that overall performance 
materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement 
in an individual account or balance) for the 
Group should be 50% of materiality, namely 
GEL 6,100,000. Our objective in adopting 
this approach was to ensure that total 
uncorrected and undetected audit 
differences in all accounts did not  
exceed our materiality level.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to the Committee all audit 
differences in excess of GEL 610,000, as 
well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Following our assessment of the risk of 
material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, our audit scope focused on five 
components which represent the principal 
business units within the Group and 
account for 93% of the Group’s total assets 
and 96% of the Group’s profit before tax. 
Two of these were subject to a full scope 
audit, whilst the remaining three were 
subject to a specific scope audit where  
the extent of audit work was based on  
our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement and of the materiality of 
 the Group’s business operations at that 
location. They were also selected to provide 
an appropriate basis for undertaking  
audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. For the 
remaining components, we performed  
other procedures to confirm there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement  
in the Group financial statements.
The Group audit team operated as an 
integrated primary team involving personnel 
in London and Tbilisi. The Senior Statutory 
Auditor was responsible for the direction, 
supervision, performance and review of the 
audit. This was achieved through a 
schedule of planned visits and regular 
meetings in Tbilisi. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the annual report is: 
 – materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
 – apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 – is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider 
whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during  
the audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and whether 
the annual report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider should 
have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 – the parent Company financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
 – we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review:
 – the Directors’ Statement, set out on 
page 101, in relation to going concern; 
and the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our 
review.

Notes:
1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Bank  
of Georgia Holdings PLC website is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the work  
carried out by the Auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, 
accordingly, the Auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since 
they were initially presented on the website.

the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted the following amended IFRS during the year:
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income – Amendments to IAS 1
The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income. Items that could be reclassified  
to profit or loss at a future point in time now have to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment 
affected presentation only and had no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance.
IAS 1 Clarification of the Requirement for Comparative Information (Amendment)
The amendment to IAS 1 clarifies the difference between voluntary additional comparative information and the minimum required 
comparative information. An entity must include comparative information in the related notes to the financial statements when it voluntarily 
provides comparative information beyond the minimum required comparative period. The additional voluntarily comparative information 
does not need to be presented in a complete set of financial statements.
An opening statement of financial position (known as the third balance sheet) must be presented when an entity applies an accounting 
policy retrospectively, makes retrospective restatements, or reclassifies items in its financial statements, provided any of those changes 
has a material effect on the statement of financial position at the beginning of the preceding period. The amendment clarifies that a third 
balance sheet does not have to be accompanied by comparative information in the related notes.
IAS 32 Tax Effects of Distributions to Holders of Equity Instruments (Amendment)
The amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation clarifies that income taxes arising from distributions to equity holders are 
accounted for in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendment removes existing income tax requirements from IAS 32 and 
requires entities to apply the requirements in IAS 12 to any income tax arising from distributions to equity holders. The amendment did 
not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as there are no tax consequences attached to cash or 
non-cash distribution.

Annual Report 2013
(All amounts are in Thousands of Georgian Lari) IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011) (IAS 19R)
IAS 19R includes a number of amendments to the accounting for 
defined benefit plans, including actuarial gains and losses that are 
now recognised in other comprehensive income and permanently 
excluded from profit and loss; expected returns on plan assets that 
are no longer recognised in profit or loss, instead, there is a 
requirement to recognise interest on the net defined benefit liability 
(asset) in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to 
measure the defined benefit obligation, and; unvested past service 
costs are now recognised in profit or loss at the earlier of when the 
amendment occurs or when the related restructuring or termination 
costs are recognised. Other amendments include new disclosures, 
such as, quantitative sensitivity disclosures. The amendments had 
no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – Offsetting Financial 
Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IFRS 7
The amendment requires an entity to disclose information about 
rights to set off financial instruments and related arrangements.  
The disclosures would provide users with information that is useful 
in evaluating the effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s 
financial position. The new disclosures are required for all recognised 
financial instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32. The 
disclosures also apply to recognised financial instruments that are 
subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar 
agreement, irrespective of whether the financial instruments are  
set off in accordance with IAS 32. As the Group does not offset 
financial instruments in accordance with IAS 32 and does not have 
relevant offsetting arrangements, the amendment does not have  
an impact on the Group.

IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities 
including special purpose entities. IFRS 10 replaces the parts of 
previously existing IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements that dealt with consolidated financial statements and 
SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 changes 
the definition of control such that an investor controls an investee 
when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. To meet the definition 
of control in IFRS 10, all three criteria must be met, including: (a) an 
investor has power over an investee; (b) the investor has exposure, 
or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; 
and (c) the investor has the ability to use its power over the investee 
to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. The Group early 
adopted IFRS 10, which had no impact on the Group’s financial 
position or performance.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 Investment in Associates 
and Joint Ventures
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 
Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary Contributions by 
Venturers. IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly 
controlled entities (JCEs) using proportionate consolidation. 
Instead, JCEs that meet the definition of a joint venture under  
IFRS 11 must be accounted for using the equity method. The 
Group early adopted IFRS 11, which had no impact on the Group’s 
financial position or performance, as it has no joint arrangements.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an 
entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates  
and structured entities. The requirements in IFRS 12 are more 
comprehensive than the previously existing disclosure requirements 
for subsidiaries. For example, where a subsidiary is controlled with 
less than a majority of voting rights. The Group early adopted IFRS 
12, which had no impact on the Group’s financial position or 
performance, as it has no subsidiaries with material non-controlling 
interests or unconsolidated structured entities.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all 
fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity 
is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how  
to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or 
permitted. The application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted 
the fair value measurements carried out by the Group.
IFRS 13 also requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of 
which replace existing disclosure requirements in other standards, 
including IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Some of these 
disclosures affected the consolidated financial statements for 
the period.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation 
or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 
2013. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee  
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over  
the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and  
only if the Group has:
 – power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the 
current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
 – exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement  
with the investee; and
 – the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or  
similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant 
facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power  
over an investee, including:
 – the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of  
the investee;
 – rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
 – the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee  
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to  
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation  
of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over  
the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the 
subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement 
of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control  
until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income 
are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and 
to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries  
to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s 
accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between 
members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 121 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss  
of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group 
loses control over a subsidiary, it 
 – Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of 
the subsidiary.
 – Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling 
interests.
 – Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded 
in equity.
 – Recognises the fair value of the consideration received.
 – Recognises the fair value of any investment retained.
 – Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss.
 – Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or 
retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the 
Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For 
each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure 
the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at 
the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets and 
other components of non-controlling interests at their acquisition 
date fair values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred 
and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial 
assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host 
contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously 
held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value 
and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. It is 
then considered in the determination of goodwill.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer  
will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial 
instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement is measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised either in either profit or loss or  
as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent 
consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in 
accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration  
that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised 
for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the 
net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value 
of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified  
all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews 
the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the 
acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair 
value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition 
date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other 
assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and 
part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying 
amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured 
based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Investments in associates
Associates are entities in which the Group generally has  
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able  
to exercise significant influence, but which it does not control  
or jointly control. Investments in associates are accounted for  
under the equity method and are initially recognised at cost, 
including goodwill. Subsequent changes in the carrying value 
reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of  
net assets of the associate. The Group’s share of its associates’ 
profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement, and its share of movements in reserves is recognised  
in other comprehensive income. However, when the Group’s  
share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest  
in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses,  
unless the Group is obliged to make further payments to, or  
on behalf of, the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its 
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest  
in the associates; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless  
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as trading and 
available-for-sale securities, derivatives and non-financial assets 
such as investment property, at fair value at each balance sheet 
date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at 
amortised cost are disclosed in Note 28.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or  
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset  
or transfer the liability takes place either:
 – in the principal market for the asset or liability; or
 – in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous 
market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible 
by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act 
in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a 
non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability 
to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant that would 
use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure 
fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair 
122
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC

(All amounts are in Thousands of Georgian Lari)
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
 – Level 1 − Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2 − Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable.
 – Level 3 − Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that  
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end  
of each reporting period.
Financial assets
Initial recognition
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. 
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets  
upon initial recognition.
Date of recognition
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are 
recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are 
purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within the period generally established by regulation or convention 
in the marketplace.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are not entered into with the intention of immediate or short-
term resale and are not classified as trading securities or designated 
as investment securities available-for-sale. Such assets are carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. This calculation 
includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that 
are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs 
and all other premiums and discounts. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement when the loans 
and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through  
the amortisation process.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial 
assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified 
in any of the three preceding categories. After initial recognition 
available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with 
gains or losses being recognised in other comprehensive income 
until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain  
or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is 
reclassified to the consolidated income statement. However, 
interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
Measurement of financial instruments at initial recognition
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured 
at fair value, adjusted, in the case of instruments not at fair value 
through profit or loss, for directly attributable fees and costs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial 
recognition is normally the transaction price. If the Group 
determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the 
transaction price, then:
 – If the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active 
market for an identical asset or liability (i.e., a Level 1 input)  
or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from 
observable markets, the Group recognises the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction 
price as a gain or loss.
 – In all other cases, the initial measurement of the financial 
instrument is adjusted to defer the difference between the fair 
value at initial recognition and the transaction price. After initial 
recognition, the Group recognises that deferred difference as a 
gain or loss only when the inputs become observable, or when 
the instrument is derecognised.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount  
is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position  
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, amounts  
due from central banks, excluding obligatory reserves with central 
banks, and amounts due from credit institutions that mature  
within 90 days of the date of origination and are free from 
contractual encumbrances.
Derivative financial instruments
In the normal course of business, the Group enters into various 
derivative financial instruments including forwards, swaps and 
options in the foreign exchange and capital markets. Such financial 
instruments are initially recognised in accordance with the policy for 
initial recognition of financial instruments and are subsequently 
measured at fair value. The fair values are estimated based on 
quoted market prices or pricing models that take into account the 
current market and contractual prices of the underlying instruments 
and other factors. Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair 
value is positive and as liabilities when it is negative. Gains and losses 
resulting from these instruments are included in the consolidated 
income statement as gains less losses from interest rate swaps and 
gains less losses from foreign currencies translation differences, 
depending on the nature of the instrument.
Borrowings
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified  
as liabilities, where the substance of the contractual arrangement 
results in the Group having an obligation either to deliver cash or 
another financial asset to the holder, or to satisfy the obligation other 
than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial 
asset for a fixed number of own equity instruments. Such instruments 
include amounts due to credit institutions and amounts due to 
customers (including promissory notes issued). These are initially 
recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly 
attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement when the borrowings are derecognised as  
well as through the amortisation process.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the 
statement of financial position and the difference between the 
carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 123 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Subordinated debt
Subordinated debt represents long-term funds attracted by the 
Bank on the international financial markets or domestic market.  
The holders of subordinated debt would be subordinate to all other 
creditors to receive repayment of debt in case of the Bank’s 
liquidation. Subordinated debt is carried at amortised cost.
Leases
Finance – Group as lessor
The Group recognises finance lease receivables in the consolidated 
statement of financial position at a value equal to the net investment 
in the lease, starting from the date of commencement of the lease 
term. In calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments 
the discount factor used is the interest rate implicit in the lease. 
Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the 
finance lease receivables. Lease payments received are apportioned 
between the finance income and the reduction of the outstanding 
lease receivable. Finance income is based on a pattern reflecting a 
constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding.
Operating – Group as lessee
Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards of ownership 
are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised 
as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term and 
included into other administrative and operating expenses.
Operating – Group as lessor
The Group presents assets subject to operating leases in the 
consolidated statement of financial position according to the nature 
of the asset. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over  
the lease term as other income. The aggregate cost of incentives 
provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income 
over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Initial direct costs incurred 
specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are added to 
the carrying amount of the leased asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any 
objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be 
impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment  
as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset (an incurred “loss event”), and that loss 
event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash  
flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that  
can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include 
indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing 
significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or 
principal payments; the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or 
other financial reorganisation; and where observable data indicate 
that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash 
flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that 
correlate with defaults.
Amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and 
finance lease receivables
For amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and 
finance lease receivables carried at amortised cost, the Group first 
assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment 
exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, 
or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. 
If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment 
exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant 
or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with 
similar credit risks characteristics and collectively assesses them 
for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment 
and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised 
are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit 
losses that have not yet been incurred). The carrying amount of  
the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced 
carrying amount based on the original effective interest rate of the 
asset. Loans together with the associated allowance are written  
off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all 
collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the Group.  
If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment 
loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance 
account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is 
credited to the consolidated income statement.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted 
at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a 
variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment 
loss is the current effective interest rate. The calculation of the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised 
financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from 
foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, 
whether or not foreclosure is probable.
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial 
assets are grouped on the basis of the Group’s internal credit 
grading system that considers credit risk characteristics such  
as asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, 
past-due status and other relevant factors.
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively 
evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of historical  
loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar  
to those in the group. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the 
basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current 
conditions that did not affect the years on which the historical  
loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in 
the historical period that do not exist currently. Estimates of changes 
in future cash flows reflect, and are consistent with, changes in 
related observable data from year to year (such as changes in 
unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices, payment 
124

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED status, or other factors that are indicative of incurred losses in the 
group or their magnitude). The methodology and assumptions used 
for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any 
differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Write-off of loans to customers
All retail loans, except mortgages, are written off when overdue  
by more than 365 days. Retail mortgage loans are written off  
when overdue by more than 150 days. Write-off of corporate  
loans overdue by more than 150 days is subject to management 
discretion and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into 
account the current and expected positions of the loan/borrower.
Available-for-sale financial assets
For available-for-sale financial investments, the Group assesses  
at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an 
investment or a group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, 
objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline 
in the fair value of the investment below its cost. Where there is 
evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, 
less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised 
in the consolidated income statement – is reclassified from other 
comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement. 
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through 
the consolidated income statement; increases in their fair value 
after impairment are recognised in other comprehensive income.
In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, 
impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial 
assets carried at amortised cost. Future interest income is based 
on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of 
interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of 
measuring the impairment loss. The interest income is recorded in 
the consolidated income statement. If, in a subsequent year, the  
fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be 
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised in the consolidated income statement, the 
impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated 
income statement.
Renegotiated loans
Renegotiated loans comprise carrying amount of financial assets 
that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have 
been renegotiated.
Where possible, the Group seeks to restructure loans rather than  
to take possession of collateral. This may involve extending the 
payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions.
The accounting treatment of such restructuring is as follows:
 – If the currency of the loan has been changed the old loan is 
derecognised and the new loan is recognised.
 – If the loan restructuring is not caused by the financial difficulties 
of the borrower the Group uses the same approach as for the 
modification of financial liabilities described below.
 – If the loan restructuring is due to the financial difficulties  
of the borrower and the loan is impaired after restructuring,  
the Group recognises the difference between the present value 
of the new cash flows discounted using the original effective 
interest rate and the carrying amount before restructuring in  
the provision charges for the period. In cases where the loan  
is not impaired after restructuring, the Group recalculates the 
effective interest rate.
Once the terms have been renegotiated, the loan is no longer 
considered past due. Management continuously reviews renegotiated 
loans to ensure that all criteria are met and that future payments are 
likely to occur. The loans continue to be subject to an individual or 
collective impairment assessment, calculated using the loan’s 
original or current effective interest rate.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or 
part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:
 – the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
 – the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset, or retained the right to receive cash flows from the 
asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and
 – the Group either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,  
but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows 
from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the 
asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the 
form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or 
purchased option (including a cash-settled option or similar 
provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s 
continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that 
the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put 
option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on an 
asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred 
asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Overview 1-9 Strategic Review 10-27 Performance 28-63 Governance 64-103 Financial Statements 104-182 Additional Information 183-188
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 125 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability  
and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Financial guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the Group gives financial 
guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, guarantees and 
acceptances. Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements at fair value, in “Other liabilities”, 
being the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
Group’s liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher  
of the amortised premium and the best estimate of expenditure 
required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of 
the guarantee.
Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken 
to the consolidated income statement. The premium received is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the guarantee.
Taxation
The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with 
the regulations in force in the respective territories in which the 
Bank and its Subsidiaries operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of 
temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred income 
taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between  
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for 
financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income  
tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit  
nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected  
to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising 
on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Georgia and Belarus also have various operating taxes that are 
assessed on the Group’s activities. These taxes are included as  
a component of other operating expenses.
Investment properties
Investment property is land or building or a part of a building held 
to earn rental income or for capital appreciation and which is not 
used by the Group or held for the sale in the ordinary course of 
business. Property that is being constructed or developed or 
redeveloped for future use as investment property is also classified 
as investment property.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including 
transaction costs, and subsequently remeasured at fair value 
reflecting market conditions at the end of the reporting period.  
Fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on  
the basis of various sources including reports of independent 
appraisers, who hold a recognised and relevant professional 
qualification and who have recent experience in valuation of 
property of similar location and category.
Investment property that is being redeveloped for continuing  
use as investment property or for which the market has  
become less active continues to be measured at fair value.  
Earned rental income is recorded in the income statement  
within other operating income. Gains and losses resulting  
from changes in the fair value of investment property are  
recorded in the income statement and presented as net gains  
or losses from revaluation of investment properties.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable  
that future economic benefits associated with it will flow to the 
Group and the cost can be measured reliably. All other repairs  
and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. If an 
investment property becomes owner-occupied, it is reclassified  
to premises and equipment, and its carrying amount at the  
date of reclassification becomes its deemed cost to be 
subsequently depreciated.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment, except for office buildings and service 
centres, is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of 
replacing part of equipment when that cost is incurred if the 
recognition criteria are met. Office buildings and service centres  
are measured at fair value less depreciation and impairment 
charged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Following initial recognition at cost, office buildings and service 
centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value  
at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 
Valuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that the  
fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its 
carrying amount.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated 
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount 
is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Any revaluation 
surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve for property and 
equipment included in other comprehensive income, except to the 
extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset 
previously recognised in the consolidated income statement, in 
which case the increase is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. A revaluation deficit is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous 
surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in 
the revaluation reserve for property and equipment.
An annual transfer from the revaluation reserve for property and 
equipment to retained earnings is made for the difference between 
depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the assets 
and depreciation based on the assets original cost. Additionally, 
accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated 
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount 
is restated to the devalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal, any 
revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is 
transferred to retained earnings.
Depreciation of an asset, including assets under construction, 
commences from the date the asset is ready and available for use. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following 
estimated useful lives:
Years
Office buildings Up to 100
Hospitals and clinics Up to 100
Furniture and fixtures 10
Computers and office equipment 5
Motor vehicles 5
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, 
and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the life of the related 
leased asset.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred 
and included in other operating expenses, unless they qualify 
for capitalisation.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured  
at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the 
Group’s net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
Goodwill on an acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible 
assets. Goodwill on an acquisition of an associate is included in the 
investments in associates. Following initial recognition, goodwill is 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently  
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-
generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of 
the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit 
or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated:
 – represents the lowest level within the Group at which the 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and
 – is not larger than a segment as defined in IFRS 8 
“Operating Segments”.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units), to which 
the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit (group of cash-generating units) is less than the 
carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment 
losses cannot be reversed in future periods.
Intangible assets
The Group’s intangible assets include computer software 
and licences.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at  
cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. The economic lives of intangible assets are 
assessed to be finite and amortised over four to 10 years and 
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that  
the intangible asset may be impaired. Amortisation periods  
and methods for intangible assets are reviewed at least at  
each financial year-end.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs 
are recorded as an expense as incurred. Software development 
costs (relating to the design and testing of new or substantially 
improved software) are recognised as intangible assets only when 
the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing 
the software so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention 
to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will 
generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to 
complete and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during 
the development. Other software development costs are 
recognised as an expense as incurred.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 127 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Insurance and reinsurance receivables
Insurance and reinsurance receivables are recognised based upon 
insurance policy terms and measured at cost. The carrying value of 
insurance and reinsurance receivables is reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded 
in the consolidated statement of income.
Reinsurance receivables primarily include balances due from  
both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance 
liabilities. Premiums on reinsurance assumed are recognised as 
revenue in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance 
were considered direct business, taking into account the product 
classification of the reinsured business. Amounts due to reinsurers 
are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated reinsured 
policies and in accordance with the reinsurance contract. 
Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on  
a gross basis.
An impairment review is performed on all reinsurance assets when 
an indication of impairment occurs. Reinsurance receivables are 
impaired only if there is objective evidence that the Group may not 
receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract that 
this can be measured reliably.
Insurance liabilities
General insurance liabilities
General insurance contract liabilities are based on the estimated 
ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the reporting 
date, whether reported or not, together with related claims-handling 
costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage and other 
recoveries. Significant delays can be experienced in the notification 
and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, 
particularly in respect of liability business, environmental and 
pollution exposures – therefore, the ultimate cost of which cannot 
be known with certainty at the reporting date.
Provision for unearned premiums
The proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable 
to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as 
unearned premium. The change in the provision for unearned 
premium is taken to the consolidated income statement in order 
that revenue is recognised over the period of risk or, for annuities, 
the amount of expected future benefit payments.
Liability adequacy test
At each reporting date, a liability adequacy test is performed, to 
ensure the adequacy of unearned premiums net of related deferred 
acquisition costs. In performing the test, current best estimates  
of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and policy 
administration expenses, as well as investment income from assets 
backing such liabilities, are used. Any inadequacy is immediately 
charged to the consolidated income statement by establishing an 
unexpired risk provision.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the 
amount of obligation can be made.
Provisions for the risk of incurring losses on off-balance sheet 
commitments is estimated regularly based on the past history  
of actual losses incurred on these commitments.
Retirement and other employee benefit obligations
The Group provides management and employees of the Group  
with private pension plans. These are defined contribution pension 
plans covering substantially all full-time employees of the Group.  
The Group collects contributions in the size of 2% of full-time 
employees’ salaries, of which 1% is deducted from the salaries and 
the other 1% – additionally paid by the Group. When an employee 
reaches the pension age, aggregated contributions, plus any 
earnings earned on the employee’s behalf, are paid to the employee 
according to the schedule agreed with the employee. Aggregated 
amounts are distributed during the period when the employee will 
receive accumulated contributions. Respective pension benefit 
obligations are recorded within other liabilities, Note 16.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive  
share-based remuneration, whereby employees render 
services as consideration for the equity instruments 
(“equity-settled transactions”).
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together  
with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on 
the date when the relevant employee is fully entitled to the award 
(“the vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that  
will ultimately vest. The consolidated income statement charge  
or credit for the period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for the awards that do not ultimately  
vest, except for the awards where vesting is conditional upon 
market conditions (a condition linked to the price of BGH’s shares) 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the 
minimum expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification 
which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment 
arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it  
has vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a 
new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as the replacement award on the date that it is granted, the 
cancelled and the new awards are treated as if they were a 
modification of the original award, as described in the 
previous paragraph.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Share capital
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business 
combination, are shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity. 
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par 
value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Treasury shares
Where BGH or its subsidiaries purchase BGH’s shares, the 
consideration paid, including any attributable transaction costs,  
net of income taxes, is deducted from total equity as treasury 
shares until they are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares  
are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received  
is included in equity. Treasury shares are stated at par value,  
with adjustment of premiums against additional paid-in capital.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity  
at the reporting date only if they are declared before or on the 
reporting date. Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed 
before the reporting date or proposed or declared after the 
reporting date but before the consolidated financial statements  
are authorised for issue.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position but are disclosed unless the possibility 
of any outflow in settlement is remote. A contingent asset is not 
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but 
disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Income and expense recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must 
also be met before revenue and expense is recognised:
Interest and similar income and expense
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and 
interest bearing securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, 
interest income or expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial 
instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net 
carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The 
calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes any 
fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the 
instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but 
not future credit losses. The carrying amount of the financial asset 
or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of 
payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated 
based on the original effective interest rate and the change in 
carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense.
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar 
financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, 
interest income continues to be recognised using the original 
effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.
Fee and commission income
The Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range 
of services it provides to its customers. Fee income can be divided 
into the following two categories:
Fee income earned from services that are provided over a 
certain period of time
Fees earned for the provision of services over a period of time are 
accrued over that period. These fees include commission incomes 
and asset management, custody and other management and 
advisory fees. Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to  
be drawn down and other credit-related fees are deferred (together 
with any incremental costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the 
effective interest rate on the loan.
Fee income from providing transaction services
Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation  
of a transaction for a third party – such as the arrangement of the 
acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale  
of businesses – are recognised on completion of the underlying 
transaction. Fees or components of fees that are linked to a certain 
performance are recognised after fulfilling the corresponding criteria.
Dividend income
Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the 
payment is established.
Insurance premium income
For non-life insurance business, premiums written are recognised 
at policy inception and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of 
the related policy coverage. Estimates of premiums written as at 
the reporting date but not yet received are assessed based on 
estimates from underwriting or past experience, and are included  
in premiums earned.
Insurance claims
General insurance claims incurred include all claim losses occurring 
during the year, whether reported or not, including the related 
handling costs and reduction for the value of salvage and other 
recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from 
previous years.
Healthcare revenue
Healthcare revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured on an accruals basis. When services are 
provided in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the revenue 
is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, 
adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalent transferred. 
When the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be 
measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
goods of services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash  
or cash equivalents transferred.
Revenue from sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods comprises revenue from sale of  
a developed real estate property and other finished goods.
Revenue from sale of a developed real estate property is 
recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership  
of the real estate have been transferred to the buyer.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 129 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Revenue from the sale of other finished goods is recognised when 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have 
passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.
Continuous transfer of work in progress is applied when: (a) the 
buyer controls the work in progress, typically when the land on 
which the development is taking place is owned by the final 
customer; and (b) all significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the work in progress in its present state are transferred to the buyer 
as construction progresses, typically when the buyer cannot put 
the incomplete property back to the Group. In such situations, the 
percentage of work completed is measured based on the costs 
incurred up until the end of the reporting period as a proportion  
of total costs expected to be incurred.
Functional, reporting currencies and foreign 
currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Georgian  
Lari, which is the Group’s presentation currency. BGH’s functional 
currency is British Pound Sterling. The Bank’s functional currency  
is US Dollar. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional 
currency and items included in the financial statements of each  
entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions  
in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, 
converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated into the functional currency at the functional currency rate 
of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Gains and losses resulting 
from the translation of foreign currency transactions are recognised  
in the consolidated income statement as gains less losses from 
foreign currencies – translation differences. Non-monetary items  
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency  
are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when  
the fair value was determined.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a certain 
transaction and the NBG exchange rate on the date of the 
transaction are included in gains less losses from foreign currencies 
(dealing). The official NBG exchange rates at 31 December 2013, 
31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 were:
Lari to 
GBP
Lari to

31 December 2011 2.5776 1.6703 2.1614 2.0905 2.0004
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the entities 
whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency 
of the Group are translated into Georgian Lari at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the reporting date and, their income statements are 
translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The 
exchange differences arising on the translation are taken to other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a subsidiary or an associate 
whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency 
of the Group, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other 
comprehensive income relating to that particular entity is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and 
any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operations and translated at closing rate.
Hyperinflation accounting
With effect from 1 January 2011, the Belarusian economy has been 
considered to be hyperinflationary in accordance with the criteria  
in IAS 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” 
(IAS 29). The standard requires that the financial statements 
prepared in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy be stated 
in terms of the measuring unit current at the reporting date.
In applying IAS 29, the Bank’s subsidiaries in Belarus, JSC 
Belarusky Narodny Bank (BNB) and BNB Leasing, LLC, have used 
conversion factors derived from the Belarusian consumer price 
index (CPI), published by the State Committee on Statistics of the 
Republic of Belarus. The CPIs for the six-year period and respective 
conversion factors after Belarus previously ceased to be 
considered hyperinflationary on 1 January 2006 are as follows:
Year Index, %
Conversion 
Factors
2006 106.6  455.0 
2007 112.1  406.3 
2008 113.3  358.2 
2009 110.1  326.0 
2010 109.9  296.3 
2011 208.7  142.0 
2012 121.8  116.6 
2013 116.6  100.0 
All income and expenses, profits and losses are recalculated by 
applying the relevant adjustment factors. Monetary assets and 
liabilities are not recalculated because they are already expressed 
in terms of the monetary unit current as at the reporting date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities (items which are not already 
expressed in terms of the monetary unit current as at the reporting 
date) are recalculated by applying the relevant index. The effect of 
inflation on BNB’s net non-monetary position is included in the 
income statement in net non-operating expenses.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Standards and interpretations that are issued but not 
yet effective
Up to the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements, 
certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards have been published that are not yet effective for the 
current reporting period and which the Group has not early 
adopted, as follows:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
FRS 9, as issued, reflects two of the three phases of the IASB 
project on replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and 
measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and hedge 
accounting. Mandatory effective date will not be before 2017, and 
has been tentatively decided as 2018. Classification of the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities may be changed as a result of the 
implementation. The Group will quantify the effect when the 
remaining part of the standard containing guidance on impairment 
of financial assets is issued.
Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and 
IAS 27)
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2014 provide an exception to the consolidation 
requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment 
entity under IFRS 10. The exception to consolidation requires 
investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair value through 
profit or loss. These amendments are not expected to be relevant 
to the Group.
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32
These amendments clarify the meaning of “currently has a legally 
enforceable right to set off” and the criteria for non-simultaneous 
settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting. 
These are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2014. These amendments are not expected to be 
relevant to the Group.
IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies (IFRIC 21)
IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy  
when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the  
relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon 
reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that  
no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum 
threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014. These amendments are  
not expected to be relevant to the Group.
IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge 
Accounting – Amendments to IAS 39
These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge 
accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging 
instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments are effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. These 
amendments will not have an impact on the Group, since the 
Group does not apply hedge accounting.
4. Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the 
Board of Directors and management use their judgement and  
make estimates in determining the amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements. The most significant judgements 
and estimates are as follows:
Fair value of financial instruments
Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position cannot 
be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety 
of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical 
models. The input to these models is taken from observable 
markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree  
of judgement is required in establishing fair values.
Measurement of fair value of investment properties and 
property and equipment
The fair value of investment properties and office buildings and 
service centres included in property and equipment is determined 
by independent professionally qualified appraisers. Fair value is 
determined using a combination of the internal capitalisation 
method (also known as discounted future cash flow method) and 
the sales comparison method.
The estimates described above are subject to change as new 
transaction data and market evidence become available.
Allowance for impairment of loans and receivables and 
finance lease receivables
The Group regularly reviews its loans and receivables and finance 
lease receivables to assess impairment. The Group uses its 
judgement to estimate the amount of any impairment loss in  
cases where a borrower is in financial difficulties and there are few 
available sources of historical data relating to similar borrowers. 
Similarly, the Group estimates changes in future cash flows based 
on the observable data indicating that there has been an adverse 
change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national 
or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets 
in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss 
experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective 
evidence of impairment similar to those in the group of loans and 
receivables. The Group uses its judgement to adjust observable 
data for a group of loans or receivables to reflect current 
circumstances.
The Group considers the fair value of collateral when estimating the 
amount of impairment loss for collateralised loans and receivables 
and finance lease receivables. Management monitors market value 
of collateral on a regular basis. Management uses its experienced 
judgement or independent opinion to adjust the fair value to reflect 
current circumstances. The amount and type of collateral required 
depends on the assessment of credit risk of the counterparty.
In order to exclude post 2008 Georgia-Russia war and global 
financial crisis extraordinary trends from the assessment of 
collective impairment of loans, the Bank amended its approach  
in 2012. Namely, the historical loss rates that are applied for 
collective impairment are now calculated based on three-year 
history of net losses (including reversals) as opposed to five-seven-
year history of net losses under previous approach. The impact of 
this change on profit from continuing operations before income tax 
expense for the year ended 31 December 2012 is GEL 20.1 million.

The net cash outflow on acquisition was as follows:
2013
Cash paid  7,810 
Cash acquired with the subsidiary  – 
Net cash outflow 7,810 
1. No impairment for loans and receivables, gross amounts equal fair values and are expected to be fully collected.
2. Consideration comprised of GEL 510 pre-existing loan to Caraps Medline LLC and cash payments of GEL 7,810.
The Group decided to increase its presence and investment in Tbilisi healthcare market, by acquiring the clinic, thus securing a leading 
position in the growing healthcare sector. Management considers that the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
As the acquisition date is 31 December 2013, no revenue or profit comes from the Acquiree in the year ended 31 December 2013. If the 
combination had taken place at the beginning of the period the Group would have recorded GEL 553,351 and GEL 208,407 of revenue 
and profit respectively.
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill on acquisition was the 
positive synergy brought into the Group’s operations. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Since Caraps Medline LLC was acquired at the reporting date, the Group had limited time to review, analyse and perform valuation of  
the respective net assets as well as amount of goodwill. Therefore the net assets as well as the amount of goodwill presented above  
are estimated provisionally as at the reporting date. The Group continues thorough full examination of these net assets and if identified, 
proper adjustments will be made to the net assets and amount of the goodwill during the 12-month period from the acquisition date, as 
allowed by “Business Combinations” (IFRS 3). However, as at the reporting date management believes that materially all factors of the 
business combination have been captured and the estimates are materially correct.

GEL 18,170 (2012: GEL 13,844, 2011: GEL 14,914).
Collateral and other credit enhancements
The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. Guidelines are implemented 
regarding the acceptability of types of collateral and valuation parameters.
The main types of collateral obtained are as follows:
 – For commercial lending, charges over real estate properties, equipment and machinery, corporate shares, inventory, trade receivables 
and third-party corporate guarantees.
 – For retail lending, mortgages over residential properties, cars, gold and jewellery, and third-party corporate guarantees.
Management requests additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement and monitors the market value of collateral 
obtained during its review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan impairment.
It is the Group’s policy to dispose of repossessed properties in an orderly fashion. The proceeds are used to reduce or repay the 
outstanding claim. In general, the Group does not occupy repossessed properties for business use.
Concentration of loans to customers
As at 31 December 2013, the concentration of loans granted by the Group to the 10 largest third-party borrowers comprised 
GEL 610,916 accounting for 17% of the gross loan portfolio of the Group (2012: GEL 544,466 and 17% respectively, 2011: GEL 402,989 
and 15% respectively). An allowance of GEL 22,740 (2012: GEL 20,702, 2011: GEL 7,033) was established against these loans.
As at 31 December 2013, the concentration of loans granted by the Group to the 10 largest third-party group of borrowers comprised 
GEL 912,106 accounting for 25% of the gross loan portfolio of the Group (2012: GEL 791,529 and 25% respectively, 2011: GEL 523,401 
and 20% respectively). An allowance of GEL 9,345 (2012: GEL 7,118, 2011: GEL 10,980) was established against these loans.

Premises of the Group are subject to revaluation on a regular basis. The date of latest revaluation is 31 December 2013. As at 31 December 
2012 and 31 December 2011 the Group analysed market prices for its premises and concluded that the market price of premises was not 
materially different from their carrying value. Refer to Note 28 for details on fair value measurements of the Group’s premises.
If the office buildings and service centres had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts of the office buildings and 
service centres as at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 would have been as follows:
2013 2012 2011

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 147 14. Goodwill (continued)
The impairment charge of goodwill in 2012 was in respect of JSC Intertour – GEL 655. The impairment charge of goodwill in 2011 was  
in respect of JSC Belarusky Narodny Bank – GEL 23,394. The main reason for impairment was insufficient future operating cash flows 
expected to be received per the forecasts of the respective cash-generating units.
Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations with indefinite lives have been allocated to five individual cash-generating units (CGUs), 
which are also reportable segments, for impairment testing: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking, Insurance, Healthcare and Liberty Consumer.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units is as follows:
2013 2012 2011
Insurance 19,601  19,601  19,119 
Retail Banking  12,433  12,433  12,433 
Corporate Banking  9,965  9,965  9,965 
Liberty Consumer 3,439  3,438  4,458 
Healthcare 3,282  220  220 
Total  48,720  45,657  46,195 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering from one- to three-year periods. Discount rates  
were not adjusted for either a constant or a declining growth rate beyond the three-year periods covered in financial budgets. For  
the purposes of the impairment test, a 0% permanent growth rate has been assumed when assessing the future operating cash flows  
of the cash-generating units.
The following rates were used by the Group for corporate banking and Retail Banking:

Discount rates
Discount rates reflect management’s estimate of Return of Capital Employed (ROCE) required in each business. This is the benchmark used  
by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future investment proposals. Discount rates are calculated by using Weighted 
Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
The Lari exchange rate towards other currencies has been assumed to be stable during the forecast period, with a steady immaterial 
depreciation, based on the prior years’ trends, in line with macroeconomic expectations. 
A moderate, stable 6% growth of real GDP was assumed, based on the Government’s and IMF forecasts. 
No change in market share was assumed. 
For the Insurance CGU, the following additional assumptions were made over the first three-year period of the business plan: 
 – Further synergies between Insurance and Healthcare businesses will increase cost efficiency and further improve operating leverage. 
 – Termination of the state-funded insurance programmes through private insurance companies (partly in April 2014 and partly in July 2014).
 – Growth of other (non-state-funded) insurance business lines through an increased market demand and economic growth. 
For the Retail and Corporate Banking CGUs, the following additional assumptions were made: 
 – Stable, business-as-usual growth of loans and deposits, in line with the 6% real GDP growth. 
 – No material changes in Cost to Income structure or ratio. 
 – Stable, business-as-usual growth of trade finance and other documentary businesses, in line with the 6% real GDP growth. 
 – Further expansion of the Express Banking businesses bringing more stable margins to Retail Banking.

Management believes that reasonable possible changes in key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of segments will 
not result in an impairment of goodwill.

The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rates. As at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 and

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 149 15. Taxation (continued)
Applicable taxes in Georgia and Belarus include corporate income tax (profit tax), individuals’ withholding taxes, property tax and 
value-added tax, among others. However, regulations are often unclear or nonexistent and few precedents have been established. This 
creates tax risks in Georgia and Belarus, substantially more significant than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems. 
Management believes that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations. However, the risk remains that 
relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretative issues.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 and their movements for the

**  603,170 is the number of JSC Bank of Georgia shares that were not converted into Bank of Georgia Holdings Plc shares during the Tender Offer.
***  GEL 943 is the nominal value of 35,909,383 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC shares translated in GEL with the share conversion date official exchange rate.
On 24 February 2012, EBRD and the International Finance Centre (IFC) utilised the convertibility feature and converted US$49,903 of their 
loans to the Bank into the Bank’s shares (Note 18). The total number of ordinary shares issued under this transaction comprised 3,635,006.
On 28 February 2012 the Group completed the Tender Offer, under which 35,909,383 of the Bank’s shares then outstanding (or 98.35%) 
were converted into 35,909,383 shares of BGH (Note 1).
The share capital of the Group was paid by the shareholders in Georgian Lari. They were entitled to dividends in Georgian Lari before the 
Tender Offer and are entitled to dividends in British Pounds Sterling after the Tender Offer.
Capital Reduction
Following the Admission (Note 1), the Directors of BGH undertook a reduction of capital in order to create distributable reserves for BGH. 
The original difference between the nominal value of BGH’s shares and the fair value of the Bank’s shares was credited to the merger 
reserve created in connection with the Tender Offer. It was the intention of BGH’s Directors that the maximum amount of distributable 
reserves should be created and therefore any merger reserve created in connection with the Tender Offer was capitalised into Class A 
shares. The Class A shares were allotted pro rata to holders of BGH shares. BGH Directors implemented a court-approved reduction of 
capital which reduced the original (Tender Offer) nominal value of BGH shares and cancelled all the Class A shares in issue resulting from 
the capitalisation of the merger reserve.
BGH shares had an original (Tender Offer) nominal value of £6.00 per share. Following the reduction of capital the nominal value of BGH 
shares was reduced to £0.01. Reduction of the capital created a new reserve on the statement of financial position of BGH (comprising 
the reduction of the original nominal value from £6.00 to £0.01 per share plus aggregate nominal amount of all of the Class A shares 
which were cancelled). The reduction of capital is a legal and accounting adjustment and did not, of itself, have any direct impact on the 
market value of BGH shares.
As a result of the capital reduction in BGH, the Group’s total additional paid-in capital outstanding at the time became distributable to the 
shareholders and was fully reclassified to retained earnings.
Treasury shares
The number of treasury shares held by the Group as at 31 December 2013 comprised 1,973,376 (31 December 2012: 2,576,747, 
31 December 2011: 3,146,140).
Treasury shares of GEL 56 as at 31 December 2013 comprise the Group’s shares owned by the Group (31 December 2012: GEL 69, 
31 December 2011: GEL 1,208).
During the year ended 31 December 2011, an increase in share capital of GEL 1,500 was made for future share-based compensation 
purposes. As a result, treasury shares amounting to GEL 1,938 as at 31 December 2011 were kept by the Group’s custodian – Abacus 
Corporate Trustee Limited, acting as the trustee of the Group. Starting 20 February 2012, all shares of the Bank kept by Abacus 
Corporate Trustee Limited were converted into the Group’s shares.

Their conversion decreased earnings per share from continuing operations. However, it also reduced the Group’s interest expense on 
these debt instruments and increased the total profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group.

27. Risk Management
Introduction
Risk is inherent in the Group’s activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, 
subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Group’s continuing profitability and each 
individual within the Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Group is exposed to credit  
risk, liquidity risk and market risk, the latter being subdivided into trading and non-trading risks. It is also subject to operational risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. 
They are monitored through the Group’s strategic planning process.
Risk management structure
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is an independent body and is directly monitored by the Board. It has the overall responsibility for developing and 
implementation of overall risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies, principles, frameworks, policies and limits. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for the fundamental risk issues and manages and monitors relevant risk decisions covering, but not limited to: 
macroeconomic and environmental risks, general control environment, manual and application controls, risks of intentionally or 
unintentional misstatements, risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets, information security, anti-money laundering, information 
technology risks, etc.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013 161 27. Risk Management (continued)
Management Board
The Management Board has the responsibility to monitor and manage entire risk process within the Group, on a regular basis, by 
assigning tasks, creating different executive committees, designing and setting up risk management policies and procedures as well  
as respective guidelines and controlling their implementation and performance of relevant departments and committees.
Bank Asset and Liability Management Committee
The Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is the core risk management body. It is responsible for managing the 
Bank’s assets and liabilities, all risks associated with them as well as overall financial structure of the Group. It is also primarily responsible 
for the funding, capital adequacy risk, liquidity risks and market risks of the Bank.
Internal audit
Risk management processes throughout the Group are audited annually by the internal audit function that examines both the adequacy 
of the procedures and the Group’s compliance with the procedures. Internal audit discusses the results of all assessments with 
management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Audit Committee.
Risk measurement and reporting systems
The Group’s risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and 
unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models. The models make use of 
probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Group runs three different basic 
scenarios, of which one is Base Case (forecast under normal business conditions) and the other two are Troubled and Distressed 
Scenarios, which are worse and the worst case scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events which are 
unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group. These limits reflect the business strategy 
and market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected 
industries. In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk-bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure 
across all risks types and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify early risks. This 
information is presented and explained to the Management Board and the head of each business division. The reports include aggregate 
credit exposures and their limits, exceptions to those limits, liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and 
changes to the risk profile. Senior management assesses the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly basis.  
The Management Board receives a comprehensive Credit Risk report and ALCO report once a month. These reports are designed to 
provide all the necessary information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group.
For all levels throughout the Group, specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed in order to ensure that all business 
divisions have access to extensive, relevant and up-to-date information.
A daily briefing is given to the Management Board and all other relevant employees of the Group on the utilisation of market limits, 
proprietary investments and liquidity, plus any other risk developments.
Risk mitigation
As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures resulting from changes  
in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity risks, credit risks, and exposures arising from forecast transactions. While these are intended 
for hedging, these do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The Group actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks, see below for more detail.
Excessive risk concentration
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic 
region, or these counterparties represent related parties to each other, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability  
to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations also involve 
combined, aggregate exposures of large and significant credits compared to the total outstanding balance of the respective financial 
instrument. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry  
or geographical location.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus  
on maintaining a diversified portfolio of both, financial assets as well as financial liabilities. Identified concentrations of credit risks  
or liquidity/repayment risks are controlled and managed accordingly.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013
(All amounts are in Thousands of Georgian Lari) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties failed to discharge their contractual 
obligations. The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual 
counterparties and for geographical, industry, product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to 
such limits.
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of 
counterparties, including regular collateral revisions. Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, 
which assigns each counterparty a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take 
corrective action.
Derivative financial instruments
Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as recorded in the 
statement of the financial position.
Credit-related commitments risks
The Group makes available to its customers guarantees which may require that the Group make payments on their behalf. Such 
payments are collected from customers based on the terms of the letter of credit. They expose the Group to similar risks to loans  
and these are mitigated by the same control processes and policies.
Credit quality per class of financial assets
The credit quality of financial assets is managed by the Group through internal credit ratings. The table below shows the credit quality  
by class of asset for loan-related lines in the statement of financial position, based on the Group’s credit rating system.

Past due loans to customers, analysed by age below, include those that are past due by not more than a few days. These loans are 
not impaired.
It is the Group’s policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio. This facilitates focused management  
of the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. The rating 
system is supported by a variety of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk. All internal risk 
ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Group’s rating policy. Attributable risk ratings are 
assessed and updated regularly.
The credit risk assessment policy for non-past due and individually non-impaired financial assets has been determined by the Group 
as follows:
 – A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due no more than 30 days 
is assessed as a financial asset with High Grade.
 – A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 30 but less 
than 60 days is assessed as a financial asset with Standard Grade.
 – A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 60 days  
or borrower of this loan has at least an additional borrowing in past due more than 60 days as at reporting date is assessed as a 
financial asset with Sub-Standard Grade.

Impairment assessment
The main considerations for the loan impairment assessment include whether any payments of principal or interest are overdue by any 
number of days or there are any known difficulties in the cash flows of counterparties, credit rating downgrades, or infringement of the 
original terms of the contract. The Group addresses impairment assessment in two areas: individually assessed allowances and 
collectively assessed allowances. Loans are considered to be individually impaired if they are past due by more than only a few days  
or there are clear indications that the borrower already faces business, financial or other type of problems that hinder its/his/her ability  
to serve contractual obligations with the Group. Impairment for all such loans is assessed individually, rather than applying standard 
collective impairment rates based on just prior history of losses of the Group.
Individually assessed allowances
For loan loss allowance determination purposes the Group considers all individually significant loans and classifies them between being 
individually impaired or not impaired. The allowance for those individually significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired, 
see definition above, is determined through individual assessment of the associated credit risk by assigning a proper credit rating. The 
allowances for non-significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired, see definition above, are also individually assessed. 
The allowance for losses for individually significant loans that are determined not to be individually impaired is assessed through the 
collective assessment approach described below. Items considered when determining allowance amounts include the sustainability of 
the counterparty’s business plan, its ability to improve performance once a financial difficulty has arisen, projected receipts and the 
expected dividend payout should bankruptcy ensue, the availability of other financial support and the realisable value of collateral, the 
timing of the expected cash flows and past history of the debt service of the borrower. Impairment losses are evaluated at each reporting 
date, unless unforeseen circumstances require more careful attention.
Collectively assessed allowances
Allowances are assessed collectively for all loans (including but not limited to credit cards, residential mortgages, and unsecured 
consumer lending, commercial lending, etc.), both, significant as well as non-significant, where there is not yet objective evidence  
of individual impairment, see definition above. Allowances are evaluated on each reporting date with each portfolio receiving a 
separate review.
The collective assessment takes into account the impairment that is likely to be present in the portfolio even though there is not yet 
objective evidence of the impairment in an individual assessment. Impairment losses are estimated by taking into consideration the 
following information: historical losses on the portfolio, current economic conditions, the appropriate delay between the time a loss is 
likely to have been incurred and the time it will be identified as requiring an individually assessed impairment allowance, and expected 
receipts and recoveries once impaired. Local management is responsible for deciding the length of this period which can extend for as 
long as one year, depending on a product. The impairment allowance is then reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with 
the Group’s overall policy.
Financial guarantees and letters of credit are assessed and provision is made in a similar manner as for loans.

Liquidity risk and funding management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and stress 
circumstances. To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its core deposit base, manages 
assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis. This incorporates an assessment of expected 
cash flows and the availability of high grade collateral which could be used to secure additional funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen 
interruption of cash flow. The Group also has committed lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs. In addition, the Group 
maintains a cash deposit (obligatory reserve) with the NBG, the amount of which depends on the level of customer funds attracted.
The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Group primarily on a stand-alone Bank basis, based on certain liquidity ratios 
established by the NBG. As at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 these ratios were as follows:
2013, % 2012, % 2011, %
Average Liquidity ratio 42.3% 40.0% 36.9%
Maximum Liquidity ratio 48.1% 49.1% 47.2%
Minimum Liquidity ratio 35.5% 31.1% 29.6%
The average Liquidity ratio is calculated on a stand-alone basis for JSC Bank of Georgia as the annual average (arithmetic mean) of daily 
Liquidity ratios, computed as the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities determined by the National Bank of Georgia as follows:
Liquid assets comprise cash, cash equivalents and other assets that are immediately convertible into cash. Those assets include 
investment securities issued by the Georgian Government plus Certificates of Deposit issued by NBG and do not include amounts due 
from credit institutions, other than inter-bank deposits, and/or debt securities of Governments and Central Banks of non-OECD countries, 
amounts in nostro accounts which are under lien, impaired inter-bank deposits and amounts on obligatory reserve with NBG that are 
pledged due to borrowings from NBG.
Liabilities comprise the total balance sheet liabilities, less amounts due to credit institutions that are to be exercised or settled later than 
six months from the reporting date, plus off-balance sheet commitments with residual maturity subsequent to the reporting date of less 
than six months. Off-balance sheet commitments include all commitments except financial guarantees and letters of credit that are fully 
collateralised by cash covers in the Bank, and commitments due to dealing operations with foreign currencies. The maximum and 
minimum Liquidity ratios are taken from historical data of the appropriate reporting years.
The Group also matches the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on negative gaps compared 
to the Bank’s stand-alone total regulatory capital calculated per NBG regulation. The ratios are assessed and monitored monthly and 
compared against set limits. In the case of deviations, amendment strategies/actions are discussed and approved by the Asset Liability 
Committee (ALCO).

The Group expects that not all of the contingent liabilities or commitments will be drawn before expiry of the commitments.
The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts. Their liquidation has historically taken place over a longer 
period than indicated in the tables above. These balances are included in amounts due in less than three months in the tables above.
Included in due to customers are term deposits of individuals. In accordance with the Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged to repay 
such deposits upon demand of a depositor (Note 17).
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such 
as interest rates, foreign exchanges, and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading 
portfolios. Trading and non-trading positions are managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial 
instruments. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates, with all other variables 
held constant, on the Group’s consolidated income statement.

The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2013 on its trading and 
non-trading monetary assets and liabilities and its forecast cash flows. The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible 
movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held constant on the income statement (due to the fair 
value of currency sensitive non-trading monetary assets and liabilities). The reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against 
the Georgian Lari is calculated as a standard deviation of daily changes in exchange rates over the last month. A negative amount in the 
table reflects a potential net reduction in income statement or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase. During the 
year ended the year ended 31 December 2013, year ended 31 December 2012 and year ended 31 December 2011, sensitivity analysis 
did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment 
earlier than expected, such as fixed rate mortgages when interest rates fall, or other credit facilities, for similar or whatever reasons.
The Group calculates effect of early repayments by calculating the weighted average rates of early repayments across each loan product 
individually, applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying amount of respective products as at the reporting date and 
multiplying by the weighted average effective annual interest rates for each product. The model does not make a distinction between 
different reasons for repayment (e.g. relocation, refinancing and renegotiation) and takes into account the effect of any prepayment 
penalties on the Group’s income.
The estimated effect of prepayment risk on profit and equity of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 
and 31 December 2011 is as follows:
Effect

 interest

2013 (5,944)

Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to perform, 
operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss. The Group cannot 
expect to eliminate all operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group 
is able to manage the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff 
education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit.
Operating environment
Most of the Group’s business in concentrated in Georgia. As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business 
and regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy. Operations in Georgia may involve risks that 
are not typically associated with those in developed markets (including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the 
country, and undeveloped debt and equity markets). However, over the last few years the Georgian Government has made a number of 
developments that positively affect the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to 
create banking, judicial, taxation and regulatory systems. This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation (including new Tax  
Code and procedural laws). In the view of the Board, these steps contribute to mitigate the risks of doing business in Georgia.
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist. The future stability of the 
Georgian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and 
monetary measures undertaken by the Government. However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic 
slowdowns elsewhere in the world.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 
Annual Report 2013
(All amounts are in Thousands of Georgian Lari) The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments which are recorded at fair value using valuation 
techniques. These incorporate the Group’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, currency 
swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap 
models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign 
exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.
Trading securities and investment securities available-for-sale
Trading securities and certain part of investment securities available-for-sale are quoted equity and debt securities. Investment securities 
available-for-sale valued using a valuation technique or pricing models consist of unquoted equity and debt securities. These securities 
are valued using models which sometimes only incorporate data observable in the market and at other times use both observable and 
non-observable data. The non-observable inputs to the models include assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the 
investee, its risk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the investee operates.

The transfer of GEL 3,837 in 2012 was the 19.4% stake in PJSC Bank Pershyi.
Movements in Level 3 non-financial assets measured at fair value
All investment properties and revalued properties of property and equipment are of Level 3. Reconciliations of their opening and closing 
amounts are provided in Notes 12 and 13 respectively.
Impact on fair value of Level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value of changes to key assumptions
The following table shows the impact on the fair value of Level 3 instruments of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions:

In order to determine reasonably possible alternative assumptions, the Group adjusted key unobservable model inputs as follows:
For equities, the Group adjusted the price-over-book-value multiple by increasing and decreasing the ratio by 10%, which is considered 
by the Group to be within a range of reasonably possible alternatives based on the price-over-book-value multiples used across peers 
within the same geographic area of the same industry.

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are  
not already recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity (less than three months) it is assumed that the 
carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a 
specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments
The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates  
when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed  
interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit  
risk and maturity.

The Group’s capability to discharge its liabilities relies on its ability to realise equivalent assets within the same period of time. In the 
Georgian marketplace, where most of the Group’s business is concentrated, many short-term credits are granted with the expectation  
of renewing the loans at maturity. As such, the ultimate maturity of assets may be different from the analysis presented above. To reflect 
the historical stability of current accounts, the Group calculates the minimal daily balance of current accounts over the past two years  
and includes the amount in the less-than-one-year category in the table above. The remaining current accounts are included in the 
on-demand category.
The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are as follows:
 – deposits;
 – borrowings from international credit institutions;
 – inter-bank deposit agreement;
 – debt issues;
 – proceeds from sale of securities;
 – principal repayments on loans;
 – interest income; and
 – fees and commissions income.
As at 31 December 2013 amounts due to customers amounted to GEL 3,117,732 (2012: GEL 2,693,025, 2011: GEL 2,735,222) and 
represented 59% (2012: 59%, 2011: 71%) of the Group’s total liabilities. These funds continue to provide a majority of the Group’s funding 
and represent a diversified and stable source of funds. As at 31 December 2013 amounts owed to credit institutions amounted to GEL 
1,886,096 (2012: GEL 1,657,162, 2011: GEL 921,172) and represented 36% (2012: 36%, 2011: 24%) of total liabilities.
In the Board’s opinion, liquidity is sufficient to meet the Group’s present requirements.

31. Capital Adequacy
The Group maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risks inherent in the business. The adequacy of the Group’s capital  
is monitored using, among other measures, the ratios established by the NBG in supervising the Bank and the ratios established by  
the Basel Capital Accord 1988.
During year ended 31 December 2013, the Bank and the Group complied in full with all its externally imposed capital requirements.
The primary objectives of the Group’s capital management are to ensure that the Group complies with externally imposed capital 
requirements and that the Group maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and to 
maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk 
characteristics of its activities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment 
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. No changes were made in the objectives, policies and 
processes from previous years.
NBG Capital Adequacy ratio
The NBG requires banks to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy ratio of risk-weighted assets, computed based on the Bank’s stand-
alone special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG regulations and pronouncements. As at 31 December 
2013, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Bank’s Capital Adequacy ratio on this basis was as follows:
2013 2012 2011
Core capital 810,545 739,880 512,238
Supplementary capital 313,220 389,685 463,825
Less: Deductions from capital (256,471) (262,616) (184,323)
Total regulatory capital 867,294 866,949 791,740
Risk-weighted assets 5,638,556 5,352,187 4,872,931
Total Capital Adequacy ratio 15.4% 16.2% 16.2%
Regulatory capital consists of core capital, which comprises share capital, additional paid-up capital, retained earnings including current 
year profit, foreign currency translation and non-controlling interests less accrued dividends, net long positions in own shares and 
goodwill. Certain adjustments are made to IFRS-based results and reserves, as prescribed by the NBG. The other component of 
regulatory capital is Supplementary capital, which includes subordinated long-term debt, preference shares and revaluation reserves.

Overview
Chairman’s Statement
Dear Shareholder
Following a challenging 2011, 2012 has been a good year for Pace; 
we have stabilised the business, made very good progress on 
our Strategic Plan and delivered strong ﬁnancial results. In doing 
so we have created the platform for Pace to become a “great 
technology company”.
At the start of 2012, the Group laid out a clear plan and I am 
pleased to say that it has delivered on all aspects of this plan. 
Under Mike Pulli and the new Executive Management team’s 
leadership, many of whom have come from within Pace, we have 
a new sense of accountability across the business, underpinned 
by robust management processes and systems and a strong 
ﬁnancial discipline.
The Group has delivered improved operating proﬁts through both 
top-line growth and a focus on operating efﬁciency, which has 
enabled Pace to signiﬁcantly reduce net debt, reducing risk in 
the business and increasing our strategic ﬂexibility.
The strong operational performance in 2012 and the momentum 
we take into 2013 give the Board conﬁdence to continue building 
on the progressive dividend policy that was introduced in 2009. 
Therefore the Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 3.06 cents 
per share, giving a full year dividend of 4.50 cents per share, 
a 20.0% increase on 2011. The dividend reﬂects the improved 
cash generation of the business and Pace will look to continue 
to pay a progressive dividend off this new rebased level.
“ 2012 has been a good year for Pace; 
we have stabilised the business, made 
very good progress on our Strategic Plan 
and delivered strong ﬁnancial results.”
The Group remains relentlessly focused on the execution of 
its primary objectives, as outlined in the Strategic Review we 
communicated to the market in November 2011. They are:
 — Transform core economics: improve our operating 
performance and leverage scale;
 — PayTV hardware leadership: build on our position as a 
world leading Set-top box, Residential Gateway and Media 
Server company; and
 — Widen out in Software, Services and Integrated Solutions: 
accelerate “widening out” by pursuing opportunities to provide 
Software and Services assets for current and new customers.
Pace’s core strengths are its engineering excellence, 
complemented by strong customer focus and delivery capabilities. 
This is demonstrated through our market leadership position 
in the development and large-scale deployment of advanced 
technologies such as Media Servers by major North American 
operators such as DirecTV and Comcast, and Software and 
Services wins at tier one operators across the world, an area 
we continue to signiﬁcantly invest in.
We have only just started on the delivery of our long-term plans 
and still have a huge amount to do. Nevertheless, we remain 
conﬁdent that the continued successful execution of the Strategic 
Plan will enable Pace to achieve an operating margin target 
of around 9% in the next two to three years, as well as increase 
proﬁts generated by Software, Services and Integrated Solutions. 
This translates to enhanced quality of earnings and signiﬁcant 
incremental shareholder value.
If you have any comments on my statement or any part of the 
Annual Report, I would be delighted to hear from you either by 
writing to me at Pace or by email at Allan.Leighton@pace.com.
Yours sincerely
Allan Leighton

Overview
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review
“ We have delivered a strong set of 
ﬁnancial results, made good progress 
on our Strategic Plan and laid the 
foundation for continued improvement 
in operating performance over the next 
few years.”
The Strategic Review we undertook in 2011 highlighted that we 
operate in sustainable and proﬁtable markets where we have 
differentiated capabilities; however, the Group must execute on 
its three primary objectives to take advantage of the opportunities 
for improving both the level and quality of its earnings. The Group 
is focused on these objectives and has made good progress 
both in delivering strong results in 2012 and paving the way 
for improvement in 2013 and beyond.
This progress is reﬂected in 2012 revenues of $2,403.4 million, 
up 4.1% on 2011, and adjusted EBITA of $158.1 million, equivalent 
to 6.6% of revenues, up 0.5ppt on 2011. Prior to the impact 
of Hard Disk Drive (HDD) supply disruption, Pace delivered 
an adjusted EBITA margin of 7.3%, up 0.9ppt on 2011.
Strategic plan
Transform core economics
Focus on operating efﬁciency has delivered sustainable savings 
in the year and Pace is well underway in the transformation of its 
supply chain that will deliver tangible beneﬁts in 2013 and beyond.
 — Operating expenses (pre-IAS 38 adjustments) reduced by 
$33.0 million (10.6%) in 2012. This was achieved through the 
scaling down of corporate resources and a reorganisation of 
the Americas and International business units, whilst continuing 
to invest in the growth areas of Software and Services. As such, 
research and development expenditure as a percentage of 
underlying administrative spend increased by 2.4ppts to 57 .0% 
(2011: 54.6%), a trend we intend to continue.
Summary
 The Group focused on its strategic 
objectives and has made good progress 
both in delivering strong results in 2012 
and paving the way for improvement 
in 2013 and beyond
 The focus on operating efﬁciency through 
our transform core economics strategy has 
delivered sustainable savings
 Pace has remained at the forefront 
of technological change with advanced

Overview

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review
Strategic plan continued
Transform core economics continued
 — The disruption to HDD supply resulting from ﬂooding in 
Thailand was a major challenge in 2012. However, through 
keen operational focus and working closely with suppliers 
and customers, the impact of this issue was contained 
within the ﬁrst half of the year, with an adverse impact of 
$76.8 million to revenue and $23.1 million to operating proﬁt, 
well below initial expectations. 
 — Signiﬁcant progress has been made in the rationalisation and 
transformation of our supply chain. In H2 2012, we selected 
two core Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) partners 
and aim to consolidate our manufacturing footprint around 
these by the end of H1 2013.
 — We continue to make progress in the improvement and 
reduction of our Approved Vendor List (AVL); optimised 
component selection has ensured that new platforms utilise 
fewer component Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and leveraging 
our EMS partner relationships has enabled Pace to reduce 
the number of vendors it buys from by over 12%.
 — Inventory controls have been strengthened; inventory is now 
tightly aligned to conﬁrmed future revenues and the mix of 
stock is improved with component stock reduced and faster 
turning ﬁnished goods increased. During the year, stock 
turns improved by 19.2% from 2011.
 — Cash generation was strong throughout the year; free cash 
ﬂow was $182.7 million (2011: $8.2 million), reﬂecting lower 
capital expenditure and re-alignment of working capital. This 
has enabled Pace to signiﬁcantly reduce its net debt, which 
is now less than 1 x net debt/adjusted EBITDA

PayTV hardware leadership
Pace was reconﬁrmed as the market leader in PayTV hardware; 
global number one in Set-top boxes

and Residential Gateways

, 
and has maintained its position at the forefront of technological 
development with the launch and deployment of Media Server 
platforms at DirecTV and Comcast, a number of Media Server 
wins across the world and continued demand for our core 
Set-top box (STB) and Gateway platforms.
 — STB and Media Server revenues were up 2.9% to 
$1,826.0 million in 2012, driven largely by the high demand 
for Media Servers in H2 for both DirecTV’s Genie™ Advanced 
Whole-Home HD DVR and the XG1 for Comcast’s new X1 
service. We expect this technology trend to continue into 
2013 and we recently announced the approval for production 
of DirecTV’s next generation HR44 Genie™ Media Server 
and C41 mini Genie™ client device.
 — The move to Media Servers and whole home solutions is 
starting to move beyond North America and Pace has achieved 
a number of key wins in Europe, Asia-Paciﬁc and Latin America 
that will be deployed in 2013 and 2014 including Foxtel, Telenet 
and Get TV in Norway.
 — Building on our global partnership with TiVo that was 
announced in H1 2012, Pace has been undertaking ﬁeld 
trials with an integrated solution consisting of TiVo software 
and Pace STBs and Gateways and is actively pursuing 
signiﬁcant worldwide opportunities during 2013.
 — Gateways revenues were up 8.3% to $469.4 million in 2012. 
Key wins in the year included MTS, the fourth largest Telco 
in Canada.
Widen out in Software, Services and Integrated Solutions
We have achieved a number of key wins and deployments across 
all areas of our Software and Services offerings and have a strong 
pipeline into next year. Revenues in this area increased 7.6% to 
$108.0 million in 2012 and we expect further growth in 2013. 
 — The Pace Elements software platform continues to gain 
signiﬁcant traction as part of an advanced integrated solution 
with a number of wins including Sky New Zealand and Foxtel.
 — Pace Elements is also a key part of our integrated solutions 
for emerging markets; we have a number of operators 
deployed with this solution (Pace hardware, software and 
Latens Conditional Access System) in India and have an 
encouraging pipeline in Southern Asia, Central Eastern 
Europe and CIS.
 — The Pace CMS software that was obtained through the 
2Wire acquisition has been rebranded as the ECO Service 
Management Suite to reﬂect the evolving offering and 
simplify the marketing message. During the year there 
were a number of signiﬁcant wins including BSkyB, Telstra 
(Australia’s leading telecommunications and information 
services company) and ON Brasil (our ﬁrst ECO win in 
the key market of Brazil). The ECO platform is currently 
supporting our customers to manage nearly 25 million 
devices across the world.
 — The Latens software-based Conditional Access and Digital 
Rights Management (DRM) business made good headway, 
with a 68.0% growth in the number of subscribers the product 
is deployed to, on both Pace and other vendors’ STB hardware.

Business performance
Pace’s markets have remained resilient during the year, 
with PayTV continuing to show growth despite difﬁcult global 
economic conditions and perceived disruptive threats from new 
Over-the-Top (OTT) market entrants. Overall, in the markets in 
which Pace operates, digital PayTV subscribers are expected 
to grow at c.6% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 
between 2012 and 2016
4
. 
A major development this year has been the emergence of 
the Media Server product. As the market evolves to a more 
sophisticated digital device in the home, Pace is uniquely placed 
to support this technology upgrade cycle. A Media Server combines 
the functionality of the STB and the Gateway, augmenting traditional 
broadcast with IP-enabled services and enabling video content 
to be distributed around the home, a key component of the move 
to “TV Everywhere”. This product category will evolve to become 
the main hub of the home, enabling any data connectivity 
(video, broadband, home automation, etc.) around the home 
with both operator-provided and consumer-purchased devices. 
Pace was recently identiﬁed as a market leader in this product 
category by industry analysts IHS Screen Digest, a position 
which is forecast to continue to at least 2016
5
.
North America
North America is the largest, most advanced and most proﬁtable 
market for digital PayTV and broadband technology in the world, 
with over 110 million PayTV subscribers and close to 120 million 
broadband connections
6
. We believe the digital PayTV market 
in North America will continue to see low single-digit annual 
growth in subscribers for the foreseeable future.
Pace is the only vendor to the largest operators in each of the 
Cable, Satellite and Telco markets, serving Comcast, DirecTV 
and AT&T respectively. In each case Pace supplies their most 
advanced in-home technology. In addition, Pace also serves 
a large number of tier two Cable and Telco operators in both 
the USA and Canada.
Total revenues in North America increased by 23.7% to 
$1,317.6 million in 2012 (2011: $1,065.1 million), driven largely by 
strong demand from DirecTV and Comcast for Media Server 
products in H2. These conﬁrmed Pace’s continued position of 
technological leadership in our sector and we remain conﬁdent 
about the long-term strength of the market for our products in 
North America.
Gateway revenues increased by 14.5% to $448.7 million reﬂecting 
the continuing demand for high performance Residential Gateways 
from Telcos and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to effectively 
deliver high quality triple-play services.
Software and Services revenues in North America increased by 7 .2% 
to $83.9 million. This revenue is primarily comprised of customer care, 
ECO Service Management software and professional services.
Latin America
The Latin America (Latam) market is a large, diverse and fast 
growing market, within which Pace serves Satellite, Cable, 
IPTV and hybrid operators across the region, with Brazil, 
Mexico and Argentina the key markets.
The overall market has expanded signiﬁcantly over the last few 
years and continues to display strong subscriber growth with a 
predicted 16% CAGR from 2012 to 2016
7
. This growth is led by 
a number of factors including greenﬁeld markets, deregulation 
in Brazil and a number of growing PayTV operators in the region. 
Demand for PayTV is strong at all levels of technology: Standard 
Deﬁnition (SD) to support analogue to digital transition, High 
Deﬁnition (HD) continues to grow to meet growing consumer 
expectations and operators are starting to develop high-end 
Personal Video Recorders (PVRs) and Media Servers for roll out 
in 2013 and beyond.
Pace achieved a double-digit increase in proﬁts in Latam despite 
revenues being down by 20.2% to $37 4.4 million (201 1: $469.0 million). 
Pace reduced supply of low end “Zapper” STBs with a resultant 
loss of revenue but has beneﬁted from focusing on high-end 
products and integrated hardware and software solutions.
Pace’s business in Latam continues to diversify; Pace is now 
providing product to eight of the ten largest PayTV providers in 
the region and is making good progress in the sale and delivery 
of integrated solutions comprising Pace hardware and software, 
as well as Gateways and next generation Media Server products. 
The Company remains conﬁdent that Latam offers strong revenues 
and proﬁtability and is strategically well positioned in key markets 
and customers in the region.
Europe
Europe remains a fragmented and highly customer-speciﬁc 
territory for Pace. Revenues in Europe were down by 12.1% 
to $402.4 million (2011: $457.7 million). HDD supply disruption 
had an impact in this region but the decrease was mainly due 
to a reduced win rate of new products in 2011, which has adversely 
affected revenue in 2012. Sales performance is improving and 
we have achieved key wins in new and existing customers.
Single-digit growth is predicted in the underlying European market
8
; 
however, we expect signiﬁcant growth in the Media Server area 
of the market as operators in Europe follow the innovation of 
North American operators. Pace has been awarded the Media 
Server business for both Telenet (the largest Cable operator in 
Belgium, part-owned by Liberty Global) and Get TV in Norway.

Overview
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review
Business performance continued
Europe continued
In addition, the Group is seeing increasing demand from operators 
for integrated solutions, incorporating Pace hardware and software 
assets, that can be quickly deployed and that enable the operator 
to innovate and differentiate in highly competitive markets. Pace 
is focused on developing opportunities in this area of the 
market and has a number of projects underway.
Rest of World
Rest of World covers a diverse range of markets which are 
developing at different rates: the highly developed markets in 
Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia; the “fast following” 
markets in Middle East and Africa; and the fast growing Indian 
market. Revenues in Rest of World are down 2.7% to $309.0 million 
(2011: $317.5 million). This decrease was primarily due to HDD 
supply disruption in H1 as a number of operators delayed large 
marketing campaigns due to the higher input prices of the supply 
constrained components. 
Australia and New Zealand are traditionally strong markets for 
Pace. In H1 2012, the Company launched its ﬁrst advanced 
integrated solution with Sky New Zealand. In H2 2012, Foxtel 
(the largest PayTV operator in Australia), selected a Pace 
solution, consisting of Pace Elements software and Pace Media 
Server hardware, to deliver their next generation subscription 
TV service. The integrated whole home solution will enable 
Foxtel’s subscribers to consume, discover and manage their 
viewing experience on any screen and from any location.
India is a key growth market for Pace as the country experiences 
large PayTV subscriber growth and the transition from analogue 
to digital progresses in the Cable sector. During the year, Pace 
secured deals with a number of operators for its integrated solution 
for Cable which combines STB hardware, Elements software 
platform and Latens Conditional Access System.
The Company remains conﬁdent that these markets will provide 
signiﬁcant growth opportunities both at the high end of the market 
with HD, PVR and Media Server products and also as the uptake 
of PayTV and digitisation continues in emerging greenﬁeld markets, 
allowing Pace to increase its footprint with new customers 
through Software and Integrated Solutions.
Board changes
On 6 September 2012, we welcomed Amanda Mesler to the Board 
as a new Non-executive Director.
Mike Inglis will be retiring from his role as a Non-executive Director 
on the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 24 April 2013.
2013 outlook
Pace has made considerable progress in 2012 but there remains 
further opportunity in 2013 to develop and improve the performance 
of the Company. We have a strong management team that is 
working well together and have a relentless focus on the execution 
of the Strategic Plan. 
The PayTV market that the Company serves remains resilient 
and the demand for our products and services continues to 
be encouraging. Next generation Media Server products are 
performing strongly in the US market where technology upgrade 
is driving revenue growth. In 2013, we will start to roll out these 
products to other operators in North America and other regions. 
In addition, as the Group continues to develop its Software, 
Services and Integrated Solutions offerings, we are seeing increased 
opportunities for these assets in all markets that Pace serves.
Going into 2013, the Group has a clear plan and good line 
of sight to making further progress.

Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s Review
Overview
“ Signiﬁcant progress has been 
made and the ﬁnancial position 
of the Company is much improved. 
This progress is reﬂected in the 4.1% 
increase in revenue (to $2,403.4 million), 
an 11.8% increase in adjusted EBITA 
(to $158.1 million) and a substantial 
reduction in net debt.”
Summary
 Proﬁt after tax increased 50.5% to 
$58.4 million (2011: $38.8 million) through 
both top line growth and improved 
operating efﬁciencies
 Free cash ﬂow generation has been 
very strong in 2012 at $182.7 million and 
contributed to a 49.2% reduction in net 
debt which reduced in the year by 49.2% 
to $163.3 million
 The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend 
of 3.06 cents per share (2011: 2.50 cents 
per share), giving a total dividend for the 
year of 4.50 cents per share (2011: 3.75 
cents per share), an increase of 20.0% in 
line with the progressive dividend policy 
introduced in 2009
Proﬁtability challenges experienced in 2011 have been 
addressed through self-help initiatives driven by our Transform 
Core Economics strategy. A tight focus on operating efﬁciency 
delivered sustainable savings in the year and actions are well 
underway in the transformation of our supply chain, which 
will deliver tangible beneﬁts in 2013 and beyond.
Free cash ﬂow generation has been very strong in 2012 at 
$182.7 million (115.6% of adjusted EBITA), which includes the 
beneﬁt of robust management and re-alignment of working 
capital (which reduced by 39.0% to $111.1 million). As a result 
of the strong cash ﬂow, net debt reduced in the year by 49.2% 
to $163.3 million at 31 December 2012.

other intangibles decreased by $27 .0 million (8.9%) to $274.9 million 
(2011: $301.9 million). The underlying decrease, excluding the 
impact of IAS 38 accounting adjustments, is a decrease of 
$33.0 million (10.6%) to $278.0 million (2011: $311.0 million). 
Considerable progress has been made in improving operating 
efﬁciency across the Company during the year; the cost saving 
reﬂects a scaling down of corporate resources and a reorganisation 
of the Americas and International business units. Research 
and development expenditure as a percentage of underlying 
administrative spend increased by 2.4ppts to 57 .0% (2011: 54.6%) 
as resource was focused on development areas.
Adjusted EBITA was $158.1 million (2011: $141.4 million); 
an operating margin of 6.6% against 6.1% in 2011.
Exceptional costs of $12.5 million (2011: $12.7 million) relate to the 
change of Directors ($1.4 million), restructuring costs in the Americas 
and International Strategic Business Units (SBUs) and corporate 
($7 .6 million) and the aborted proposal to acquire the Motorola 
Home business from Google ($3.5 million).
Amortisation of other intangibles, primarily reﬂecting the annual 
charge for intangible assets acquired in 2010, was $51.8 million 
(2011: $55.7 million).
Segmental analysis
The Group operates through SBUs. Pace Americas and Pace 
International are deemed by the Board to represent operating 
segments under IFRS 8, with revenues and EBITA as follows:
Restated
FY 2012 FY 2011
$m $m
Revenue
Pace Americas 1,441.9 1,350.6
Pace International 953.6 953.1
Other 7.9 5.6
Total revenue 2,403.4 2,309.3
Adjusted EBITA
Pace Americas 144.0 157 .9
Pace International 72.3 60.3
Other (58.2) (76.8)
Total adjusted EBITA 158.1 141.4
Movements in revenue are described in the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer’s Review on pages 5 to 8. Although not wholly 
consistent, revenues in North America belong primarily to the 
Americas SBU, revenues in Europe and Rest of World belong 
largely to the International SBU and revenues in Latam belong 
to both the Americas and International SBUs.
The performance of Pace International improved with ﬂat revenue 
despite disruption to the HDD supply chain in H1 and operating 
margin improved from 6.3% to 7.6%. Pace Americas’ revenue 
increased by $91.3 million (6.8%) in 2012, reﬂecting strong demand 
for next generation Media Server products, and operating margin 
declined from 11.7% to 10.0%.
Other amounts include central and unallocated costs and other 
immaterial SBUs, which are operating segments that are allowed 
to be aggregated under IFRS 8.
The reduction in Other loss of $18.6 million (24.2%) relates 
primarily to cost savings realised through corporate restructuring.
Finance costs
Net ﬁnancing costs of $13.7 million (2011: $18.3 million) reﬂect 
a reduction in average net debt during the period.
Proﬁt before tax
Proﬁt before tax was $80.1 million (2011: $54.7 million); 
an increase of $25.4 million (46.4%) on 2011.
Taxation
The tax charge of $21.7 million (2011: $15.9 million) results from 
the full year effective tax rate of 27.1% (2011: 29.1%).
The rate reduction reﬂects lower corporate taxes in the UK.
Proﬁt after tax
Proﬁt after tax was $58.4 million (2011: $38.8 million); an increase 
of $19.6 million (50.5%) on 2011.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) was 19.4 cents (2011: 13.2 cents), 
an increase of 47.0%. Adjusted basic EPS, which removes the 
tax effected impact of exceptional costs and amortisation of 
other intangibles to reﬂect underlying performance, is 35.1 cents 
(2011: 29.7 cents), an increase of 18.2%.
Balance sheet
Intangible development expenditure assets increased by 
$2.4 million (2011: $9.3 million) due to continued investment 
in product development.
Tangible ﬁxed assets increased in the period as capital 
expenditure of $22.6 million was offset by the depreciation 
charge of $21.0 million and disposal of assets and exchange 
adjustments totalling $1.8 million. The $22.6 million capital 
expenditure reﬂected a reduction of $18.9 million from 2011 
and is a more normal level for the Company. 
A ﬁnal payment of $15.7 million was made in 2012 as deferred 
consideration for Latens. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 11
Working capital
Net working capital was reduced by $71.0 million (39.0%) in the 
period as commercial terms with suppliers were re-aligned to 
match Pace’s working capital cycle, inventory control processes 
strengthened and a more focused approach was taken to cash 
collection from our customers.
Inventory increased by $32.1 million (21.4%) to $182.1 million 
during 2012; however, the mix of stock has signiﬁcantly improved, 
with component stock reduced and faster turning ﬁnished goods 
increased. Increased inventory is required to meet strong 
anticipated revenue in the ﬁrst quarter of 2013. Average stock 
turn in the year was 8.7 times against 7.3 times in 2011.
Debtor days were reduced by eight days to 53 days at 
31 December 2012; this contributed c.$68 million to the full 
year cash ﬂow. Overall debtor balances increased reﬂecting 
the increased level of trade in Q4 2012 compared to Q4 2011.
Creditor days were increased from 73 days to 83 days at 
31 December 2012 contributing a one-off beneﬁt to cash ﬂow 
of c.$58 million.
Debt
Net debt of $163.3 million (31 December 2011: $321.7 million) 
reduced by $158.4 million (49.2%) in 2012. During the year two 
scheduled facility repayment instalments were paid of $37 .5 million 
each in June and December 2012. The remaining facility continues 
to be repaid through payments of $37.5 million every six months, 
with a ﬁnal payment of $75.0 million due on 31 March 2014.
A key target for the Group is to reduce the balance sheet 
leverage (calculated as net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA 
over the preceding twelve months). At 31 December 2012 
this was 0.9 times, a substantial improvement from the 
position at 31 December 2011. 
Liquidity and cash ﬂows
A key performance measure for the Group is free cash ﬂow, which 
was $182.7 million (2011: $8.2 million) and represented 102.0% of 
adjusted EBITDA (2011: 4.8%). Cash outﬂows from interest payable 
net of interest received were $11.1 million (2011: $13.6 million). 
Cash invested in acquisitions in the form of deferred consideration 
paid was $15.7 million (2011: $6.4 million). Cash spent on 
exceptional costs was $17.9 million (2011: $14.3 million).
The Board is conﬁdent that the Company will continue to be 
strongly cash ﬂow positive in 2013 and that the Company’s 
committed bank facilities are more than sufﬁcient to meet its 
short to medium-term funding needs.
Foreign currency
In the period approximately 76% of the Group’s revenues were 
denominated in USD, 10% in Euros, 13% in Brazilian Real and 
1% in Sterling. 
The impact of non-USD revenues, costs and overheads 
continues to be addressed through Pace’s foreign exchange 
hedging strategy.
Critical accounting policies
The Directors consider that the Group has the following critical 
accounting policies, as they require the use of estimates and 
are subjective in their nature:
 — revenue recognition;
 —impairment;
 —taxation;
 — provisions;
 — intangible assets; and
 — hedge accounting.
Details of accounting policies and estimates can be found 
within the notes to the Financial Statements.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 3.06 cents per 
share (2011: 2.50 cents per share), an increase of 22.4% in line 
with the progressive dividend policy introduced in 2009. The full 
year proposed dividend increases 20.0% to 4.50 cents per share 
(2011: 3.75 cents per share). The increase reﬂects the Board’s 
conﬁdence in the outlook for the Company and its improving 
ﬁnancial position. Pace will look to continue to pay a progressive 
dividend off this new rebased level.
Dividends will be paid in Sterling, equivalent to 2.029 pence per 
share. This is based on an exchange rate of £ = $1.508, being 
the closing rate applicable on 4 March 2013, the date on which 
the Board resolved to recommend the ﬁnal dividend. The 
proposed dividend will be payable on 5 July 2013 to 
shareholders on the register on 7 June 2013.

to 22 together with the audited Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 (year) (prior ﬁnancial period, year

Principal activities
The Group’s principal activities are the development, design 
and distribution of technologies, products and services for 
managed subscription television, telephony and broadband 
services and the provision of engineering design and software 
applications to its customers. The Group also provides related 
support services including systems integration and customer 
care centres.
Business and ﬁnancial results
The information that fulﬁls the requirements of the Business 
Review and Management Report, including a review of the Group’s 
activities, developments and the ﬁnancial results for the year, and 
the key ﬁnancial performance indicators relevant to the business 
of the Company (principally revenue, gross margin %, adjusted 
EBITA, proﬁt before tax, operating margin, free cash ﬂow, stock 
turns, debtor days and net debt), can be found in the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s 
Review on pages 5 to 11. The aforementioned information is 
incorporated in this report by reference. There is no information 
which falls to be disclosed pursuant to Section 417 (5) of the 
Companies Act 2006, other than as noted in the risks and 
uncertainties section below.
Risks and uncertainties
The following are the key risks and uncertainties relevant to the 
business of the Group:
Customers and markets
Orders placed by the Group’s PayTV and telecoms customers 
are typically large one-off orders for delivery over a number of 
months with supplemental orders for additional volumes. As the 
eventual deployment of the STB or gateways can be unpredictable, 
revenues can be volatile. The difﬁculty in predicting the Group’s 
business ﬂow and its risks can be exacerbated by a number of 
other factors including, for example, the development process 
for an advanced STB, which can take over twelve months. 
The Group works on long lead times (e.g. four months or more) 
for component supply and manufacture, typical of the industry. 
In the USA market, in particular, customers’ ﬁrm order lead times 
may be less than the component lead times. There are third party 
delivery risks, for example, difﬁculties in the delivery of components 
or software code, and the ﬁnal order for manufacture and ﬁrm 
contractual commitment is usually dependent on product 
approvals and acceptance both from the operator and sometimes 
from third parties. The Group is also exposed to the industry wide 
inherent risk of supply chain failure. The Group has put in place 
Summary
 The Group is controlled through the 
Board of Directors, which comprises two 
executive and ﬁve non-executive directors
 The directors recommend the payment 
of a ﬁnal dividend of 3.06 cents per 
ordinary share, giving a total dividend of 
4.50 cents per share for the full year
 Substantial ongoing programme of research 
and development of new products, spending 
$158.6 million in the year
“ The Group’s principal activities 
are the development, design 
and distribution of technologies, 
products and services for 
managed subscription 
television, telephony and 
broadband services and the 
provision of engineering design 
and software applications to its 
STB and gateway customers.” Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 15
Risks and uncertainties continued
Customers and markets continued
procedures to monitor the ﬁnancial and operating strength 
of key suppliers. In addition, it utilises dual or multi source 
suppliers where possible to mitigate this risk.
Product liability claims
In common with many companies in the industry, the Group is 
exposed to the risk of product liability claims made by customers 
or affected third parties, should the Group’s products not fulﬁl 
the terms of the contracts under which they are sold. The Group 
has in place quality control and other operational procedures 
to mitigate this risk.
Credit risk
The Finance function of the Group obtains reports from 
third party sources in respect of the credit worthiness of key 
customers and suppliers and sets individual credit limits as 
appropriate. The Company previously maintained a credit 
insurance policy, which provided cover over certain debtors 
where it is was considered economically viable, subject to 
excesses. The Company reviewed this policy in February 2013 
and determined that the insurance coverage was no longer 
economically viable based on the availability of such insurance, 
the amount of excess required and ﬁnancial cost of the premium. 
Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by 
the Finance function. Credit limits for each customer are set 
based on an evaluation of ﬁnancial strength. The Company’s 
customers are by and large proﬁtable and cash positive. No bad 
debt of any signiﬁcance has been incurred in the last ﬁve years. 
Deposit investments are generally undertaken only in liquid 
securities and with counterparties that have appropriate 
credit ratings.
Royalties
The Group’s products incorporate third party technology, 
usually under licence. Inadvertent actions may expose the 
Group to the risk of infringing third party intellectual property 
rights. Potential claims can be submitted many years after 
a product has been deployed.
Regulatory
The Group is subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and 
standards and remains exposed to changes in the regulatory 
environment, including potential modiﬁcations to import duty 
regimes, and legislation relevant to the Group’s products and 
services. It is Pace’s policy to require that all its subsidiaries 
comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards.
Currency risks
The standard “industry currency” is the US Dollar, with the majority 
of components and manufacturing capacity purchased in this 
currency. However, due to part of the Group’s revenues being 
in Sterling and Euros, the Group is exposed to the risk of foreign 
currency movements. To manage this risk, the Group’s treasury 
policy is progressively to cover cash ﬂows when these are 
sufﬁciently certain and to seek price variations through contractual 
mechanisms where signiﬁcant currency movements occur.
Financial results
The consolidated income statement for the year is set out on 
page 34. The proﬁt before tax was $80.1 million (2011: $54.7 million) 
and the proﬁt before tax, interest, exceptional items and amortisation 
of other intangibles was $158.1 million (2011: $141.4 million).
Dividend
The directors recommend the payment of a ﬁnal dividend 
of 3.06 cents per ordinary share (2011: 2.50 cents) to be paid 
on 5 July 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 7 June 2013. An interim dividend of 1.44 cents 
per ordinary share was paid during the year (2011: 1.25 cents).
Dividends will be paid in Sterling equivalent to 2.029 pence per 
ordinary share. This is based on an exchange rate of £ = $1.508, 
being the rate applicable on 4 March 2013.

Report of the Directors
Directors
The names of the current directors of the Company are shown 
on pages 12 and 13. Other than as described on pages 12 and 13 
in respect of Roddy Murray and Amanda Mesler, all those listed 
held ofﬁce throughout the year.
During the year Stuart Hall (retired 6 March 2012) and 
David McKinney (retired 6 January 2012) also held ofﬁce 
as directors.
All the directors will retire at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting of the Company and, other than Mike Inglis, offer 
themselves for re-election. The Board has determined that all 
of the directors continue to make a very effective contribution 
to the Board and demonstrate a high level of commitment. 
Amanda Mesler, having been appointed by the Board subsequent 
to the last Annual General Meeting, will hold ofﬁce until the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will then offer herself 
for election at that meeting. Mike Inglis will retire at the Annual 
General Meeting but will not offer himself for re-election since 
he will be participating in a round the world sailing race later this 
year. Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and the 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are disclosed 
in the Remuneration Report on pages 25 and 26.
Payment to suppliers
It is the policy of the Group to agree terms and conditions for its 
business transactions with suppliers, which are varied from time 
to time. Payment is made in accordance with those terms, subject 
to the other terms and conditions being met by the supplier. 
The Group does not follow any code or standard on payment 
practice. Creditor days at the end of the period for the Group 
were 83 days (31 December 2011: 73 days).
Research and development
The directors regard it as fundamental to the future success 
of the Group to engage in a substantial ongoing programme 
of research and development of new products, spending 
$158.6 million in the year (2011: $169.7 million) and charging 
$155.4 million (2011: $160.6 million) to the income statement 
during the year following the treatment under IAS 38.
Donations
During the period the Group donated $145,784 (2011: $150,746) 
to charitable causes. No political donations were made. Further 
details of the charitable and community-related activities of the 
Group are given on pages 20 and 21.
Corporate governance
As referred to on page 25 the Company granted an 
Appointment Share Award to Allan Leighton on his appointment 
as Non-executive Chairman. Save in respect of this Appointment 
Share Award, the directors believe that the Company has 
complied throughout the period with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, as revised and adopted by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The Board conﬁrms that it has established 
the necessary procedures designed to maintain a sound 
system of internal control and that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks 
faced by the Company.
Board of Directors
The Group is controlled through the Board of Directors, which 
comprises two executive and ﬁve non-executive directors 
who bring a wide range of skills and experience to the Board. 
Biographical details of all directors are to be found on pages 12 
and 13. The Chairman, Allan Leighton, is mainly responsible for 
the running of the Board ensuring, together with the Company 
Secretary, that it receives timely and clear information appropriate 
to enable it to discharge its duties. The responsibilities of the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Mike Pulli, are to focus on running the 
Group’s business and implementing Group strategy. The Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer is assisted in managing the business on 
a day-to-day basis by the Executive Committee as further 
described below. 
All the non-executive directors (other than the Chairman) are 
deemed by the Board to be independent and the Chairman 
was independent on his appointment, as required by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Board has 
designated Pat Chapman-Pincher as the Senior Independent 
Director. All directors have access to the advice and services 
of the General Counsel and Company Secretary and are able 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary. Historically, 
directors have submitted themselves for re-election at least once 
every three years and now, each of them submit themselves for 
re-election on an annual basis. New directors receive a programme 
of tailored induction on joining the Board and all directors are offered 
the opportunity to continually update their skills and knowledge 
by attending external training events. The Company has in place 
procedures to deal with directors’ conﬂicts of interest and the 
Board is satisﬁed that these procedures operate effectively.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally 
reserved to it and normally meets at least eight times each year. 
It is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and 
divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects 
and consideration of signiﬁcant ﬁnancing matters. It reviews 
the strategic direction of the Group and meets with other 
senior executives within the Group as required during the year. 
The Chairman holds meetings with the non-executive directors 
without the executive directors being present on a regular basis. 
It is the policy of the Board to undertake a formal review and 
evaluation of its performance including the performance of its 
committees, the Chairman and individual directors on an annual 
basis. This is generally concluded by written feedback in 
standardised form from each director to the Chairman or the 
Senior Independent Director in the case of appraisal of the 
Chairman. The Board will consider appointing an independent 
facilitator for the evaluation process at least once every three years. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 17

the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee is responsible 
for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and 
other members of the Executive Committee including making 
recommendations regarding the grant of share incentive awards. 
The members of the Committee have no personal interest, 
other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, no 
potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross-directorships 
and no day-to-day involvement in the running of the business.
The Nominations Committee is comprised of non-executive 
directors Pat Chapman-Pincher, John Grant, Mike Inglis and 
Amanda Mesler and is chaired by Allan Leighton. Its principal 
purpose is to consider and make recommendations to the Board 
regarding the appointment of new directors. The Nominations 
Committee meets at least once a year or as required. 
External search consultants were appointed by the Committee 
in connection with the appointment of Roddy Murray and 
Amanda Mesler.
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of 
the executive directors and other members of the Executive 
Committee as a prelude to recommending their annual 
remuneration, bonus awards and long-term share incentive 
awards to the Board. The ﬁnal determinations are made by the 
Board as a whole but no director plays a part in any discussions 
concerning their own remuneration. There are no agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees providing 
for compensation for loss of ofﬁce or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs 
as a result of a takeover bid.
The Remuneration Report of the Directors to shareholders is 
set out on pages 23 to 30 and includes the remuneration policy 
of the Company and details of directors’ incentive payments 
and the related performance criteria.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the Annual General Meeting in 2012 the Company was 
authorised by shareholders to purchase up to 45,774,165 of 
its own ordinary shares, representing 15% of its issued share 
capital as at March 2012. The Company did not utilise this 
authority during the year. The authority for the Company to 
purchase its own shares expires at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting in 2013 and a resolution to renew it will be 
proposed at that meeting.

Accountability and audit
A detailed review of the performance of the Group’s business 
is contained in the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review and the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s Review. These statements, together 
with the Chairman’s Statement and the Report of the Directors, 
are intended to present a balanced assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects. The directors’ responsibility for the 
Financial Statements is described on page 31 and the 
responsibilities of the auditors are described on page 32.
Audit & Risk Committee
During the year the Committee undertook the annual review of 
its terms of reference. The review focused primarily on extending 
the Committee’s role in relation to the areas of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code revised in 2012 and applicable to the current 
ﬁnancial year. Following this review the terms of reference were 
revised in relation to review of audit services tenders and review 
of the ﬁnancial reports and statements. 
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for:
 — monitoring the integrity of the Financial Statements of the 
Company and formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
ﬁnancial performance and reviewing any signiﬁcant ﬁnancial 
reporting judgements contained therein;
 — reviewing the Company’s internal ﬁnancial and operational 
control and risk management systems;
 — monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit 
function and reviewing its material ﬁndings;
 — reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments 
and disclosures in the Financial Statements to ensure clarity 
and completeness such that shareholders may understand 
strategic aims and risks of the business of the Group;
 — overseeing the Company’s relationship with its external auditors, 
including making recommendations as to frequency of tendering 
for audit services, the appointment or re-appointment of 
the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement 
and monitoring their independence and ensuring that policy 
surrounding their engagement to provide non-audit services 
is appropriately applied; and
 — reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
whistleblowing procedures.
Internal audit
The Company’s Head of Risk Assurance, Damien Wilkinson, 
who has direct access to the Audit & Risk Committee primarily 
through the Chairman of the Committee, manages an internal 
audit function provided by external qualiﬁed auditing professionals.
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews annually the arrangements 
for internal audit and during the year the Committee re-appointed 
BDO LLP (BDO) to act as internal auditors, performing an agreed 
programme of internal audits in collaboration with the Company’s 
Head of Risk Assurance and senior management. BDO attended 
and presented their reports to each of the Audit & Risk Committee 
meetings during the year.
The Committee has, amongst other things, considered the quality 
of reporting to the Committee and impartiality of the internal 
auditors and has concluded that the effectiveness of Internal 
Audit during the year was satisfactory.
External audit
The Audit & Risk Committee has satisﬁed itself that the external 
auditors, KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG), acted independently of the 
Group. Previous appointments of KPMG and the extent of other 
work undertaken by it were considered inter-alia in this regard.
It is the Audit & Risk Committee’s opinion that there were no 
limitations imposed by management on KPMG whilst performing 
their duties during the review period.
The Audit & Risk Committee, in consultation with the Group’s 
executive management, agreed to the terms of the KPMG 
engagement letter, audit plan and budgeted audit fees for the 
2012 ﬁnancial year.
A formal framework governs the process through which the 
Group’s auditors are considered to render non-audit services. 
The Audit & Risk Committee has approved a policy in relation 
to the provision of non-audit services by the external auditors 
and the nature and extent of non-audit services that the external 
auditors could provide within the scope of the policy during 
the ﬁnancial year.
Internal controls
Overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control 
rests with the Board. The Board has delegated certain of its 
powers to the Audit & Risk Committee to review the effectiveness 
of the systems of control and to receive reports from the auditors 
(internal and external) and from the management relating to the 
interim and annual accounts and the control systems in use 
throughout the Group.
During the year and up to the date of this report, the Board 
carried out reviews of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls. The reviews were undertaken in accordance with the 
Financial Reporting Council’s guidance under the following 
headings and were aimed at clearly identifying the systems 
already in place and the action plans necessary to improve 
areas of control weakness.
The control environment
Subject to those powers and limits of authority reserved by 
the Board, and to the Group policies and guidelines they have 
established, the conduct of the business of the Group is delegated 
within a clearly deﬁned organisational structure and approved 
level of authority. The Board has also adopted a Code of Business 
Ethics, which has been incorporated into the Employee Handbook 
issued to all employees.

Risk assessment
The directors and senior managers are responsible for identifying 
and monitoring sources of potential business risk and ﬁnancial 
risk, and for taking such preventative and protective actions 
as they consider necessary to manage such risks effectively. 
During the year a risk assessment review of the Group’s business 
has been conducted by the Head of Risk Assurance and BDO 
acting as internal auditors in conjunction with members of the 
Executive Committee. The Board has received and considered 
this review as part of an annual risk and control assessment.
The Group’s systems are designed to identify and manage, 
rather than eliminate, signiﬁcant business risks, including the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives, but can provide 
only reasonable not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Business risks are identiﬁed, evaluated 
and managed through functional line management reporting to 
divisional meetings, Executive Committee meetings and Board 
meetings as appropriate. Each member of the Executive 
Committee is required to highlight and report on any signiﬁcant 
business risks identiﬁed within their sphere of responsibility.
The key business risks associated with the timely completion 
of long-term development projects and ongoing business 
risks, including alleged infringement of third party intellectual 
property rights and supply chain interruption, are managed by 
cross-functional teams of senior employees. Business continuity 
plans addressing physical risks to the Group’s development 
sites and maintenance of IT services are maintained. The Group 
has adopted Customer Account Teams (CATs) grouped within 
SBUs so as to focus the business on customer needs. The senior 
managers within the CATs also monitor the ﬁnancial and business 
risks, including competitor risks, associated with the delivery 
of agreed plans, reviewing such matters at Business Review 
Meetings held on a regular basis and attended by members 
of the Executive Committee. 
Financial control and information systems
The Group’s strategic direction is reviewed regularly by the 
Board and plans, budgets and performance targets are reviewed 
and approved at least annually. Directors receive monthly 
summaries of ﬁnancial results which compare actual performance 
with targets, together with detailed management reports that 
identify the reasons for variances and the progress achieved. 
Business planning documents are revised on a regular basis 
in line with actual and expected performance. A review of the 
consolidated Financial Statements is completed by the centralised 
Group Finance function to ensure that the ﬁnancial position 
and results of the Group are appropriately reﬂected in the 
consolidated accounts.

is reviewed regularly by the

Report of the Directors
Control procedures
Financial control procedures have been developed for all of 
the main business functions and in relation to the Company’s 
ﬁnancial reporting process and the Group’s process for the 
preparation of consolidated accounts, and have been documented 
in a procedures manual. Authorisation limits for purchases and 
capital expenditure are speciﬁed and procedures are in place 
for minimising exposure to potential weaknesses in the receipt, 
handling and despatch of goods. The Group’s main premises 
have received accreditation for BSI ISO 9001: 2000.
Monitoring systems
Monitoring of the internal control systems is carried out by 
the Head of Risk Assurance in conjunction with the internal 
auditors, BDO.
Although no system of internal ﬁnancial control can provide 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, 
the Group’s systems are designed to provide the directors 
with reasonable assurance that transactions are authorised 
and completely and accurately recorded, that assets are 
safeguarded and that material errors, irregularities and actions 
contrary to Group policies and directions are either prevented 
or promptly discovered.
Going concern
The Group has borrowing facilities in place until March 2014. 
At 5 March 2013 these are in the form of a $150 million term loan 
which is subject to repayment through instalments of $37 .5 million, 
each due every six months, plus a ﬁnal payment of $75 million, and 
a $150 million revolver credit facility. These facilities are subject 
to ﬁnancial performance covenants which the Group currently 
complies with.
The Board’s assessment of the Group and Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern has taken into account the effect 
of the current economic climate, current market position and 
the level of borrowings in the year. The principal risks that the 
Group is challenged with have been set out in the Risks and 
Uncertainties section of this report along with how the directors 
intend to mitigate those risks.
The Board has prepared a ﬁnancial and working capital 
forecast that is based upon trading assumptions and other 
medium-term plans and has concluded that the Group will 
continue to meet its ﬁnancial performance covenants and 
will have adequate working capital available to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Corporate social responsibility
Employment policies
The directors recognise the importance of the Group’s employees 
to its success and future development and are committed to 
providing an environment that will attract, motivate and reward 
high quality employees. The Group continues to invest in a range of 
internal and external initiatives to promote employee development.
Employees are kept informed of matters affecting them 
as employees and factors affecting the performance of the 
Group through regular employee meetings/brieﬁngs and 
regular written news brieﬁngs distributed electronically.
The Group welcomes applications for employment from all 
sectors of the community and promotes equality of opportunity 
in employment regardless of age, sex, sexual orientation, disability 
or ethnic origin. It is the Group’s policy that training, career 
development and promotion opportunities should be available 
to all employees. In the event that an employee becomes 
disabled, the Group makes reasonable adjustments where 
any aspect of premises or working practices puts such a 
disabled employee at a substantial disadvantage compared 
with a non-disabled employee.
Health and safety
Each SBU in the Group has an established Health and Safety 
Committee made up of health and safety representatives, the 
designated health and safety ofﬁcer and other persons with 
expert knowledge who review health and safety issues relevant 
to the Group’s business. Other safety-related committees also 
conduct periodic reviews of speciﬁc work practices. These actions 
complement the UK Government’s “Health, Work, Wellbeing” 
(HWW) initiative which has been adopted and implemented 
by the Company.
Part of the HWW incorporates return to work programmes 
and the Group’s operations in Saltaire, Americas West 
and Americas East, France, Brazil and India have adopted 
similar policies. Each division incorporates, where appropriate, 
their ergonomic risk assessments. The Group’s businesses in 
India, the UK, Americas West and Americas East provide 
training for First Aid, Fire Evacuation and Fire Wardens. 
Americas West undertakes earthquake training and Americas 
East undertakes hurricane training. All of these initiatives are 
backed up by appropriate risk assessments. “Tool-box talks”, 
short presentations on speciﬁc aspects of health and safety, 
are also published on the Group’s intranet and shared between 
different parts of the Group.
The number of workplace accidents during the year for Saltaire 
was 6. Outside the UK, there were 16 accidents in the Americas 
West and Americas East operations, 3 in France, 6 in Brazil 
and none in India. None of these accidents was regarded as 
serious by the relevant local Health and Safety Committee. 
Charitable and community support
The Group has an established Charitable Donations Committee 
comprising employees based at the Group’s premises in the UK 
and the USA. The Committee considers all requests for charitable 
and community project assistance from employees within a 
ﬁnancial budget and criteria approved by the Board on an 
annual basis. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 21
Corporate social responsibility continued
Charitable and community support continued
The Group’s support through the Committee is focused on the 
local geographical area of Pace’s premises in the UK, France, 
India and the USA as well as the charitable and community 
initiatives of Group employees. 
During the year, requests for assistance satisfying the above 
criteria received ﬁnancial support amounting to $145,784 in total. 
The participation of employees of the Group in community and 
charitable activities outside work hours has been encouraged 
by the provision of funds to match individual sponsorship raised. 
Pace has continued as lead sponsor of the Ahead Partnership’s 
education strand of business engagement in the UK’s West 
Yorkshire region. This has enabled the Ahead Partnership to 
develop and roll out their Make the Grade business education 
partnership model in the West Yorkshire region and during 
the year Pace adopted a three-year sponsorship commitment 
in this regard. 
In addition, Pace has partnered with Teach First to support the 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) teachers 
in Yorkshire and the Humber. Pace will fund the provision of 
personal development coaches to Teach First participants in 
their second year of teaching. Teach First recruits, trains and 
supports teachers working in schools in low income communities 
to raise the achievement, aspirations and access to opportunity 
of children from low socio-economic backgrounds.

Supply chain
Pace is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizen Coalition 
(EICC) and applies the EICC Code of Conduct in its business. 
A programme of assessment and auditing is maintained at 
the regular business review meetings held with the Group’s 
principal suppliers. 
Auditors
KPMG held ofﬁce as auditors during the year. The Audit & 
Risk Committee reviews the independence and objectivity of 
the auditors, considering whether, taken as a whole, the various 
relationships (if any) between the Group and the auditors impair, 
or appear to impair, the auditors’ judgement or independence. 
The Committee was satisﬁed throughout the year that the 
objectivity and independence of KPMG was not in any way 
impaired by either the nature of the non-audit related services 
undertaken during the year, the level of the non-audit fees 
charged or any other fact or circumstances.
Having considered the results of the Committee’s work, 
the Board is recommending the re-appointment of KPMG 
as auditors. A resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG 
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Each of the directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of 
this Report of the Directors conﬁrms that, so far as they are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and the directors have each taken all 
the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Relations with shareholders
The Board has continued to establish and maintain relationships 
with institutional shareholders and communicates with investors 
through the Group’s website (www.pace.com). A programme 
of meetings with institutional shareholders is in place (at which 
institutional shareholders are offered the opportunity to meet 
with non-executive directors) and analyst presentations are made 
following announcement of the interim and annual results. 
Shareholders are welcome to participate at the Annual General 
Meeting at which the Board will be available for questions.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held 
on 24 April 2013 at the ofﬁces of the Company at Salts Mill, 
Victoria Road, Saltaire, West Yorkshire BD18 3LF. Full details 
of the business to be transacted at the meeting will be set 
out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors
A statement of the responsibilities of the directors is contained 
on page 31. The directors whose names appear on pages 12 
and 13 conﬁrm that to the best of their knowledge:
 — the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
 — the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with the 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Governance
The directors present their report to shareholders on pages 23 
to 30 regarding remuneration matters in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2012.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible 
for setting the individual remuneration of the executive directors 
and other members of the Executive Committee within the 
framework of the remuneration policy described below, which 
is set by the Board.
The directors who were members of the Committee during the 
year were Pat Chapman-Pincher (Chairman of the Committee), 
Allan Leighton, John Grant and Mike Inglis. Amanda Mesler, 
was appointed to the Committee in January 2013. For guidance, 
the Committee makes use of surveys of executive pay and 
knowledge of market rates. The CEO and Director of HR also 
attended Remuneration Committee meetings during the year 
by invitation and provided advice to the Committee to enable it 
to reach informed decisions. No director was present when their 
remuneration was being discussed. The Committee was assisted 
in its consideration of remuneration matters by Kepler Associates 
who were appointed by the Committee. Kepler Associates 
provided no other services to the Group in the year. Pinsent 
Masons LLP, legal advisers to the Company, also advised the 
Committee regarding certain equity incentive related issues.
Remuneration policy
The Board believes that the remuneration packages of the 
executive directors should encourage them to drive long-term 
shareholder value. The market, particularly in the US, is very 
competitive for high quality talent. When setting remuneration 
to attract and retain talent, the Board takes account of the external 
market and Group and individual performance. It is our intention 
to reward success. The policy is for a signiﬁcant proportion 
of executive directors’ total remuneration to be capable of being 
earned from variable, performance-based incentives, through 
annual bonuses and share-based incentives. The objective of this 
policy is to provide rewards and incentives for success. More 
than half of an executive director’s potential remuneration is 
variable and can only be earned by good corporate performance.
The Board’s policy in relation to non-executive directors continues 
to be to pay fees that are competitive with the fees paid by 
comparable quoted companies. Non-executive directors’ fees 
are determined by the Board as a whole within the limits set out 
in the Company’s Articles of Association. Non-executive directors 
are not eligible for performance bonuses or pension contributions 
and do not participate in the equity incentive plans, save in respect 
of Allan Leighton’s Appointment Share Award which was a 
one-off exception to the policy. Non-executive remuneration 
is reviewed annually.
Summary
 The Board believes that the remuneration 
packages of the executive directors 
should encourage them to drive long-term 
shareholder value
“ The Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee) is responsible for

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Salary
Basic salary for each executive director is determined by the 
Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual 
and information from independent sources on external market 
salary levels for comparable jobs with a view to salaries being 
set around the median to upper quartile level for comparable 
companies. In setting senior executives’ salaries, the Committee 
also takes into account pay and employment conditions in the 
Group as a whole. Salary is generally reviewed at the commencement 
of each ﬁnancial year. Although there was a review for all employees 
and increases applied across the Group, there were no increases 
in salaries of the executive directors for 2013. The salary of 
Mike Pulli was ﬁxed at $750,000 per annum upon his appointment 
as CEO in December 2011, and the salary of Roddy Murray 
was ﬁxed at £325,000 (US Dollar amount $514,898) upon his 
appointment in February 2012. These are their current salaries.
Performance bonus
The Company established a non-pensionable performance-related 
bonus plan for the executive directors and other key members 
of management for the year, which was based on the successful 
achievement of corporate and individual objectives. The corporate 
objectives were linked to the key drivers of value creation for 
shareholders and the key measure therefore was the proﬁtability 
of the Group for the full ﬁnancial year. Achievement of the 2012 
bonus was dependent on the Group’s EBITA (before certain 
exceptional items) exceeding $146 million with the capacity to earn 
additional bonus increments upon achievement of higher proﬁt 
targets up to a ceiling of $187 million. In addition, a number of 
individual personal objectives were set for each director and 
manager, which were aligned with the objectives of the Group 
for the year. The maximum normal bonus achievable by the 
executive directors in the event that all corporate and individual 
targets were met was 150% of basic annual salary with one-third 
of any bonus outcome achieved being deferred into shares in the 
Company for a period of two years under the Group Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan. The Committee retained a discretion to 
reduce the bonus otherwise payable by up to 50% based on 
their assessment of the management of the Company’s cash 
position during the year.
In respect of the 2012 ﬁnancial year, the Committee reviewed 
the executive bonus structure with its remuneration advisers. 
The Committee and the Board believed that it in view of the 
situation of the Company at the beginning of 2012 and the 
new management team, there should be a higher incentive for 
performance that signiﬁcantly improved the operating performance 
of the Company. The outcome of this review was a revised bonus 
structure which allowed the Committee to enhance normal 
bonus outcomes achieved under the Group EBITA targets 
and individual objectives described above up to the maximum 
of 225% of salary but only if a positive bonus outcome is ﬁrst 
achieved under the normal Group EBITA target and individual 
objectives. Potential maximum bonus outcomes are capped 
at 225% of base salary and one-third of all bonus outcomes 
achieved up to 150% of base salary deferred into shares for 
two years, with deferral also applying on these terms to any 
bonus outcomes achieved between 150% and 225% of base 
salary. In respect of 2012 the Committee awarded an enhanced 
bonus to Mike Pulli taking his overall annual bonus up to the 
maximum level of 225% of salary; and an enhanced bonus of 
100,000 shares (representing approximately 71% of salary) to 
Roddy Murray based on the cash management performance of 
the business and net debt reduction during the year. Each of 
these enhanced bonus awards is deferred into shares for a 
longer deferred period of three years. 
This outline structure for annual bonus and award of deferred 
shares has been maintained in respect of the 2013 ﬁnancial year 
with individual limits based on multiples of salary also maintained.
Beneﬁts in kind
Each UK-based executive director is entitled to beneﬁts such 
as the provision of a fully expensed company car plus fuel 
(or cash alternative), private medical insurance, permanent 
health insurance, life insurance and where applicable relocation 
assistance. Mike Pulli has equivalent beneﬁts to the extent 
consistent with US labour market practice.
Pension contributions
In the year ended 31 December 2012, contributions were paid 
into the executive directors’ pension plans at rates determined 
by the Board. Contributions have continued to be paid during 
the current year at the rate of 15% of each UK-based executive 
director’s basic salary. The Group does not operate any deﬁned 
beneﬁt plans.
Performance Share Plans
Following the approval of shareholders at the 2009 AGM, a new 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) was introduced, with all Group 
employees (including executive directors) eligible to participate. 
The maximum award is 100% of salary. Under the PSP , employees 
receive a conditional right to receive shares for no cost, which 
will normally vest after three years subject to continued 
employment and the achievement of stretching performance 
conditions. Where granted in the form of nil-cost options, 
they may be exercised up until the tenth anniversary of grant 
subject to the rules of the PSP.
PSP awards granted in and prior to 2011 will vest subject 
to the achievement of three-year targets based on cumulative 
proﬁt before tax (PBT) for the Group as set out in Note 3 to the 
directors’ share options table on page 29. PSP awards made in 
2009 vested in full during 2012, but PSP awards made in 2010 
failed to reach minimum vesting criteria and 0% vested. During 
the year awards made to employees including executive directors 
were based on three-year Group adjusted EBITA. The cumulative 
Group adjusted EBITA targets that apply to the awards made in 
2012 are set out in Note 3 to the directors’ share options table on 
page 29.
Cumulative EBITA targets are again proposed for 2013 awards 
with cumulative EBITA being measured over the three ﬁnancial 
years 2013–2015. For these purposes EBITA and previous PBT  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 25
Performance Share Plans continued
targets will be adjusted to exclude the amortisation of other 
intangibles, exceptional items and other items that the 
Committee determines to be appropriate to ensure it reﬂects 
underlying long-term performance. The use of EBITA targets for 
2013 PSP awards was considered to be appropriate as it aligns 
the focus of Pace senior executives on a key measure of ﬁnancial 
performance which is easily understood, highly visible internally 
and externally and which is regularly monitored and reported.
Following the General Meeting of the Company held on 
18 October 2010 shareholders approved the adoption of a new 
performance share plan, the International Performance Share 
Plan (IPSP). The IPSP follows closely the terms of the PSP; 
however executive directors may not participate.
Share option plans
At present, the executive directors may participate in two share 
option plans:
 — a standard HMRC approved all-employee sharesave plan (or an 
equivalent sharesave plan available for US employees); and 
 — the Company’s 2005 discretionary share option plans 
(HMRC Approved and Unapproved plans). 
In 2012, executive directors were granted sharesave options 
and Roddy Murray also received option grants under the 2005 
discretionary share option plans. Details of the performance 
conditions applying to all outstanding share options held by the 
executive directors, including options granted in 2012, are set out 
in the footnotes to the directors’ share options table on page 29.
The maximum award of options to any employee pursuant to the 
HMRC Approved plan is £30,000. The maximum award of options 
under the unapproved plan to any employee in each year is 200% 
of salary or, in exceptional circumstances, as determined by the 
Committee, 400% of salary. Option awards are targeted at the 
Company’s most senior executives and are based on a ﬁxed number 
of options (subject always to the discretion of the Committee to 
utilise other award criteria in exceptional circumstances). Option 
awards vest subject to real EPS growth (as noted on page 29). 
The Committee believes EPS targets to be appropriate to enhance 
alignment of the senior executives with shareholder interests 
whilst still maintaining focus on proﬁtability.
Share award contracts
As part of the terms on which Allan Leighton was appointed, he 
agreed to purchase $310,000 of Pace shares and the Company 
agreed to match this personal investment on a two-for-one basis 
that will vest on the third anniversary of his appointment which 
occurred on 31 May 2011. An additional award of 600,000 
Pace shares was made at the same time and will vest dependent 
on share price performance over a four-year period: 25% of this 
award will vest at a share price of 145 pence with full vesting at 
190 pence. Both awards are subject to the shares being retained 
until at least the ﬁfth anniversary of appointment. The awards will 
normally lapse on cessation of the ofﬁce within three years. On a 
change of control the awards will vest, with vesting of the share 
price related awards dependent on share price performance. Vesting 
may also occur on certain other corporate events. The maximum 
number of shares awarded under this arrangement is 938,810 shares. 
The Committee recognises that such awards are unusual: as 
discussed with shareholders in advance of the appointment and 
following last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, the decision 
reﬂected Allan’s willingness to make a signiﬁcant personal investment 
in the Company and the need to secure his unique experience at 
a time when the business was facing a number of challenges. The 
Committee considers the Award is aligned with shareholder interests 
in that it is linked to share price performance and the options and 
awards made to executive directors are made by reference to 
different performance criteria (EBITA and EPS) eliminating, in 
the view of the Committee, any potential conﬂict of interest. 
In March 2010 the Remuneration Committee agreed to make 
an individual award of contingent shares (the “2010 Share Award”) 
to Mike Pulli (at a time when he was not a director of Pace plc) 
equivalent to 1 x annual salary (171,480 ordinary shares). 
Vesting of the 2010 Share Award was dependent on achievement 
of budget by Pace Americas in each of 2010 and 2011 ﬁnancial 
years. Vesting was achieved in full on 15 March 2012 and 
particulars of this award are contained in the table on page 27.
Minimum shareholding
The Committee operates individual shareholding target 
requirements for members of the Executive Committee 
(including executive directors) with a requirement (subject 
to a discretion of the Committee) for such executives to retain 
a portion of any net awards (i.e. after tax and exercise cost) 
of newly vested share-based incentives made after 2009 until 
the target shareholding level is reached. The target shareholding 
is approximately 100% of the executive’s annual salary and up 
to 50% of shares earned but held under the Company’s Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan are deemed to count towards the ownership 
target. Each executive is required to achieve target ownership 
level within a period of ﬁve years. Mike Pulli achieved the required 
minimum shareholding during the year.
Service contracts
Company policy is that executive directors’ notice periods 
should not exceed one year. Each of the executive directors has 
a service contract with the Company. Each of these agreements 
is terminable by the Company on twelve months’ prior written 
notice or by the relevant director on not less than six months’ prior 
written notice. At the option of the Company, each agreement 
may be terminated forthwith subject to the Company paying 
a sum equivalent to twelve months’ salary, beneﬁts and 
pension contributions. 
It is the Company’s policy to honour its obligations with regard 
to directors’ service agreements and where the employment of 
a director is terminated in accordance with the aforementioned 
contractual process, the Company will pay the sum speciﬁed in 
the relevant service agreement as payable or otherwise pay fair 
and reasonable compensation. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 26

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Service contracts continued
The service agreement of Mike Pulli with Pace Americas, Inc. 
became effective on 13 November 2003, was amended on 
26 October 2004 and was most recently amended by decision 
of the Committee to reﬂect his appointment as CEO and new 
terms as outlined previously (but varied to reﬂect USA practice 
and custom) on 14 December 2011. The service agreement 
of Roddy Murray became effective on 23 February 2012. 
Save for the notice periods referred to in the previous paragraph, 
these contracts have no unexpired term.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed under a letter 
of appointment which is terminable at any time by the Company 
without contractual notice. Where notice is not given, termination is 
generally subject to payment of an amount equal to three months’ 
directors’ fees. Each of the directors (and certain ofﬁcers of 
subsidiaries of the Company) has a letter of indemnity issued 
by the Company which provides an indemnity in respect 
of liabilities incurred in the course of their ofﬁce to the extent 
permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association and the 
provisions of the Companies Act.
Copies of the service contracts of the executive directors and 
the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors, together 
with the share award contracts and letters of indemnity referred 
to above, are available for inspection during normal business 
hours (Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays excepted) 
at the registered ofﬁce of the Company.
The Company maintains directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance 
in respect of senior employees and ofﬁcers of the Group including 
the directors. The consent of the Board is required in the event that 
an executive director wishes to accept an external appointment. 
It has been the practice of the Company to permit a director to 
retain non-executive fees arising from any such appointment 
but during the year none of the current executive directors held 
such external appointments.
The auditors are required to report on the information disclosed 
below and on pages 26 to 30.

Notes: Performance conditions
1  Options subject to performance conditions based on growth in the pre-tax proﬁts of the Group (PBT) over a period of three 
ﬁnancial years with 25% of options vesting at $10.7 million PBT in the third ﬁnancial year and 100% of options vesting at 
$26.7 million PBT in the third ﬁnancial year, with vesting on a sliding scale between these two target thresholds. 
2  Options granted in FY 2008 are subject to performance conditions based on cumulative growth in EPS requiring a minimum 
growth in EPS of 4% per annum above inﬂation over a three-year period at which level there is 25% vesting. Cumulative growth 
of 8% per annum above inﬂation is required for 100% vesting. Options granted in FY 2009, FY 2010, FY 2011 and FY 2012 are 
subject to performance conditions based on similar cumulative EPS growth but with increased EPS growth required for maximum 
vesting from RPI + 8% to RPI + 15% per annum. In order to assess whether the performance conditions have been met, the 
Committee will utilise the earnings ﬁgures derived from the audited Financial Statements of the Group adjusted to exclude 
exceptional or other items that the Committee determines appropriate to ensure they reﬂect underlying long-term performance. 
3  PSP awards will vest subject to the achievement of three-year targets based on cumulative PBT for the Group prior to 2012 and awards 
granted thereafter will vest subject to achievement of three-year targets based on cumulative adjusted EBITA for the Group.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Governance
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts and the Group and Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
Company Financial Statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the Company Financial Statements 
on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of their proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 — make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
 — state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
 — prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 32

To the members of Pace plc
Independent Auditors’ Report
We have audited the Financial Statements of Pace plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 set out on pages 34 to 75.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and, as regards the 
parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 31, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit, and express an opinion on, the Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
A description of the scope of an audit of Financial Statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
 — the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2012 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the 
year then ended;
 — the Group Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
 — the parent Company Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
 — the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,

Financial Statements
Notes
1 Basis of preparation and business environment
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Financial Statements:
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost 
convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of derivative instruments.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Group’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
endorsed by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company’s Financial Statements have 
been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is 
presented for the Company. The result of the Company for the year is shown in Note 25.
Financial year end
The current year’s Financial Statements are for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the previous year’s Financial Statements 
are for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings (Note 13) drawn up to 
31 December 2012. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly 
or indirectly, to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Intra-group transactions, including sales, 
proﬁts, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost 
less any impairment loss in the Financial Statements of the Company.
Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars 
which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
The US Dollar/Pound Sterling exchange rate at 31 December 2012 was 1.62 (2011: 1.55).
Signiﬁcant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty
The Group’s main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and ﬁnancial condition are set out on pages 42 to 47. 
Judgements and assumptions have been required by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies in many areas. 
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions. Key areas of estimation 
uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are as follows:
Warranties
Pace provides product warranties for its products. Although it is difﬁcult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or 
the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before ﬁeld deployment 
data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the ﬁeld.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data 
and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision required is reviewed 
on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Royalties
Pace’s products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence. Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk of infringing 
third party intellectual property rights. Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been deployed. 
Any such claims are always vigorously defended.
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated 
claims for royalties relating to the Group’s use (including past usage) of that technology. Having taken legal advice, the Board 
considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate 
or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which 
the potential liabilities are ﬁnally settled. The provision is based on the latest information available. Financial Statements

1 Basis of preparation and business environment continued
Signiﬁcant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty continued
Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identiﬁed as the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has determined that, based on its current internal 
reporting framework and management structure, it has two reportable segments. 
Such determination is necessarily judgemental in its nature and has been determined for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements. The level of disclosure of segmental and other information is determined by such assessment. Further details of the 
considerations made and the resulting disclosures are provided in Note 3 to the Financial Statements.
Intangible assets
The Group business includes a signiﬁcant element of research and development activity. Under accounting standards, principally 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected 
beneﬁts from projects deemed to be commercially viable. The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by 
management of the forecasted economic beneﬁt from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with 
the selection of amortisation periods appropriate to the life of the associated revenues from the product. 
Going concern
The Group has borrowing facilities in place until March 2014. At 31 December 2012 these are in the form of a $150 million term loan, 
which is subject to repayment through instalments of $37.5 million each, due every six months plus a ﬁnal payment of $75 million, 
and a $150 million revolver credit facility. These facilities are subject to ﬁnancial performance covenants which the Group currently 
complies with.
The Group has prepared a ﬁnancial and working capital forecast based upon trading assumptions and other short-term and 
medium-term plans. The Group has sensitised these plans for a number of potential scenarios, including working capital management 
and revenue reduction and has concluded that the Group will continue to meet its ﬁnancial performance covenants and will have 
adequate working capital available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2 Accounting policies
Business combinations
Control is the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In assessing 
control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable. The acquisition date is the date 
on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether 
control is transferred from one party to another.
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Initial measurement
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
all measured as of the acquisition date. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred 
by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group. Consideration transferred also includes 
the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the 
business combination. If a business combination results in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and 
the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element 
is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation 
and arises from a past event and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The Group measures any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identiﬁable net assets of the acquiree. 
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination such as ﬁnder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence 
fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 43
2 Accounting policies continued
Goodwill continued
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount 
of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to 
any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
As permitted by IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 (date of transition 
to Adopted IFRS) has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually. The Group performs 
its annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have ﬁnite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of other intangibles is done on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the particular asset 
categories as follows:
Customer contracts and relationships three–ten years
Technology and patents  one–ten years
Other    three years
Research and development expenditure
All ongoing research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Where a product is technically feasible, production 
and sales are intended, a market exists and sufﬁcient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are 
capitalised and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned from 
commercial launch. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of 
overheads. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is 
incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The estimated 
useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between six and thirty months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Company’s distributable 
proﬁts as the costs meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the income statement in research and development 
expenditure within the Administrative expenses category. 
Impairment charges
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-ﬁnancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indeﬁnite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset 
or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reﬂects the 
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is 
allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inﬂows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets 
are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which 
the corporate asset is allocated. Impairment losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss. Any impairment losses recognised in respect 
of CGUs are allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Financial Statements

Notes
2 Accounting policies continued
Impairment charges continued
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods 
are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Exceptional items
Items which are signiﬁcant by virtue of their size or nature and which are considered non-recurring are classiﬁed as exceptional 
operating items. Such items which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of signiﬁcant restructuring 
and proﬁts and losses made on the disposal of properties, are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement 
category, albeit analysed as a separate line within that category, and are highlighted separately in the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the proﬁt measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive 
of value added tax and net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the 
customer and substantially all of the Group’s work is completed, which is usually upon delivery to the customer or his agent.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised 
over the period over which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken, project milestones achieved and any 
future obligations remaining.
When a single sales transaction requires the delivery of more than one product or service (multiple components), the revenue 
recognition criteria are applied to the separately identiﬁable components. A component is considered to be separately identiﬁable 
if the product or service delivered has standalone value to that customer and the fair value associated with the product or service 
can be measured reliably. The amount recognised as revenue for each component is the fair value of the element in relation to the 
fair value of the arrangement as a whole. This requires a degree of management judgement and the fair value allocations are, by their 
nature, best estimates. The timing and amount of revenue recognition can vary depending on what assessments have been made. 
Where there is no separate selling price of an element, management determines fair value based on equivalent available products.
The Group does not recognise revenue before delivery has occurred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. 
The determination of whether the amount of revenue can be measured reliably or whether receivables are collectible is 
inherently judgemental.
Finance income and ﬁnance costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
in proﬁt or loss, using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and impairment losses 
recognised on ﬁnancial assets. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset are recognised in proﬁt or loss using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are 
reported on a net basis.
Government grants
Grants in respect of speciﬁc research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income 
statement or against the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the project’s related expenditure.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with 
original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the statement of cash ﬂows.
Allowance for doubtful debts
Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually signiﬁcant. 
Where necessary, provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 45
2 Accounting policies continued
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out basis and includes 
appropriate transport and handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale. Where necessary, provision is made 
for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset 
concerned, the cost of property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, 
at each balance sheet date. The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
Long leasehold properties Period of lease
Short leasehold properties Period of lease
Plant and machinery One–ten years
Motor vehicles  Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed 
to have occurred. 
Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. 
Assets held under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected 
useful lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and 
is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising 
on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
to the Group’s presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the 
translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation 
reserve is reclassiﬁed to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange risks arising from operational, ﬁnancing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does 
not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading purposes. The directors have determined that the instruments qualify 
for cash ﬂow hedge accounting.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed as cash ﬂow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash ﬂows 
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction. Financial Statements

Continued
Notes
2 Accounting policies continued
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments continued
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness. Where a derivative ﬁnancial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability 
in cash ﬂows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the 
movement in fair value of the derivative ﬁnancial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within ﬁnance income/costs. 
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a ﬁnancial asset or liability, the associated cumulative 
gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassiﬁed into the income statement when the transaction occurs.
Taxes
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled. 
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available in the foreseeable 
future from which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions 
are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting 
conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reﬂect such conditions and there is no true-up 
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised 
as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled 
to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability 
are recognised as personnel expenses in proﬁt or loss.
Employee share ownership plans
The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Beneﬁts Trust are treated as being those of the Company. 
Until such time as the Company’s own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted 
in arriving at equity.
Employee beneﬁts
Obligations for contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred. The Group has no deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements in place.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Dividends payable
Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders’ equity. A liability is recorded for a ﬁnal 
dividend when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 47
2 Accounting policies continued
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event and it is probable that an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation.
(a) Royalties
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated 
claims for royalties relating to the Group’s use (including past usage) of that technology. The provision is based on the latest 
information available. 
(b) Warranties
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical 
warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision 
required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
(c) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring 
has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
(d) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected beneﬁts to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower 
than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
(e) Deferred consideration
A provision is recognised for deferred consideration relating to acquisitions, based on the expected fair value of the outﬂow.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning on or after 
1 January 2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 January 2012 
and not early adopted
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’ requires an entity to present the items of other comprehensive 
income that may be recycled to proﬁt or loss in the future if certain conditions are met, separately from those that would never 
be recycled to proﬁt or loss. The Group is yet to assess IAS 1’s full impact and intends to adopt IAS 1 no later than the accounting 
period beginning on or after 1 July 2012, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IAS 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ was amended in June 2011. The amendment does not impact the Group.
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated Financial Statements of the parent Company. The Group 
is yet to assess IFRS 10’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 
1 January 2014, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, 
including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014, 
subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise deﬁnition of fair 
value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRS. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 13’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, 
subject to endorsement by the EU.
There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group. Financial Statements

3 Segmental analysis
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) has been identiﬁed as the Board 
of Directors which reviews internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information to evaluate the performance 
of the business and make decisions.
The Group determines operating segments on the basis of SBU areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its 
worldwide interests. 
During the year the Group consolidated Pace Europe, Pace Enterprise and certain other immaterial operating segments into a new 
SBU named Pace International. This was done in order to reﬂect the management structure of those operating segments, which 
changed in the year.
The Group has the following reportable segments:
 — Pace Americas;
 — Pace International; and
 —Other.
Other include central and unallocated costs and other immaterial SBUs, which are operating segments that are allowed to be 
aggregated under IFRS 8.
Reconciliations between Pace Americas, Pace International and the geographical revenue disclosure given are not possible 
due to the different revenue streams which sit under each reportable segment. 
Performance is measured based on segmental adjusted EBITA, as included in the internal management information which is reviewed 
by the CODM. Adjusted EBITA is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most 
relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments, relative to other entities that operate within these industries. 
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers and, where appropriate, pricing is determined 
on an arm’s length basis. There are no material inter-segment transactions. 
The tables below present segmental information on the revised basis, with prior periods amended to conform to the current 
period presentation:

from 1 April 2013. The relevant deferred tax balances have therefore been re-measured. 
A reduction to the Corporation tax rate has been announced and is expected to be enacted subsequently to reduce the rate 
by 2% per annum to 21%, effective 1 April 2014. This change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, 
therefore, is not recognised in these Financial Statements.

Goodwill
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations and relates to the following acquisitions:
 — XCom Multimedia Communications SA (now Pace Europe SAS) in February 2001;
 — the STB and connectivity solutions business of Royal Philips Electronics (Pace France) in April 2008;
 — Bewan Systems SA (Bewan) in April 2010;
 — 2Wire, Inc (2Wire) in October 2010; and
 — Latens Systems Limited (Latens) in November 2010.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash-generating units (CGUs) as follows:
 — $121.0 million within Pace International;
 — $191.2 million within Pace Americas; and
 — $25.7 million within Latens.  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 55
11 Intangible assets continued
Goodwill continued
These CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated 
goodwill is monitored for management purposes. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are 
indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined from value in use calculations. These calculations use cash ﬂow projections based on 
the following year’s budget and the Group’s 3 year plan. These forecasts have been approved by the Board, and have an appropriate 
long-term growth rate of 1% (2011: 1%) applied to them.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash ﬂow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-based 
discount rate. The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 10.14% (2011: 9.55%). 
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates and expected changes 
to selling prices and direct costs. Sales growth, selling prices and direct costs are built up within the budget and 3 year plan on a 
product by product basis utilising the knowledge and expertise of operational staff. The anticipated launch dates for new products, the 
achievable prices and direct costs to be incurred are therefore highly judgemental. The directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax 
rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
The Directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and have also considered the following reasonable changes 
in the assumptions:
 — movements in the pre-tax discount rate of up to an additional 10%; and

During the year, an exercise was completed to align the useful economic lives of certain asset classes across the Group. These asset 
classes have now been extended from a previous useful economic life of 1 to 3 years (depending on the asset class), to a revised 
useful economic life of 2 to 5 years. The directors believe that this change better reﬂects the manner in which these assets will be 
used by the business. 
The effect of this change has been a reduction in the current year depreciation charge in comparison to prior periods. The depreciation 
charge in each period going forward will be lower as a result but the effect on future periods has not been disclosed due the number 
of assets involved and the range of remaining useful economic lives. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 57

18 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
The Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost. For more information about the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk, see Note 19.
The Company has a facility underwritten by RBS and HSBC incorporating Lloyds TSB, Barclays, Santander and Yorkshire Bank 
in a syndicated deal.
The main facilities at 31 December 2012, which are all denominated in US Dollars, consist of a $150 million term loan facility 
together with a $150 million revolving credit facility.
The facilities have a termination date of 31 March 2014. Amortisation of the original $300 million term loan commenced on 20 June 2011 
with repayments of $37.5 million made every six months until 20 December 2013. A ﬁnal repayment of $75 million is due to be 
made on 31 March 2014.
Interest is payable on the facilities at LIBOR plus a speciﬁed margin. The margin is subject to a ratchet linked to overall leverage 
conditions of the Group.
Facility arrangement and associated fees of $9 million were capitalised and are being amortised over the life of the facilities 
and included within the overall interest costs.
There are certain ﬁnancial covenants with regard to the facilities. These are principally linked to interest cover and net leverage.
In addition to the main facilities, a Bi-lateral Bonding Facility with RBS was also entered into and covers bank guarantees, 
principally in respect of Duty and Deferment requirements ($155,000).
The carrying value of the year-end borrowings position is as follows:
2012 2011
Group and Company $m $m
Non-current liabilities
Bank term loans 74.7 147 .3
Current liabilities
Bank term loans 73.2 73.1
Bank revolving credit facility 90.1 150.0
163.3 223.1
The face value of the borrowings was $75 million (2011: $150 million) in respect of the bank term loans within non-current liabilities, 
$75 million (2011: $75 million) in respect of the bank term loans within current liabilities and $90.1 million (2011: $150 million) in respect 
of the bank revolving credit facility. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 63
18 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued
The difference between the face value amounts and the amounts in the previous table is $0.3 million (2011: $2.7 million) in non-current 
liabilities and $1.8 million (2011: $1.9 million) in current liabilities which represents facility arrangement fees and accrued interest costs.

(c) Gains and losses on currency derivatives
The majority of the Group’s production costs are denominated in US Dollars. The Group endeavours to obtain as much of its income 
as possible in US Dollars. The Group’s policy is to hedge forward progressively against movements in the value of foreign currencies, 
in respect of cash receipts and payments expected from transactions over the next twelve months.

The Group’s derivatives contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have a fair value at the balance sheet date of $(1.3) million 
(2011: $4.5 million).
(d) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount 
and duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating. The Group does not require collateral in respect 
of ﬁnancial assets. There were no signiﬁcant impairments in the periods under review. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 65
19 Derivatives and other ﬁnancial instruments continued

Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
reporting date was:
2012 2011
Carrying amount $m $m
Trade receivables 514.1 369.8
Cash and cash equivalents 74.7 48.7

Euro-zone countries 24.0 24.0
United States 293.2 195.1
Other regions 75.3 55.8
514.1 369.8
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings. At each balance sheet date 
there was no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk, other than those customers with revenues in excess of 10% of the Group’s 
total revenues, as explained in Note 3.
Of the trade receivables at 31 December 2012, 92% were within terms (2011: 94%). Of the balance 7% were less than 30 days past 
due, with the remaining amounts over 30 days due (2011: 4% less than 30 days past due). There were no material bad debts 
provisions deemed necessary against such balances, in the current or preceding years.
(e) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast 
and actual cash ﬂows and matching the maturity proﬁles of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. Financial Statements

It is not expected that the cash ﬂows included in the maturity analysis could occur signiﬁcantly earlier, or at signiﬁcantly different amounts.
The directors have considered the periods in which the cash ﬂows associated with derivatives that are cash ﬂow hedges are expected 
to occur, together with the timing of impact on proﬁt or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the above table.
(f) Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term ﬂuctuations on the Group’s earnings. 
The directors consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates during a twelve-month period would have a $0.8 million 
impact on cash ﬂows (2011: $0.9 million).
The Group’s key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and Sterling. A 1% strengthening in the US Dollar against 
these would have an adverse impact of $0.2 million (2011: $0.9 million) on the proﬁt reported in the year ended 31 December 2012 
and an adverse impact of $4.7 million (2011: $4.4 million) on equity.  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 67

(g) Capital management
Capital risk management
The Group and Company manage their capital, being the net assets base, to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern 
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The capital structure of the Group and Company comprises 
equity attributable to equity holders of Pace plc, consisting of issued ordinary share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed 
in Notes 21, 22 and 24 and cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in Note 18.
The Group and Company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issue of new 
shares and buy-back of existing shares and issuing new borrowings or repaying existing borrowings.
Note 21 to the Financial Statements provides details regarding the Company’s share capital and movements in the period. 
There were no breaches of any requirements with regard to any relevant conditions imposed by either the UKLA or the Company’s 
articles of association during the periods under review.
Details of the Company’s facilities are given in Note 18. Such facilities are subject to certain ﬁnancial performance covenants. 
There have been no breaches of these covenants in the period under review.
(h) Fair value
Fair value versus carrying amounts
The directors have considered the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities and have determined that these are not materially 
different from the carrying amounts shown in the Group balance sheet.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments, namely forward exchange contracts, have been determined to represent Level 2 instruments 
(characterised by the existence of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). 
(i) Exchange rates

Royalties under negotiation
The owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Group’s 
use (including past usage) of that technology. Negotiations over these liabilities continue for long periods of time. The directors have 
made provision for the potential royalties payable based on the latest information available. Having taken legal advice, the Board 
considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate 
or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which 
the potential liabilities are ﬁnally settled.
Given the nature of the claims it is not possible to be more speciﬁc with regard to the timing of outﬂows. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 69
20 Provisions continued
Royalties under negotiation continued
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the negotiation of royalty claims during the year would be 
seriously prejudicial to other royalty claims under negotiation, in litigation or dispute. Accordingly the directors have aggregated 
amounts released unused with additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year shown on page 68.
Other provisions
Other provisions mainly relate to retirement and exceptional restructuring provisions within the Group, along with certain other provisions.
Warranties
Pace provides product warranties for its STBs and Gateways from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised 
when the underlying products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and 
related cost of repair information and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty 
provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Although it is difﬁcult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty 
estimate must be calculated at the outset of product shipment before ﬁeld deployment data is available, these estimates improve 
during the lifetime of the product in the ﬁeld.
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the settlement of warranty claims during the year would be 
seriously prejudicial to other claims under negotiation. Accordingly the directors have aggregated amounts released unused with 
additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year shown on page 68.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within ﬁve years of the balance sheet date.

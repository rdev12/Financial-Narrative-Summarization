Osmetech today
Transforming molecular diagnostics into practical, cost-effective, FDA
cleared testing solutions.
As the demand for and acceptance of molecular diagnostic tests
multiplies, so does the rate of testing decentralization. The movement
of molecular diagnostic testing into the clinical laboratories of mid-
size hospitals requires greater simplicity, flexible testing capabilities,
and cost-effectiveness.
Osmetech Molecular Diagnostics is focused on providing cutting-
edge, cost-effective molecular diagnostic technologies and tools that
enable a broader range of hospitals and laboratories to offer
molecular diagnostic services for improved patient care.

™ Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report that 2006 has been another year of considerable achievement for Osmetech.
Our Molecular Diagnostics Division received FDA clearance for its eSensor
®
Cystic Fibrosis screening
test and has achieved its first sales of diagnostics products in this rapidly developing and strategically
important market.
In December 2006 we announced that the sale of our Critical Care Division to our veterinary partner,
IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. for $44.9m in cash had been agreed. This sale was completed at the end of
January 2007, crystallising a considerable gain in the value of this business under Osmetech’s ownership
and management since its acquisition from Roche Diagnostics in April 2003.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Critical Care Division employees for their
dedication, enthusiasm and commitment over the past few years in helping to create a strong and
successful business in the blood gas market. The Board wishes them well for the future as they enter an
exciting new chapter under IDEXX’s ownership.
The sale of the Critical Care Division has demonstrated the skill of the Osmetech management team in
acquiring and developing underexploited assets and now management is focussed solely on the major
opportunities available in Molecular Diagnostics market. We are confident that we can deliver similar
success with our Molecular Diagnostics business, which is now appropriately funded, and I look forward
to updating shareholders on further progress in due course.

2 Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Chief Executive Officer’s review
Introduction
Through the recent sale of its Critical Care Division, Osmetech has capitalised on the considerable value
created in that business since its acquisition from Roche Diagnostics, Inc. in 2003. Following its sale, the
Group is now wholly focussed on its Molecular Diagnostics business operating in Pasadena and Boston
in the US.
Sale of Critical Care Division
2006 was another year of strong profitable growth for the Critical Care Division. Sales of the blood gas
and electrolyte product range increased to £10.5m ($19.4m) in 2006 from £5.6m ($9.9m) for the 8 month
period ended 31 December 2005. Sales increased by 29% when compared to the equivalent 12 month
period in 2005 of £8.1m, benefiting in particular from VetStat sales to our veterinary distribution partner,
IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (‘IDEXX’).
Notwithstanding the highly satisfactory operating performance of the Division this year, on 18 December
2006, we announced the proposed sale of the Critical Care Division to IDEXX for $44.9m in cash. This
sale was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 9 January 2007 and the
transaction was completed on 31 January 2007.
The Critical Care Division was originally acquired by Osmetech in April 2003 for $2.7m before costs.
During the period of Osmetech’s ownership, sales more than doubled and a loss making business was
transformed into profitability. This was achieved principally through selective new product investment
and the launch of the VetStat in the veterinary market with IDEXX. Osmetech’s developing commercial
relationship with IDEXX presented an opportunity to sell the Division at an attractive price, representing
a substantial return on investment.
Your Board considered that this divestment was in the best interests of the Group as a whole, delivering
the following benefits:
• Realises excellent value creation for shareholders
• Removes any shareholder concerns over the Group’s funding requirements and strengthens its
balance sheet
• Provides the necessary funding to enable the continued development of a successful Molecular
Diagnostics business
• Osmetech is now well positioned in a high growth market sector with potentially high returns
Molecular Diagnostics Market
The molecular diagnostics market is expected to continue to be the fastest growing segment within In
Vitro Diagnostics (IVD). With an estimated global market worth of $2.6bn in 2006, it is approaching 10%
of the total IVD market and exhibiting annual growth rates of approximately 20%. Infectious disease and
genetic testing are the two most rapidly growing areas for molecular diagnostics accounting for
approximately half of the overall market segment.
Osmetech is primarily targeting genetic testing, which can be divided broadly into three areas:
• Diagnosis and Monitoring – evaluating genetic sequences to confirm the presence or progress of
disease
• Susceptibility – evaluating genetic mutations to determine susceptibility to a future condition (e.g.,
cystic fibrosis)
• Pharmacogenetics – evaluating genetic variations to predict a patient’s response to a particular drug
Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 3 Chief Executive Officer’s review
continued
Pharmacogenetics or ‘personalised medicine’ is widely anticipated to grow rapidly as treatments are
more closely tailored to a patient’s genetic make-up. For example, Osmetech is developing a genetic
test relevant for the anticoagulant Warfarin where the market opportunity is substantial. Optimal doses
of Warfarin vary among patients with incorrect starting dosages prescribed for 20% of patients, resulting
in either insufficient or excessive blood thinning.
Warfarin testing is expected to lead to a reduction in the 85,000 cases of severe bleeding and 17,000
strokes occurring annually in the US and could decrease national healthcare spending by $1.1bn per
year as estimated by the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institute. More than 30m
prescriptions for Warfarin are given annually in the US alone with 3m new patients each year suffering
from a heart attack or stroke. The total annual number of patients worldwide with conditions for which
Warfarin could potentially be prescribed is 8.5m.
Pharmacogenetics is also expected to play a larger role in drug development through the identification
of genetic mutations and creation of “companion” diagnostics.
Molecular Diagnostics Division
Osmetech is developing a strong, complementary portfolio of FDA-approved and development-stage
products that address the rapidly growing molecular diagnostics market.
We plan to expand and develop the Division through the following means:
• Progress with the development and commercialisation of the Group’s existing product pipeline
including the second generation instrument platform, the eSensor
®
XT-8
• Secure licensing agreements that will add assay content, and therefore revenues, for the Group’s
instrument platforms
• Continue to explore selective acquisition opportunities which will strengthen and expand the
Group’s presence in the molecular diagnostics market
• Negotiate licensing agreements and enter into strategic partnerships in non-healthcare markets, thereby
leveraging the strength of the Group’s instrument platforms, technology and intellectual property
Osmetech’s two instrument platforms, eSensor
®
and GeneSensor™ (previously known as OPTI GENE)
are directly targeting the demand for decentralised testing by providing practical, cost effective
molecular diagnostic technologies and tools that will enable a broader range of hospitals and
laboratories to offer molecular diagnostic services. Our strategy has been to design low cost products
specifically for the diagnostics market rather than by adapting complicated high cost research 
products.
eSensor
®
The eSensor
®
instrument and cartridge consumable system is primarily suited to undertaking relatively
complex molecular tests which require the analysis, detection or identification of many different targets
at once. The electrochemical detection technology is protected by strong international intellectual
property, including 70 patents in the US alone, which have benefited from an investment of
approximately $100m by Motorola during its period of ownership.
Earlier this year Osmetech received 510(k) clearance from the US FDA for its Cystic Fibrosis carrier
detection test and its eSensor
®
4800 DNA Detection instrument platform. This FDA approval is a first for
a combined instrument and consumable Cystic Fibrosis assay. The system assesses whether an individual
carries mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis gene and is used by adult couples contemplating pregnancy.
The core technology for the instrument platform and microarray consumable forming part of this
approval will also be used for running tests for other conditions to be launched in the future.

continued
eSensor
®
XT-8
Later this year we shall be introducing our second generation instrument, the eSensor
®
XT-8 with new
consumable cartridge, which will be able to routinely run complex assays including the Cytochrome P450
(“CYP 450”) pharmacogenomics assays described later.
The eSensor
®
XT-8 system will deliver a number of operational, design and performance benefits
including:
• Significant reduction in processing time
• Smaller foot print
• Modular and expandable with higher throughput potential
• Integrated CPU
• Programmable eSensor
®
cartridge
• Increased chip density to enable wider analysis of gene mutations
• Improved data management capabilities
A successful third party evaluation for a fully functional prototype XT-8 instrument and our first CYP450
assay for Warfarin testing took place in December 2006. We now plan to exhibit the platform at the
Clinical Virology Symposium in the US next month moving to clinical trials in support of an FDA
submission in the third quarter of 2007. Following FDA approval, we anticipate a launch in the US by the
end of 2007 with an international launch scheduled for 2008.
SensiTube™
The SensiTube™ product line, previously known as OPTI TUBE™, consists of plastic tubes and
ergonomically designed sealing caps and carousel for use in the Roche LightCycler, a market leading
instrument used in PCR analysis. SensiTube™ is a cost effective, robust alternative to Roche glass
capillaries that eliminates the dangers of glass breakage and minimises the risk of laboratory personnel
being exposed to potentially dangerous samples and glass shards. The same plastic technology has
been incorporated into consumables to be supplied for use with Osmetech’s GeneSensor™ instrument.
Osmetech has also granted a worldwide non-exclusive license to Roche for the manufacture and sale of
plastic consumable vials using this proprietary plastic tube technology, in respect of which the Company
has recently been granted its first patent.
GeneSensor™
The GeneSensor™ instrument is primarily suited to undertaking relatively simple molecular tests. Whilst
our primary objective is to further develop the commercial potential for our eSensor
®
system, we plan to
fully launch the GeneSensor™ as a research instrument later this year followed by the introduction of an
FDA-cleared instrument and accompanying Factor V and Factor II IVD tests for thrombophilia in early
2008. In time we expect that the instrument platform and proprietary consumable will be used for
testing a wide range of conditions.
The combination of the eSensor
®
and GeneSensor™ products should enable both complex and simple
molecular diagnostic tests to be performed accurately by hospitals in a cost effective and easy to use
format. Unlike many competing products, the two products combine both an instrument platform and
proprietary test specific consumables. New tests launched will use the same instrument platform and
consumable format thereby increasing sales revenues for each instrument in use.
Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 5  Chief Executive Officer’s review
continued
The increase in administrative expenses and operating loss for the continuing operations of the Group
for 2006 reflects both the comparison with an 8 month period for 2005 and the inclusion of the results of
Clinical Micro Sensors, Inc for a full 12-month period following its acquisition on 26 July 2005. We
anticipate that administrative expenses for continuing operations will show a marginal increase in 2007
as more of our Molecular Division’s products reach commercialisation.
The operating loss for the period of £12.4m compared to a net cash outflow from operating activities of
£11.2m, with the difference of £1.2m largely explained by the share compensation charge of £0.8m, a
non-cash item accounted for in accordance with Financial Reporting Standards No.20, “Share Based
Payment” (FRS 20). Also in accordance with FRS 20 we have restated the prior year charge for share
compensation charges.
At 31 December 2006, cash and liquid resources were £7.1m. Following the receipt of the proceeds (net
of expenses) from the sale of the Critical Care Division, cash and liquid resources on 31 January 2007
were £27.5m. The majority of our cash and liquid resources are denominated in US dollars and will be
retained as such to meet the anticipated funding requirements of our Molecular Diagnostics Division
arising in the same currency.
We have announced today that we have agreed to acquire the warrants issued to Motorola as
consideration for the acquisition of Clinical Micro Sensors in July 2005. The warrants are over 7,811,428
ordinary shares (representing 3.85% of the issued share capital) and will be cancelled by the Company
thereby removing any dilution effects that would result from their exercise. The cash cost to the
Company is approximately £469,000, representing 6 pence per warrant which were exercisable into
ordinary shares at 17.5 pence.
Outlook
The importance of the developing global Molecular Diagnostics market with high product margin
potential is becoming increasingly recognised by healthcare companies, for example GeneOhm and TM
BioSciences were recently acquired by larger players. Furthermore, healthcare giant Abbott Laboratories
recently announced that it was to sell its core laboratory diagnostics business to GE Healthcare but
would retain its Molecular Diagnostics and Diabetes Care (glucose monitoring) businesses. It is also
likely that the growth of “companion” diagnostics in the pharmacogenomics market segment will lead
to closer alliances with pharmaceutical companies.
The sale of our Critical Care blood gas and electrolyte analyser business has enabled Osmetech to
become a ‘pure play’, well funded molecular diagnostics business operating in a high growth market.
The Company’s recent business development activities have given Osmetech the financial flexibility to
execute its strategy of building a portfolio of commercial-stage molecular diagnostic products. We
expect to be able to add further content in order to develop a pipeline of new molecular diagnostic
tests to be run on the Company’s instrument platforms. In addition, we anticipate that we will be able to
secure license agreements and partnerships to leverage the Company’s assets in non-healthcare
diagnostic markets, where predicted growth rates are similarly attractive.
We have a growing presence in this exciting market. With our experienced management and a proven
product technology backed by a strong intellectual property portfolio, Osmetech has considerable
scope to build significant value in its Molecular Diagnostics Division.

Principal activities, trading review and future developments
The principal activity of the Group is the design, development, manufacture and sale of healthcare diagnostics and medical
devices incorporating sensing technology.
The principal activities of the subsidiaries, Osmetech Inc and Clinical Micro Sensors Inc, are the same as Osmetech plc. Osmetech
Technology Inc, is a holding Company. Osmetech GmbH was established as a sales operation having exclusive rights to distribute
Osmetech’s Critical Care Division products in Germany, prior to the disposal of the Division. Molecular Sensing Limited, Molecular
Sensors Limited are dormant companies.The principal activity of the seventh subsidiary, Osmetech AESOP Trustee Limited, is to
act as a trustee to an employee share ownership trust.
Enhanced Business Review
Operations
Osmetech is a fast developing, international healthcare diagnostics business with operations in Boston and Pasadena in the US
serving the high growth Molecular Diagnostics market targeting hospitals and reference laboratories. Osmetech Molecular
Diagnostics has been built through the acquisitions and subsequent development of the businesses of Molecular Sensing plc in
2004 and Clinical Micro Sensors Inc (‘CMS’) in 2005.
On 31 January 2007, the Group’s Critical Care blood gas and electrolyte analyser business based in Atlanta, US was sold for
$44.9m representing a significant return on the original investment made when this business was acquired in 2003. Whilst the
results for 2006 and 2005 include those of the Critical Care Division (“CCD”), these have been separately disclosed as discontinued
operations. Detailed commentary in relation CCD is not relevant to the future performance of the Group and therefore this review
concentrates on our Molecular Diagnostics business.
The financial position and performance of the Group is set out on pages 17 to 20. A review of the business, its markets and future
developments is included in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive Officer’s Reports set out on pages 2 to 7.
Business risks
The Board considers that the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group may be summarised as follows:
• Recruitment and retention of employees: The Group operates in a knowledge based industry employing many highly skilled,
specialist staff. The Group aims to provide a challenging and rewarding working environment for its employees and has share
options incentives for key staff.
• Regulatory compliance: Osmetech operates in a regulated industry with its US based operations and market governed by the
requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We have received FDA 510k Pre-marketing Approval for our
Cystic Fibrosis carrier detection test and eSensor
®
4800 DNA Detection instrument platform and it is our intention to produce
other FDA cleared tests in the future. Both of our US sites operate under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP).
Securing and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals, accreditations and quality standards is of fundamental
importance to the future success of the Group.
Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 9 Report of the directors
continued
Enhanced Business Review continued
• Product development: Although the Directors believe that there is a strong and growing demand for the molecular diagnostics
products being developed by the Group, the ability of these products to meet the specifications demanded and therefore the
speed of market penetration and the achievability of target prices is not certain. Prior to acquisition or license by Osmetech,
the Group’s core technologies have received considerable investment and we believe that the principal technological and
scientific risks have now largely been overcome. Additional efforts are continuing in production scale up in order to meet
increasing market demands.
• Market Acceptance of Osmetech’s Products: Commercial success will be dependent upon on the market acceptance of the
Group’s products, including the ability to: convince customers that the Enlarged Group’s technology is an attractive alternative
to other technologies; manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost; and sell,
place and service sufficient quantities of the products. The Group believes that the market opportunities for genetic testing in
particular are considerable, driven by improved patient care and healthcare cost management. These benefits have been
recognised by the FDA who welcome the prospect of further approved tests to promote the wider use of such testing.
• Intellectual Property Rights (“IP”). The Group’s success relies in part on maintaining meaningful patent protection on its
inventions, technologies and discoveries. To compete effectively the Group will depend on its ability to develop and maintain
proprietary aspects of its technology, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others or, if necessary, to
obtain rights to third-party proprietary rights. Whilst this is a complex area the Directors believe that Osmetech has a strong IP
position, particularly in the field of electro-chemical detection. The molecular diagnostics market is at a relatively early stage of
development and we believe that Osmetech’s IP will create barriers to entry.
Key performance indicators
The principal key performance indicators (“KPIs”) are detailed below:
• As reported on page 27, research and development costs in the year amounted to £5,601,000 (8 months ended 31 December
2005 – £2,665,000). Included within these total amounts are £4,768,000 (8 months ended 31 December 2005 – £2,120,000)
relating to continuing operations. In addition to the specific comments in the Chief Executive’s Report, we consider that
successful progress with product development activities is critical to the future success of the business for which KPIs are
difficult to quantify. Product development programmes for our Molecular Diagnostics Division are described in detail in the
Chief Executive’s Report.
• As reported on page 20, operating cash outflows during the period were £11.2m (8 months ended 31 December 2005 – £4.3m),
of which £11.2m (8 months ended 31 December 2005 – £4.5m) related to continuing operations.
• As reported on page 18, the Group had a total of £7,089,000 of cash and liquid resources at 31 December 2006 (2005 –
£7,207,000). These balances increased significantly on 31 January following the sale of the Critical Care Division.
• As reported on page 27, the Group increased its average headcount in the year by 34% to 159 full-time equivalent employees
(2005 – 119). Of these totals, average headcount relating to continuing operations was 75 in the year (2005 – 41). Voluntary staff
turnover in the year for continuing operations was 15% (2005 – 15%), which we believe to be relatively stable compared with
our industry peers.
Charitable and political contributions
The Group did not make any charitable or political contributions during the year (31 December 2005: £NIL).

Compliance
The Company is mindful of the provisions of the Combined Code. However, as an AIM listed company, the Combined Code is not
mandatory and the Company has therefore not produced a separate Corporate Governance or Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Going Concern
Having reviewed the Group’s budgets and financial projections and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The financial
statements, therefore, are prepared on a going concern basis.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law. The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Company
and of the Group and of the profit and loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent and;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business
Each person who is a director at the date of the approval of this report confirms that:
1) so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and:
2) the director has taken all steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any information and
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of S234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the web site is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that have occurred
to the information contained in the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements and other information
included in the annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Supplier Payment Policy
The Company has due regard to the payment terms of suppliers and settles all undisputed accounts in accordance with the
payment terms agreed with the supplier for each business transaction. The Group had 15 days (31 December 2005 – 39 days) of
purchases outstanding at the end of the financial year.

CREST
The Company’s ordinary shares are eligible for settlement through CREST, the system for securities to be held and transferred in
electronic form rather than in paper. Shareholders are not obliged to use CREST and can continue to hold and transfer shares in
paper without loss of rights.
Independent Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s auditor will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Electronic Communications
The Company may deliver shareholder information including Annual and Interim Reports, Forms of Proxy and Notices of General
Meetings in an electronic format to shareholders.
Shareholders wishing to receive shareholder information in the conventional printed form will continue to do so and need take no
further action. If you would like to receive shareholder information in electronic format, please register your request on the
Company’s Registrar’s electronic database at www.capitaregistrars.com. You will initially need your unique “investor code”, which
you will find at the top of your share certificate. There is no charge for this service. If you wish to subsequently change your mind,
you may do so by contacting the Company’s Registrars by post or through their web site.
If you elect to receive shareholder information electronically, please note that it is the shareholder’s responsibility to notify the
Company of any change to their name, address, e-mail address or other contact details. Shareholders should also note that, with
electronic communication, the Company’s obligations will be satisfied when it transmits the notification of availability of
information or such other document as may be involved to the electronic address it has on file. The Company cannot be held
responsible for any failure in transmission beyond its control any more than it can for postal failure. In the event of the Company
becoming aware that an electronic notification is not successfully transmitted, a further two attempts will be made. In the event
that the transmission is still unsuccessful a hard copy of the notification will be mailed to the shareholder. In the event that specific
software is required to access information placed on the Company’s website it will be available via the website without charge.
Before electing for electronic communications shareholders should ensure that they have the appropriate equipment and
computer capabilities sufficient for the purpose. The Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure no viruses are present in
any communication it sends out but cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any e-mail
or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to
use. Any electronic communication received by the Company that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.
Should you have any further questions on this please contact the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars on 0870 162 3131.
Annual General Meeting – Explanation of Special Business
Resolution 6
The Directors may only allot shares or grant rights over shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. The general authority
granted at the annual general meeting held on 3 May 2006 is due to expire at the annual general meeting in 2007. Accordingly,
Resolution 6 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant a new authority to allot unissued share capital up to an aggregate
nominal value of £67,605 (representing 67,605,000 ordinary shares of 0.10p each, being approximately one third of the total issued
ordinary share capital as at 20 March 2007). If given, this authority will expire at the earlier of (A) 30 June 2008 and (B) the
conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2008. Other than in respect of the Company’s
obligations under its employee share schemes, the Directors have no present intention of utilising the authority set out in this
resolution to issue any of the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company.
Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 13 Report of the directors
continued
Resolution 7
The Directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares
where they propose to do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The general authority
granted at the annual general meeting held on 3 May 2006 is due to expire at the annual general meeting in 2007. Accordingly,
Resolution 7 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such authority. If given, this authority will expire at the earlier of (A)
30 June 2008 and (B) the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2008. Apart from rights
issues, open offers and other pre-emptive issues, the authority will be limited to the issue of shares and sale of treasury shares for
cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £ 40,563 (being 40,563,000 ordinary shares of 0.10p each, representing approximately 20
per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital at 20 March 2007). This authority does not accord with IPC guidelines, but the
directors regard the authority as desirable to maximise the options open to the Company in the coming year.
Resolution 8
Resolution 8 will give the Company authority to purchase its own shares in the markets up to a limit of 10 per cent. of its issued
ordinary share capital as at 20 March 2007. The Company will only be able to purchase its own shares pursuant to this authority to
the extent that it has sufficient distributable reserves. The Company does not currently have any distributable reserves.
Nevetheless, the Directors believe it is advantageous for the Company to have this authority in place so that, if and when it does
have such reserves, the Company has the flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares in order to manage its capital
base.
If the Company were to be in a position to be able to utilise this authority, the maximum and minimum prices at which it can
purchase its own shares are stated in the resolution. In the event that shares are purchased, they would either be cancelled (and
the number of shares in issue would be reduced accordingly) or, subject to the Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury
Shares) Regulations 2003 (the “Regulations”), retained as treasury shares. The Regulations enable companies to hold shares
repurchased as treasury shares with a view to possible re-sale at a future date rather than having to cancel them. The Company will
consider holding repurchased shares pursuant to the authority conferred by this resolution as treasury shares. This would give the
Company the ability to re-issue treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional
flexibility in the management of its capital base. In the event that the Company has sufficient distributable reserves, the Directors
will only exercise this authority if they are satisfied that a purchase would result in an increase in expected earnings per share and
would be in the interests of shareholders generally.

14 Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Independent auditors’ report
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Osmetech plc
We have audited the group and individual company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Osmetech plc for the year
ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the consolidated and individual company
balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement and its associated notes a) to c), the consolidated statement of total
recognised gains and losses, the statement of accounting polices and the related notes 1 to 27. These financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant
financial reporting framework and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you
whether in our opinion, the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. In addition, we report to you, if in our
opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions with the company
and other members of the group is not disclosed.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the
Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of
the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the company and the
group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy
of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and

1  Accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account. The following accounting policies have all been applied
consistently throughout the year, with the exception of the policy for share-based payments which is explained in Note 24.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the financial statements of Osmetech plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to
31 December 2006. The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to consolidate the results of its subsidiary
undertakings. The results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition.
Changes in accounting policies
The financial statements reflect the adoption of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payments’ (‘FRS 20’). The prior period figures have been
restated, as set out in Note 24 to include the cost and balance sheet position under FRS 20.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Acquisitions and Disposals
On acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the Group’s share of net separable assets under the acquisition method in
FRS 6 ‘Acquisitions and Mergers’. Where there is no readily ascertainable market, the fair value of intangible assets purchased as
part of a business acquisition is limited to an amount that does not create or increase negative goodwill. The results and cash flow
relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated cash flow statement from the
date of acquisition.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, is
capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. This is presumed to be between 10 and 15 years
depending on the business acquired, unless circumstances change significantly resulting in an impairment of the carrying value.
Turnover
Turnover represents sales of goods and services to third parties as well as income received from licence and development
agreements. Turnover is stated exclusive of value added tax and other sales related taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods,
typically instruments and consumables, is recognised when the goods are shipped or despatched. Revenue from services is
recognised either in the period invoiced or if the service relates to a specific period, the revenue is recognised evenly over the
period to which the charges relate.
Income from licence and development agreements is typically in the form of fees on signature, milestone payments on the
achievement of pre-determined events and royalties on the sale of the product once marketed. Turnover is recognised when
licence rights are granted to the extent that the Group has performed its contractual obligations, based on the fair value of the
right to consideration for each component of the agreement. Unearned amounts are carried forward as deferred income
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Notes forming part of the financial statements
continued
24 Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006
1  Accounting policies continued
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets, except for assets under
construction, over expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following rates:
Short leasehold improvements – over the life of lease
Plant, machinery and laboratory equipment – 10 – 35% per annum on cost
Office equipment – 25 – 50% per annum on cost
No depreciation is charged in respect of assets under construction until the assets are fully completed at which point they are
transferred into plant, machinery and laboratory equipment.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, research and development tax credits and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected
to be paid or recovered using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a
right to pay less tax at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing
differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in
which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more
likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Finance costs
Finance costs associated with the issue of debt are deducted from the proceeds of the issue and charged to profit over the term
of the debt so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Financial instruments
In relation to the disclosures made in note 26:
• Short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities.
• The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
• Forward exchange contracts are used to fix the value of the related asset or liability in the contract currency and at the contract
rate and any gains or losses on these instruments are offset. Where the instrument is used to hedge a committed or probable
future transaction, gains and losses are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Foreign currency
Profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rate. Assets and liabilities of
the foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences which arise from translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiary undertakings and the translation of
the profit and loss between closing rate and average rate are taken to reserves.
All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings,
which, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, are taken directly to
reserves to the extent of the exchange differences arising on the net investment in those enterprises. Notes forming part of the financial statements
continued
Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 25
1  Accounting policies continued
Intellectual property rights
Patent costs are capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over the shorter of the life of the patent or its useful economic
life. The Group’s other intellectual property rights are stated at cost and amortised over their useful economic lives in relation to
revenues generated.
Licences
Licences are depreciated over the life of the product to which it relates, after the first sale of the product.
All research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Stock
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated as follows:
Raw materials – cost of purchase on first in, first out basis
Finished goods – cost of raw materials and labour and attributable overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal.
Pension costs
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they
become payable.
Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on
such a basis.
Share based compensation arrangements
The Group operates equity-settled share based compensation plans. In accordance with transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as at 1 May 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share based payments are measured
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expressed on a straight line basis over the vesting
period, based on estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. Fair value is based on both Black-Scholes and
binomial models, according to the relevant measures of performance.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable with
the impact of any revision being recognised in the profit and loss account and a corresponding adjustment to reserves over the
remaining vesting period. The proceeds received net of any transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and
share premium when the options are exercised. Notes forming part of the financial statements

Factors that may affect the future tax charge
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of timing differences relating to tax losses carried forward as there is
insufficient evidence that the asset will be recovered. The amount of the asset not recognised at a standard rate of 30% is
£11.1 million (31 December 2005 – £8.5 million). In addition, a deferred tax asset in respect of capital allowances of £110,000
(31 December 2005 – £335,000) has not been recognised. These assets will be recoverable if the Group generates profits in the
future from the same trade in which the losses were incurred.
9  Loss attributable to the Company
The loss for the financial year dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company was £1,840,809 (eight months ended
31 December 2005 as restated – £1,467,667). As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss
account is presented in respect of the parent company. Notes forming part of the financial statements

FRS 22 requires presentation of diluted Earnings per share when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would
decrease net profit or increase net loss per share. For a loss making company with outstanding share options, net loss per share
would only be increased by the exercise of out-of-the-money options. Since it is inappropriate to assume that option holders
would act irrationally, no adjustment is made to diluted Earnings per share for out-of-the-money share options.

Employee participation in these schemes is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee or senior management of the
Company. Share options granted under LTIPs, EMI Plan and Unapproved Options dated 2 September 2005 are exercisable at a
price of 0.1 pence per share subject to the achievement of specific non-market based performance criteria. For LTIPs, exercise is
also subject to the achievement of share price targets. All other options are exercisable at a price equal to equal to the average
quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant and generally vest between 1 and 3 years.
Options are generally exercisable for a period up to 10 years after grant and are forfeited if the employee leaves the group before
the options vest. At 31 December 2006 all options are equity-settled. Following the sale of the Company’s Critical Care Division
(“CCD”) on 31 January 2007, the US Plan was amended to allow the Company to cash settle options held by CCD employees
leaving the Group (“CCD Options”). For those option holders wishing to exercise and immediately sell their shares, the Company
intends to cash settle any appreciation in value calculated on the difference between the closing bid price of an Osmetech share
on the date of exercise and the related exercise price. At 31 December 2006, the CCD Options totalled 5,055,000 (2005 –
2,600,000) and have an exercise period expiring on 31 December 2007.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the date of grant
of equity settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of the LTIPs is measured by use of a binomial model. The Black Scholes model is used to determine the fair value of
other options. The models include adjustments, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and
behavioural considerations. The option life is derived by the models based on these assumptions and other assumptions identified
below. Expected volatility is calculated using an analysis of volatility over an historical 3 year period.
The total expense included within operating loss in respect of share-based payments was £781,000 (8 months ended 31 December
2005 – £432,000).

26  Financial instruments
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard
13 (FRS 13) and Financial Reporting Standard 25 (FRS 25)– “Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures”. Certain
financial assets such as investments in subsidiaries are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS 13 and FRS 25, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures other than the
currency risk disclosures.
There is no material difference between the fair values and book values of the Group’s financial instruments, either in the current or
prior year.
The Group’s treasury activities are designed to provide suitable, flexible funding arrangements to satisfy its requirements. The
Group uses financial instruments comprising cash and term deposits. The main risks arising from the Group financial instruments
are interest rate and liquidity risks. The Board reviews policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged from previous years. Notes forming part of the financial statements
continued
Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2006 41
26  Financial instruments continued
The Group aims to achieve a balance between continuity and flexibility of funding by maintaining a range of maturities on its liquid
resources. The Group also mixes the duration of its deposits to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations.
The Group has limited foreign currency risk since overseas subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses denominated
predominantly in the currencies of the countries in which they operate. All monetary assets and liabilities of the Group are materially
denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
There is no material difference between the fair values and book values of the Group’s financial instruments.

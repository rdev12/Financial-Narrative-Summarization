Strategic report: Overview
LampreLL  
at a gLance
Lamprell delivered exceptional financial performance 
in 2014 as a result of strong project execution.  
2014 saw us deliver nine major projects, a record 
for the Company . The Group was successful in 
converting a significant proportion of its bid  
pipeline with six new build jackup rig orders won  
and a number of other smaller awards signed.  
The year also saw the Company achieve significant 
milestones by completing its largest rig conversion 
project (“MOS Frontier”) and delivering the last of  
the problematic projects (the Caspian Sea jackup  
rig “Mercury”). Both the Land Rigs and Engineering 
& Construction business units, while still relatively 
small contributors, saw significant growth during 
2014. The debt refinancing and the rights issue  
were completed in 2014 and have re-established  
the Group with a strong balance sheet.

Strategic report: Chairman’s statement
strengthening 
our business
2014 was a successful 
year for Lamprell. I am 
pleased to report on the 
significant progress achieved 
operationally and financially .
Following its return to profitability in 2013, 
the Group completed its recovery process 
in delivering an exceptional financial 
performance and a number of major 
operational milestones. These results have 
been driven by strong project execution and 
major business improvements, allowing the 
Group to deliver improved returns. 
Delivering strong performance
This improved performance has been 
possible as a result of robust project 
execution and the implementation of 
important structural changes. A strong  
cost discipline has been established,  
with significant reductions achieved.  
This is being monitored closely by the 
Board. The safety and quality standards 
in our yards are paramount and in 2014 
achieved world-class levels. The Company 
disposed of a non-core business to allow 
the management team to focus on core 
markets. Lamprell is now leaner , fitter and 
stronger , and aiming to accomplish more.
Strategy
Beyond operational performance, Lamprell’s 
overall success is highly geared to its  
ability to win new business. In the first half 
of 2014, we took steps to overhaul our 
strategy and the business development 
function to ensure that the Group remains 
competitive. The Board reviewed the 
strategy  page 08 and concluded that 
there was a need to focus on our core 
markets in the short to medium term.  
Our long-term goal is to broaden our 
offering into related areas such as the 
modular plant and FPSO markets where 
we have already been successful and 
have a proven track record. In doing 
this we will leverage the Group’s proven 
expertise in project execution to diversify 
our client base. Key strategic principles are: 
focus on high quality clients, on improved 
margin projects and on bids with a higher 
probability of winning. 
Financial platform and stakeholders
A strong financial platform was put in  
place in 2014 to enable the management 
team to implement our strategy . The rights 
issue and refinancing allowed us to ensure 
there is now a strong balance sheet and 
sufficient cash resources to support the 
strategy implementation. 
In line with our commitment to best 
practice in corporate governance, we 
maintained clear controls and looked to 
enhance certain processes such as risk 
management  page 14. Our primary 
focus was on greater communication and 
transparency with our investors when we 
explained the drivers behind the rights 
issue and refinancing; we appreciate the 
overwhelming support we received for  
these transactions. 
Markets
In the final quarter of 2014 we saw a 
significant deterioration in the oil & gas 
markets and reductions in industry capital 
expenditure programmes following a steep 
decline in oil prices. In a period of uncertain 
market environment, the Board has ensured 
that the management team’s remuneration 
targets are stretching and closely linked  
to the Company’s strategic objectives 
 page 55. Our management team is 
measured against every pillar of our 
strategy for success, including Lamprell’s 
safety record, cost management, delivery 
of operational efficiencies and financial 
performance.

Non-Executive Chairman Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

deFining  
our vaL ues
Jim Moffat was appointed to 
the Board in March 2013 as 
Chief Executive Officer . With 
over 35 years in the industry, 
Jim has brought a wealth of 
experience which has seen 
the Group achieve a number 
of records in 2014 and 
deliver the most profitable 
year in its history . 
Q  What were the major highlights and 
your main focus during 2014?
We have seen improvements in virtually 
every aspect of our business. For me, 2014 
was about strengthening the Company and 
building a solid platform for future growth. 
The previous year was focused on steadying 
the ship with our “back to basics” approach. 
Our successful turnaround in 2013 resulted 
in a better start to 2014 and a return to 
profitability . We were therefore able to build 
on this and focus instead on future growth by 
refining and implementing our strategy .
Q  Is the turnaround now complete and 
are the legacy issues in the past?
Lamprell as a business has recovered 
from a loss of USD 110 million in 2012 to 
deliver a profit of nearly USD 120 million in 
2014 which is an impressive achievement. 
We have retained Lamprell’s fundamental 
strengths and based on these we have 
built a business that is financially and 
structurally sound, with a new approach 
to business development, using the robust 
bid procedures now in place. The past 
issues have been addressed and legacy 
projects completed; we have enhanced 
certain systems, including the rollout of a 
new ERP system to assist with monitoring 
and accountability . We can now confidently 
say that the business has moved on from 
securing its recovery to building its future. 
Our exceptional financial performance  
in 2014  page 18 is clear evidence of  
our recovery .
Q  What were your key business 
decisions in 2014?
The return to profitability allowed us to review 
the debt and equity structure of the Company 
from a position of renewed strength. The 
terms of the previous financing package  
that had been secured in 2013 were onerous 
and only represented a short-term financing 
solution. We recognised the need for 
additional financial firepower to fund our  
near-term plans and longer-term ambitions. 
With this in mind, we approached our banks 
and investors requesting a new financial 
structure  page 19, consisting of an equity 
injection through a rights issue and a full 
debt refinancing. Our plans were met with 
overwhelming support and resulted in a fully 
underwritten rights issue of USD 120 million 
and new debt facilities of USD 350 million.

Strategic report: Chief Executive’s review
This strengthened balance sheet allowed 
us to implement the key elements of 
our strategy: we commenced a major 
capital investment programme for our 
facilities which will improve our operational 
performance and strengthen our 
competitive position by reducing our costs. 
Q  What have been your operational 
priorities?
Based on an analysis of our operational 
performance for 2013, our core business 
was solid but there was room for significant 
improvements to make Lamprell more 
efficient and productive. On the one 
hand, we had a well-trained workforce; 
good facilities with substantial access to 
quayside; a proven track record and culture 
of delivery, and client-friendly service. 
On the other hand, some of the existing 
techniques required modernisation to 
enhance productivity . In other words, we 
were building high quality products, on time 
and on budget, but I felt that we could do it 
more efficiently and at lower cost.
In order to improve the way we operated, 
we outlined a series of productivity 
and efficiency measures under “Project 
Evolution”. This formed a key component 
of our strategy and half of the funds raised 
in the rights issue were directed towards 
the funding of these measures. Project 
Evolution has been under way since  
mid-2014 and is expected to reach the  
full savings runrate in 2016.
Q  How is Project Evolution going to 
improve your operations?
Project Evolution is intended to improve 
the processes and infrastructure on which 
our operations rely on a day-to-day basis. 
Every aspect of our operation is affected 
– projects, production, engineering, 
procurement, finance, HR, administration 
and IT . We are fortunate to have access to a 
dedicated, well-trained and cost-competitive 
workforce but we are working towards a 
better balance between modern techniques 
and the use of manual labour . For example, 
we are introducing a panel line and beam 
cutting machines in Hamriyah which are 
anticipated to reduce the total manhours 
per project significantly .
We anticipate that Project Evolution 
will also reduce costs associated with 
construction. For example, over the 
course of the last year we have replaced 
stick welding in our yards with flux cored 
arc welding, a more modern technique. 
This is expected to result in a saving 
of up to a third of welders’ time, which 
will have considerable cost implications 
in a business like ours where welding 
accounts for about a third of the total 
manhours spent on building a jackup rig. 
In total, there are over 20 initiatives under 
Project Evolution which will result in a better 
layout and a higher degree of automation in 
our yards, leading to more efficient and cost 
effective operations.
Q  What are the other key pillars of 
success in your strategy?
A strong competitive position relies on 
robust project execution, the right approach 
to business development and a long-term 
vision for growth. Project Evolution will go 
a long way to raising the efficiency of our 
operations but, in order for Lamprell to 
improve, we have been working to embed 
a culture of continuous improvement 
into every aspect of our business, and 
then measure performance against key 
performance indicators.
With our operations improving, we also 
analysed our core markets  page 13 to 
understand our position in the competitive 
landscape. Lamprell remained strong 
in winning orders based on our existing 
strengths of safety  page 21, quality and 
reliability; however , we noted competitors’ 
commercial advantage to offer back-ended 
payments, whereby clients would use the 
fabrication yard’s balance sheet to facilitate 
project construction. The debt refinancing 
package we secured in the summer of 
2014 enables us to offer this option which 
effectively levelled the playing field. This 
significantly broadened our addressable 
market and has already contributed to us 
securing additional contract wins, albeit 
without having to draw on the funding facility .
Safety We deliver world class safety standards and leave 
nothing to chance so everyone goes home safely .
Fiscal responsibility Because every employee influences 
our costs, we are all accountable to ensure that we achieve the 
most cost effective solutions.
Integrity We conduct our business honestly , with professional 
integrity , fairly and transparently , and we are open and ethical in 
our day-to-day dealings with all stakeholders.
Accountability We deliver what we say we will.
Teamwork We strive to work together with our stakeholders and 
believe great teams can achieve incredible things.
our  
vaLues Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Our approach to winning business has  
been restructured and improved further  
with the hire of a seasoned marketing  
and commercial team. A new Chief 
Commercial Officer and VP Business 
Development have worked on developing 
and implementing a new approach to the 
way that invitations to tender are assessed, 
ranked and submitted  page 10. This 
ensures that our marketing efforts target 
those prospects which are expected to 
suit our yards and facilities best and thus 
yield better returns on investment based 
on the highest probability of a successful 
contract award. This new approach has 
already resulted in us winning a record 
number of awards and the management 
team is looking to use these systems to 
improve the quality of our backlog.
This, along with Project Evolution, helps 
Lamprell to become even more competitive, 
but there are other aspects of the 
business that are crucial to our success.
Q  What other aspects of the strategy  
are you particularly proud of?
Safety is paramount in our operations  
 page 21. I see this as a non-negotiable 
factor in our success – for our staff, our 
clients and ultimately all our stakeholders. 
Lamprell has always operated relatively 
safely but, much in the same way as 
with operations, I saw opportunities for 
substantial improvement. We hired a VP 
of HSESQ in 2013 who has overhauled 
Lamprell’s approach and standards. The 
results speak for themselves: we have cut 
our Total Recordable Injury Rate (“TRIR”) 
to less than half of 0.67 in 2013, which is 
good, to 0.28 in 2014, which is industry 
leading. This is a key consideration for 
high quality operators in making contract 
awards, but most importantly it creates the 
right environment for our operations.
Our operational performance in 2014 was 
strong. We delivered nine major projects, 
a record for the Group. We delivered all 
projects as planned and on budget, and 
as a result made a number of savings, 
benefiting from the release of contingencies 
as well as early results from Project 
Evolution. This had a positive impact on 
our financial performance, which was 
exceptionally strong in 2014. 
This year has seen some major achievements 
in our yards. The Nexen PUQ deck made it 
into the Guinness World Book of Records 
 page 23. We completed our largest 
rig conversion project to date, the “MOS 
Frontier”. We also delivered the last of 
the problematic projects, the “Mercury” 
Caspian Sea rig, which was a challenging 
project with remote operations. Both were 
delivered without a single day away from 
work case. We secured three contracts to 
build six new jackup rigs, two for Ensco, 
two for Shelf Drilling and two for our largest 
client, National Drilling Company (“NDC”). 
We concluded the year with the delivery of 
“Shuwehat”, the third rig delivered in 2014 
to one client, NDC  page 28, another 
record for Lamprell. 
Q  Do you expect to be able to maintain 
this strong performance in the 
challenging market conditions? 
Our financial performance in 2014 was 
exceptional. We will maintain the high 
standards of operational performance 
which was a key factor to the results of 
2014; however in 2015 our ongoing projects 
are at different stages in their construction 
cycles. In addition, the wider market 
environment is weak due to the current oil 
price. Lamprell entered 2015 in a position 
of relative strength – our balance sheet is 
robust, we have a strong cash position, 
we have a high proportion of this year’s 
revenue secured and a good bid pipeline.
The sharp market deterioration at the end of 
the year has brought significant uncertainty 
around 2015. Our business has a certain 
degree of flexibility built in and my team 
will look to mitigate the impact on Lamprell. 
With the Board’s support and direction, 
we expect to be able to weather the storm, 
but pressure on margins and the inevitable 
slowdown is likely to affect everyone in the 
industry . Our focus will be on maintaining 
the highest standards of project execution 
and using our competitive position to 
convert our pipeline into wins.

Strategic report: Pipeline and opportunities
our business modeL  
converts opportunities
We have a prospect pipeline management system 
which allows us to apply the various elements of our 
business model to convert the higher priority targets 
into bidding prospects. Over the last 12 months, we 
have refined the system to improve both the quality 
of the bid pipeline and also the probability of winning 
new work. 
Conversion of the bid pipeline into contract awards 
is based around the strong relationships we have 
established with many leading industry clients 
and prime contractors. We had a record year for 
converting prospects into awards and successfully 
increased our pipeline by 10% to USD 5.2 billion.
Project Evolution’s vision is to 
construct best in class products at 
lower cost with improved facilities, 
efficient people and processes. 
With the safest and best resources, 
optimised processes, connected 
technology and a continuous 
improvement culture, Project 
Evolution aims to reduce costs 
and add value to the bottom line. 
In 2014, 20% of Evolution’s key 
milestones were completed and 
the project is now allowing us to 
reduce costs to our bids and  
new projects alike.
Strong pipeline and high 
bidding activity
Bid pipeline was USD 5.2 billion as  
of the end of 2014 (31 December

New build jackup rigs
We were highly successful in converting 
orders for new build, shallow water jackup 
rigs in 2014, with a record six orders for 
new rigs in a single year , plus options for an 
additional five rigs. All the orders were for 
high specification, LeTourneau-designed 
rigs of a Super 116E (Enhanced) Class; 
however , in line with our reputation for 
working with clients to meet their needs, 
we tailored the final rig designs to each 
client’s particular requirements. We are able 
to structure our offering if a client requests 
a rig of different design, having delivered 
a total of 18 new build jackup drilling rigs 
since 2006.
Offshore/onshore construction
Over the long-term, global demand for 
offshore and onshore modular construction 
in energy markets remains strong and this 
is reflected in our prospects pipeline with 
approximately 60% being associated with 
this sector . Our business model for these 
projects is structured around our ability 
to deliver a safe, high quality product at 
competitive prices. These prospects are 
typically based around a tendering process 
which can take up to 12 months to reach 
contract award. This provides greater 
visibility on future prospects for targeting 
purposes.  
We have a strong track record in modular 
construction and we are well placed both 
geographically and technically to offer 
differentiated standalone fabrication or 
EPC services. In 2014 we successfully 
secured a contract for the fabrication of 
over 10,000 tonnes of piperack modules for 
the Petrofac/ZADCO project in Abu Dhabi, 
as well as several other smaller projects in 
this sector .  
Rig refurbishment/conversion
Typical rig refurbishment and conversion 
projects have a short bid-to-award profile 
and therefore the number of prospects in 
the pipeline can be limited due to the short-
term time span. Rig refurbishment projects 
vary greatly in scope from project to project 
and can have a work schedule lasting a 
few weeks to potentially 12 months. With 
about 30% of the jackup fleet older than 35 
years by 2017, this reflects positively on the 
demand for rig refurbishment projects. 
Clients typically focus on the following  
key drivers: geographical proximity of the 
yard, reliability, ability to respond quickly 
and price. These drivers are aligned 
with our key strengths, which we use to 
differentiate our position as the leading 
regional rig refurbishment business.  
There was good activity with 14 rig  
upgrade projects undertaken in 2014, 
including the largest ever rig conversion  
in the history of the Group. 
Contract types
Our contracts fall primarily into three 
categories: lump sum, unit rate and cost 
reimbursable.  
 » Lump sum contracts (primarily the 
new build jackups and EPC projects) 
are for a total fixed price for a defined 
scope of work covering engineering, 
procurement, subcontracts, fabrication 
and pre-commissioning services. This 
is the highest risk category for us and 
to do this we have developed a robust 
risk review management and oversight 
process. 
 » Unit rate contracts (predominantly for 
offshore/onshore module fabrication) 
are based on agreed fixed rates for a 
specifically defined unit of work. The 
contracts are subject to final adjustment 
based on the actual material quantity 
take-offs. 
 » Cost reimbursable contracts usually 
comprise schedules of pre-agreed 
hourly or daily rates with materials and 
subcontracts reimbursed on a cost plus 
mark-up basis. This type of contract 
is most common in the upgrade and 
refurbishment of rigs.

Macroeconomic factors 
and strategy 
The oil price volatility in late 2014 is 
expected to create near-term uncertainty, 
with many leading oil companies reducing 
their capital expenditure, particularly 
on projects in the deepwater and Arctic 
environment segments. However we 
do not participate in these segments, 
our expertise being primarily focused 
around shallow water activities. 
The current low oil prices are creating 
challenges to our clients, however the  
long-term market fundamentals remain 
strong as outlined in a recent report from 
BP (Energy Outlook 2035 Report) with 
primary energy consumption anticipated 
to increase by 1.4% per annum, equating 
to 37% in the next 20 years, with oil & 
gas remaining a major contributor .
1
We expect 2015 to be a challenging 
year . However we have a strong pipeline 
of prospects by geography and by 
product type including major projects 
in the North Sea and Middle East.
The areas of growth in the longer term 
are expected to be in offshore/onshore 
modular construction including FPSO 
facilities and LNG plants. Based on 
our strategic objectives, we are well-
positioned to take advantage, both 
competitively and geographically, of 
the opportunities in these markets.

Ageing current global

2
Approximately 30% of the  
global jackup fleet will be over  
35 years old by 2017. This reflects 
positively on the demand for 
new build jackup rigs and rig 
refurbishment projects.
After a positive start to 2014, the final quarter of 
the year saw a deterioration in the global energy 
market following a significant fall in oil prices. Many 
of the global drillers and IOC’s have subsequently 
announced reductions in their 2015 capital 
expenditure programmes. 
While business development and tendering continues 
apace, our ability to win new business is contingent 
on the state of the broader industry . The scale of the 
downturn will remain unclear until the market and 
commodity prices stabilise. The outlook for the oilfield 
services sector looks challenging in the near term; 
however the energy industry is based on strong  
long-term fundamentals.

New build  
jackup rigs
After the historic  
highs of 79 rig orders 
in 2013, the market 
returned to more typical 
levels with 38 new rig 
orders in 2014. It is 
expected to see lower 
order levels in 2015. 
There is increased 
competition from 
Asia with many of the 
planned 126 new rigs 
being built there to be 
delivered between 2015 
and 2017. Lamprell 
remains competitive 
in this market as 
evidenced with six 
rigs won in 2014 and 
options for five more 
with leading clients. 
Offshore/onshore 
construction 
As a result of the capex 
budgetary pressures, 
there will be intense 
competition in the 
short term as a larger 
number of players 
chase fewer energy 
industry, fabrication 
and EPC projects. 
However , the Middle 
East is expected 
to provide good 
opportunities in light of 
the lower oil production 
costs. There are also 
prospects in other 
markets which suffer 
from high costs and/
or lower infrastructure 
capabilities. 
Rig refurbishment/
conversions
The drive to extend rig 
life cycles is expected 
to continue as 30% of 
the global jackup fleet 
will be over 35 years 
old by 2017, although it 
is expected that some 
rigs will be stacked or 
scrapped against the 
backdrop of low oil 
prices. Older assets 
may be maintained 
or converted for 
alternative use such as 
accommodation units. 
Lamprell is the regional 
market leader in this 
market, particularly on 
medium or large-scale 
rig refurbishments and 
conversions. 
Land rig services
The number of land 
rigs in MENA is forecast 
to grow by 20% over 
the next five years 
with Saudi Arabia

. Some 
Middle East onshore 
drilling programmes 
may be impacted by 
volatility in oil prices 
although lower regional 
oil production costs 
mitigate the risk of a 
substantial impact. We 
anticipate long-term 
sustainable regional 
demand for our land 
rig services, and 
specifically our new 
Lamprell-designed land 
rig “LAM 2K”.

Strategic report: Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk ranking, monitoring and profiling
The principles of risk and opportunity are 
becoming part of everyday work processes 
through continuous reviews, workshops, 
knowledge sharing, monitoring, reporting 
and trending. Lamprell believes that robust 
risk and opportunity processes provide 
advantages with regard to:
 » early anticipation of risks within areas of 
the business; 
 » better audit reviews;
 » more robust risk management strategies; 
and 
 » Improved contingency management 
including costs.
Following the meetings with risk owners,  
all project risks are ranked using a 
“probability vs. impact” measurement on  
a high/medium/low basis. The risks are  
also ranked on a gross (pre mitigation) and 
net (post mitigation) basis. Where possible, 
a cost, quality or schedule contingency 
assessment is also undertaken and 
completed. These “bottom-up” risks are 
then logged into a centralised, secure, 
risk and opportunity database and each is 
assigned to the risk owner who owns the 
actions arising out of the risk management 
plan. In addition, the management team 
undertakes a separate, “top-down” 
assessment to identify the key major risks 
and opportunities faced by the Group.
Risk review panel and  
corporate risk reporting
A risk review panel, comprising members of 
the senior management team, meets on a 
monthly basis to review Lamprell’s risk and 
opportunities management process and 
to challenge the effectiveness of selected 
risk management plans. In this way, there is 
greater cohesion between the assessment 
of and alignment between the “bottom-up” 
and “top-down” risks.
In addition, we have taken steps to trend 
and profile our risks on an enterprise basis. 
By reviewing and using this data, we are 
aiming to identify potential major risks at 
an early stage, thereby allowing us to take 
mitigating actions. The risk management 
process and all major risks are reviewed 
with the Board and the Audit & Risk 
Committee at least twice a year . 
Principal risks and uncertainties  
for Lamprell 
While the Group undertakes detailed project 
risk evaluations, the overall Group faces a 
wide variety of risks in connection with its 
business and the operations. We believe 
that the principal risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group are as follows:
we activeL y  
manage our risKs
Analysis of risks
Our profiling of project 
risks confirms that while 
most risk areas remain in 
the operation category, 
the largest percentage of 
“high” risks on a pro rata 
basis are in strategic and 
financial categories for this 
reporting period. Lamprell 
uses this data to prioritise 
those enterprise and project 
risks, and implements 
appropriate risk mitigation 
strategies and activities.
At Lamprell, we are 
committed to actively 
managing our risks. There 
has been additional focus 
during 2014 to ensure that 
the processes for identifying, 
managing, reporting on 
and mitigating the Group’s 
risks are embedded 
within the Group’s various 
business units. This has 
been facilitated with the 
appointment of a Group 
Risk Manager , who meets 
regularly with all risk owners 
and management, allowing 
us to manage our day-to-day 
business more effectively 
and evaluate potential risks 
when bidding for new work.

Securing new  
contracts
As a result of the changes in the oil & gas 
sector during 2014, Lamprell identified that 
demand for its range of services may be 
adversely impacted by a fall in the levels 
of expenditure by oil & gas and renewable 
energy companies
 » Backlog at 31 December 2014 of 
USD 1.2 billion with contract options 
for up to additional USD 0.9 billion
 » Lamprell has a strong bid pipeline 
of USD 5.2 billion
 » Business development to identify 
key clients, maintain client relations 
and develop win strategies with 
competitive tendering
 » Focusing on delivery of high quality 
products which provide a robust 
platform for repeat business
Over-reliance  
on a single product
A significant proportion of the Group’s 
revenue continues to be generated from 
new build jackup drilling rigs. This has led to 
over-reliance on limited rig designs and on 
key suppliers. There is a risk that Lamprell’s 
revenues will be impacted if this rig design 
becomes obsolete or if the key suppliers fail 
to deliver the products forming part of this rig 
design in a timely manner
 » LeTourneau Super 116E remains a 
popular robust design. Demand for 
it is being monitored  
 » Lamprell is looking at alternative rig 
designs 
 » 60% of prospects pipeline 
associated with non-rig products 
and services
 » Lamprell has the capabilities to 
design and build new build rigs and 
vessels within the UAE and on a 
global basis
Fluctuations in  
order book 
Over-reliance on 
limited number of 
customers
The Group’s visible order book can fluctuate 
significantly because the majority of the 
projects are fixed duration lump sum contracts 
or short-term rig refurbishment contracts
If the Group is unable to maintain strong 
relationships with a core group of customers 
or fails to continue to offer them high levels of 
service, the business, financial condition and 
prospects of the Company may be adversely 
affected
 » Strategy in place to diversify our 
addressable markets and broaden 
our client base
 » Lamprell has a range of contract 
types from lump sum through to unit 
rate remeasureable
 » Lamprell is also reviewing the 
use of framework and call off

In order for the business units to remain 
competitive and for the business to grow, it is 
essential for Lamprell to manage its overhead 
cost base and to implement the targeted 
productivity improvements and cost efficiency 
initiatives. Further , in highly challenging market

Strategic report: Financial review
responsibLe 
management
2014 was a year of 
exceptional financial 
performance. It was driven 
by strong project execution, 
as well as some cost savings 
and exceptional gains. We 
finished the year with a 
solid balance sheet and a 
strong net cash position.
Results from operations
The Group continued on its path to financial 
recovery started in 2013. Lamprell’s strong 
operational performance was the main 
driver behind our exceptional financial 
results in 2014.
The Group’s total revenue for the year was 
USD 1,084.9 million, in line with earlier 
guidance. The revenue was mainly driven by 
the new build segment with a contribution 
from rig refurbishment, partially offset 
by weaker revenues in the offshore and 
onshore construction market  page 20. 
The good performance in the refurbishment 
business was supported by the large-scale 
rig conversion project for MOS which was 
delivered in 2014. We delivered nine further 
refurbishment projects by the end of the 
year , albeit of significantly smaller scale.
In 2014, the Group completed a record 
number of major projects with some 
projects being delivered ahead of time 
and also ahead of budget. As a result of 
this improved performance, the project 
contingencies were not utilised, delivering 
enhanced margins. This was also supported 
by some early savings from “Project 
Evolution” being implemented across 
the Group, and by our efforts to reduce 
overheads  page 10.
As a result the Group’s gross margin 
significantly increased over the previous 
year to USD 182.1 million from USD 120.0 
million. Lower offshore/onshore construction 
revenues had a negative mix impact on 
margins but this was more than offset by a 
material improvement in margins in our new 
build jackup rig business. This was partially 
driven by a more favourable phasing of 
the construction cycle, but mainly resulted 
from the Group’s continuing improvement 
in project execution  page 08. As referred 
to earlier , initial procurement savings and 
productivity gains also contributed to our 
strong profitability . Our Land Rig Services 
and our Engineering & Construction 
business units have also contributed  
to the improvement in margins. 
EBITDA excluding discontinued operations 
and exceptional items for the period was 
USD 137.0 million (2013: USD 84.4 million). 
The Group’s EBITDA margin increased  
from 7.9% in 2013 to 12.6% in 2014, 
reflecting the improved operating 
performance of the business.
Finance costs and financing activities
Net finance costs in the period decreased 
to USD 18.3 million (2013: USD 22.0 
million). Interest costs were USD 1.7 million 
lower due to the lower cost of debt following 
the refinancing in the summer .
Net profit after exceptional items and 
earnings per share
The Group recorded a profit for 2014 
attributable to the equity holders of  
USD 118.1 million (2013: USD 36.4 million), 
including a USD 31.3 million gain from 
the disposal of Inspec. The fully diluted 
earnings per share for the year were  
37.38 cents (2013: 12.67 cents).
Capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure in 2014 
increased to USD 22.5 million (2013: USD 
14.6 million). The main area of investment 
consisted of additions to operating 
equipment with the major items being new 
cranes, a new panel line, welding facilities

and to a lesser extent infrastructure. We also 
continue to invest in our new ERP system, 
Oracle, a proven top tier solution that has 
helped us realign our processes with best 
practices and ensure accurate assessment 
of our financial performance. The major 
capital investment programme enabled by 
the rights issue has reduced costs in 2014, 
and will continue to reduce these costs 
with the major part of the investment being 
committed over the course of 2015.
Cash flow and liquidity
The Group’s net cash flow from operating 
activities for 2014 reflected a net outflow of 
USD 39.8 million (2013: net inflow of USD 
117.7 million) primarily driven by increased 
working capital due to the natural cycle of 
major projects. 
Cash and bank balances increased by 
USD 27.1 million during the year , resulting 
from the net proceeds from the rights issue 
and  the disposal of Inspec, less a net 
repayment of debt and net cash outflow 
from operations.
Borrowing and debt refinancing
In 2013, the Group concluded a refinancing 
through a syndicate of banks for an 
aggregate amount of USD 181.0 million. 
In May 2014, the Group agreed with a range 
of banks a new set of funded facilities 
on substantially more favourable terms 
amounting to USD 350 million replacing the 
previous facilities. It comprised (a) a USD 
100 million term loan; (b) USD 50 million 
for general working capital purposes; and 
(c) USD 200 million of working capital for 
project financing. In addition, the lending 
banks committed a USD 250 million 
bonding facility that may be used by the 
Group for project bonding requirements 
in connection with new contract awards 
funded by the working capital project 
financing facility . Along with greater financial 
flexibility, the new facilities have generated 
initial savings at the end of 2014 and are 
expected to deliver lower bonding costs on 
future projects.
Our borrowings were USD 99.0 million  
at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013:  
USD 160.8 million). 
Going concern
After reviewing its cash flow forecasts for a 
period of not less than 12 months from the 
date of signing these financial statements, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. The Group therefore 
continues to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing its financial statements.
Dividends
The repayment of the balance of term 
loan facility B under the 2013 debt facility 
agreement removed the restriction on the 
payment of dividends. Given the ambitious 
investment programme to be funded by the 
proceeds of the rights issue in 2014, as 
well as the uncertain market environment, 
the Directors do not currently recommend 
the payment of a final dividend for 2014. 
However , the Directors recognise the 
importance of dividends and remain 
optimistic about the future of the Group and 
will seek to review and restore the payment 
of a dividend at the most appropriate time.

Safety, quality and reliability 
are at the heart of what  
we do. These and our other 
key strengths set us apart 
from our competitors. They 
underpin our strategy  
and the way we service  
our clients. 
Operational and efficiency improvements
Lamprell has a proven track record for 
reliable project execution in its core  
markets and this has been enhanced 
further with the delivery of all of its nine 
major projects as planned, within budget 
and to the highest standards of safety . As 
well as making a record number of major 
deliveries in 2014, the Group identified 
a number of key focus areas where 
operational efficiencies could be targeted 
with significant cost savings. A project 
team was appointed with the overall aim 
of driving cost savings through more 
efficient use of resources, enhancements 
in operational processes as well as 
driving productivity improvements through 
the upgrade of facilities at our yards, 
collectively known as “Project Evolution”.
Project Evolution is primarily focussed upon 
improvements in four specific areas:
 » production processes; 
 » site layout/workflow; 
 » project management/scheduling; and 
 » procurement.
These were further subdivided into 
more than 20 activities. Improvement 
implementation commenced in mid-2014 
and is expected to run throughout 2015, 
into 2016, before realising the full savings. 
The major equipment contracts relating to 
these initiatives have all now been awarded 
and the Group has started to recognise 
savings achieved during 2014. Major 
activities include the planned introduction 
of an automated panel line in Hamriyah, the 
purchase of new beam cutting machines, 
improvements in yard layout at the Hamriyah 
and Sharjah fabrication yards as well as 
centralised procurement function.  
The Group has also implemented a  
number of fabrication measures such as 
changes in the welding techniques, aimed 
at increasing the efficiency of the Group’s 
production processes. 
The mission of Project Evolution is to  
drive a culture of continuous improvement 
ensuring that Lamprell continues to employ 
the safest and best resources, utilising 
state-of-the-art processes, enabling us to 
continue to deliver products of the highest 
quality to our customers and best value for 
money for the benefit of both clients and the 
Lamprell Group.  
The Group has also made positive  
progress in upgrading its supporting IT 
infrastructure with the implementation  
of the next phase of its ERP . Having 
successfully delivered phase one in late 
2013 (ahead of schedule and under 
budget), the Group scoped the phase two 
requirements in H1 2014 and then kicked 
off implementation in Q3 2014, supported 
by an extensive training programe for all 
personnel on the new system to ensure 
effective knowledge transfer . Phase one 
focussed on the back-office modules of  
HR, payroll and finance whereas phase two 
is targeting the core technical functions  
of engineering, procurement and 
construction. To date, this project has been 
a resounding success for the business and 
is a testament to one of our core values –  
teamwork. Implementation of phase 
two is progressing well and on budget, 
with completion expected in Q3 2015.

New build jackup rigs 
Highlights
Four drilling rigs successfully delivered  
during the year
All projects completed on time and  
within budget 
Significant new contract wins with  
Ensco, Shelf and NDC
Trading review
Our new build jackup drilling business had 
a record year with the delivery of four rigs 
during 2014, the highest annual number of 
jackup deliveries since 2006. This included 
three rigs to one client in a single year , 
another record for Lamprell. In total, as at  
31 December 2014, we have delivered  
18 new build jackup drilling rigs since  
our listing in 2006, including 11 of the  
LeTourneau Super 116E design. 
3 rigs 
delivered to  
one client in 2014
Following the successful delivery of three 
rigs to our largest client NDC (namely 
the “Qarnin”, the “Marawwah” and the 
“Shuwehat”), the Group’s relationship with 
NDC continues to be strong as evidenced 
by the award of another contract in 
November 2014 for an additional two jackup 
rigs plus three optional rigs. In early 2015, 
the Group will deliver the sixth in a series  
of eight rigs to NDC; the construction of  
the two new rigs starts in H1 2015.
The year also saw the successful delivery 
of the “Mercury” rig for operations in 
the Caspian Sea. This project had been 
identified as critical with significant potential 
risk around completion, due to the losses 
suffered on the first Caspian Sea rig 
project. Notwithstanding the complexities of 
delivering a challenging execution model in 
a remote location, the Group delivered the 
rig several weeks ahead of the contracted 
schedule expending nearly four million 
manhours without a day away from work 
case which is a notable safety record. 
Completion of this project represented a 
significant milestone for the Group.
Since the start of 2015, we have handed 
over a second rig, the “Jindal Pioneer”, 
to the Jindal group and delivered the 
“Greatdrill Chaaru” rig to the Greatship 
group. The Group’s strong operational 
performance has continued into the New 
year as all three rigs are expected to be 
delivered as planned and on budget.
In line with our strategy, the Group was 
successful in winning additional jackup rig 
contracts with new clients during 2014. In 
April 2014 the Group secured a contract 
for the construction of two jackup rigs from 
Ensco. We have refurbished rigs for Ensco 
in the past; however this is the first new 
build project we have won for this client. 
Shortly thereafter , in May 2014, the Group 
also signed a contract with first-time client 
Shelf Drilling for the construction of two 
jackup rigs. These projects are in early 
stages of construction and are progressing 
well and as planned. We have established 
regular reporting processes with these new 
clients in order to ensure that we satisfy the 
needs of both.

Trading review
There were positive developments in our 
offshore/onshore construction core market 
which comprises of the construction of 
fixed structures and process modules, as 
well as minor fabrication and site works. 
In April 2014, the Group delivered the 
13,000 plus tonne PUQ deck to Nexen as 
part of the Golden Eagle Area Development 
in the North Sea. Our safety performance on 
the entire Nexen project (we delivered the 
Wellhead deck in June 2013) was excellent, 
reaching the milestone of over 10 million 
manhours without a day away from work 
case, a record achievement for Lamprell. 
Both decks are now fully operational in 
the North Sea. In delivering this project, 
Lamprell also achieved a world record for 
the heaviest load moved by self-propelled 
modular trailers, which was officially 
recognised by Guinness World Records.
10 
million manhours 
without a daFwc
The Group was awarded a small but 
important project in late December 2013 
for the fabrication of a fast track schedule 
jacket and topside, which was then 
delivered in September 2014 for installation 
offshore Dubai for our client, Technip.  
With a perfect safety record of over  
600,000 manhours without any recordable 
incidents, we once again demonstrated  
our deep commitment towards maintaining 
a safe working environment for our clients 
and employees. 
In October 2014 the Group also 
successfully completed the topside and 
jackets on the Leighton project. While this 
project has been completed, our client has 
commissioned us to preserve and store the 
decks in our Sharjah yard on a temporary 
basis pending an instruction from their client 
that the end destination offshore Iraq is 
ready to receive them. This is anticipated to 
be in mid-2015.
The Group also undertakes general 
fabrication works for offshore and onshore 
projects as well as site services under the 
Engineering & Construction business unit. 
This unit saw considerable growth in its 
activities driven by a number of remote 
site projects. By way of example, the 
team successfully delivered its services, 
including engineering, procurement, 
piping, mechanical and commissioning, 
for a compression project to its client 
Petrofac, and completed 328,000 
manhours without a single day away 
from work case. It further successfully 
dismantled a process plant, completed 
engineering works for re-installation and 
erected five process columns for the KAR 
group. This project, which commenced 
in 2013, is marked as the first of its size 
to be completed in Dubai’s Jebel Ali Free 
Zone, another notable achievement. 
While 2014 was a relatively slow year in 
terms of awards in this core market, the 
Group did win a significant new contract 
for the fabrication and delivery of 29 
modules to Petrofac. The modules are being 
constructed for use in connection with the 
landmark Upper Zakum, UZ750 (EPC-2)  
field development in Abu Dhabi. The 
estimated total weight for these modules is 
approximately 10,000 tonnes. This contract 
win yet again underlines Lamprell’s trusted 
reputation for delivering quality projects 
to some of the largest oil & gas projects 
worldwide. The project is progressing well in 
our Jebel Ali facility and we are scheduled 
to deliver the first shipment of modules in 
Q3 2015, with the final piperack expected to 
be delivered in Q1 2016.

Rig refurbishment/conversions
Highlights
Delivery of “MOS Frontier” major rig 
conversion project
10 rig refurbishment projects delivered  
in 2014
All projects successfully delivered as 
planned with impressive safety records
Trading review
Whilst headline revenues for our rig 
refurbishment business were down 
on the prior year , the Group continues 
to demonstrate its unique ability to 
deliver some of the most large-scale 
and complex rig refurbishment projects 
for our clients. During 2014, the Group 
successfully delivered a large-scale rig 
conversion project for our client Millennium 
Offshore Services. Over a 10-month 
period, significant quantities of steel 
and leg braces were changed out as we 
successfully converted the drilling jackup 
rig into a 290-bed jackup accommodation 
support vessel complete with gyms, an 
entertainment room and a high quality living 
accommodation area. The upgrade of the 
“MOS Frontier” rig was a highly complex 
job which showcased the Group’s ability 
to innovate by bringing the rig onshore at 
its Sharjah facility, effectively dry-docking 
the vessel and allowing the Group to 
perform the refurbishment and conversion 
works from all sides concurrently . 
Whilst 2014 presented a noticeable increase 
in the level of competition in this market, 
we were able to differentiate ourselves from 
our competitors on the basis of quality and 
reliability for delivery on schedule. This was 
proven in our completion and delivery of 
10 rig upgrade and refurbishment projects 
throughout the year . We have a high level 
of repeat business with regular returning 
customers. By way of example, out of the 
14 rig refurbishment contracts we won in 
2014, 12 were for repeat customers.

Our Land Rig Services business unit 
enjoyed a record-breaking year in 2014 
in this core market for the Group, with 
revenues increasing by 60% on the previous 
year driven by continued high regional 
activity, both for existing and new clients. 
During the year , the Group completed 
a major land rig upgrade project on the 
“ND11 rig” for NDC. The scope of the 
project involved converting the rig and its 
equipment from a conventional design to 
a mobile, fast moving one on wheels. The 
project was delivered to the satisfaction 
of the client and with an exemplary safety 
record. Another notable achievement was 
the design and fabrication of Lamprell’s first 
training rig for Franks International.

Trading review
We have experienced significantly fewer 
opportunities in the renewable energy 
sector and this is likely to continue during 
this period of lower oil prices, which has a 
direct impact on the viability of renewable 
energy projects. 
During the year we successfully delivered 
the jackup vessel “Hydra” to our client, 
Seajacks. The “Hydra” is the fourth self-
propelled, multi-purpose liftboat vessel that 
Lamprell has built for Seajacks and the sixth 
such vessel in total. The vessel is a modified 
version of GustoMSC’s NG 2500 X design, 
fully adaptable for work in both the oil & 
gas and the offshore wind industries. The 
Group’s strong performance throughout 
the project resulted in early completion of 
the construction phase, ensuring a timely 
delivery and another satisfied client. 
We remain in dialogue with clients that  
are participating in this core market and  
are committed to meeting clients’ needs  
for additional vessels as further 
opportunities emerge.

Strategic review: Sustainability report
We aim to deliver controlled, 
sustainable and profitable 
growth through strong 
management and good 
operational performance 
based around our key 
organisational strengths. 
During 2014, there were 
numerous employee activities 
and significant developments 
in quality and safety as we 
embedded our core values 
into the business.  
Employee welfare 
Our core values include integrity and 
teamwork and 2014 was a landmark year 
for employee welfare which is founded on 
these values. In November 2014 Lamprell 
received a major regional award, for the 
“Most Improved Corporate Health and 
Wellness Performance” at the Daman 
Corporate Health Awards in Abu Dhabi. 
The Group was recognised for executing 
new initiatives such as health awareness 
campaigns on diabetes, breast cancer , heat 
stress, cholesterol management and dental 
and oral hygiene. In addition almost 2,000 
employees have undergone basic health 
screening and have been provided with a 
follow up health report. 
We also recognise the importance of a 
good work-life balance and encourage 
employees to participate in a variety of 
internal sports tournaments and leisure 
activities that we organised during 2014. 
This included basketball, cricket, football, 
badminton and bowling tournaments as  
well as an inaugural talent show – 
“Lamprell’s Got Talent”. With the high 
employee participation, the Group is 
continuing with similar activities during 
2015, some of which are already under way .
In terms of staff training and development, 
the Company had a strong year supporting 
both professional and trades development. 
The Lamprell Assessment and Training 
Centre opened its doors in October 2013 
and currently has 70 individual courses 
available covering topics as diverse as 
leadership, English language, welding, 
fabrication, electrical and mechanical. 
Some of the courses have mandatory third 
party involvement which includes offshore 
survival, rigging and crane operations. 
Figures for the 2014 period include circa 
58,000 training and assessment mandays 
with more than 250,000 manhours in total.
Health and safety
Throughout 2014 we continued to 
implement a best-in-class organisational 
health and safety management system with 
campaigns designed to ensure the safety 
and wellbeing of all employees including:
 » Major road safety awareness campaign;
 » A series of fatal risk awareness 
campaigns; and
 » Comprehensive heat stress prevention 
initiative.
The heat stress prevention initiative 
highlighted the dangers of heat exposure 
to personnel and resulted in a 97.6% 
drop in heat stress related cases with 
comparison to the previous year . One of the 
key components of the health and safety 
management system within Lamprell is the 
focus on creating an incident and injury 
free culture for all employees, as well as 
improving the health, safety and wellbeing 
of all stakeholders. The senior management

is actively engaged in the living standards 
of our yard workforce with physical site 
inspections of their living quarters on a 
quarterly basis at least.
We track a number of key leading and 
lagging HSESQ statistics such as those 
relating to days away from work, audit and 
incident items and close-outs, absenteeism, 
environmental and security issues. However , 
the key benchmark is the evaluation of 
total incidents recorded. Through effective 
implementation of this system, we have 
seen a steady and significant reduction in 
the total number of incidents for the Group 
over the course of the last few years. This 
will remain a high priority for the Group 
and is directly linked to management’s 
remuneration structure.
Emissions and the environment
We recognise that our business activities 
have an impact on the environment through 
our day-to-day operations and the use of 
products and services that we deliver to 
our clients. Throughout the year we actively 
sought to improve our environmental 
performance through:
 » acquisition of resources to control 
potential environmental incidents;
 » more effective emissions reduction 
devices; and 
 » participation in the internationally-
recognised Carbon Disclosure Project, 
which entails the public reporting of 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Due to the nature of the work which 
Lamprell undertakes, certain emissions to 
the environment are unavoidable. However , 
we aim to reduce these emissions through 
regular maintenance of all combustible 
engines, the establishment of physical 
barriers to protect the land, air and marine 
environment and the utilisation of low 
sulphur diesel fuel. 
Lamprell works in close consultation with 
all applicable regulatory bodies, such as 
Dubai Municipality and the Hamriyah Free 
Zone Authority, to monitor the quantity of 
emissions produced from our activities 
and to ensure compliance with local legal 
limitations. In 2014, we implemented a 
range of control measures to monitor 
and reduce the quantity of environmental 
emissions from our operations. These 
controls incorporated daily, weekly 
and monthly facility inspections. Our 
new monthly reporting processes will 
enable us to collect summary data 
for 2015 which we then plan to make 
available in next year’s Annual Report. 
We are also planning to participate in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project this year . 
By conducting regular reviews of the 
environmental impact of our projects, we 
strive to identify ways in which operational 
processes can be made more efficient, 
therefore reducing our carbon footprint. 
These efforts include optimising the 
yard layouts and more efficient welding 
practices.   
Quality
We have a dedicated Quality Department 
and, as a key strength, we structure 
our Quality Policy Statement around the 
following key objectives:
 » Setting and achieving well-defined 
“Quality Objectives” for each function;
 » Understanding customer requirements 
and working together to meet those 
requirements; and
 » Incremental improvements to our internal 
knowledge-management database.
During 2014 we introduced several new 
measures to improve the quality assurance 
and control functions including enhanced 
surveillance, planning, root cause analysis 
and performance measurement. Some 
examples include enhanced Quality 
Toolbox Talks to discuss ongoing issues, 
the introduction of process improvement 
audits in addition to regular quality audits, 
rigourous vendor audits as per API Q1 
9th edition requirements and new training 
programmes.
Significant improvements were made to 
the Lamprell Group Management System 
in line with API Q1, 9th Edition and ASME 
standards. All of our facilities are subject 
to scheduled internal audits and third 
party reviews. Our Sharjah facility was 
successfully recertified to ASME U, U2, PP , 
S, NB & R certifications and our Land Rig 
Services division successfully renewed 
their API Q1, ISO 9001:2008, 4F & 16C 
certifications.
Corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) 
We have a commitment to corporate 
social responsibility which is focused on a 
controlled number of CSR projects that are 
aligned with our business. 
For the past five years we have donated 
to the Don Bosco Snehalaya shelter which 
provides care and protection to street 
children, orphans and other vulnerable 
children, some of whom are as young as 
seven years old. Some of our managers 
visited the shelter in Baroda, India in 2014 
to make the annual donation and to see how 
our donations are spent. Lamprell has also 
played an active part in supporting some 
of the apprenticeship schemes that Don 
Bosco runs with a view to encourage some 
of these apprentices to work for Lamprell 
in the UAE. This gives them a long-term 
opportunity for a career . We are proud to 
report that there are orphans who were 
helped by Don Bosco that are now working 
for us.  
In addition, as we have a major presence 
within the UAE and we aim to contribute to 
the local community, we made a donation 
to UAE-based charity Al Noor Training 
Centre, which provides services for children 
with special needs. Finally, in 2015 we will 
be continuing our ongoing support of the 
Rashid Centre for the Disabled.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Corporate governance: Directors’ Report
maintaining  
our vigiLance
Guided by our values
The Board is guided by our 
values and while not exhaustive, 
we describe some of our 
key highlights and how they 
demonstrate what has been 
achieved by our Board in 2014 
by embracing our values.
Safety 
In determining the key 
performance indicators for 
the executive management, 
the Board set a safety target 
which ultimately delivered 
a significant improvement 
in safety results in the 
business  page 09. Top 
tier clients typically demand 
that safety is paramount to a 
contractor’s business when 
assessing whether or not 
to appoint the contractor . 
Accordingly, this feeds 
directly into our ability to win 
work and hence our strategic 
objectives.
Fiscal responsibility
As a contractor in the oil & gas 
industry, the Group structures 
its business model on a 
competitive cost base and high 
productivity . As a cornerstone in 
the 2014 rights issue, the Board 
approved the capital investment 
programme of USD 60.0 million 
to enhance the yard productivity 
and efficiency and support 
operational systems, with an 
expected payback period of 
three to four years  page 22.
Dear Shareholders, 
I am pleased to report that, 
consistent with our broader 
culture of continuous 
improvement, the Board 
and I have been active in 
working to make further 
improvements to governance 
within Lamprell. The 
Company has benefited from 
a period of relative stability 
compared to recent years 
and so your Board has been 
able to give greater focus on 
the future of the Company 
and specifically its strategy . 
That strategy was the 
foundation for the rights issue 
and refinancing processes 
which were completed in 
mid-2014.
The Company is incorporated in the  
Isle of Man and has a Premium Listing 
on the Official List of the London Stock 
Exchange. The Board makes considerable 
efforts to ensure that during the relevant 
period the Company applies and complies 
with Sections A to E of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 as the pre-eminent 
set of global standards for corporate 
governance (the “Code”, available at  
www.frc.org.uk). To the extent that the 
Company does not comply, this is set  
out in this Annual Report and Accounts  
and specifically in this Corporate 
Governance Report.
Priorities for 2014
In my Statement last year , I set out the 
priority areas for the Board in 2014 and  
your Board has agreed new priorities for 
2015  page 39. The priorities in 2014 
reflected our need to create stability and 
leadership as the Company transitioned 
from its recovery phase in 2013 to the 
more normalised business requirements 
that will allow the Company to develop 
and grow, and ultimately create value to 
the shareholders. Taking each priority in 
turn, I am pleased to highlight some of the 
Board’s activities in 2014 demonstrating 
our successes in moving towards the 
Company’s strategic objectives.
Priority 1: leadership
In order to give long-term stability to the 
governance of the Company, we recognised 
the need for greater clarity and visibility 
of succession planning at the Board 
and at the management levels. With this 
in mind, we have instigated an in-depth 
and methodical review of succession 
planning for all key roles with the assistance 
of external consultants and ongoing 
oversight by the Nomination & Governance 
Committee. A key focus for such review will 
be the appointment of a CFO following the 
departure of Joanne Curin in Q4 2014. 
In line with the changes to the Code in late 
2013, the Board (through the Audit & Risk 
Committee) has overseen the requirement 
to ensure that the Company’s Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair , 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy .  
Priority 2: shareholders agreement
With the change in the Listing Rules in June 
2014, we worked with the Company’s major 
shareholder to put in place a “controlling 
shareholder’s agreement”, compliant with 
the new regulations  page 40. This was 
completed by the deadline of 16 November 
2014 and now represents a key component 
of the Company’s corporate governance  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
35
Integrity 
At the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting, a resolution 
relating to the executive 
remuneration incentives 
was approved by the 
shareholders but, in light 
of a sizeable vote against 
the resolution, the Board 
directed the Remuneration 
Committee to re-engage 
with the Company’s 
shareholders in connection 
with its remuneration policy 
and specifically seek 
feedback on the executive 
remuneration incentives  
 page 46.
Accountability
Last March, the Board 
laid out the following key 
business activities, all of 
which have been achieved 
or are being implemented:
 » Dispose of non-core 
service businesses
 » Implement strategy
 » Diversify client base
 » Drive productivity 
improvements/cost 
efficiencies
 » Strengthen business 
development function
Teamwork
The Board has encouraged 
participation from a wide 
range of management 
team members who have 
presented on a variety 
of key topics at Board 
meetings including by way 
of example:
 » Personnel and human 
resources
 » Business development 
function and processes
 » The process for the 
rights issue and 
refinancing
 » The next phase for the 
business of the Group
structure. The agreement is designed 
to regulate the relationship between the 
Company and its major shareholder , 
enabling the Group to operate in an 
environment free from external influences.
Priority 3: effectiveness
In order to assess our performance during 
2014, we have used an online evaluation 
system which has proven to be more 
efficient and effective. The results of the 
evaluation process have demonstrated that 
the Board, Board Committees and individual 
Directors are all performing effectively  
 page 38. Specific feedback was given 
to enhance performance and, based on 
the results, the Board has set new priorities 
notably around the area of succession 
planning for the Board and management.
Priority 4: strategy
As I mentioned above, our highest priority 
during 2014 was the development of the 
strategy for the business  page 08. In 
January 2014, we held a two-day workshop 
working closely with management to review 
opportunities to maintain and grow the 
business, in the short and longer term. 
The workshop included presentations on 
diverse opportunities including additional 
product lines and alternative geographies, 
as well as possible productivity 
improvements and cost efficiencies 
which the team is now implementing. 
Priority 5: risk
There have been enhancements in the 
Company’s risk management processes 
which had been an acknowledged 
weakness within the business. An executive 
risk review panel was established and, 
following the appointment of a Group Risk 
Manager , the Group developed an online, 
fully-interactive risk management database. 
The database is updated on a daily basis 
and ensures that all project teams are fully 
engaged in the process for identifying, 
managing, mitigating and monitoring on 
risks within the business prior to reporting 
up to the Board  page 14. 
The Board considers that high standards of 
corporate governance are a pre-requisite 
for any listed company . I am satisfied that 
the current structure is appropriate for the 
Company, taking into consideration the size 
and complexity of our business.
John Kennedy
Chairman
The Directors present 
their report on the affairs 
of the Company and the 
Group together with the 
financial statements and 
the auditor’s report for the 
year ended 31 December 
2014.
Results and dividends
The financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 
are set out on  pages 63 to 107. The 
Group’s profit from continuing and 
discontinued operations after income 
tax and exceptional items for the year 
amounted to USD 118.1 million (2013: 
USD 36.4 million). The Directors do 
not recommend the payment of any 
dividend for the financial year ended  
31 December 2014.

Corporate governance: Directors’ Report
Our Board aims to lead the 
Company and the Group as 
a whole in such a way as to 
ensure that the Company 
delivers sustainable 
growth over the longer 
term to its shareholders 
and other stakeholders. 
Who is on our Board?
All current Board members  page 32 
have served as Directors throughout the 
course of 2014, with the only change 
being the departure of Joanne Curin as 
a Director announced on 17 November 
2014. Accordingly, as at the date of 
this report, the Board consists of the 
Chairman, four Non-Executive Directors 
(“NEDs”) and one Executive Director . 
The Board of Directors represents a good 
combination of industry, regional and 
operational experience, supported by the 
diverse professional skills of the NEDs. 
However , with the departure of Joanne 
Curin as Chief Financial Officer , the Board 
recognised that there was insufficient 
representation of executive directors at the 
Board level and thus promptly commenced 
a search to identify a successor; this will 
be a key priority for the Board in 2015. 
In addition, the Board is considering 
appointments of at least one additional 
independent NED in order to bring 
further experience and independence 
to the Board, as well as facilitating 
greater rotation of membership among 
the principal Board Committees.

How is our Board structured?
The duties of the Chairman and the CEO 
have been segregated, in line with the 
best practices set out in the Code, and 
this has been agreed by the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for providing 
effective leadership for the Board and the 
Group as a whole including strategy and 
direction and chairs all Board and general 
meetings within a solid and effective 
corporate governance framework. The CEO 
is responsible for the day-to-day running of 
the Group’s business, including execution 
of the Group’s business plans and 
objectives and communicating its decisions 
from/recommendations to the Board. 
Aside from the Chairman and the CEO, 
there are four NEDs, whose role is 
critical to ensure an effective counter-
balance on the Board. The NEDs are 
primarily responsible for challenging 
constructively all recommendations 
presented to the Board, based on their 
broad experience and individual expertise. 
The biographical information and 
commitments of each of the Directors, 
as well as the memberships for each 
of the principal Board Committees, 
are detailed on  pages 32 to 33.
How is our Board organised?
The Board oversees the activities of the 
executive management team and delegates 
certain matters for resolution through the 
principal Board Committees. Given the time 
and resources invested in the appointment 
of the Directors, it is important for the 
Directors to operate in an environment 
of mutual trust and respect in order to 
be effective. Accordingly, while there is 
a formal schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board (pursuant to which the Board 
retains sole discretion to approve or reject 
decisions on key subject matters including 
inter alia strategy, the annual budget, full 
year and interim financial statements), the 
Board will often review other matters which 
are of relevance beyond the schedule.

A similarly open and forthright environment 
is also encouraged in meetings of the 
three principal Board Committees. Each 
of the Committees has written terms of 
reference, which are reviewed annually and 
are available on the Company’s website.
The Board has access to the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible to the Board 
and provides the Board and the individual 
Directors with advice and assistance on 
governance matters. He ensures that all 
Board materials and other information are 
delivered in a timely fashion, normally seven 
days before scheduled Board meetings 
through a secure, online application system.
Who attends Board meetings?
As well as the Directors and the Company 
Secretary, it is common for members 
of the executive committee and the 
wider management team to attend parts 
of the Board meetings and to deliver 
presentations on operational or business 
topics in greater detail. In this way, the 
Board gains an in-depth understanding 
of business-critical functions and the 
presenting managers are able to interact 
with the Directors and gain experience for 
their own personal development. From time 
to time, the Board may also invite guest 
external presenters on key subject matters.

How often does our Board meet?
Our Board aims to meet in person enough 
times in order to address matters requiring 
Board involvement and in 2014 did so on six 
occasions (four in Dubai and two in Paris). 
However , where required and in order 
to receive an interim update on ongoing 
matters, the Directors will convene ad hoc 
at short notice by way of conference call 
with attendance outside of the UK, where 
required. Meetings in person will generally 
take place over the course of two days and 
will include meetings of both the Board 
and the principal Board Committees. 
What matters does the Board 
consider and discuss?
The Board discusses a wide variety of 
matters although there are a number of 
standing agenda items  page 36.  
The Chairman sets the agenda for 
each meeting in consultation with the 
CEO and the Company Secretary .

At the meeting, the Executive Directors 
give an update on business, operational 
and financial matters, thereby enabling 
the Board to understand progress but 
also anticipate likely risks in the coming 
period. Last year , there were also detailed 
presentations from responsible managers 
on key subject matters including personnel 
& HR, business development function and 
the next phase of the Group’s business. 
The guest external presenters in 2014 
included the Company brokers (JPMorgan 
Cazenove) and lawyers (Ashursts) who 
presented on a variety of topics, including 
the regulatory and procedural aspects 
of the rights issue and the refinancing 
projects which were completed in 2014. 
This was important not only to ensure that 
the Company follows due process but also 
allowed the individual Directors to remain 
current with the latest regulatory obligations.
The Directors believe that an effective 
working relationship between each of the 
Directors provides a robust framework 
for achieving the Company’s strategic 
objectives. Accordingly, there are regular 
discussions outside of scheduled meetings, 
particularly between the Chairman and 
the other Directors, with a view to reaching 
a mutual understanding of views prior 
to wider discussions at meetings. 
At physical Board meetings, the NEDs have 
a private session without executives present 
in order to share insights on matters of 
governance and sensitivity for management.
In addition to Board meetings, the executive 
management distributes a monthly report 
to the Board providing a summary of 
the financial performance of the Group, 
highlighting developments and key risks.
Are our Board members independent?
The Board takes steps to ensure that at all 
times at least half of the Board (excluding 
the Chairman) is comprised of independent 
NEDs who are free from any business or 
other relationships that could materially 
interfere in the exercise of their independent 
judgement. Michael Press, John Malcolm 
and Ellis Armstrong are all considered 
by the Board to be independent NEDs 
as defined by Section B.1.1 of the Code. 
While Peter Whitbread acted in the capacity 
of a Non-Executive Director during 2014, 
he is not considered to be independent 
because he was the Group CEO until James 
Moffat took over the role in March 2013. 
The Company asks each of the 
independent NEDs to re-consider and 
re-confirm their independence at the start 
of each year . The Chairman of the Board 
was considered to be independent on 
his original appointment in June 2012. 
What is the process for appointing, 
inducting and training Directors?
The Nomination & Governance Committee 
leads the process for new appointments 
to the Board and makes any such 
recommendations to the full Board for 
approval. The Committee will assess the 
high level criteria for any candidates, taking 
into account the Board composition and 
requirements, and typically appoint external 
search consultants to prepare candidate 
lists and assist with the recruitment/
evaluation process. While there were 
no new appointments during 2014, the 
process is considered by the Board to 
be formal, rigorous and transparent. 
Once appointed, a new Director is given 
training and induction on a variety of 
subject matters including the Listing 
Rule obligations for the Company, 
company law duties and responsibilities 
for directors, share dealing restrictions 
in accordance with the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Model 
Code on Directors’ dealings as well as 
Board and business related matters. 
On an ongoing basis, there is training 
and development for the Directors as a 
whole by way of the regular presentations 
to the Board and the principal Board 
Committees from guest presenters. 
The Audit & Risk Committee also 
benefits from regular briefings from the 
external auditors on any new accounting 
requirements as well as developments 
in the area of corporate governance. 
All Directors are encouraged to 
attend relevant external seminars. 
Similarly, any Director is entitled to take 
independent professional or legal advice 
on Company matters, if needed.

Which of our Board members are 
standing for re-election in 2015?
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Directors are required to 
submit themselves for re-election at least 
every three years. However , in line with 
the Code, the Board has decided that all 
Directors will retire and stand for re-election 
at the 2015 AGM. As also required, the 
Company makes the terms and conditions 
of Directors’ engagement available for 
inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours 
and also at the Company’s AGM 15 minutes 
prior to the meeting and during the meeting.
How does the Board measure 
its performance?
Each year the Board evaluates its 
performance according to a formal process 
led by the Nomination & Governance 
Committee with the assistance of the 
Company Secretary . In order to enhance 
the security and simplify the procedural 
aspects, the evaluation for 2014 was 
based around an online questionnaire 
which included both questions asking for 
quantitative ranking and for qualitative 
feedback to the Board, principal Board 
Committees and the Directors. The 
Board sought feedback both from the 
Directors themselves and also from 
specific, invited key executives that 
have regular interaction with either the 
Board or the Board Committees.
The results from the online evaluation 
questionnaires were collated independently 
by the Company Secretary and summarised 
on an aggregated and confidential basis. 
The Board discussed the results and 
has structured its next priorities around 
them. The NEDs, led by the Senior 
Independent Director , evaluated the 
Chairman’s performance and confirmed 
that he is performing effectively .
In line with best practice (although not 
required for a ‘smaller company’ under the 
Code), the Board is planning to appoint 
an external facilitator to assist with the 
2015 performance evaluation process.
How are conflicts of interest dealt with?
Based on our core value of “integrity”  
 page 25, each of the Directors 
recognises the importance of transparency 
in trying to avoid any actual or potential 
conflict of interest but will promptly 
declare such conflict, if one arises. 
This enables the Board to assess the 
possible impact of any conflict and take 
appropriate and timely action. With this in 
mind, there are the following procedures 
in place for dealing with conflicts:
 » Any new Director is required 
to provide information on any 
conflicts of interest by means of a 
questionnaire prior to appointment;
 » Conflicts are declared and 
addressed during Board meetings 
and noted in the minutes; and
 » For conflicts arising between Board 
meetings, these are submitted to the 
Chairman and/or the Chairman of the 
Nomination & Governance Committee 
for consideration, prior to deliberation at 
the next available Committee meeting.
During 2014, no new, additional conflicts 
of interest were noted from the Directors, 
save as disclosed previously . John Kennedy 
remains as the Non-Executive Chairman of 
Maxwell Drummond (which has provided 
recruitment services to the Company) but 
the Board has determined that this potential 
conflict has been effectively managed. All 
conflict management procedures were 
adhered to and operated effectively .
How does the Company communicate 
with its stakeholders?
As at 17 March 2015, being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication 
of this Annual Report, the significant 
interests in the voting rights of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares based 
on the last request for confirmation as 
to the beneficial ownership of voting 
rights in the Company (at or above 5% 
beneficial ownership) were as follows:

2014 was a busy year for communication 
with our shareholders. Our investor relations 
activities are led by our CEO and Deputy 
CFO with the support of a dedicated investor 
relations team. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director are available to speak 
with shareholders and did communicate 
from time to time with shareholders on 
specific issues during 2014.
Not only did Company representatives meet 
with major institutional shareholders and 
market analysts following the announcement 
for our full-year and half-year financial 
results but there were meetings in Q2 2014 
relating to the launch of the Company’s 
rights issue. These meetings were of added 
importance because they presented an 
opportunity for the Company to explain 
in detail how the new strategy would be 
implemented in practice  page 08. The 
high participation by existing shareholders 
in the rights issue and positive market 
reaction clearly demonstrates the effective 
and transparent communication between 
the Company and its shareholders. 
The Board also strives to identity and 
address specific feedback or concerns

Corporate governance: Directors’ Report
from shareholders. Late in 2013, the 
Remuneration Committee consulted key 
shareholders in relation to remuneration 
proposals prior to implementation. However , 
at the 2014 AGM, one of the remuneration 
proposals (Resolution 14) received a large 
vote against the resolution and, even though 
it was approved, the Company (through the 
Remuneration Committee) decided to re-
engage with its shareholders to understand 
better their views on the policy .  page 46 
The Company’s core lending group is 
another key stakeholder group for the 
business and the debt facility terms 
represent a fundamental part of the 
Group’s governance structure as it includes 
certain banking covenants and restrictions. 
The management team provides regular 
updates on key aspects of the business 
to the lending group and the Deputy CFO 
communicates frequently with each of the 
lending banks to address any queries.
Finally, the Board places considerable 
importance on positive and effective 
interaction with the Group’s workforce 
and the Group’s internal Corporate 
Communications team coordinates 
campaigns for the management team to 
communicate key messages throughout the 
Group. During 2014, there were campaigns 
relating to safety, financial and IT matters. 
In June 2014 and in January 2015, the 
CEO presented a series of “townhall 
meetings” at each of the three main 
facilities in the UAE, which were focussed 
on the Company’s performance and on 
implementation of the new strategy . The 
CEO also presented awards for long service 
and safety achievements and records to 
employees regularly during the year .
How is the Company’s relationship 
with its major shareholder regulated?
By virtue of the size of its shareholding in 
the Company  page 39, Lamprell Holdings 
Limited and its ultimate owner , Steven 
Lamprell, are “controlling shareholders” 
for the purposes of the Listing Rules. 
Accordingly, they were required to enter 
into an agreement with the Company to 
ensure compliance with the independence 
provisions set out in the Listing Rules 
(“Controlling Shareholder Agreement”). 
The Controlling Shareholder Agreement 
regulates the ongoing relationship between 
the Company and these controlling 
shareholders. The Company has complied 
with the independence provisions in 
the Controlling Shareholder Agreement. 
So far as the Company is aware, the 
controlling shareholders have also complied 
with the independence provisions.  
The Controlling Shareholder Agreement 
represents a key component of the 
Company’s corporate governance 
structure. The earlier so-called “President’s 
Agreement” with Steven Lamprell and 
Lamprell Holdings Limited, which was 
similar to the new controlling shareholder’s 
agreement and created at the time of 
the Company’s original listing, ceased 
to be effective on 24 December 2014. 
What use does the Company make 
of its Annual General Meeting?
The Company held its 2014 AGM in Dubai, 
United Arab Emirates and all Directors were 
present. We encourage our shareholders 
to attend the AGM as an opportunity to 
engage in a constructive dialogue with 
the Board members attending in person. 
Typically resolutions are passed on a 
show of hands but, as a matter of good 
governance, the Chairman submitted 
resolution 14 to a poll because of the large 
dissenting vote. The resolution still passed 
but the Board noted the voting results 
and responded in a proactive manner 
by re-engaging with its shareholders to 
better understand their views.  page 46
The 2015 AGM is scheduled to take place 
on 12 May 2015 in Dubai and full details 
are set out in the Notice of Meeting which 
accompanies this report (and is also 
available our website). All Directors are 
planning to attend and will be available 
to answer questions from shareholders. 
Each item will be presented as a separate 
resolution and the Chairmen of the principal 
Board Committees will be available to 
answer questions from shareholders. 
Any shareholder unable to attend 
in person but wishing to submit a 
question for consideration by the 
Directors, is invited to submit questions 
to investorrelations@lamprell.com 
How is the Directors’ 
remuneration determined?
The Remuneration Committee is primarily 
responsible for determining the principles 
and details of Company’s remuneration 
policy, taking into account the best 
practices as well as the advice from external 
consultants on peer companies. Details of 
the Company’s policy on remuneration, the 
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and their interests in 
the ordinary shares of the Company can 
be found in the Directors’ Annual Report 
on Remuneration.  pages 53 to 59. 
What insurance coverage 
do the Directors have?
Each year , the Board reviews and approves 
the level of the Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance cover to ensure that it is 
appropriate in light of the circumstances, 
size and risks within the business. This 
is subject to the usual exclusions such 
as fraud or dishonesty by a Director .

Who attends the Committee’s meetings?
The Committee is comprised of 
members that are considered to be 
wholly independent or were considered 
independent on appointment, in the 
case of the Chairman of the Board. 
Aside from the members, the Company 
Secretary and the Group’s Vice-President 
of Human Resources are typically invited 
to attend the Committee meetings. 
What are the Committee’s 
responsibilities?
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for the composition, structure, balance, 
diversity and experience of the Board 
and the principal Board Committees, 
and for leading the evaluation of the 
Board’s performance and effectiveness. 
It also assesses the succession planning 
needs both at the Board and at the 
senior management level and, following 
the major overhaul of the Committee’s 
responsibilities in 2013, the Committee 
considers the implications of changes in 
the governance and regulatory framework 
in which the Company operates.
What did the Committee 
focus on during 2014?
With the renewed stability on the Board 
during the first half of the year , the 
Committee dedicated a considerable 
amount of time to the consideration of 
potential candidates to act as an additional 
independent NED. However , the process 
was unsuccessful due to the lack of 
available, high quality candidates. This 
search process will continue into 2015 
although it has been superseded as a 
priority by the need to replace Joanne 
Curin as CFO following her departure 
in Q3 2014. Tony Wright, formerly Vice-
President (Finance), was promoted to 
the position of Deputy CFO pending a 
decision on a permanent appointment. 
Tony Wright is not a Director .
During Q4 2014, the Committee completed 
an evaluation process for appointing a 
firm of executive recruitment consultants 
to assist with this search process and 
ultimately the Committee decided to appoint 
Korn Ferry because of its strong profile 
in the industry and proven assessment 
processes. The Committee also made 
use of the services of other executive 
recruitment consultants during the relevant 
period, namely Maxwell Drummond. Save 
as disclosed  page 39, these companies 
had no other connection with the Company .

Corporate governance: Nomination & Governance Committee Report
How does the Board manage the talent 
and plan for leadership moves?
The Board recognises that succession 
planning and talent management is of 
crucial importance in order to deliver the 
business strategy in the coming years. 
The preference is also to develop talent 
from within the existing workforce and so, 
at the Board’s direction, the Committee 
initiated a succession planning and risk 
assessment exercise in order to evaluate 
the key executive positions within the 
Group. This exercise looks at the leadership 
team’s critical competencies and, in this 
way, the Committee will able to assess the 
criticality of each role and the retention 
risk around the incumbent. This also allows 
the Committee to identify high potential 
employees that might then fill any vacancy 
in due course, as well as their training and 
development needs to achieve that goal. 
This process of implementing the results 
of the succession planning exercise will 
be one of the top priorities for both the 
Committee and the Board during 2015.
In the meantime however , the Company has 
appointed Korn Ferry as expert executive 
search and recruitment consultants to 
support the Company in its process to fill 
the vacant role of CFO. This process will 
be formal, rigorous and transparent, and 
the Committee will assess all candidates 
according to a defined set of criteria. The  
process will therefore only be completed 
later in 2015 although the Board is pleased 
to note that the Deputy CFO has indicated 
a strong interest in taking up such role. 
What is the Board’s policy 
with regard to diversity? 
The departure of Joanne Curin from 
the Company in November 2014 has 
unfortunately created a gender imbalance 
on the Board. The Company is acutely 
aware of its responsibilities to pay due 
regard to the benefits of diversity at 
the Board level and, in assessing any 
candidate to fill a vacancy on the Board, 
the Committee will consider a number of 
key factors of which this responsibility is 
one. However , in further recognition of this 
need to diversify the composition of the 
Board, the Board has a adopted policy 
of recruiting a minimum of one female 
Director by the end of 2016.  page 39
Within the wider management level, 
there is greater diversity although the 
Company does not currently have 
any female representatives among 
the senior management team. 
How long are Directors appointed for? 
Executive Directors are employed under 
Directors’ Service Contracts with termination 
notice periods of not more than 12 months.
Non-Executive Directors are engaged 
pursuant to letters of appointment which 
do not have specific or fixed terms but they 
are subject to re-election by the Company’s 
shareholders at intervals of not more than 
three years. All directors have been elected 
or re-elected by the shareholders within the 
last two years.

Who attends the Committee’s meetings?
Membership of the Committee is comprised 
solely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors and the Board confirms that 
Ellis Armstrong has relevant financial 
experience for the purposes of the Code, 
thereby ensuring the appropriate balance of 
financial and industry experience to assess 
the matters presented to the Committee.  
As a “smaller company” under the Code, the 
Committee needs only have two members. 
Aside from the members, the Company 
Secretary and the Group’s Deputy 
CFO are typically invited to attend the 
Committee meetings. In addition, the 
external and internal auditors are invited 
to meetings at key times during the year . 
On occasion, other Board members and 
managers have attended by invitation.
What are the Committee’s 
responsibilities?
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for overseeing the integrity of all of the 
Company’s announcements relating to its 
financial performance, including its financial 
results, and for considering all matters 
relating to the appointment, performance 
and independence of the Company’s 
external auditors. In addition, following 
the major overhaul of the Committee’s 
responsibilities in 2013, the Committee 
oversees the Company’s risk management 
system as well as its internal control 
systems, and monitors the effectiveness 
of such systems particularly against 
potential ethical or fraudulent activities.

Corporate governance: Audit & Risk Committee Report
What did the Committee 
focus on during 2014?
The Committee’s main activities 
during 2014 were as follows: 
 » the year-end/interim financial 
statements for the Group;
 » oversight and assessment of 
the Group’s risk management 
database and how enterprise risks 
are evaluated and mitigated;
 » review of the internal audit 
reports, outstanding action 
points and the 2015 plan;
 » external auditor’s independence, 
objectivity and the effectiveness, as well 
as the auditor’s forthcoming activities;
 » ongoing assessment of the control 
environment and systems; 
 » analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(“PwC”) of the Group’s IT 
systems and controls; and 
 » reporting on the whistleblowing statistics 
and cases raised during the year .
What significant judgements did the 
Committee have to consider during 2014?
The Committee considered the  
significant judgements below during 2014. 
The Committee was satisfied that the 
judgements made by management are 
reasonable and that appropriate disclosures 
have been included in the accounts.
What interaction does the Committee 
have with its external auditors?
The external auditor for the year ended 
31 December 2014 was PwC and they 
presented on various matters (including 
their audit report on the financial results 
for the previous year) to the Committee 
on three occasions during the year . PwC 
also provided the Committee with updates 
on changes to accounting, regulatory 
and corporate governance laws and 
regulations that impact the Company .
PwC has been acting in the role as the 
Company’s auditors for nearly nine years 
including the successful renewal of their 
appointment following a tender process in 
2010. PwC has expressed its willingness 
to continue in office as auditor and a 
resolution to reappoint it will be proposed 
at the forthcoming AGM for their services 
in respect of the 2015 financial year . 
However , the Committee has decided that 
it is appropriate and timely to re-tender 
for the external audit services during H2 
2015, which appointment will be effective 
for the 2016 financial year onwards.
Significant judgements considered 
by the Committee during 2014
Views/actions of the Committee with 
respect to significant judgements
Impact of the disposal of the 
non-core service businesses 
on the financial statements
The Group disposed of two non-core service businesses 
(although one is due to complete in H1 2015) in the year . The 
Committee received summaries of the accounting areas such 
as the valuation of intangible assets, any gains or losses on 
disposal and any subsequent fair value adjustments made.
Accounting treatment of rights 
issue of new ordinary shares
The Group completed a rights issue during the year . 
The Committee reviewed the accounts and disclosures 
proposed by management, in particular the treatment 
of the costs that arose from the transaction.
Review of subjective provisions At each meeting, the Committee receives and evaluates 
a management report which includes details of 
material subjective provisions made in respect of 
matters including doubtful debts, contract accruals, 
project risks and warranty issues. The adequacy and 
appropriateness of these provisions and disclosures 
required are discussed and challenged.
Revenue recognition and estimated 
cost to complete on major projects
The Committee considered the appropriateness of 
revenue recognition and estimated cost to complete 
on major projects ongoing at the balance sheet date. 
The Committee satisfied itself that the Company’s 
financial statements had been prepared on the basis 
of the accounting policy and noted that the external 
auditors had audited the methodology on that basis.
Refinancing The Group completed a refinancing project in 2014 
and the accounts and disclosures proposed by 
management were reviewed by the Committee. Significant 
fees arose from the refinancing and the treatment of 
these was reviewed in detail by the Committee. 
How does the Committee ensure the 
independence and performance & 
effectiveness of its external auditors? 
Pursuant to the Company’s Policy on 
Auditor Independence (which is available 
on the Group’s website), the Committee 
re-assesses the auditor’s independence at 
least on an annual basis, by reference to 
the activities of PwC and specifically the 
levels and types of non-audit services. 
In 2014, PwC provided non-audit services 
with a total value of USD 872,000 (2013: 
USD 1,621,000) against an annual audit 
fee including Group audit fees with a 
total value of USD 663,000 (2013: USD 
530,000). The Committee acknowledges 
the apparent imbalance between the two 
figures but notes that the high value of 
non-audit services originates primarily from 
the corporate transactions, notably the work 
undertaken by PwC in connection with the 
rights issue and the refinancing. PwC’s role 
in the rights issue was effectively an audit 
role, namely as reporting accountant and 
PwC was able to provide useful insights 
in light of PwC’s deep understanding of 
the workings of the Group. Given these 
incremental benefits of PwC’s involvement 
and the oversight by the Board, the 
Committee considers that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor were 
safe-guarded throughout the financial year .
The Committee also assesses the auditor’s 
effectiveness by way of feedback from 
several sources: the Committee relies on 
self-assessment by PwC of its performance, 
on feedback from certain senior 
managers that work closely alongside 
the auditors including the Deputy CFO 
and the Company Secretary, and on its 
own evaluation of PwC’s services based 
on the results of its audit work and the 
challenges presented to the views and 
positions of the Group’s management. 
In light of the accumulated feedback, 
the Committee remains satisfied of 
PwC’s independence and effectiveness 
and the Board concurs with the 
assessment by the Committee.
How does the Committee interact 
with its internal auditors? 
The Group’s internal audit function makes 
a presentation to the Committee at least 
on a bi-annual basis, providing updates 
and analysis for the internal audits and 
the control self-assessment exercises 
that were completed during the year , as 
well as making key recommendations 
and observations to the Committee and 
submitting a proposal for the internal 
audits proposed for the subsequent  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
45
year . The Committee will assess, 
by reference to the highlighted risk 
trends within the business and best 
practices, the key recommendations and 
observations and approve actions and 
the forward-looking internal audit plan. 
With the increased focus on risk 
management during 2014  page 14, 
there has also been closer interaction 
between the internal audit and Group risk 
functions, and the 2015 planned internal 
audits take into account identified areas of 
higher risk, at the Committee’s request. 
From time to time, the internal audit 
function will also undertake ad hoc reviews 
and assist management with specific 
tasks, including by way of example, 
for the year under review the internal 
audit of advances to subcontractors. 
At the management’s request, the team 
performed a detailed review of such 
amounts and, as a result, a number of 
internal control weaknesses were identified 
and resolved to prevent recurrence.
As a matter of best practice, the 
Committee meets with the internal auditor 
without executives present, to discuss 
any sensitive matters or concerns.
How does the Board manage risk? 
The Board has delegated its responsibility 
for the monitoring of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems to the Audit & 
Risk Committee. However , the day-to-
day responsibility for developing and 
implementing the internal control and 
risk management procedures resides 
with the executive management team 
which then reports on risk to the Audit & 
Risk Committee. This represents a two-
way disclosure and monitoring system 
for such systems and procedures which 
provides the Directors with reasonable 
(but not absolute) assurance against 
material misstatements and losses. The 
results of this system can be seen in the 
information relating to the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Group, together 
with the mitigating factors.  page 14
How does the Company’s system of 
internal controls work?
In the first instance, the Company has a 
system of internal controls based around 
certain key policies and procedures 
which define the Group’s standards of 
business and include a schedule of 
matters reserved for the Board, a defined 
organisation structure, a delegation 
of authority matrix and safety and 
quality policies, all of which are framed 
within the Company’s core values. 
There are also policies and procedures 
which embed regulatory requirements 
into the daily operations of the Group 
such as the anti-bribery and corruption 
policy, the share dealing code, the insider 
dealing and market abuse policy and the 
whistleblowing policy . They are all available 
on the Company’s website (www.lamprell.
com). In addition, there is a multi-lingual, 
secure whistleblowing hotline which was 
set up to allow staff members to report 
ethical breaches, irregularities or simply 
concerns on a confidential basis without 
any fear of recrimination. They are all key 
elements of an internal control system which 
is designed to assist in the achievement 
of the Group’s business objectives. 
The Audit & Risk Committee undertakes 
an annual review of the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. 
This is performed in collaboration with both 
the internal and external auditors and, 
where weaknesses have been identified; 
the management team was tasked with 
implementing further safeguards which will 
then be re-tested by the audit teams. The 
Committee reports on its monitoring and 
observations to the Board at least annually . 
The Directors are satisfied that, as a  
result of the systems and the oversight 
functions, the internal control environment  
is operating effectively .
What activities has the Group undertaken during 2014 to manage risk appropriately?

directors’ remuneration  
report
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board,  
I am pleased to introduce 
the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended  
31 December 2014. 
Performance and reward in 2014
The Company’s exceptional performance 
in 2014, particularly in terms of net 
profit, sales and safety, building on the 
improvements achieved in the previous  
year , resulted in a strong bonus pay out 
of 90.7% to the CEO. The breakdown of 
the CEO’s performance against targets is 
detailed elsewhere in this report.
As announced to the market on 17 October , 
Joanne Curin stood down as a Director and 
CFO. The position has not yet been filled 
and Tony Wright, formerly Vice-President 
(Finance), was promoted to the position 
of Deputy CFO pending a decision on a 
permanent appointment. Tony Wright is not 
a Director .
Although shareholders approved both the 
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report 
on Remuneration during the 2014 AGM, 
shareholders expressed concern about the 
Company’s proposal to issue two sets of 
long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) awards in 
2014 in order to make up for the Company’s 
inability to issue an LTIP award during 
2013 due to a prolonged closed period. 
As a result, the Remuneration Committee 
engaged with shareholders to address a 
number of concerns that had emerged 
at the 2014 AGM. The outcome of this 
consultation is referenced further below  
and in the Remuneration Policy Statement. 
After a prolonged restricted period from 
October 2012 to June 2014, followed by 
the period of shareholder consultation, in 
November the Company was finally able 
to make the delayed awards to the CEO 
in respect of the 2013 and 2014 LTIP and 
his contractual entitlement to a recruitment 
award of stock options.
Remuneration Policy for 2015
As reported last year , the Remuneration 
Policy was extensively reviewed by the 
incoming Committee during 2013 and 
was approved at the AGM in June 2014. 
However the resolutions on executive 
remuneration were passed but with a 
narrower margin than we had sought 
and without sufficient support to give the 
Committee comfort that it had a clear 
mandate to proceed. Following this vote, 
the Committee took the view that further 
consultation with investors was appropriate 
and the Company made a statement to that 
effect. Hence revised proposals were put 
forward to address the shareholders’ key 
concerns and based on positive feedback 
from the shareholders, we were able to 
implement the revised proposals.
The Committee is satisfied that the 
Remuneration Policy will ensure that we can 
recruit and retain the right calibre of senior 
management to maximise shareholder value 
and deliver sustainable growth over the 
longer term whilst addressing the concerns 
expressed by shareholders during 2014.
We will be seeking your support for  
this report at the forthcoming AGM on  
12 May 2015. On behalf of the Committee  
I recommend this Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to you and I hope that you will find it 
clear , concise and understandable.

Remuneration Policy 
The Policy Statement was put to a binding 
shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and 
the policy took formal effect from 10 June 
2014. No changes are proposed to the 
Remuneration Policy for 2015 and therefore 
the policy is approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM and is reproduced below 
solely for information.
As a result of shareholder concerns at the 
AGM, the Company undertook a process 
of consultation and in response to the 
concerns of some investors, agreed that 
in several respects, it would apply the 
remuneration policy on a more restrictive 
basis than the approved policy would 
otherwise allow. Although these do not 
formally constitute a change to policy, for 
ease of readership we have noted these 
amendments in the text of the policy report 
which is reproduced below:
1. a reduction in the CEO’s maximum LTIP 
opportunity from 120% to 100%  
of base salary;
2. an agreement not to use the exceptional 
LTIP limit of 150% of base salary;
3. a freeze on Executive Directors’ base 
salaries and fees for Non-Executive 
Directors until January 2016;
4. the introduction of more challenging 
targets for the 2014 long-term incentive 
plan; and
5. remuneration payments under all future 
Service Agreements are enforceable 
only insofar as they fall within a 
shareholder-approved Remuneration 
Policy .
Policy overview
The Committee is responsible, on behalf 
of the Board, for establishing appropriate 
remuneration arrangements for the 
Executive Directors and other senior 
management in the Group.
Our Remuneration Policy aims to drive 
continuous improvements in business 
performance and maximise shareholder 
value by offering remuneration packages 
that are appropriately balanced and 
are designed to enable the recruitment, 
retention and motivation of talented 
Executive Directors and senior 
management. 
In setting the remuneration policy for 
the Executive Directors, the Committee 
considers the remuneration policy and 
levels of remuneration for the wider 
employee population, the policy and 
practice in the UAE and the wider market. 
The Committee will ensure that the 
arrangements are in the best interests of 
both the Group and its shareholders, by 
taking into account the following general 
principles:
 » To attract, retain and motivate the best 
talent without paying more than is 
necessary .
 » To ensure total remuneration packages 
are simple and fair in design and valued 
by participants. 
 » To ensure that the fixed element of 
remuneration is determined in line 
with market rates, taking account of 
individual performance, responsibilities 
and experience; and that a significant 
proportion of the total remuneration 
package is linked to performance-related 
incentives. 
 » To balance performance pay 
between the achievement of financial 
performance objectives and delivering 
sustainable stock market out-
performance; creating a clear line of 
sight between performance and reward 
and providing a focus on sustained 
improvements in profitability and returns. 
 » To calibrate carefully all performance 
metrics and associated sliding scale 
ranges to ensure that performance 
is incrementally rewarded through 
stretching targets and that executives 
are not inadvertently incentivised to take 
inappropriate business risks.
 » To maintain the highest possible health 
and safety standards where any fatality 
that takes place in a facility operated by 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries 
may result in discretionary withdrawal of 
incentive eligibility .
 » To provide a significant proportion 
of performance linked pay in shares 
allowing senior management to build 
significant shareholding in the business 
and therefore aligning management with 
shareholders’ interests and the Group’s 
performance. 
 » To maintain appropriate governance and 
risk management through the application 
of holding periods and clawback 
provisions on incentive plan awards.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Company is committed to maintaining 
good communications with investors, as 
evidenced by the process of consultation 
that took place following the 2014 AGM. 
The Committee considers the AGM to be 
an opportunity to meet and communicate 
with investors and consider shareholder 
feedback received in relation to the AGM 
each year and guidance from shareholder 
representative bodies more generally . This 
feedback, together with any additional 
feedback received on a regular basis, is 
then considered as part of the Company’s 
annual review of remuneration policy . 
The Committee will also seek to engage 
directly with major shareholders and 
their representative bodies should any 
material changes be made to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy . Details of the votes 
cast for and against the resolution to 
approve last year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.  page 53 Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

increase in the scale or 
scope of the role. 
None
1. A description of how the Company intends to implement the above policy is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance metric selection
The annual bonus is predominantly based 
on key financial performance indicators,  
to reflect how successful the Group has 
been in managing its operations. The 
balance is determined on performance 
against individually determined strategic 
objectives and annual operational targets, 
including HSE.
The LTIP performance measures reward 
significant long-term returns to shareholders 
and long-term financial growth. Targets 
take account of internal strategic planning 
and external market expectations for the 
Company and are set appropriately to the 
economic outlook and risk factors prevailing 
at the time, ensuring that such targets 
remain challenging in the circumstances, 
whilst remaining realistic enough to  
motivate and incentivise management.  
Only modest rewards are available for 
achieving threshold performance with 
maximum rewards requiring substantial  
out-performance of challenging strategic 
plans approved at the start of each year . 
Discretion
The Committee will operate the incentive 
plans in accordance with their respective 
rules, the UK Listing Rules and the HMRC 
rules where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains 
discretion over a number of areas relating to 
the operation and administration of certain 
plan rules. These include (but are not limited 
to) the following: 
 » who participates; 
 » the timing of the grant of award and/or 
payment;
 » the size of an award (up to plan/policy 
limits) and/or a payment;
 » the result indicated by the relative TSR 
performance condition may be scaled 
back (potentially to zero) in the event that 
the Committee considers that financial 
performance has been unsatisfactory 
and/or the outcome has been distorted 
due to the TSR for the Company or any 
comparator company being considered 
abnormal;
 » discretion relating to the measurement of 
performance in the event of a change of 
control or reconstruction;
 » determination of a good leaver (in 
addition to any specified categories) 
for incentive plan purposes and the 
treatment of leavers;
 » adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring and special 
dividends); and
 » the ability to adjust existing performance 
conditions for exceptional events so that 
they can still fulfil their original purpose.
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving 
this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority 
is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or 
former Directors (such as, the vesting or 
exercise of past share awards).
Relative to pay and employment  
conditions in the Group 
The Committee takes account of 
remuneration levels offered to the senior 
management team in the Group as well as 
the awards affecting the wider employee 
population. When considering the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration structure and levels, 
the Committee reviews base salary and 
incentive arrangements for the management 
team, to ensure that there is a coherent 
approach across the Group. Employees 
may be eligible to participate in an annual 
bonus arrangement and receive awards 
under the LTIP , Executive Share Option Plan 
(“ESOP”), Retention Share Plan (“RSP”) or 
Free Share Plan (“FSP”). Opportunities and 
performance metrics may vary by workforce 
level with specific business metrics 
incorporated where possible. 
While the Company sees communication 
among its employees as a key priority, it 
does not formally consult with employees 
in respect of the design of the Executive 
Director remuneration policy, although the 
Committee will keep this under review.

Executive Directors 
The charts below show an estimate of the 
potential range of remuneration payable for 
the Executive Director(s) in 2015 at different 
levels of performance. The charts highlight 
that the performance-related elements 
of the package comprise a significant 
portion of the Executive Director’s total 
remuneration at maximum performance.

Assumptions:
1. Base salary levels applying on 1 January 2015.
2. Benefits are estimated, based on the 
annualised value for the year ended  
31 December 2014.
3. The end of service gratuity is estimated,  
based on the accrual for the year ended  
31 December 2014.
4. Minimum performance assumes no award 
is earned under the annual bonus plan and 
no vesting is achieved under the LTIP; at 
on-target, typically 80% of the maximum is 
earned under annual bonus plan and typically 
40% vesting is achieved under the LTIP; and at 
maximum full vesting under both plans. 
5. As per the legislation, share price movement 
and dividend accrual have been excluded 
from the above analysis.
Directors’ recruitment and promotions 
The Committee takes into account the need 
to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors and senior managers of the 
highest calibre, while at the same time 
ensuring a close alignment between the 
interests of shareholders and management.
If a new Executive Director was to be 
appointed, the Committee would seek 
to align the remuneration package with 
the remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders, including discretion to award 
an annual bonus up to 100% of base 
salary and, in exceptional circumstances, 
an LTIP award up to 150% of base salary .
1
 
Flexibility would be retained to set base 
salaries at the level necessary to facilitate 
the hiring of candidates of appropriate 
calibre in external markets and to make 
awards or payments in respect of deferred 
remuneration forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer . In terms of remuneration 
to compensate forfeited awards, the 
Committee would look to replicate the 
arrangements being forfeited as closely 
as possible and in doing so, would take 
account of relevant factors including the 
nature of the remuneration, performance 
conditions and the time over which they 
would have vested or been paid. 
1. In subsequent consultation with shareholders, 
it was agreed that the normal maximum LTIP 
opportunity and exceptional maximum LTIP 
opportunity would remain at 100%.
In exceptional circumstances and only on 
recruitment (e.g. to buyout the value of 
awards forfeited) the Committee may also 
award share options of up to 150% of base 
salary under the ESOP . Options will vest 
dependent on the achievement of agreed 
performance and/or retention conditions 
over a three year period and will be 
exercisable up to the 10th anniversary of the 
date of grant. Dividends that accrue during 
the vesting period may be paid in cash or 
shares at the time of vesting, to the extent 
that the options become exercisable.
For an internal appointment, any incentive 
amount awarded in respect of a prior role 
may be allowed to vest on its original terms, 
or adjusted as relevant to take into account 
the appointment. Any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue.
The Committee may also agree that the 
Company will meet certain relocation and 
incidental expenses as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman 
or NED, the fee arrangement would be 
set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy at that time. 
Directors’ service agreements and 
payments for loss of office 
The Committee reviews the contractual 
terms of the service agreements to ensure 
these reflect best practice. 
The Group’s policy is that Executive 
Directors should be employed on a rolling 
term, with a notice period not exceeding 12 
months and in the event of early termination, 
the Company will not make any payments 
beyond its contractual obligations. 
The Executive Directors’ service 
agreements are terminable on 12 months’ 
notice. In circumstances of termination on 
notice, the Committee will determine an 
equitable compensation package, having 
regard to the particular circumstances of 
the case. The Committee has discretion 
to require notice to be worked or to make 
payment in lieu of notice or to place the 
Director on garden leave for the notice 
period. In case of payment in lieu or garden 
leave, base salary, benefits and end of 
service gratuity will be paid for the period 
of notice served on garden leave or paid in 
lieu. If the Committee believes it would be 
in shareholders’ interests the Company may 
elect to make payments in three separate 
tranches; 50% within seven working days of 
the termination date; 25% three months after 
the termination date; and 25% six months 
after the termination date. 
The annual bonus may be payable in 
respect of the period of the bonus plan year 
worked by the Director; there is no provision 
for an amount in lieu of bonus to be payable 
for any part of the notice period not worked. 
The bonus will be scaled back pro-rata for 
the period of the incentive year worked by 
the Director and will still be payable at the 
normal payment date. 
Long-term incentives granted under the LTIP 
will be determined by the plan rules which 
contain discretionary good leaver provisions 
for designated reasons (e.g. participants 
who leave early on account of injury, 
disability or ill health, or any other reason at 
the discretion of the Committee). In these 
circumstances a participant’s awards will 
not be forfeited on cessation of employment 
and instead will vest on the normal vesting 
date. In exceptional circumstances, the 
Committee may decide that the participant’s 
award will vest early on the termination 
date. In either case, the extent to which 
the awards will vest depends on the extent 
to which the performance conditions have 
been satisfied and a pro-rata reduction of 
the awards will be applied by reference 
to the time of cessation (although the 
Committee has discretion to disapply 
performance conditions and time pro-rating 
if the circumstances warrant it). In the case 
of death of the participant, the award will 
vest at that time, irrespective of whether or 
not any performance conditions have been 
satisfied, and the award will not be time 
pro-rated. 
In respect of legacy options outstanding 
under the ESOP , the options will be 
determined by the plan rules which contain 
discretionary good leaver provisions for 
designated reasons (i.e. participants who  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
52
leave early on account of injury, disability 
or ill-health, a sale of their employer or 
business in which they were employed 
or any other reason at the discretion of 
the Board). In these circumstances a 
participant’s options will not be forfeited 
on cessation of employment but will vest 
on the termination date instead. The extent 
to which the options become exercisable 
depends, unless the Board determines 
otherwise, on the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been satisfied 
up until the termination date or such longer 
period as the Board may decide within six 
weeks of the grant date. The performance 
period will end on the termination date 
unless the Board determines otherwise. 
In the case of death of a participant, the 
option will become exercisable at that 
time, irrespective of whether or not any 
performance conditions have been satisfied, 
and the option will not be time pro-rated.
In the event of a change of control all 
unvested awards under the long-term 
incentive arrangements would vest, to the 
extent that any performance conditions 
attached to the relevant awards have been 
achieved. The awards will, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, be scaled 
back pro-rata for the period of the incentive 
year worked by the director (although 
the Committee has discretion to disapply 
performance conditions and time pro-rating 
if the circumstances warrant it). 
The table below sets out the details of the 
Executive Directors’ service contracts:
Director Date of contract
James Moffat 25 November 2012
The service contracts are available for 
inspection during normal business hours 
at the Company’s registered office, and 
available for inspection before and at  
the AGM. 
After consultation with shareholders 
following the 2014 AGM, it was agreed that 
remuneration payments under all future 
Service Agreements are enforceable only 
insofar as they fall within a shareholder-
approved Remuneration Policy .
NEDs terms of engagement
The NEDs do not have service contracts 
and instead are appointed by letters of 
appointment for an initial term of three 
years, which are terminable by three 
months’ notice on either side. At the end of 
the initial period the appointment may be 
renewed by mutual consent for an additional 
three-year term, subject to re-election at  
the AGM. 
Upon termination or resignation, NEDs are 
not entitled to compensation and no fee is 
payable in respect of the unexpired portion 
of the term of appointment.
Currently, three NEDs (excluding the 
Chairman who was independent on 
appointment) are considered to be 
independent of the Company . 
The following table shows the effective date 
of appointment for each NED:

Annual Report on Remuneration
This report has been prepared in 
accordance with Part 4 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 and 9.8.6R of the UK’s 
Listing Rules. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM. The 
information  pages 55 to 59 has been 
audited.
Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for 
determining and agreeing with the 
Board the policy on Executive Directors’ 
remuneration, including setting the 
over-arching principles, parameters and 
governance framework and determining 
the initial remuneration package of 
each Executive Director . In addition, the 
Committee monitors the structure and level 
of remuneration for the senior management 
team and is aware of pay and conditions 
in the workforce generally . The Committee 
also ensures full compliance with the Code 
in relation to remuneration. The Committee’s 
terms of reference are available for review 
on the Company’s website. 
Members and activities of the Committee
The members of the Committee throughout 
the relevant period were Michael Press 
(Chair) and John Malcolm. Membership is 
comprised solely of independent NEDs. 
None of the current Committee members 
have day-to-day involvement with the 
business nor do they have any personal 
financial interest in the matters to be 
recommended. The Company Secretary 
acts as Secretary to the Committee and 
the Vice-President, Human Resources 
and Administration attends meetings on a 
regular basis to present and provide related 
support. The number of formal meetings 
held and the attendance by each member 
is shown in the table below. The Committee 
also held informal discussions as required.

External advice received
During the year , the Committee received 
independent advice on remuneration 
matters from New Bridge Street (“NBS”), 
a trading name of Aon plc. NBS did not 
provide other services to the Group during 
the year under review and there is no other 
connection between NBS and the Company 
or the Directors. The Committee also 
consulted with the CEO and Chairman but 
not in relation to their own remuneration. 
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Code of Conduct and adhere 
to the Voluntary Code of Conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in 
the UK. The Committee has reviewed the 
operating processes in place at NBS and 
is satisfied that the advice it receives is 
objective and independent.
The fees paid to NBS during the year were 
£106,280.
Shareholder voting at AGM  
At last year’s AGM held on 10 June 
2014, the shareholders cast their votes in 
connection with the resolutions relating to 
the parts of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report (see table below).
During 2014, the Committee engaged 
in a process of consultation with key 
shareholder groups aimed at addressing a 
number of concerns that emerged at and 
following the AGM on 10 June. As a result 
of this consultation, the Committee made 
a number of proposals to address these 
concerns, which are within the approved 
policy but constrain the manner in which we 
shall implement it; these are noted in the 
Remuneration Policy which is set out on  
 pages 47 to 52.
Implementation of the remuneration 
policy for 2015
Base salary
In setting the base salaries for 2015, 
the Committee considered external 
market data, the increase in base salary 
for the senior management team and 
the workforce generally, where the 
average increases across the Group 
are expected to be up to 4%. However , 
in view of the agreement reached with 
shareholders to freeze Executive Directors’ 
base salaries until January 2016, this 
increase will not apply to the CEO and 
accordingly his base salary for 2015 will 
remain the same as 2014 as follows: 
Base salary USD 
from 1 January
%
increase 2015 2014
James Moffat 753,000 753,000 0%
Annual bonus for 2015
For 2015 the annual bonus opportunity will 
be 100% of base salary for the CEO and 
up to 100% of base salary for the CFO, 
once appointed. 50% of the bonus will be 
based on net profit, 25% will be based on 
sales set in relation to the Group’s budget 
and the remaining 25% will be based on 
non-financial, strategic and/or personal 
targets, including safety performance. 
This structure is intended to provide a 
rounded assessment of the Group and 
management’s performance. 
The sales targets will be within a range  
from USD 900 million to USD 1.4 billion  
with associated pay-outs within the range 
of 20-100% of target. The Committee 
considers any disclosure of future net profits 
to be commercially sensitive, however , full 
retrospective disclosure of targets and 
performance against them will be disclosed in 
next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Clawback provisions will apply .

Long-term incentives to be granted in 2015
Subject to compliance with the Listing Rules, awards will be made in 2015 and the maximum LTIP potential will be 100% of base salary for the 
CEO and for the CFO, once appointed. 50% of the award will be based on relative TSR (relative to the FTSE World Oil Equipment and Services 
Index), 25% on cumulative EBITDA and 25% on end of period backlog.
Relative TSR, cumulative EBITDA and end of period backlog are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance 
for the Group, in that they ensure the Executive Directors are incentivised and rewarded for the financial performance of the Group as well as 
returning value to shareholders.

The awards will be subject to clawback provisions. 
A mandatory holding restriction of 18 months beyond vesting will apply to the 2015 awards. 
End of service gratuity
As required under the UAE Labour Law, the Company contributes to the End of Service Gratuity Fund on behalf of the Executive Directors, 
whereby the gratuity will be 21 days’ base salary for each year of the first five years of employment and 30 days’ base salary for each 
additional year of employment thereafter , on the condition that the total gratuity does not exceed two years’ base salary, payable upon 
termination of employment.
Outside appointments
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept appropriate external, commercial Non-Executive Director appointments provided the 
aggregate commitment is compatible with their duties and does not cause a conflict of interest with the role of an Executive Director . Such 
Executive Directors may retain fees paid for these services, which will be subject to approval by the Board. During the year Joanne Curin 
served as a Non-Executive Director on the Board of WS Atkins plc and Deep Ocean Group Holding BV . 
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman’s remuneration is determined by the Committee and the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Executive 
Directors and the Chairman, all of which is based on the responsibility and time committed to the Group’s affairs and appropriate market 
comparisons. Individual Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions regarding their own fees. The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors receive no other benefits. A summary of the current fees are as follows:

2. Benefits and allowances include housing, private medical insurance, life insurance, club membership, the use of a company car and driver , private fuel card, 
airfare tickets and utility expenses.
3. End of service gratuity is the provision accrued during the year . In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, the present value of Directors’ end of service 
gratuity obligations under UAE Labour Law have been valued using the projected unit credit method, as at 31 December 2014 and 2013. Under this method an 
assessment has been made of a Director’s expected service with the Group and the expected base salary on the date of termination. As part of the valuation 
we have assumed an average base salary increment of 3% p.a. (2013: 3%). The expected liability on the date of termination has been discounted to its net 
present value using a discount rate of 3.5% p.a. (2013: 4.25% p.a).
4. The annual bonus for 2014 was based on performance against financial and non-financial performance targets. Performance against these targets is set out in 
the table below. 
5.  Joanne Curin’s service agreement was terminated on 17 October 2014. Details of the payments made in respect of the termination are provided on  page 57.

Corporate governance: Directors’ Remuneration Report
Long-term incentive awards granted during the year
Due to the prolonged close period and subsequent period of shareholder consultation, the Company had been unable to make any LTIP 
awards since 2012. Accordingly, awards were made on 18 November to the CEO in respect of the 2013 and 2014 LTIPs. The awards were 
based on a value equivalent to 100% of Mr Moffat’s base salary and, in each case, amounted to 321,691 shares at nil cost.
The 2013 LTIP award vests in full on the date of the publication of the 2015 results subject to achievement of a performance condition relating 
to three-year cumulative EBITDA to 31 December 2015. The 2014 LTIP award vests in full three years from the date of grant subject to the 
achievement of conditions established around three-year EBITDA to 31 December 2016, end of period backlog and relative TSR. The 2014 
incentives, once vested, will be subject to a holding period of 12 months from the date of publication of the 2016 results.
In addition, as reported last year , the Committee agreed that the CEO’s contractual recruitment award should remain in place despite the 
prolonged close period and the earlier proposal to adopt a long stop date. Accordingly, on 18 November , Mr Moffat was awarded an option 
over 340,855 shares, equivalent in value to 100% of his annual base salary, at an exercise price of £1.4125 per share being the closing mid-
market price on the day immediately preceding the date of grant. The options will vest three years from the date of grant in accordance with 
plan rules and conditional upon achievement against a relative TSR performance metric tested at 1 March 2016.
In view of this delayed contractual award, it was agreed that a cash compensatory award of up to £79,293 would be made to Mr Moffat on  
1 March 2016 in respect of the lost opportunity from 1 March 2013 to the date the options were granted (18 November 2014). The compensatory 
award was calculated by reference to the number of shares that Mr Moffat expected to be awarded on 1 March 2013, the share price on 1 
March 2013, adjusted for the rights issue (£1.2057), and the share price on the date of grant (£1.4125). The award will be conditional upon the 
achievement of a relative TSR condition and a minimum share price on 1 March 2016 equal to the grant price of £1.4125. In the event that the 
share price on 1 March 2016 is between £1.2057 and £1.4125, vesting of the cash award will be scaled back to 0% on a straight-line basis.
As reported last year , in recognition of the exceptional circumstances whereby the composition of the Board completely changed except for 
the Chairman and the Company was restructuring its financing and recovering from poor trading results in 2012, the Remuneration Committee 
agreed that some form of additional compensation was appropriate to recognise the significantly increased commitments required by the 
Chairman throughout H2 2012 and 2013 and in recognition of the need to re-establish longer-term stability on the Board and the senior 
management team.
Accordingly on 18 November , an award of 122,499 shares at nil cost was made to John Kennedy, equivalent in value to his annual fee of 
£180,000. The shares will vest in full three years from the date of grant under the terms of the Company’s Retention Share Plan 2009.

Directors’ interests in ordinary shares 
The Committee has adopted a formal policy requiring the Executive Directors to build and maintain, through the award of shares by the 
Company, a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 150% of base salary for the CEO and 125% of base salary for the CFO, when 
appointed. Until such time as this threshold is achieved there is a requirement for executives to retain the net proceeds of all vested share 
awards. Mr Moffat has not currently achieved these guidelines.  
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company discloses the beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company as at 
31 December 2014 as follows:

2. Save in relation to John Kennedy , there were no changes to the interests of the Directors in the ordinary shares of the Company in the period from 1 January 
2014 to 16 March 2015, being the last practicable date that the Company is able to report on Directors’ interests. As between the start of the year and  
17 March 2015, John Kennedy or his connected persons had acquired an additional 1,601,939 interests in the share capital of the Company, pursuant to a 
trading plan which was entered into on 15 January 2015 in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and the Model Code. Further purchases may 
have been made under such trading plan after the date of this annual report on remuneration. 
3. This comprises the RSP award in 2014, which is subject to a vesting period. 
Note: Full details of the Directors’ shareholdings and share allocations are given in the Company’s Register of Directors’ Interests, which is open to inspection at 
the Company’s registered office during business hours. 
Payments to former directors
There were no payments to former directors during the year .
Payments to departing directors
Joanne Curin stood down as a Director and CFO on 17 October 2014 and her last day at work was 17 November 2014. Under her Service 
Agreement she was entitled to full salary and benefits for a notice period of 12 months amounting to USD 862,784. In addition, under the 
terms of a Compromise Agreement, a payment of USD 463,215, representing 85% of Ms Curin’s annual base salary, was made in lieu of 
her eligibility for a short-term incentive award for 2014. A further payment of USD 284,500 was made in lieu of her eligibility for a long-term 
incentive award in accordance with the rules of the plan.
Both the payments in lieu of incentive awards took into consideration the performance of the Company and Ms Curin up to 17 November 2014. 
The payments in lieu of incentive awards are subject to a clawback provision in the event that the Company’s auditors determine any material 
issue in relation to the reported accounts up to 30 June 2014.
The total value of contractual compensation, payments in lieu of incentive awards and the continuation of benefits in lieu of notice amounted 
to USD 1,610,499 including an amount of USD 63,487 in respect of Ms Curin’s entitlement to UAE gratuity which, under the requirements of 
UAE labour law, will become payable in 2015 upon Ms Curin’s final departure from the UAE. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Corporate governance: Statutory Information and Directors’ Statements
Memorandum and Articles of  
Association
The Company’s Memorandum of 
Association sets out the objectives and 
powers of the Company . The Articles of 
Association detail the rights attaching to 
each share class, the method by which the 
Company’s shares can be purchased or 
re-issued and the provisions which apply 
to the holding or and voting at general 
meetings. The Articles also set out the rules 
relating to Directors (including by way of 
example, their appointment, election and 
re-election, retirement, duties and powers).  
Capital structure and significant  
shareholders
Details of the authorised and issued share 
capital together with details of movements 
in share capital during the year are included 
in Note 25 to the financial statements. The 
Company has one class of share in issue, 
ordinary shares of 5 pence each, all of 
which are fully paid. Each ordinary share 
in issue carries equal rights including one 
vote per share on a poll at general meetings 
of the Company, subject to the terms of 
the Company’s Articles of Association and 
applicable laws. There are no restrictions on 
the transfer of shares. 
Details of the Company’s employee share 
schemes are disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report  page 56 and in 
Note 8 to the financial statements.

The awards under the Lamprell plc FSP , RSP

Pursuant to the Company’s share schemes, 
the Employee Benefit Trust as at the year-
end, held a total of 16,217 (2013: 14,686) 
ordinary shares of 5p, representing less 
than 0.01% (2013: 0.01%) of the issued 
share capital. The voting rights attaching to 
these shares cannot be exercised directly 
by the employees, but can be exercised 
by the trustees. However , in line with good 
practice, the trustees do not exercise 
these voting rights. In the event of another 
company taking control of the Company, 
the employee share schemes operated by 
the Company have set change of control 
provisions. In short, awards may, in certain 
circumstances and in approved proportions, 
be allowed to vest early or be allowed to be 
exchanged for awards of equivalent value in 
the acquiring company .
The Company was given authority at the 
2014 AGM to make market purchases of 
up to 26,000,000 ordinary shares of 5p, 
which represented approximately 10% of 
the Company’s then issued ordinary share 
capital. This authority will expire at the 2015 
AGM, where approval from shareholders 
will be sought to renew the authority for 
approximately 10% of the Company’s 
current issued ordinary share capital.
Approval from shareholders is also 
proposed to be sought to authorise the 
Directors to allot the Company’s unissued 
shares up to a maximum nominal amount 
of £4,900,000, representing approximately 
30% of the Company’s current issued 
ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) to existing shareholders and to 
issue equity securities of the Company 
for cash to persons other than existing 
shareholders, other than in connection 
with existing exemptions contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association or in 
connection with a rights, scrip dividend, 
or other similar issue, up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £825,000 representing 
approximately 5% of the current issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company . 
Authorities were given by the shareholders 
at the AGM in 2014 to issue a similar 
percentage of the Company’s then issued 
ordinary share capital. The authorities 
now sought, if granted, will expire on the

earlier of the conclusion of the AGM of the 
Company next year and the date which 
is 15 months after the granting of the 
authorities.
What are the Directors’ responsibilities?
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year . Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union. The 
financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 » make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 » state that the financial statements 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
 » prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors confirm that they have 
complied with the above requirements in 
preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Isle of 
Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the Isle 
of Man governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair , balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy . 
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed  pages 32 to 33 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 » the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the 
Group; and
 » the Directors’ Report includes a 
fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
As far as each Director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. In 
addition, each Director has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information. 
What is the Directors’ approach to  
preparing this report?
The Directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair , balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess a company’s 
performance, business model and strategy . 
The Audit & Risk Committee oversees the 
implementation of this approach.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the Strategic report  pages 
01 to 31. The financial position of the 
Company, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in 
the Financial Review  pages 18 to 19. 
The Company’s consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. After reviewing its cash 
flow forecasts for a period of not less than 
12 months from the date of signing these 
financial statements, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will 
have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Group therefore continues to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
its financial statements. 
The financial information has been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, except 
as disclosed in the accounting policies 
below.

Financial statements
independent  
auditor’s report  
to the members of lamprell plc Report on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated and parent company financial statements (“the financial statements”) of Lamprell plc and 
its subsidiaries (the “Group”) which comprise the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 December 2014 and the consolidated 
income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated and company statements of changes in equity and 
consolidated and company cash flow statements for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory notes.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with applicable Isle of 
Man law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and parent company financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. This report, including the opinion, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 15 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error . In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
 » the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2014 and of 
its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
 » the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the parent company as at 31 December 
2014 and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982; and
 » the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report on the following:
The Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931-2004 require us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 » proper books of account have not been kept by the parent company or , proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 » the parent company’s balance sheet is not in agreement with the books of account and returns; or
 » we have not received all the information and explanations necessary for the purposes of our audit; and
 » certain disclosures of Directors’ loans and remuneration specified by law have not been complied with.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 » the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern; and
 » the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.

limited by shares under the Isle of Man Companies Acts with the registered number 117101C. The Company acquired 100% of the legal and 
beneficial ownership in Lamprell Energy Limited (“LEL”) from Lamprell Holdings Limited (“LHL”), under a share for share exchange agreement 
dated 25 September 2006 and this transaction was accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the uniting of interests method 
(Note 26). The Company was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (“ AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange with effect from 16 October 
2006. From 6 November 2008, the Company moved from AIM and was admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) plc’s main 
market for listed securities. The address of the registered office of the Company is Fort Anne, Douglas, Isle of Man and the Company is 
managed from the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”). The address of the principal place of the business is PO Box 33455, Dubai, UAE.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) are: the upgrade and refurbishment of 
offshore jackup rigs; fabrication; assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewable sector , including jackup

1. The remaining balance of 51% in each case is registered in the name of a Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) National/Entities owned by a GCC National, but 
has assigned all the economic benefits attached to their shareholdings to the Group entity . The Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity via management agreements and, accordingly , these 
entities are consolidated as wholly owned subsidiaries in these consolidated financial statements. These shareholders receive sponsorship fees from the Group 
(Note 24).

Financial statements
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and parent company financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931-2004. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982, the Company has not presented its own statement of comprehensive 
income. 
After reviewing its cash flow forecasts for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of signing of these financial statements, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Therefore, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting polices below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated and parent company financial 
statements, are disclosed in Note 4.
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
IAS 32 (amendments), ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, on asset and liability offsetting, are guidance to the application and clarify some  
of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet. The Group has adopted this amendment and  
it has no material impact on Group.
IAS 36 (amendment), ‘Impairment of assets’ on recoverable amount disclosures, addresses the disclosure of information about the 
recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The Group has adopted this amendment 
and it has no material impact on Group.
(b)  New and amended standards and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2014 but not 
currently relevant to the Group
IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’. This is an interpretation of IAS 37, ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the 
recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event (known as an 
obligating event). The interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the 
relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy . The Group is currently not subjected to significant levies so the impact on the Group is 
not material.
Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities. These amendments mean that many funds and similar 
entities will be exempt from consolidating most of their subsidiaries. Instead, they will measure them at fair value through profit or loss. The 
amendments give an exception to entities that meet an ‘investment entity’ definition and which display particular characteristics. Changes have 
also been made IFRS 12 to introduce disclosures that an investment entity needs to make. This amendment is currently not applicable to the 
Group, as the Group has no investment entities.
IAS 39 (amendment), ‘Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting’ on financial instruments recognition and measurement, 
provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation to a hedging instrument to a central counterparty meets specified criteria. 
This amendment is currently not applicable to the Group.
(c)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2014 and not  
early adopted
Amendment to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’ regarding depreciation and amortisation, clarifies that 
the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that 
includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset. The Group 
intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The 
complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for 
financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification 
depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments 
are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in 
OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For 
financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other 
comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by 
replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and 
for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is 
still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.1 Basis of preparation continued
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information 
to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contract 
with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and 
obtain the benefits from the goods or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related 
interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted. The 
Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
Amendment to IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ regarding employee or third party contributions to defined benefit plans, applies to contributions 
from employees or third parties to defined benefit plans and clarifies the treatment of such contributions. The amendment distinguishes 
between contributions that are linked to service only in the period in which they arise and those linked to service in more than one period.  
The Group intends to adopt these amendments from the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2015.
Amendment to IAS 27, ‘Separate financial statements’ regarding the equity method, allows entities to use the equity method to account 
for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. The Group intends to adopt these 
amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 regarding the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture, 
addresses an inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint 
venture. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction 
involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if those assets are in a subsidiary . The Group intends to adopt these amendments  
no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
Amendment to IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ regarding acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, provides new guidance on how to 
account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint venture operation that constitutes a business. The amendments require an investor to apply 
the principles of business combination accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a ‘business’. The Group 
intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
2.2 Revenue recognition
(a) Contract revenue
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method. When the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated, 
revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated costs up to the year end bear to the estimated total costs of the 
contract. When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to the extent of costs 
incurred up to the year end which are considered recoverable.
With respect to new build fixed price construction contracts with an expected contract duration of 18 months or greater , profit on such 
contracts will only be recognised when the contract has progressed to 20% based on the total estimated cost of the contract and the ultimate 
outcome can be reliably estimated. 
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of revenue 
arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable that 
the customer will accept the claim and the amount can be measured reliably .
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated losses, including 
any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is first foreseen.
The aggregate of the costs incurred and the profit/loss recognised on each contract is compared against progress billings at the year end. 
Where the sum of the costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss exceeds the progress billings, the balance is shown under trade 
and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts. Where the progress billings exceed the sum of costs incurred and recognised 
profit or recognised loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables as amounts due to customers on contracts.
In determining contract costs incurred up to the year end, any amounts incurred, including advances paid to suppliers and advance billings 
received from subcontractors relating to future activity on a contract, are excluded and are presented as contract work-in-progress.
(b) Products and services 
Revenue from sale of products and services is recognised in the accounting period in which the risks and rewards are transferred or the 
service is rendered. 
(c) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.3 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity . Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 
date that control ceases. 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owner of the acquiree and the equity interests 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amount of acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value 
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as 
goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is 
recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations involving entities under common control do not fall within the scope of IFRS 3. Consequently, the Directors have a 
responsibility to determine a suitable accounting policy . The Directors have decided to follow the uniting of interests’ method to account for 
business combinations involving entities under common control.
Under the uniting of interests method, there is no requirement to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities and hence no 
goodwill is recorded as balances remain at book value. Consolidated financial statements include the profit or loss and cash flows for the 
entire year (pre- and post-merger) as if the subsidiary had always been part of the Group. The aim is to show the combination as if it had 
always been combined.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses  
are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed  
or adjustments have been made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted 
by the Group.
(b) Disposal of subsidiaries
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, 
with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purpose of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of related asset or liabilities. This may 
mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(c) Joint arrangements
The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint 
operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor . The Company has assessed the nature of 
its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity 
method of accounting, interest in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the 
post- acquisition profits or losses and movements in the consolidated income statement. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture 
equals or exceeds its interest in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interest that, in substance, forms part of the Group’s net 
investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the joint ventures.
(d) Associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 
20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity 
method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of 
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the 
associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is 
the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying 
value and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of an associate’ in the consolidated income statement.

continued Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.4 Investment in subsidiaries
In the Company’s separate financial statements, the investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less provision for impairment. Cost is the 
amount of cash paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the investment. Income from such investments is recognised only 
to the extent that the Company receives distributions from accumulated profits of the investee company arising after the date of acquisition. 
Distributions received in excess of such profit i.e. from pre-acquisition reserves are regarded as a recovery of investment and are recognised 
as a reduction of the cost of the investment.
2.5 Foreign currency translation 
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Group’s activities are primarily carried out from the UAE, whose 
currency, the UAE Dirham, is pegged to the United States Dollar (“USD”) and is the functional currency of all the entities in the Group (except 
MISCLP and MIO whose functional currency is the Omani Riyal, MISQWLL whose functional currency is the Qatari Riyal, MIS Kazakh Branch 
and LKZ whose functional currency is the Kazakh Tenge and EBT whose functional currency is the Great Britain Pound). The consolidated and 
parent company financial statements are presented in US Dollars. 
(b)  Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when deferred 
into other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated income 
statement within ‘finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the consolidated income statement 
within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 » assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 » income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and
 » all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, are taken to other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on sale.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment is the purchase 
cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the expected useful 
economic lives of the assets as follows:
Years
Buildings and infrastructure 3-25
Operating equipment 3-15
Fixtures and office equipment 3-5
Motor vehicles 5
The assets’ residual values, if significant and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Subsequent 
costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably . All repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, capital work-in-progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment and 
depreciated in accordance with Group policies.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable 
amount (Note 2.22). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within ‘other  
gains/(losses) – net’ in the consolidated income statement. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.7 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over Lamprell plc’s interest in the 
net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (“CGUs”) 
or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is 
allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is 
monitored at the operating segment level. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less 
costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
(b) Trade name
A trade name acquired as part of a business combination is capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if  
the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . Amortisation is calculated on a 
straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life. The useful life of a trade name is reviewed on an 
annual basis. 
(c) Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of 
acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . Amortisation 
is calculated on a straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life. The useful life of customer 
relationships is reviewed on an annual basis.
(d) Operating lease rights
Intangible assets representing operating leasehold rights are carried at cost (being the fair value on the date of acquisition where intangibles 
are acquired in a business combination) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any . Amortisation is calculated using the straight 
line method to allocate the cost of the leasehold right over its estimated useful life. 
(e) Computer software
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs. Other 
development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer software development costs recognised as 
assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives. 
(f) Work-in-progress
Work-in-progress is in relation to computer software and stated at cost. When commissioned, work-in-progress is transferred to software and 
amortised in accordance with Group policies.
2.8 Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and consumables which are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost is 
determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition.
2.9 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts receivable from customers for billing in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or 
less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor , probability that 
the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade 
receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement within ‘general and administrative expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against 
the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘general and 
administrative expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.

2.10 Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.11 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made. 
2.12 Employee benefits
(a) Provision for staff benefits 
A provision is made for the estimated liability for employees’ entitlements to annual leave and related benefits as a result of services rendered 
by the employees up to the balance sheet date. The provision relating to annual leave and leave passage is disclosed as a current liability and 
included in trade and other payables.
Provision is also made, using actuarial techniques, for the end of service benefits due to employees in accordance with the Labour Laws 
applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, for their periods of service up to the balance sheet date. The provision relating to end 
of service benefits is disclosed as a non-current liability .
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The current service cost and interest cost is recognised in the income statement in ‘Employees’ end of service benefits’.
(b) Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the shares/options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the shares/options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for 
example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares/
options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of shares/options that 
are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company has granted rights to its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies conditional upon the completion of 
continuing service with the Group for a specified period. The total amount of the grant over the vesting period is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and is recognised in each period as an increase in the investment in the subsidiary with 
a corresponding credit to retained earnings. In the separate financial statements of the subsidiary, the fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the equity instruments of the Company is recognised as an expense with a corresponding credit to 
equity .
2.13 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated income statement on 
a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current accounts with banks less margin deposits, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
on the balance sheet. 
2.15 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the repayment value is recognised in the consolidated statement of income 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The Group capitalises general and specific borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
2.16 Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Group’s consolidated and parent company financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the shareholders.
2.17 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker . The chief 
operating decision-maker , who is responsible for allocating resources and accessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the Executive Directors that make strategic decisions.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2.18 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity . In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively . 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However , deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax 
is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax liability where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.19 Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables. Currently, 
the Group does not have any available-for-sale and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as 
hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the 
consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or 
have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented in the 
consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’ in the period in which they arise.
(b) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as  
non-current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade receivables (Note 2.9), other receivables (excluding prepayments), receivables from a 
related party and cash and cash equivalents (Note 2.14) in the consolidated balance sheet and amounts due from related parties (Note 24) 
and cash at bank (Note 22) in the Company balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost less provision for 
impairment. The amortised cost is computed using the effective interest method. 
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the counterparty have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership.
(c) Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or 
events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.20 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if 
so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur , the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 28. The full fair value of a hedging derivative 
is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when 
the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement 
within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the item affects profit or loss (for example, when the 
forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’. However , when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset (for example, contracts work-in-progress or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the 
case of contracts work in progress or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
2.21 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through 
a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
2.22 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to amortisation and 
are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and 
its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 
reporting date. Any material impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement and separately disclosed.
2.23 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity . Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The excess of proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs over the par value 
of the shares are credited to the share premium.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
2.24 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of 
their nature or amount. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

3 Financial risk management 
3.1 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange and cash flow interest rate risk), credit 
risk and liquidity risk. These risks are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis to assess and manage critical exposures. The Group’s 
liquidity and market risks are managed as part of the Group’s treasury activities. Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of 
established policies and procedures.  
(a) Market risk – foreign exchange risk
The Group has foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to commitments in Euro with certain suppliers. To manage the foreign exchange 
risk exposure arising from future commercial transactions and recognised liabilities, the Group uses forward exchange contracts (Note 28). 
(b) Market risk – cash flow interest rate risk
The Group holds its surplus funds in short-term bank deposits. During the year ended 31 December 2014, if interest rates on deposits had 
been 0.5% higher/lower , the interest income would have been higher/lower by USD 1,358,744 (2013: USD 899,000).
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk 
which is covered by the Group by taking fixed interest rate swap against the variable rates. During the year ended 31 December 2014, if interest 
rates on borrowings had been 0.5% higher/lower , the interest expense would have been higher/lower by USD 543,411 (2013: USD 730,000).
(c) Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is detailed in Notes 15, 21, 22 and 28. The Group has a policy for dealing with customers with an 
appropriate credit history . The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, financial asset carried at fair 
value through profit or loss, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments. The Group has a formal procedure of monitoring 
and follow up of customers for outstanding receivables. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum 
rating of ‘B’ are accepted. The Group assesses internally the credit quality of each customer , taking into account its financial position, past 
experience and other factors.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had a significant concentration of credit risk with nine of its largest customer balances accounting for 57% 
(2013: 81%) of trade receivables outstanding at that date. Management believes that this concentration of credit risk is mitigated as the Group 
has long-standing relationships with these customers.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed 
credit facilities. The Group is currently financed from shareholders’ equity and borrowings. 
The Group’s liquidity risk on derivative financial instruments is disclosed in Note 28.

3.2 Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, or issue new shares to 
reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated 
as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and bank balances. Total capital 
is calculated as “equity” as shown in the balance sheet plus net debt. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has no net debt and was therefore un-geared.
3.3 Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
a. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
b. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
c. Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all 
significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant 
inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. 
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
a. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments; and
b. Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. 
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
Revenue recognition 
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the percentage-of-completion method 
requires the Group to estimate the stage of completion of the contract to date as a proportion of the total contract work to be performed in 
accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.2. As a result, the Group is required to estimate the total cost to completion of all 
outstanding projects at each period end. The application of a 10% sensitivity to management estimates of the total costs to completion of all 
outstanding projects at the year end would result in the revenue and profit increasing by USD 4.4 million (2013: USD 28.3 million) if the total 
costs to complete are decreased by 10% and the revenue and profit decreasing by USD 4.4 million (2013: USD 29.7 million) if the total costs 
to complete are increased by 10%.
Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill (Note 17) for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. Goodwill is monitored by management at the ‘cash generating unit relating to upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, 
fabrication, assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors, including FPSO and other offshore and 
onshore structures, oilfield engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs’ (“CGU 1”). 
The recoverable amount of CGU 1 is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (Note 17). 
The amount of headroom is USD 290.6 million (2013: USD 187.1 million). 
If the revenue growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction of USD 5.7 million 
(2013: USD 3 million) in the headroom if the revenue growth rate was lower or the headroom would be higher by USD 5.7 million (2013:  
USD 3 million) if the revenue growth rate was higher . 
If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction in the headroom of  
USD 55.2 million (2013: USD 27.6 million) if the discount rate was to increase or an increase in the headroom by USD 63.5 million (2013:  
USD 31.2 million) if the discount rate was to decrease. 
If the net profit as a percentage of revenue used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be an increase 
of USD 62.1 million (2013: USD 56.1 million) in the headroom if the net profit was to increase or there would be an reduction in the headroom 
of USD 62.1 million (2013: USD 56.1 million) in the headroom if the net profit was to decrease. 
If the terminal value growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction in the 
headroom of USD 43.4 million (2013: USD 19.9 million) if the terminal value growth rate was lower or an increase in the headroom of  
USD 49.8 million (2013: USD 22.5 million) if the terminal value growth rate was higher .

4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Estimated impairment of investment in subsidiaries
The Company tests investment in subsidiaries (Note 18) for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate a potential impairment. The recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiaries is determined based on value-in-use calculations. 
These calculations require the use of estimates. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by 
management covering a three-year period. 
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated revenue growth rate of 5% (2013: 5%). A discount rate of 
10.46% (2013: 11.48%) is used to discount the pre-tax cash flows projections to the present value. In determining the appropriate discount 
rate, the Group considers the weighted average cost of capital employed, which takes into consideration the risk free rate of US treasury 
bonds with the long-term maturity period, UAE inflation rate, equity risk premium on the entities operating from UAE, Group’s beta and cost of 
Group’s debt.
The amount of headroom is USD 381.7 million (2013: USD 45 million).
If the revenue growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower by  
USD 5.8 million (2013: USD 3.1 million) if the revenue growth rate was decreased or the headroom would be higher by USD 5.8 million  
(2013: USD 3.1 million) if the revenue growth rate was increased. 
If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower by USD 56.7 million 
(2013: USD 27.5 million) if the discount rate was increased or the headroom would be higher by USD 65.4 million (2013: USD 31.1 million)  
if the discount rate was decreased. 
If the net profit as a percentage of revenue was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower by 
USD 63.2 million (2013: impairment charge of USD 56.4 million) if the net profit as a percentage of revenue was lower or the headroom would 
be higher by USD 63.2 million (2013: USD 56.4 million) if the net profit as a percentage of revenue was higher . 
If the terminal value growth rate was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower by  
USD 44.7 million (2013: USD 19.8 million) if the terminal value growth rate was lower or the headroom would be higher by USD 51.4 million 
(2013: USD 22.4 million) if the terminal value growth rate was increased. 
Employees’ end of service benefits
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post-employment defined benefit obligation should be based on market yields on high quality 
corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds should be used. In the 
UAE, there is no deep market for corporate bonds and no market for government bonds and therefore, the discount rate has been estimated 
using the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy . On this basis, the discount rate applied was 3.5% (2013: 4.25%). If the discount rate 
used was to differ by 0.5 points from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the employee end of the service benefits provision at 
the balance sheet date would be an estimated USD 1.5 million (2013: USD 1.3 million) lower or USD 1.6 million (2013: USD 1.4 million) higher . 
If the salary growth rate used was to differ by 0.5 points from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the employee’s end of the 
service benefits provision at the balance sheet date would be an estimated USD 1.5 million (2013: USD 1.5 million) higher or USD 1.6 million 
(2013: USD 1.4 million) lower .
5 Segment information 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker . The chief 
operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Directors who make strategic decisions. The Executive Directors review the 
Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments 
based on these reports.
The Executive Directors consider the business mainly on the basis of the facilities from where the services are rendered. Management 
considers the performance of the business from Sharjah (“SHJ”), Hamriyah (“HAM”) and Jebel Ali (“JBA ”) in addition to the performance of 
Land Rig Services (“LRS”), Sunbelt, Engineering and Construction (“E&C”) and Operations and Management (“O&M”).
SHJ, HAM, JBA and LRS are reported as a single segment (Segment A). Services provided from Sunbelt, E&C and O&M do not meet the 
quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8, and the results of these operations are included in the “all other segments” column. 
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue from the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, fabrication, assembly and 
new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors, including FPSO and other offshore and onshore structures, oilfield 
engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Free share plan
The Company awarded shares to selected Directors, key management personnel and employees under the free share plan that provides 
an entitlement to receive these shares at no cost. These free shares are conditional on the Directors/key management personnel/employee 
completing a specified period of service (the vesting period). The award does not have any performance conditions and does not entitle 
participants to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The fair value of the share awards made under this plan is based on the share 
price at the date of the grant, less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period.

Executive share option plan
Share options are granted by the Company to certain employees under the executive share option plan. This option plan does not entitle the 
employees to dividends. These options are conditional on the employee completing three years of service (the vesting period) and hence the 
options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date and have a contracted option term of 10 years. The Group has no legal or 
constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.

Performance share plan
The Company granted share awards to Directors, key management personnel and selected employees that give them an entitlement to 
receive a certain number of shares subject to the satisfaction of a performance target and continued employment. The performance target 
related to the growth in the Group’s earnings per share. The fair value of the share awards made under this plan is based on the share price at 
the date of the grant less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period.

13 Earnings per share
(a) Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year , excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares  
(Note 25).
(b) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion  
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the free share awards, options under the executive share option plan and the performance share 
plan, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average 
annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share 
awards/options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming  
the exercise of the share awards/options.

On 26 June 2014, the Company announced a rights issue of five shares for every 16 shares held at a discounted price of 88 pence per share 
resulting in the issue of 81,363,469 new ordinary shares (Note 25). The calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the 
current period was affected by the issue of the new ordinary shares. The Group has treated the discount element of the rights issue as if it 
were a bonus issue, using the theoretical ex-rights price of 132 pence per share. The effect of this is to increase the weighted average number 
of shares reported in the prior period, with a resulting reduction in the reported basic and diluted earnings per share for the previous period. 
The adjustment factor , to effect the increase in the weighted average number of shares, has been calculated by dividing the share price 
immediately before the shares were quoted ex-rights (146p) with the theoretical ex-rights price (132p), giving an adjustment factor of 1.104. 
These adjustments to the comparative EPS calculations do not impact the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet 
previously reported. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Trade name represents the expected future economic benefit to be derived from the continued use of the MIS trade name acquired through 
the acquisition of MIS. 
Leasehold rights represent a favourable operating right acquired upon the acquisition of MIS and existing leasehold rights in the books of 
MIS on acquisition of Rig Metals LLC in 2008. The value of the intangible assets has been determined by calculating the present value of the 
expected future economic benefits to arise from the favourable lease terms of 11 to 19 years. 
Work-in-progress represents the cost incurred towards the implementation of new Enterprise Resource Planning software (“ERP software”). 
During 2012, the implementation of the old ERP software was discontinued and the usable portion of USD 1.5 million was transferred to 
software, and amortised until 31 December 2013. 
Management reviews the business performance based on the type of business (Note 5). Goodwill is monitored by the management at the 
operating segment level. Goodwill of USD 180.5 million arising due to the acquisition of MIS has been allocated to the CGU 1 within Segment A.
The recoverable amount of CGU 1 has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates. 
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on Group budget covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the three-year 
period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for 
the business in which the CGU operates. The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflect specific risks to the relevant cash generating unit.
The key assumptions, revenue growth rate, discount rate, net profit rate and terminal value growth rate used in the value-in-use calculations 
are as follows:
2014 2013
Revenue growth rate
1
5% 5%
Discount rate
2
10.55% 11.48%
Net profit rate
3
 5% 3%
Terminal value growth rate
4
3.25% 3.25%
1. Revenue growth rate for the first three-year period is based on the Group budget. Beyond this period the growth rate is determined based upon past 
performance and management expectations of future market development. 
2. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the weighted average cost of capital employed, which takes into consideration the risk free 
rate of US treasury bonds with the long-term maturity period, UAE inflation rate, Equity risk premium on the entities operating from UAE, Group’s beta and cost 
of Group’s debt.
3. Net profit rate for the first three-year period is based on the Group budget. Beyond this period net profit rate is determined based upon management 
expectations of future market development taking into consideration Group’s financial recovery when compared to previous year , its lower cost of debt from 
refinancing and implementation of strong cost discipline improved productivity initiatives.
4. Terminal value growth rate is based upon management expectations of future market development.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Legal reserve
The Legal reserve relates to subsidiaries (other than the subsidiaries incorporated in free zones) in the UAE and the State of Qatar . In 
accordance with the laws of the respective countries, the Group has established a statutory reserve by appropriating 10% of the profit for the 
year of such companies. Such transfers are required to be made until the reserve is equal to, at least, 50% (UAE) and 33.3% (State of Qatar) 
of the issued share capital of such companies. The legal reserve is not available for distribution.

On 11 September 2006, the Group acquired 100% of the legal and beneficial ownership of Inspec from LHL for a consideration of USD 4 million. 
This acquisition was accounted for using the uniting of interests method and the difference between the purchase consideration (USD 4 million) 
and the share capital of Inspec (USD 0.2 million) was recorded in the Merger reserve. On the disposal of Inspec during the period, this reserve 
has been recycled to the consolidated income statement and presented as part of the gain on disposal of a subsidiary (Note 23). 
On 25 September 2006, the Company entered into a share for share exchange agreement with LEL and LHL under which it acquired 100%  
of the 49,003 shares of LEL from LHL in consideration for the issue to LHL of 200,000,000 shares of the Company . This acquisition has  
been accounted for using the uniting of interests method and the difference between the nominal value of shares issued by the Company 
(USD 18.7 million) and the nominal value of LEL shares acquired (USD 0.1 million) has been recorded in the Merger reserve.

27 Provision for employees’ end of service benefits 
In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, management has carried out an exercise to assess the present value of its obligations at  
31 December 2014 and 2013 using the projected unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service benefits payable under the Labour 
Laws of the countries in which the Group operates. Under this method, an assessment has been made of an employee’s expected service life 
with the Group and the expected basic salary at the date of leaving the service. The obligation for end of service benefit is not funded. 
The movement in the employees’ end of service benefit liability over the year is as follows:

The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
2014 2013
Discount rate 3.50% 4.25%
Future salary increase:
Management and administrative employees 3.00% 3.00%
Yard employees 2.50% 2.50%
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post-employment defined benefit obligation should be based on market yields on high quality 
corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds should be used. In the 
UAE, there is no deep market for corporate bonds and no market for government bonds and, therefore, the discount rate has been estimated 
using the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy . On this basis, the discount rate applied was 3.5% (2013: 4.25%).  
Due to the nature of the benefit, which is a lump-sum payable on exit for any cause, a combined single decrement rate has been used as 
follows:
Percentage of employees at each 
age exiting the plan per year
2014 2013
Yard employees:
20-29 years 16% 16%
30-44 years 10% 10%

are pegged to the US Dollar .
On 11 August 2014, the Group signed an agreement with the lenders for a syndicated facility . This new facility will replace the Group’s  
existing funded facility with a USD 350 million facility, comprising a USD 100 million term loan, USD 50 million for general working capital 
purposes and USD 200 million of working capital for project financing. In addition, the lending banks have agreed to arrange a committed

2011 HAS BEEN ANOTHER GOOD YEAR FOR 
DIALOG SEMICONDUCTOR PLC, WITH REVENUE 
UP 78% YEAR-ON-YEAR TO US$527 MILLION 
AND THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF 
SITEL SEMICONDUCTOR BV.
The Company continues its strategy of deeper 
and broader relationships with existing customers 
(more complex solutions sold into new and existing 
applications) whilst at the same time increasing the 
number of new customers. The SiTel acquisition has 
undoubtedly helped the Company bring on board 
new significant customers such as Microsoft, Gigaset 
and Plantronics.
I believe the Company is firmly on the way to 
achieving the goal of US$1 billion plus annual 
revenues. The Company continues to work towards 
ensuring it has the necessary infrastructure to support 
a US$1 billion turnover business with global reach, 
whilst at the same time maintaining best industry 
metrics not only in terms of quality control but also 
financially, where profitability has to be carefully 
managed, given the competing pressures of the 
price expectation of volume customers and 
supply constraints.
As last year, despite the troubled economic 
environment, I remain confident about the future 
growth prospects of the Company in 2012 and 
thank you for your continued support.

Business review and strategy
NEW CUSTOMERS ACROSS NEW APPLICATIONS AS A RESULT  
OF OUR PROCESSOR PARTNER PROGRAMME INITIATIVE 
A key element of Dialog’s success is to engage with application processor vendors  
and develop power management companion chips for their processors.  
This allows Dialog to become an integral 
part of their promotional and 
application ecosystem and reach a 
much broader customer base without 
the need for additional sales and 
support investment. In 2011, Dialog 
continued to support and expand  
its relationships with the major 
application processor vendors  
within the portable space, including 
announcing Freescale as the latest 
processor company to join 
the programme.
BROADENED OUR CUSTOMER BASE BY LEVERAGING OUR 
PORTFOLIO OF STANDARD SOLUTIONS
Dialog has increasingly adapted some 
of its solutions to address multiple 
customers’ needs, thereby transitioning 
its portfolio to offer more standard 
products. In 2011, new products were 
launched including a third generation 
of configurable system power 
management ICs, new audio codecs, 
low energy green VoIP ICs, a new 
generation of digital cordless chips  
as well as SmartPulse™ technology 
enabling smart home sensor networks.
PERFECTION OF THE FABLESS MODEL WHILE MAINTAINING 
CLOSE CONTACT WITH OUR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS
Dialog remained focused on its 
existing business model, which 
included fully outsourcing silicon wafer 
production and test to Asian foundry 
manufacturing plants and test houses, 
and supplying ASICs and ASSPs using 
mainstream CMOS and BCD-based 
process technologies. During 2011, 
a year of tight wafer capacity, while 
growing our business to a level of 
more than 300 million chips, we were 
again commended by many of our 
customers for our operational 
excellence and support. 
OUR STRATEGY WAS FURTHER VALIDATED IN 2011 WHEN WE 
DELIVERED RECORD FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  
WE HAVE AGAIN ACHIEVED HIGH GROWTH – BEYOND THE 
INDUSTRY AND OUR PEERS – AND EXITED THE YEAR WITH 
A STRONG BALANCE SHEET WITH NO DEBT.
Major achievements from Dialog in the execution of its strategy 
included the following:
ACCRETIVE ACQUISITION OF SITEL SEMICONDUCTOR
Adding US$109 million of revenue in 2011 through the addition of short-range 
wireless technologies to the portfolio. The acquisition contributed positively to 
Dialog’s earnings in the first quarter post the acquisition. Through an accelerated 
integration programme, including a single corporate organisation for the major 
functions, the products are now sold under the Dialog brand through a unified 
sales force.
DEEPENED OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY INDUSTRY 
TRENDSETTERS AND LEADERS 
Dialog has relationships with a number of high-volume customers, many of which 
are considered trendsetters and key industry leaders in their respective sectors. 
Dialog has in 2011 continued to focus efforts on these customers to increase 
both the custom semiconductor content sold into the customers’ platform  
and broaden the number of platforms addressed. In December 2011, Dialog 
announced its first platform success at 
Samsung for a smartphone platform, 
which will form the basis for a series 
of phones to be launched through 
2012 for the Chinese TD-SCDMA 
market. The first of these phones  
has already started production and  
is being distributed by China Mobile,  
the largest cellular operator in China.
EXPANDED NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA OPERATIONS WITH 
ALREADY INCREASED CUSTOMER SUCCESS DEMONSTRATED
Dialog expanded its recently opened office in Silicon Valley to support its growing 
US customer base and application processor partners and continues to add 
engineering and sales resources to 
support local US customers. In Taiwan, 
Christophe Chene has joined as a new 
addition to the management team 
with a charter to further increase the 
Dialog brand and awareness together 
with building out a greater footprint 
for operational, sales and marketing 
functions in the Greater China region. 
Both these regions represent exciting 
growth opportunities for Dialog  
going forward. 13
Chief Executive’s review
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
As we enter into the first half of 2012, it is worth 
taking a look at the progress of Dialog in the last year. 
As reported in our financial results, once again Dialog 
continued to perform very strongly on the top line  
with growth of 78% year-on-year, outpacing our 
competitors worldwide, in a backdrop of semiconductor 
industry growth of 2-3%. This constitutes our fourth 
consecutive year of profitable and rapid growth, 
something that our Board, our management team and 
all our employees have contributed to and are justly 
proud of. The impressive growth in 2011 was delivered 
partly through our organic growth and partly through 
the acquisition of SiTel Semiconductor in Q1 2011, 
more of which I will discuss later in this letter.
However, as it is commonly known, 2011 at a  
macro level was dominated by world macroeconomy 
and financial crisis issues carried over from 2010, 
compounded by some tragic natural disasters in  
Japan and Thailand. The impact of all this on the 
semiconductor industry, and supply chain in particular, 
was insufficient manufacturing investment, periodic 
uncertainty about capacity and shortage of certain  
key essential raw materials and packaging components. 
The effect of increasing costs in energy, raw material 
and precious metals such as gold, together with the 
tightness in the supply chain, had the undesirable 
effect of impacting the cost base of our products and 
thereby reducing our gross operating margins as a 
percentage of revenue, relative to 2010. As we enter 
2012, gross margin recovery is now an area where our 
management team is currently focused on to bring 
about improvements through cost reductions and 
capacity planning as well as positioning the Company 
to benefit from the prospects of a more balanced 
supply and demand situation with the manufacturing 
subcontractors in 2012.
Dialog market performance in 2011 was driven by the 
major success of our lead customers in the smartphone 
and tablet PC global markets. This market area is 
expected to continue to perform strongly for several 
years as a wider range of smartphones and tablets 
from different vendors are launched into the market.  
In line with our belief in the secular growth trends  
of personal portable connected devices, we have 
positioned the Company to develop the right 
technologies such as system power management,  
low power audio, low power display drivers and others 
to benefit from this ongoing growth and expansion. 
We believe that beyond the boom in media players, 
smartphones, tablets and e-books there will be other 
emerging portable devices such as ultra-books,  
as well as personal medical, fitness and sport handheld 
equipment that will drive further growth for years  
to come. Following on from this we believe there  
will be additional capabilities that Dialog must  
develop or acquire to ensure it maintains its growing 
leadership in the mixed signal semiconductor market 
for mobile devices.
In light of the above, we believe competencies 
in short-range connectivity is a key addition to 
our portfolio of technology, allowing Dialog’s

Going forward into 2012 and beyond, our focus will 
remain on scaling our operation to tackle our next 
mid-term target of US$ 1billion turnover with an 
increasing portfolio of mixed signal low power products 
for portable devices. Diversification of our product 
portfolio and key customer base with a focus on 
regional growth in Asia form the main pillars of 
our strategy.
Achieving a larger scale per se, whilst very desirable, 
is not a sufficient goal by itself. We believe we should 
also turn our attention to our social obligations and 
play our part as good corporate citizens. This means 
that we will be fine-tuning and augmenting our 
policies and actions with a conscious eye on the  
impact on the environment, sustainability and positive 
social contribution. 
Of course, our employees and management team 
remain the key essential ingredients of success  
at Dialog and the Company will continue to invest  
in their development and training, as well as career 
development and succession planning, to ensure  
our future is secured.
I look forward to the challenges of the year 2012 and 
remain confident of Dialog’s prospects for continuing 
growth and outperformance.

participation in the upcoming opportunities in new and 
emerging standards and applications for transmitting 
data within a short range between, for example, 
a smartphone device and other client devices or  
smart sensor networks. In February 2011, we acquired 
SiTel Semiconductor, a fabless semiconductor company, 
based in The Netherlands and owned by a private 
equity fund in the UK. We have been working hard 
together as a team to achieve a fast and high-quality 
integration of this company into Dialog, while 
maintaining the integrity and continuity of operational 
support for our customers. In addition to our established 
customer base, we have welcomed new customers 
from SiTel to our list, including Panasonic, Gigaset, 
Microsoft and Plantronics amongst others. We expect 
to increasingly benefit from this acquisition with 
cross-selling opportunities of Dialog low power 
products into the new customer base.
We are very pleased with our first acquisition, the 
quality of the team and its fit within Dialog. We have 
been able to accelerate and release several new 
products which were already in the R&D pipeline 
before the acquisition, such as a new generation of 
digital cordless chips, low power VoIP products, as well 
as SmartPulse™ technology enabling smart home sensor 
networks. Going forward, the strategic positioning of 
the R&D will increasingly target short-range wireless 
emerging standards which could include low energy 
bluetooth and wifi direct amongst others.
Chief Executive’s review continued
Dialog has established application 
laboratories at our global sites

OUR SOLUTIONS
Our solutions address four major markets: (i) portable 
electronic devices, including smartphones and tablet 
PCs, (ii) short-range wireless applications like digital 
cordless, gaming, home automation, (iii) VoIP 
applications, and (iv) automotive and industrial 
electronics. The demand for an increased feature  
set with improved displays in lithium-ion powered 
portable devices, coupled with the expectation of 
ever-increasing battery life, is a major driver in the 
development of our power-saving technology solutions.
With the acceleration of social networking driving 
increased adoption of smartphones, internet 
connectivity, photo and video sharing, video streaming 
and high-quality audio on portable devices make huge 
demands on battery energy management, as well as 
on the technology which controls the quality of images 
and displays. Our skill in developing highly integrated 
silicon solutions enables our customers to design 
products which deliver excellent performance as  
well as market-leading talk and standby times.
As short-range connectivity becomes prevalent in our 
society, Dialog provides both proprietary and standard 
solutions for applications, from cordless phones to 
wireless headsets to its latest SmartPulse™ to control 
home sensors. In the future, we expect personal 
healthcare and fitness monitoring to require short-
range transmission to your smartphone for intelligent 
apps processing and we currently adopt our technology 
to offer optimised solutions for these markets.
Because of the bandwidth efficiency and low costs by 
allowing voice and data to run over a single network 
that VoIP technology can provide, businesses are 
migrating from traditional copper wire telephone 
systems to VoIP systems. Dialog provides an energy-
efficient – Green VoIP – solution to address this 
growing market and engages with the leading global 
VoIP phone manufacturers from large enterprises to 
the small to medium business (SMB) and growing  
hotel market for VoIP .
Video must now be transmitted throughout the car, 
captured outside the car and monitored with extremely 
low latency to be able to react in real time to the 
changing external environment. Hi-fi quality is also 
demanded of the audio system and, of course, better 
GPS support. Our power management and clock 
companion ICs for the Intel Atom processor provide  
an optimum solution for next generation multimedia 
powered infotainment systems. Additionally, 
automotive customers use our products in comfort  
and safety sub-systems, and in the industrial market 
our products are used in highly integrated smart-power 
management systems such as intelligent electronic 
ballasts for fluorescent lighting.

DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION
We are justifiably recognised for the quality and 
feature-rich functionality of our mixed signal integrated 
circuits, achieving integration levels which we believe 
are the highest in the industry.
We nevertheless continually work to increase our 
intellectual property and improve our engineering  
skill base and technology portfolio.
During 2011, we invested US$90.0 million, or 17.1% 
of our revenues, in research and development. Our 
ability to develop mixed signal ASIC and Application 
Specific Standard Product (“ASSP”) designs rapidly 
enables us to respond to customers’ needs for new 
solutions that increase performance, while at the  
same time reducing cost. Our strategy of modifying 
and reusing a wide set of specialised analogue building 
blocks speeds up the design process; in addition, our 
use of industry standard design tools increases the  
level of automation and the quality of verification  
in our products. Our commitment to continuously 
deepen our expertise has resulted in increased levels  
of integration and product innovation in all 
business sectors.
POWER MANAGEMENT AND AUDIO ICS
Effective power management for ever-increasing 
feature-rich portable devices such as tablet PCs 
presents increasingly new design challenges. For 
example, the introduction of dual or quad ARM 
processor cores into the application processor which 
needs to be powered up and down in a particular 
sequence or operate in different sleep modes; 
increased peak currents due to lower geometry 
technologies; lithium-ion type batteries needing to 
charge faster, safer and from a wider variety of sources 
such as USB ports; changing chemical structures of 
batteries; in addition to displays which are required to 
be brighter, bigger and incorporate touch functionality 
with the use of new organic substrate materials.
All these trends impact the power management IC 
directly, and we constantly evolve our core technology 
and intellectual property to extend our market-leading 
status. With a long legacy of delivering different power 
management designs for world-leading mobile phone 
manufacturers and portable consumer OEMs, we 
optimise all aspects of the design, including electrical, 
thermal and mechanical (packaging) considerations. 
These designs offer unprecedented integration with 
multiple power management and analogue functions 
on the chip, including programmable high-performance 
LDOs (low dropout voltage regulators), high-efficiency 
DC-DC voltage converters, intelligent battery charging 
circuits, software programmable LED drivers, sensor 
ADCs, USB interfaces, and multichannel audio 
capabilities. By capitalising on our experience in 
integrating high- and low-voltage circuits on CMOS – 
the most widely used semiconductor technology – 
and combining it with our experience in developing 
and integrating high-performance CODECs and other 
analogue functions, we are able to offer a selection of 
differentiated power management and audio solutions. 
The integration of more than 40 different functions on 
a single chip delivers significant space, power and cost 
savings to our customers.
Continuous innovation and perfection of our 
power management IP portfolio allows our 
customers to typically save 30% of the power 
consumed in their portable devices.
In 2011, we launched a new class of power 
management product – DA9053 – our third generation 
of advanced system power management integrated 
circuit (PMIC) and flagship product, targeting high-end 
multicore-based applications, supporting the ARM 
Cortex™ processor. Additionally, a second member  
of the family – DA9021 – addresses lower power cost 
sensitive applications. 
DISPLAY DRIVERS AND RELATED-SYSTEM ICS
In 2011, Dialog provided the SmartXtend™ IC 
technology together with TDK OLED glass module 
(operations later in 2011 acquired by Futaba)  
to the cellphone industry. Lenovo in China was the  
first customer to bring a SmartXtend™ feature phone 
– S800 – to the market incorporating a transparent 
display based on SmartXtend™. 
Dialog Semiconductor partners with Qualcomm  
to exclusively supply driver ICs for their MEMs-based 
Mirasol™ technology. 2011 saw the first design wins 
of this technology in e-reader type applications. 
Qualcomm’s Mirasol™ colour display (wide viewing 
angle, readability in sunlight with very low power 
consumption and fast response time) is seeing 
increased adoption, with Qualcomm investing a 
reported US$1 billion on a new manufacturing site  
for mass production of Mirasol™ displays.
Product technology and key customers continued
Testing and monitoring 
integrated circuits first at  
a wafer level, ensures Dialog  
can reach optimum production 
yields of a final packaged 
integrated circuit. 19
AUTOMOTIVE AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM ICS
Dialog supplies motor control ASICs to a leading 
European automotive supplier who in turn delivers 
Dialog-based windscreen wiper motor products 
addressing mid- to high-end European cars. Additionally, 
our first product for a customer in Japan achieved 
qualification in 2011 and will shortly start production.
These devices capitalise on Dialog’s expertise and 
knowledge of technology, ranging from power 
management systems and mixed signal design,  
to high voltage circuits and embedded microprocessors 
on a single integrated circuit in an automotive- 
qualified CMOS process (including flash memory).
For the industrial market, Dialog develops innovative 
control ASICs, both for conventional light sources,  
such as fluorescent or high-intensity discharge (“HID”) 
lamps, and for emerging LEDs. These devices seek to 
deliver optimal control and regulation of light sources, 
while maximising their service life. Through intelligent 
control, using advanced digital signal processing,  
these devices help to minimise energy consumption.
MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING
We outsource our wafer production to selected 
foundries, principally in Singapore and Taiwan, which 
provide high-quality products and have the ability to 
meet both our stringent qualification requirements  
and tight deadlines. In 2011, in addition to CMOS, 
through a close cooperation with TSMC we have seen 
volume production of our first products using a BCD 
process which enables higher voltage functionality 
to be integrated efficiently into single chip power 
management ICs.
The final assembly of our chips is outsourced to a 
number of qualified subcontractors in Asia. Our test 
programmes, based on our own and individual 
customers’ specifications, are developed by our test 
engineers in parallel with the design process. All test 
development is undertaken at our Nabern facility in 
Germany using the same type of test equipment and 
handling interfaces that are used by our offshore test 
subcontractors in order to speed up the volume ramp 
and production transfer process. All production testing 
and warehousing of final product is outsourced to our 
Asian test subcontract partners, enabling direct drop 
shipments to our end customers. We have also created 
a specialist offshore operations and a support centre in 
Taiwan. We have our own manufacturing and technical 
engineers close to foundries, and assembly and test 
subcontractors in Asia. By being “on the spot”  
to resolve any potential engineering issues quickly,  
they can forestall potential delays in production.
QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENT CONTROL
We have an uncompromising approach to quality 
assurance in every area of our operations and an 
uncompromising goal to deliver “zero fail” products. 
Active employee participation in error prevention 
approaches has enabled us to win the approval of 
all our major customers and to beat their parts per 
million (ppm) failure rate expectations. The overall 
objective of our quality management system is to 
provide all our customers with the assurance that 
our products and services not only fulfil their current 
contractual requirements, but will also meet their 
future needs. We are committed to minimising our 
impact on the environment by developing and 
promoting environmentally compatible products, 
and operate in accordance with the ISO 14001 
international environmental quality standard. 
We continuously promote awareness and knowledge 
of environmental issues throughout the organisation 
to ensure that they become a natural part of the 
decision-making process. As we demand the same 
standards from our suppliers we only form supply 
partnerships with those who are accredited to the 
same international quality standards. For more  
detailed information on specific products, please see 
our Website: www.dialog-semiconductor.com.
PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS
Many of Dialog’s principal customers are leading 
portable device digital cordless, automotive and 
industrial equipment manufacturers that purchase  
both ASICs and ASSPs solutions. Customers with a 
significant contribution to revenue include Apple, 
Gigaset, Panasonic, RIM (Research in Motion) and 
Bosch. These top five customers represented 83%  
of revenue in 2011.
Given the rapidly evolving nature of the technology 
used in Dialog’s target markets, the Company strives 
to develop long-term relationships with its major 
customers and seeks to adopt a partnership approach 
for both standard products and custom solutions. 
Customers look to Dialog for high integration,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
SEGMENT REPORTING
Revenues in the Audio & Power Management  
segment for the year ended 31 December 2011 were 
US$369.2 million compared to US$245.4 million in 
2010, an increase of 50.5%. The increase in this sector 
is primarily driven by the success of our growing range 
of highly integrated power management solutions  
for portable devices including portable media players, 
smartphones and tablet PCs. 
The operating profit in the Audio & Power 
Management segment (see note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements) increased to 
US$70.0 million compared to US$59.1 million  
in the same period 2010, an increase of 18.4%.
Revenues in the Display Systems segment were 
US$1.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 
(2010: US$1.9 million). The decline in revenues 
between 2010 and 2011 is primarily due to the 
reduction in customer funded R&D activities which 
contributed predominantly to the 2010 revenues. 
The operating loss in this segment (see note 23 to  
the consolidated financial statements) for year ended 
31 December 2011 was US$10.1 million (2010: 
US$11.2 million). These losses reflect our investment 
in the emerging ultra-low power display technologies 
such as PMOLED.
Revenues from our Automotive/Industrial 
Applications segment were US$45.9 million for  
the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: US$50.3 
million), representing 8.7% of our total revenues 
(2010: 17.0%). Operating profit in the segment (see 
note 23 to the consolidated financial statements) was 
US$9.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 
(2010: US$7.0 million). The 8.8% year-on-year revenue 
decline reflects the fact that we benefited from sales  
of last time buy products during 2010 for an amount 
of US$6.4 million. These products were sold as a result 
of last year’s notification of the phasing out of an

Along with the increasing revenues, selling and 
marketing expenses increased from 5.9% of total 
revenues in 2010 to 6.1% of total revenues in the  
year ended 31 December 2011.
Excluding the share-based compensation impact, and in 
2011 the costs in connection with the SiTel acquisition, 
the underlying* selling and marketing expenses for 
2011 were US$25.9 million (4.9% of revenues) 
compared to US$15.8 million or 5.3% in 2010.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
General and administrative expenses consist primarily 
of personnel and support costs for our finance, human 
resources and other management departments. In 2011, 
general and administrative expenses increased to 
US$24.4 million (2010: US$17.5 million). This increase 
predominantly reflects the consolidation of the newly 
acquired SiTel business which contributed US$4.2 million 
of general and administrative expenses and the SiTel 
transaction costs of US$3.3 million. For the year ended 
31 December 2011, general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenues were 4.6% (2010: 5.9%). 
The underlying* general and administrative expenses were 
US$19.9 million or 3.8% of revenues in 2011. This 
compares to US$12.2 million (4.1% of revenues) in 2010.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES 
Research and development expenses consist principally 
of design and engineering-related costs associated with 
the development of new Application Specific Integrated 
Circuits (“ASICs”) and Application Specific Standard 
Products (“ASSPs”). Research and development 
expenses (net of customer funded projects) increased to 
US$90.0 million in 2011 (2010: US$56.5 million). The 
absolute US dollar increase in research and development 
expenses was primarily due to an increased headcount 
of our R&D personnel in support of our growth strategy. 
A major part of this headcount increase comes from 
the newly acquired SiTel business, which contributed 
US$21.0 million of research and development expenses 
(including amortisation expenses resulting from the 
purchase price allocation). As a percentage of total 
revenues research and development expenses decreased 
from 19.0% (2010) to 17.1% (2011), resulting from a 
higher revenue base in the latter period.
OTHER OPERATING INCOME, 
RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
Other operating income of US$0.3 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2011 relates to the unexpected 
settlement against receivables which had been written 
down in 2006 as a result of the insolvency of BenQ 
Mobile. For further information please refer to note 26 
to the consolidated financial statements. Restructuring 
expenses of US$0.6 million recorded in 2010 are 
related to the closure of our Heidelberg (Germany) 
Design Centre.
older manufacturing process from one of our 
foundry partners.
Revenues from our Connectivity segment were 
US$108.8 million. These revenues are associated with 
the SiTel business acquired in 2011. The operating 
profit achieved in the connectivity segments (see note 
23 to the consolidated financial statements) was 
US$4.9 million.
REVENUES 
Total revenues for the year ended 31 December 2011 
were US$527.3 million (2010: US$296.6 million).  
This increase of 77.8% results predominantly  
from higher sales volumes in our Audio & Power 
Management segment and the revenue from our 
Connectivity segment as described above.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales consists of material costs, the costs  
of outsourced production and assembly, related 
personnel costs and applicable overhead and 
depreciation of test and other equipment. For the year 
ended 31 December 2011, cost of sales increased by 
100.3% to US$319.1 million (2010: US$159.3 million), 
resulting from increased revenues recorded during  
the year. The newly acquired SiTel business contributed 
US$63.5 million to the cost of sales of the Group.  
As a percentage of total revenues, cost of sales in  
the same periods increased from 53.7% to 60.5%.  
The underlying* cost of sales for 2011 was 
US$316.0 million (59.9% of revenues) compared  
to US$158.9 million (53.6% of revenues) in 2010.
GROSS PROFIT
Gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 
US$208.2 million (2010: US$137.3 million). Our gross 
profit decreased from 46.3% of revenues in 2010 to 
39.5% of revenues for the year ended 31 December 
2011, driven by lower cost of sales as a percentage 
of revenue and the accelerated introduction of new 
products as prescribed above. 
SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES
Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily  
of salaries, sales commissions, travel expenses, 
advertising and other marketing costs. In 2011,  
selling and marketing expenses increased to  
US$32.4 million (2010: US$17.4 million) mainly  
as a result of the consolidation of the newly acquired 
SiTel business which contributed, US$13.5 million of 
selling and marketing expenses (including amortisation 
expenses resulting from the purchase price allocation). 
The increase is also in line with increased production 
volume and is a result of the Company’s investment  
in creating value by increasing staff in strategic 
marketing functions.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
CASH FLOWS
Cash generated from operating activities was 
US$69.6 million (2010: US$52.0 million). The cash 
inflow in 2011 primarily resulted from the operating 
income (before depreciation, amortisation and other 
non-cash effective expenses), and an increase in trade 
accounts payable. This cash inflow was partly offset 
by cash used for the purchase of inventory and an 
increase in trade accounts receivable. The cash inflow 
in 2010 primarily resulted from the operating income 
(before depreciation, amortisation and other non-cash 
effective expenses), a decrease in trade accounts 
receivable and higher trade accounts payable.  
This cash inflow was partly offset by an increase in 
inventory balances and a reduction in tax liabilities.
Cash used for investing activities in 2011 was 
US$116.1 million (2010: cash used US$15.5 million). 
Cash used for investing activities in 2011 consisted 
mainly of the net cash outflow in connection with  
the SiTel acquisition in the amount of US$84.2 million 
(2010: nil), the purchase of tooling (masks), laboratory 
equipment, probe cards, load boards and other 
advanced test equipment for a total of US$21.2 million 
(2010: US$9.8 million), the purchase of intangible 
assets of US$5.4 million (2010: US$5.9 million) and 
payments related to capitalised development costs  
of US$5.2 million (2010: US$2.8 million). 
LIQUIDITY
At 31 December 2011 we had cash and cash 
equivalents of US$113.6 million (31 December 2010: 
US$158.2 million). The decrease stands in connection 
with the cash outflow relating to the SiTel acquisition. 
The working capital (defined as current assets minus 
current liabilities) was US$150.8 million (31 December 
2010: US$169.2 million).
If necessary, we have available for use a multi-currency 
3 years (2010-2013) revolving credit line facility of 
£10.0 million at a rate of LIBOR +150bp and a 3 year 
(2011-2014) revolving credit facility of US$35.0 million 
that bears interest at a rate of LIBOR +140bp.  
At 31 December 2011 and 2010 we had no amounts 
outstanding under these facilities. In addition, we have 
two factoring agreements which provide the Company 
with up to US$42.0 million of readily available cash. 
Accordingly, we believe the funding available from 
these and other sources will be sufficient to satisfy  
our working capital requirements in the near to 
medium term if needed.
OPERATING PROFIT
We reported an operating profit of US$61.6 million  
for the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: 
US$45.3 million). The improvement primarily resulted 
from increased revenues and gross profits recognised  
in 2011. From the day of the acquisition our newly 
acquired SiTel business contributed US$12.6 million  
to the operating profit of the Group. Excluding the 
share-based compensation impact, and in 2011 costs  
in connection with the SiTel acquisition, the underlying* 
operating profit achieved in 2011 was US$79.8 million 
or 15.1% of revenue compared with the underlying* 
operating profit of US$56.2 million or 18.9% in 2010.
INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER 
FINANCIAL INCOME
For year ended 31 December 2011, interest income 
and other financial income from the Company’s 
investments (primarily short term) was US$0.4 million 
compared to US$1.1 million in the previous year.  
The decrease is primarily the result of decreased 
liquidity and lower interest rates.
INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER 
FINANCIAL EXPENSE
Interest expense and other financial expense consists 
primarily of expenses from the Group’s factoring 
arrangement. Interest and other financial expense  
in 2011 was US$0.2 million (2010: US$0.1 million).
INCOME TAXES
For the year ended 31 December 2011 a net  
income tax charge of US$5.6 million was recorded 
(2010: US$1.8 million). The amount in 2011  
consists of a current tax expense of US$7.0 million  
(2010: US$5.3 million) and a deferred tax benefit  
of US$1.4 million (2010: US$3.5 million). The tax 
charge in 2011 continued to benefit from the 
utilisation of brought-forward tax losses resulting  
in a residual minimum level current tax charge. 
Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets were 
recognised during the year. This resulted in a 
contribution of US$14.6 million (2010: US$10.6 million) 
to the Company’s net profit (for further information 
please refer to note 5 to the consolidated  
financial statements). 
NET PROFIT
For the reasons described above, in 2011 net profit 
increased by US$13.4 million to US$55.9 million or 
10.6% of total revenues (2010: US$42.5 million or 
14.3% of total revenues). For year ended 31 December 
2011, basic earnings per share were US$0.89 (2010: 
US$0.70) and diluted earnings per share were US$0.84 
(2010: US$0.66). The underlying* earnings per share 
(diluted) were US$1.11 for financial year 2011.  
This compares to US$0.82 for financial year 2010.

*  Underlying results are based on IFRS, adjusted to exclude share-based compensation charges of US$6.2 million (2010: US$10.9 million), excluding one-time costs of US$3.3 million associated with the 
acquisition of SiTel Semiconductor (“SiTel”) incurred during 2011, excluding US$6.4 million of amortisation of intangibles associated with the acquisition of SiTel and excluding amortisation expenses  
of US$2.2 million in relation to previously capitalised R&D expenses for close to end of life products from SiTel. The term “underlying” is not defined in IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with 
similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Underlying measures are not intended as a substitute for, or a superior measure to, IFRS measures.  Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 2 | Business review 24
Based on the expected positive net result for the  
near future, the management concluded that it was 
appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets in an 
amount of US$17.4 million (2010: US$10.8 million). 
The assessment was based on the business plan for 
2011 and beyond.
Non-current liabilities relate to provisions, capital lease 
and hire purchase commitments and the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments.
Shareholders’ equity increased to US$263.1 million 
(US$205.3 million at 31 December 2010) which is 
predominantly the result of our net profit. The equity 
ratio (equity over total assets) was 76.4% (81.0% at 
31 December 2010).
Balance sheet total was US$344.5 million at 
31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: US$253.4 
million). Cash and cash equivalents decreased by  
28.2% to US$113.6 million at 31 December 2011 
(31 December 2010: US$158.2 million). This decrease 
is predominantly related to a cash outflow from 
investing activities in the amount of US$116.1 million 
which was only partially offset by a cash inflow from 
operating activities in the amount of US$69.6 million 
and a cash inflow from the sale of shares in connection  
with the share option programme in the amount of 
US$2.3 million. Other current assets increased by 
102.0% to US$117.7 million (31 December 2010: 
US$58.3 million), mainly driven by higher inventory 
and trade accounts receivable balances. 
In 2011, total non-current assets increased by 206.6% 
to US$113.2 million. This increase is primarily due to 
the goodwill recorded in connection with the SiTel 
acquisition, higher balances of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets, again with an amount 
of US$25.6 million, the major part of this increase 
relates to the acquisition of SiTel. Also, in 2011, 
additional net deferred tax assets in the amount of 
US$6.6 million, principally relating to carried forward 
losses, were recognised of which US$2.1 million  
relate to SiTel.

Risks and their management
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group earns interest from bank deposits and uses 
money market deposits with highly rated financial 
institutions. During the year, the Group has held cash 
on deposit with a range of maturities from one week to 
three months. This can vary in view of changes in the 
underlying currency’s interest rates and the Group’s cash 
requirements. The Group has no long-term debt and 
no amounts outstanding under short-term credit facilities 
as at 31 December 2011 (2010: nil). The Group’s policy 
is to manage its interest income using a mix of fixed 
and variable interest rate debts. In order to achieve this 
policy, the Group invests in highly liquid funds having  
a matching investment strategy. Once the operating 
business has been financed, short-term excess funds 
are invested with reputable financial institutions.
CURRENCY RISK
The Company’ s functional – and presentational – currency 
is the US dollar, and the majority of its revenue and 
expenses are in that currency. There are, however, foreign 
exchange risks associated with transactions, and 
recognised assets and liabilities in other currencies, 
primarily the euro and the pound sterling. Transaction 
currency exposures arise from sales or purchases in 
currencies other than the US dollar. We use forward-
currency contracts to eliminate our exposure associated 
with the payment of salaries and wages in other currencies. 
We maximise the effectiveness of our hedge derivatives 
by matching the terms and conditions of the hedge to 
those of the underlying obligation (see note 24 on 
page 91 for further information).
CREDIT RISK
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities and certain of its financing activities. We ensure 
that our exposure to bad debt is minimised by monitoring 
all customers who trade on credit terms and receivable 
balances. In order to finance our growth we entered into 
two factoring agreements with reputable financial 
institutions. The maximum amount of cash that can  
be received under these factoring agreements is  
US$42 million (2010: US$25 million). Since the financial 
institutions assume all risks associated with the collection 
of receivables from selected customers, the agreements 
significantly reduce our risks associated with their collection.
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION RISK
We refer to note 24 to the consolidated financial 
statements section “vulnerability due to certain 
significant risk concentration”. 
LIQUIDITY RISK
We monitor our liquidity on a quarterly basis, with  
the objective of avoiding interest on short-term bank 
liabilities or overdrafts. Our policy is to structure the 
maturity of our current financial assets in the Group to 
meet 100% of the respective maturities and liabilities. 
THE MARKET
The market in which we compete is intensely 
competitive and highly cyclical, and is characterised 
by continuous development and technological 
improvement. Our future success depends on our 
ability to anticipate and respond to new market trends, 
to implement new designs rapidly to meet customers’ 
needs, and to keep abreast of the technological 
changes. As a result, we invest in research and 
development to enable us to create innovative designs 
and products on a cost-effective, timely basis.
REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY
We returned to profitability in 2008 after having not 
been profitable for the prior seven financial years and 
cannot guarantee that we will remain profitable in the 
future. But we constantly seek to improve profitability by 
launching new products and acquiring new customers. 
Since we continue to rely on a relatively small number  
of customers for a substantial proportion of our revenue, 
the loss of one or more of these customers would be 
likely to have a material effect. Our goal is to spread this 
risk by acquiring more customers. We are attempting to 
reduce the risk of our revenues, profitability and growth 
being affected by a slowdown in the wireless communicat- 
ions market by winning customers in other sectors.
THIRD-PARTY COSTS AND SUPPLIER RISK
Since 2007, we have outsourced our manufacturing 
and testing to lower-cost environments, mainly in Asia, 
where there is excellent capacity to overcome the potential 
problem of an inability to access manufacturing capacity 
which would result in increased costs and, therefore, 
decreased revenue. The tightness in the industry supply 
chain that we have experienced during most of 2011, 
and with increased demand due to our rapid growth, 
has impacted our ability to extract price reductions from 
our suppliers. We believe now as we enter the first quarter 
of 2012, the situation is stabilising due to investments 
that most of our suppliers made in extra manufacturing 
capacity in 2011 and we expect to see a gradual 
improvement in the supply chain situation from the 
end of the first quarter of 2012. We remain confident 
that we will continue to meet our revenue plans with the 
capacity we have secured with our suppliers. If any of the 
Company’ s suppliers were to become insolvent, there could 
be a risk of the Company’ s production being interrupted.
For this reason, the Company tries to source its components 
from at least two different suppliers and from different sites. 
In addition, the Company takes the precautions for supplier 
insolvency with its risk management system in which 
information on the creditworthiness of suppliers is kept. 
This seeks to identify suppliers at risk at an early stage.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We seek to protect our intellectual property from being 
copied or used by others by appropriate use of patents, 
copyrights and trademarks. Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 2 | Business review 26
Sustainability
ENVIRONMENTAL
The environmental agenda at Dialog considers  
climate change environmental protection aspects  
(air, land and water quality), effective resource 
management (eco-efficiency) and sustainability.  
Our commitment to the environment is evidenced  
by our ISO 14001 certification.
RAW MATERIALS
We take the scarcity of natural resources very seriously 
and consider the conservation of raw materials, such  
as metals, to be a top priority. Dialog is continually 
identifying potential methods to improve existing 
technologies and substitute alternatives, such as 
copper, for precious metals without sacrificing quality 
and performance. We have also implemented a rigorous 
recycling of precious metals, such as gold and silver, 
from our waste and damaged product. We have increased 
the quantity of recovered gold by 300% and recovered 
silver by 200%. In addition, we are actively reducing 
the quantity of hazardous substances used in our labs.
ENERGY AND CLIMATE
Dialog is working to systematically reduce CO 2 emissions 
to minimise the Company’s carbon footprint. The Carbon 
Disclosure Project recognised Dialog Semiconductor Plc 
as one of the 10 successful companies achieving the 
“Scope-2-Indirect CO 2 Emission Reduction” with a 
reduction of 26.3%, and have set a target of 30% by 2014.
PACKING AND RECYCLING
Dialog only uses packing material qualified as “green 
packing”, implementing a “non-wood packing” 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Dialog considers that the social challenges of corporate 
responsibility should be based on fair wages, healthy 
and safe working conditions, respect for human and 
labour rights, and honest relationships and commitment 
to community development. With regard to these 
challenges, Dialog is committed to the adoption of the 
Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (EICC) standard 
as the model for ensuring that working conditions for 
internal and external suppliers are safe and that all 
workers are treated with respect and dignity. This 
commitment is reflected in Dialog’s own “Code of 
Conduct”, which addresses all the key areas defined  
in the EICC standard along with recognised standards 
such as International Labour Organization Standards 
(ILO), Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 
Social Accountability International (SAI), and the Ethical 
Trading Initiative (ETI). In addition, the Company complies 
with the worldwide ISO 14001 Environmental Standard 
– and requires its suppliers to do the same – in order  
to ensure that all manufacturing processes are 
environmentally compliant.
We are currently undertaking a complete audit of our 
business operations; benchmarking, revising policies 
and setting targets for improvement on all areas of 
sustainability, including our: environmental impact, 
supply chain, employee development, community 
investment and corporate governance. Our objective  
is to become an industry leader in sustainability and 
corporate responsibility.
In 2011, Dialog sponsored energy saving projects through a donation of $10,000 to the Los 
Altos school district, with active participation from the students in the project. Mark Tyndall,

SOCIAL
EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT
Dialog aims to attract and retain the best people  
by ensuring that all employees receive comprehensive 
on-the-job formal training, coaching and mentoring. 
Employees work in a peer group that challenges, 
motivates, inspires and stretches the imagination – 
helping individuals to continue to grow and learn  
in their chosen field. Working in such an innovative 
environment means the opportunity to continue to 
learn happens on a daily basis. In parallel, Dialog has  
a range of specific learning and development initiatives, 
designed to enable all to develop to their full potential.
Dialog is committed to the training and development 
of all employees, at all levels of the organisation. Our 
vision is to develop a positive learning culture which 
fully supports the development of the individual and 
the growth of the business. We have a global learning 
and development strategy that has been written in order 
to support both the development of the organisation and 
the individuals within it. Everyone within the organisation 
has the opportunity to participate in a variety of career 
advancing training and development programmes. 
As well as the wide range of development programmes 
provided to employees, Dialog has created a Technical 
Ladder which provides promotional opportunities for 
those who bring great value to the Company through 
their technical expertise and want to focus their careers 
on that know-how rather than on management and 
leadership. Employees who are successful in gaining  
a place on the Ladder spend around 20% of their  
delivery policy in 2011. We believe that reusing and 
recycling packing material and waste (inclusive PET  
and glass bottles used in our working areas) can 
contribute to the effectiveness of our resource 
management and sustainability. Our five design 
locations currently recycle 91% of packing and  
waste; we are striving for 95% by 2013.
SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT
We firmly believe that sustainable development can  
be secured only if we safeguard our valuable resources; 
therefore, we deal only with suppliers that have similar 
environmental goals and are also accredited to the  
ISO 14001 standard. Within our supply chain, we 
continually emphasis that environmental issues should be 
an instinctive part of any decision-making process, and 
suppliers should use environmentally friendly 
technology to:
 ● reduce and eliminate emissions of ozone-depleting 
and other volatile organic chemicals (VOC);
 ● design and manufacture only environmentally 
friendly products;
 ● manage, reduce and dispose of hazardous 
substances safely;
 ● monitor and control waste water and solid waste 
emissions;
 ● reduce and eliminate all types of waste, including 
water and energy;
 ● reduce waste by maximising product yields; and
 ● ensure all environmental permits are obtained, 
maintained and kept current.
As a fabless semiconductor company, it is important that 
all of our manufacturing partners are equally committed 
to respecting the environment. All Dialog’ s major suppliers 
have committed to our “Code of Conduct”, which 
reflects our commitment to the Electronics Industry Code 
of Conduct (EICC). Compliance is monitored through  
a two-pronged approach: every supplier is required  
to complete a self-audit questionnaire to identify and 
document compliance as well as regular on-site audits 
of all of our major suppliers. In addition, 91% of our 
major suppliers have their own documented corporate 
social responsibility policy, which we aim to increase  
to 100% by the end of 2013.
We are continually working with our suppliers to develop 
recovery processes, resource-substitution technologies 
and methods to reduce CO 2 emissions throughout the 
supply chain. We are assessing and developing an 
all-suppliers policy related to conflict minerals.

“GIVING BACK” – COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
Dialog is committed to being a responsible member of 
the community and increased corporate giving by 41% 
in 2011. A plan has been put in place to continue to 
do more by setting a target of giving 1% of pre-tax 
profit by 2015.
During 2011, Dialog significantly ramped up its 
relations with key universities throughout the UK and 
Europe. As well as giving the Company access to the 
brightest graduate talent, it has also afforded us the 
opportunity to give something back to the community. 
During 2011 Dialog sponsored three electronics 
engineering students from UK universities through the 
UK Electronic Skills Foundation, an organisation that 
aims to attract students of school and university age 
into the electronics industry. We have committed  
to a further three for 2012, and have an ongoing 
commitment for an additional three per year.
Dialog has also kicked off a programme of industrial 
scholarships within European universities, notably 
Karlsruhe and Aalen universities in Germany. During 
2011 we sponsored one scholar at each university  
who received a laptop, an annual bursary, paid work 
placements, an opportunity for a summer job and an 
industrial mentor. The target is to add a further four 
scholars during 2012 at other universities.
In 2011, Dialog implemented a programme to provide 
prizes and bursaries for various degree programmes, 
such as two “access bursaries” of £1,000 each at the 
University of Edinburgh to assist low-income engineering 
time on Technical Ladder activities such as researching 
new initiatives, university relationships, speaking at 
conferences, internal communication and training.
Clear and consistent communication is achieved through 
regular Company-wide information sessions, led by  
the CEO; every effort is made to keep employees fully 
aware of Company matters that affect them. We 
encourage employee feedback at all levels for new 
ideas to improve business efficiency and performance.
EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING
Dialog has been implementing a programme of growth 
and investment in many of our locations, expanding 
facilities and work space. When we expand or refurbish 
a site, employee suggestions are incorporated to create 
an environment that both meets the Company’s business 
needs while also being a pleasant place in which to work.
Dialog is committed to supporting the health and 
well-being of its employees. Employees and their 
families are eligible to participate in non-contributory 
medical plans where local culture and practice supports 
this. Additionally, Dialog currently offers a selection of 
“well-being” initiatives across a variety of locations, 
including an on-site, free flu vaccination programme,  
cycle to work schemes and an on-site gym.
Furthermore, a key element of Dialog’s 2012 employee 
engagement plans is to define and implement further 
local initiatives that build upon the current health and 
well-being programmes in place and support the needs 
of our employees.
Dialog donated €2,000 in total to help to fund a film competition for 
young people in Kirchheim, Germany to raise awareness of alcohol abuse 
in children.
Dialog are proud to be associated with Advanced Sports Coaching, who 
provide sports coaching in safe, happy environments in South West 
England. Dialog UK also donated a new kit for the under-8 team. 29
Dialog opened its own fitness 
room at the start of the year  
in a further step to promote a 
healthy lifestyle for its employees.
audits and inspections are performed regularly by 
Dialog to verify its continuing maintenance.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Dialog considers a safe and healthy working 
environment to be essential in the maintenance of 
employees’ morale and in the production of high-
quality and innovative products. As a result, we require 
our major suppliers to be committed to ensuring the 
creation of safe and healthy working conditions. We 
expect them to provide evidence of suitable controls, 
safe working procedures, preventative maintenance 
and general protective measures in their working 
environments. When hazards cannot be adequately 
controlled by these means alone, suitable protective 
clothing or equipment is supplied, and evacuation 
procedures and facilities are in place at Dialog’s and 
suppliers’ premises.
ETHICS
Dialog believes that continued success in the 
semiconductor market can be achieved only by 
adopting high standards of ethical behaviour when 
dealing with customers, suppliers and workers.
It is particularly important to protect Intellectual Property 
(“IP”), which is the key to ensuring the development of 
innovative solutions to complex problems. Any transfer 
of technology or know-how is always done in a 
manner that protects IP rights; effective protection also 
means that products can be discussed openly with our 
business partners. The disclosure of information which 
is related to business activities, structure, our financial 
situation and performance is always carried out in 
accordance with applicable regulations and prevailing 
industry practices. We expect the highest standards of 
integrity from all Dialog stakeholders; any malpractice 
is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate 
termination and legal action.
Neither we nor our suppliers offer or accept inducements 
or any other means of obtaining undue or improper 
advantage. We have a “whistle-blower” policy in place 
to protect employees’ confidentiality and encourage

GOVERNANCE
HUMAN RIGHTS AND CODE OF CONDUCT
Dialog’s philosophy is that all its suppliers must 
demonstrate a commitment to upholding workers’ 
human rights and to treating them with dignity and 
respect. Standards such as the UDHR, SAI and the  
ETI have been used as a basis for these requirements. 
All labour must be given voluntarily and workers must 
be free to leave their employment on reasonable 
notice. Child labour must not be used at any stage of 
manufacturing. Working hours must not exceed the 
maximum set by local laws and wages must comply 
with all applicable laws. Dialog and its suppliers must 
ensure that workers are not threatened or subjected to 
inhumane or harsh treatment, harassment or any form 
of unlawful discrimination. Open communication and 
direct engagement between workers and management 
is encouraged, even in those countries where there  
is no meaningful legal protection. In order to promote 
its philosophy, several new initiatives have been 
introduced to all of Dialog’s manufacturing partners, 
including a detailed code of conduct for them to 
review and implement. Detailed self-audits have been 
performed by all of our suppliers in order to verify the 
implementation of this code of conduct, and on-site  30 Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 3 | Management and governance

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS
Dialog Semiconductor creates highly integrated, mixed signal integrated 
circuits (ICs) optimised for personal portable, low energy short-range 
wireless, lighting, display and automotive applications. The Company 
provides flexible and dynamic support, innovation and the assurance  
of dealing with an established business partner. 
With its focus and expertise in energy-efficient system power management, 
and now with the recent addition of low energy short-range wireless and 
VoIP technology to the portfolio, Dialog brings decades of experience to 
the rapid development of ICs for personal portable applications, including 
smartphones, tablet PCs, digital cordless phones and gaming applications. 
Dialog’s power management processor companion chips enhance the 
performance in terms of extended battery lifetime and the consumers’ 
multimedia experience. With world-class manufacturing partners, Dialog 
operates a fabless business model.
Dialog Semiconductor Plc is headquartered near Stuttgart, with a global 
sales, R&D and marketing organisation. In 2011, it had approximately 
US$527 million in revenue and is one of the fastest growing European 
public semiconductor companies. It currently has approximately  
650 employees. The Company is listed on the Frankfurt (FWB: DLG)  
stock exchange and is a member of the German TecDax index.
More information about the business is set out in the CEO’s statement,  
on pages 13 and 14, and in the Business review, on page 12.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The Group’s stated objective is to be the leading global supplier of lowest 
power, highest-quality mixed signal components and system level solutions 
to the wireless and automotive markets. The Company is currently 
leveraging its expertise to expand its standalone audio product portfolio, 
capitalising on the success of its newly introduced low power and 
high-quality audio IC, and to add innovative ultra low power display 
technologies such as PM-OLED.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
The Group believes that its future competitive position will depend on  
its ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of its customers by 
developing new designs in a timely and cost-effective manner. To this end, 
the Company’s management is committed to investing in researching and 
developing new products and customising existing products. 
To date, R&D projects have been in response to key customers’ requests  
to assist in the development of new products, and for the development  
of application-specific standard products (ASSPs). The Company does not 
expect any material change to this approach in the foreseeable future.

the Directors’ report are listed on pages 32 and 33. Having made enquiries 
of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of the Directors 
affirms that:

of that information. 36 Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 3 | Management and governance
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is chaired by Russ Shaw, 
who is assisted by Chris Burke and Peter Weber. The responsibility of  
the Committee, among other things, is to determine, subject to Board

is monitored at Board level – a reflection of the importance it is given  
by the Board. 
During the year, the Audit, and Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees met frequently to analyse issues under their jurisdiction, 
usually on the day of, or the day before, each Board meeting.
TRANSPARENCY

quarterly financial reports, together with key information on the AGM,  
on its Website.

shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. The notice of the general 
meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights either by proxy 
notice or by presence in person or by proxy in relation to resolutions to be 
passed at a general meeting. All proxy votes are counted and the numbers 
for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution are announced at  
the AGM and published on the Company’s Website after the meeting. 
GOVERNANCE STANDARDS
Dialog Semiconductor Plc is committed to implementing high levels of 
governance. Accordingly, Dialog (as a foreign company listed on the 
German stock exchange) has established and published its own Corporate 
Governance principles, corresponding in substance to the provision of  
the “German Declaration on Corporate Governance”. 
Dialog’s Corporate Governance principles are published on its Website 
(www.dialog-semiconductor.com). The Website also contains a full version 
of the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This details 
Dialog’s expectations regarding the ethical standards that each Director, 
officer and employee should follow while acting on the Company’s behalf.
Corporate Governance information relating to the past financial year  
is set out below.
SHAREHOLDERS AND THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (“AGM”)
The AGM, at which the annual financial statements and audit reports  
are presented, is the main forum for Shareholders to exercise their voting 
rights. Directors appointed by the Board during any given year are subject 
to Shareholder approval at the AGM. 
In addition, one-third of the Directors must resign each year and may put 
themselves forward for re-election. Changes to the constitution of the 
Company are decided by Shareholders’ resolution. Similarly, the AGM  
is the forum at which Shareholders can authorise the Directors to issue 
new shares. 
Dialog does not have any shares in issue which have multiple voting rights, 
preferential voting rights or maximum voting rights.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board is responsible for determining Dialog’s business strategy and 
ensuring that an executive is appointed to implement it. 
It is also responsible for overseeing the financial aspects of the business. 
The Board, which met five times during the year, currently consists of seven 
non-executive Directors and one executive Director. The compensation 
provided to each Director is detailed in the Directors’ remuneration  
report on pages 38 to 40. The executive Director’s remuneration is largely 
performance related and is connected to a set of goals determined by 
the Board.
AUDIT COMMITTEE, AND REMUNERATION AND 
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Dialog’s Audit Committee comprises the following Directors: Aidan Hughes 
(Chairman), John McMonigall and Peter Tan. The Committee is responsible 
for monitoring financial statements and reviewing the performance of  
the external auditors. It also assesses the efficiency of the audit process 
and (among other things) considers compliance with accounting standards. 
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary 
and representatives of the external auditors usually attend Audit 
Committee meetings. 
Corporate Governance 37
BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Dialog seeks to comply with all laws and regulations that have an impact 
on its business. In addition, the Company expects its employees and 
Directors to act with honesty, integrity and fairness in the conduct of its 
business. Dialog’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is published on 
the Company’s Website.
Dialog is committed to taking account of interests outside the Company, 
including those of employees, business partners, the environment and the 
local communities on which it has an impact. The Board values, and has 
developed, a culture of corporate social responsibility that takes the above 
factors into consideration.
AUDIT AND AUDITORS
The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Dialog’s 
auditors, Ernst and Young (“E&Y”). E&Y were appointed in October 2006 
following a tender process.
The remuneration given to the auditors over the past two financial years  
is detailed in notes 3 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements on 
pages 65 and 101.
The Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2010, and the reports from the Directors and auditors 
thereon, were presented to, and approved by, the Shareholders at the 
AGM of the Company held on 21 April 2011. E&Y, the Company’s 
independent auditors, were reappointed until the following AGM.
Given the acquisition of SiTel Semiconductor B.V. (“SiTel”) on 10 February 
2011, the Board has requested that Kevin Harkin, the Senior Statutory 
Auditor, extend his period of service from five years to seven years (to end 
with audit of the 31 December 2012 annual report). The Board believes 
that this will give the Group greater stability and more comfort over audit 
quality over the next two years as SiTel is integrated into the Group. After 
due consideration, Kevin Harkin and Ernst & Young LLP have accepted  
this request and have advised that they will implement additional review 
procedures in order to mitigate any potential risk of familiarity impairing 
their independence. 
DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY WITH REGARD TO THE GERMAN 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
Dialog Semiconductor Plc has established and published its own Corporate 
Governance principles corresponding in substance to the provisions of the 
German “Corporate Governance Code” as amended on 14 June 2007,

Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code. This declaration 
is available on the internet at: www.dialog-semiconductor.com.
GREGORIO REYES
CHAIRMAN
16 February 2012
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company 
other than:
 ● certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws and 
regulations (for example, insider trading laws);
 ● employees of the Company are not allowed to trade in shares or 
exercise options in certain close periods (such close periods normally 
start two weeks before the end of each quarter and end 48 hours  
after the release of the financial results).
Details of changes in share capital can be found in note 18 to the 
consolidated financial statements. Besides that, the Company did not 
purchase its own shares and the Company holds no shares in treasury. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between Shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and for voting rights. 
Dialog has an Employee Benefit Trust which holds Dialog shares for the 
benefit of employees, including for the purpose of satisfying awards made 
under the various employee and executive share plans. The trustee may 
vote the shares as it sees fit, and if there is an offer for the shares the 
trustee is not obliged to accept or reject the offer but will have regard  
to the interests of the employees and may consult them to obtain their 
views on the offer and may otherwise take action with respect to the  
offer it thinks fair.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that 
occur because of a takeover bid. The agreements between the Company 
and its Directors for compensation for loss of office are given in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on page 38.
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of Shareholders.
INTERNAL CONTROL
In accordance with the EU Transparency Directive (DTR 7.2.5), Dialog’s 
Board of Directors and Audit Committee acknowledge that they are 
responsible for the Company’s processes of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. Such processes are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Company has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks it faces. This process is reviewed in 
accordance with the EU Transparency Directive. The process was in place 
during 2011 and up to the date of the approval of the 2011 annual report 
and financial statements.
The Company’s Board and Audit Committee can confirm that necessary 
actions have been taken to remedy any significant failings or weaknesses 
identified from these process reviews. 38 Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 3 | Management and governance

POLICY ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Board is responsible for setting the Company’s policy on Directors’ 
remuneration; the Remuneration and Nomination Committee agrees  
the remuneration for each executive Director.
The primary objectives of the Company’s policy on executive Directors’ 
remuneration are first, that it should be structured so as to attract and 
retain executives of a high calibre, with the skills and experience necessary 
to develop the Company successfully and, second, to reward them in a way 
which encourages the creation of value for the Company’s Shareholders.
The performance measurement of each executive Director and the 
determination of his annual remuneration package are undertaken  
by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.
No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.  
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee comprises non-executive 
Directors and its role, inter alia, is to apply the Board’s policy on 
remuneration. The current members of the Committee are Russ Shaw 
(Chairman), Chris Burke and Peter Weber.
The Company has one executive Director, Dr Jalal Bagherli, who was 
appointed on 12 September 2005. The executive Director’s remuneration 
consists of three components:
1.  Salary – reflects the executive’s experience, responsibilities and 
market value;
2.  Bonus – as part of his remuneration Dr Bagherli receives bonuses 
based on objectives set by the Remuneration and Nomination 
Committee relative to the performance of the Group, as an incentive  
to Dr Bagherli to achieve relevant and demanding targets; and
3.  Share options – details are set out in note 20 to the consolidated 
financial statements.

SHARE OPTIONS GRANTED TO THE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Each non-executive Director was previously entitled to an initial grant  
of 50,000 options vesting monthly in 48 equal tranches. At each AGM 
(ending with the 2009 AGM), non-executive Directors received a further 
20,000 options vesting over 12 months. Options may be exercised at the 
market price prevailing at the date of grant. The non-executive Directors 
are not subject to performance criteria related to their remuneration.  
The stock options granted to non-executive Directors are not, therefore, 
subject to the achievement of performance targets. At the 2010 AGM the 
Shareholders voted against the continuance of this share option plan. 
At the 2011 AGM Shareholders resolved that one-third of the non-
executive Directors’ remuneration should be satisfied in shares in the 
Company. These shares are issued through the mechanism of options 
(with an exercise value of Euro 15 cents) the exercise of which, subject  
to certain exceptions, is conditional on the Director still being a member 
of the Board immediately before the third AGM following grant.
The share option grants to non-executive Directors are as follows:

To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable

fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of 
the Group, and the Group management report includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks 
associated with the expected development of the Group.

 ● prepare the financial statements on the going-concern basis unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible  
for preparing a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration report that 
comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s Website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislations in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the IFRS report and accounts 
2011 and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable law and regulations. Company law requires 
the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements 
for each financial year. Under the law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements 
on the same basis.
The Group and parent company financial statements are required by law 
and IFRS as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of  
the Group and the parent company and the performance for that period; 
the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of the Act to financial statements 
giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair 
presentation. In preparing each of the Group and parent company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 ● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ● state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS  
as adopted by the EU; and

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
1. GENERAL 
The consolidated financial statements of Dialog Semiconductor Plc (“Dialog or the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for 
issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 16 February 2012. Dialog Semiconductor Plc is a company incorporated in the UK, whose 
shares are publicly traded. The principal activities of the Group are set out in the segment reporting (note 23). 
COMPANY NAME AND REGISTERED OFFICE 
Dialog Semiconductor Plc 
Tower Bridge House  
St Katharine’s Way 
London E1W 1AA 
United Kingdom 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars (“US$”) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when 
otherwise stated.  
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and its interpretation as adopted by the EU. Based on these standards, management has applied the 
accounting policies as provided in note 2. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES 
The accounting policies are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the changes resulting from the adoption of the following 
amended, revised and new Standards and new IFRIC interpretations during the year: 
IAS 24 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES (REVISED) 
The revised IAS 24 was issued in November 2009 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The changes to IAS 24 simplify the 
disclosure requirements for government-related entities and clarify the definition of a related party. The revised standard did not have an impact on the 
disclosures regarding related party transactions. 
IMPROVEMENTS TO IFRSS – A COLLECTION OF AMENDMENTS TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (ANNUAL IMPROVEMENTS 
PROJECT) 
The IASB has also issued a collection of amendments to various IFRSs (“Improvements to IFRSs”) in May 2010. This includes amendments to various 
existing IFRSs. The amendments have no impact on the financial position nor the financial performance of Dialog, however, disclosures for financial 
instruments have been adjusted accordingly. 
All following amended or new interpretations did not result in changes to the accounting policies and did not have a material effect on the financial 
statements, as they currently do not apply to Dialog: 
Interpretation  Title Effective date
IFRIC 14 Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement  1 January 2011
IFRIC 19  Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments 1 July 2010

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED (STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ARE ENDORSED BY THE EU EXCEPT 
AS NOTED OTHERWISE) 
IFRS 7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DISCLOSURES (AMENDED) 
The amendment was issued in October 2010 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. The amendments will allow users of 
financial statements to improve their understanding of transfer transactions of financial assets (for example, securitisations), including understanding the 
possible effects of any risks that may remain with the entity that transferred the assets. The amendments also require additional disclosures if a 
disproportionate amount of transfer transactions are undertaken around the end of a reporting period. 
IFRS 7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DISCLOSURES (AMENDED / IAS 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: PRESENTATION (AMENDED) 
The amended IFRS 7 / IAS 32 were issued in December 2011 and are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The amendment 
standards comprise disclosure requirements to assess the effect or potential effect of offsetting arrangements on a company’s financial position. The 
new disclosure requirements also improve transparency in the reporting of how companies mitigate credit risk, including disclosure of related collateral 
pledged or received. The amended standards have not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The new IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009. The new standard for financial instruments sets out provisions for the classification and measurement of 
financial assets. IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortised cost or fair value, replacing the many 
different rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how an entity manages its financial instruments (its business model) and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial assets. The new standard also requires a single impairment method to be used, replacing the many different 
impairment methods in IAS 39. The revised standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
In October 2010 additions to IFRS 9 Financial instruments were issued.  The additions outline the requirements on the accounting for financial liabilities. 
The new requirements address the problem of volatility in profit or loss (P&L) arising from an issuer choosing to measure its own debt at fair value (often 
referred to as the ‘own credit’ problem). The IASB decided to maintain the existing amortised cost measurement for most liabilities, limiting change to 
that required to address the own credit problem. With the new requirements, an entity choosing to measure a liability at fair value will present the 
portion of the change in its fair value due to changes in the entity’s own credit risk in the other comprehensive income (OCI) section of the income 
statement, rather than within profit or loss. The revised standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
The new IFRS 9 is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 (as amended in December 2011). The impact will be further analysed in the 
future when the project is complete. 
IFRS 10 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS 11 JOINT ARRANGEMENTS, IFRS 12 DISCLOSURES OF INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES, IAS 27 
(REVISED) SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IAS 28 (REVISED) INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES 
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) completed in May 2011 its improvements to the accounting requirements for off balance sheet 
activities and joint arrangements by issuing IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in 
Other Entities. The new and revised standards are effective for periods beginning on 1 January 2013: 
 IFRS 10 builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within 
the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control 
where this is difficult to assess. 
The Group does not expect a material effect on its financial statements resulting from this new standard. 
 IFRS 11 provides for a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its 
legal form (as is currently the case). The standard addresses inconsistencies in the reporting of joint arrangements by requiring a single method to 
account for interests in jointly controlled entities. 
The Group does not expect a material effect on its financial statements resulting from this new standard, as the group is not engaged in joint 
arrangements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
 IFRS 12 is a new and comprehensive standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, 
associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. 
The Group expects additional disclosures from this new standard. 
 IAS 27 (revised) now includes the provisions on separate financial statements that are left after the control provisions of IAS 27 have been included 
in the new IFRS 10. 
 IAS 28 (revised) now includes the requirements for joint ventures, as well as associates, to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11. 
IFRS 13 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
The new IFRS 13 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The requirements of IFRS 13 do not extend 
the use of fair value accounting, but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards 
within IFRSs. The impact will be further analysed in the future not expect a material effect on its financial statements resulting from this new statement. 
IAS 1 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The amendments to IAS 1 were issued in June 2011 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. The amendments require 
companies preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRSs to group together items within Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) that may be 
reclassified to the profit or loss section of the income statement. The amendments also reaffirm existing requirements that items in OCI and profit or loss 
should be presented as either a single statement or two consecutive statements. The Group does not expect a material effect on its financial statements 
resulting from this amendment. 
IAS 12 INCOME TAXES (AMENDED) 
The amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes were issued in December 2010 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012. IAS 
12 requires an entity to measure the deferred tax relating to an asset depending on whether the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of the 
asset through use or sale. It can be difficult and subjective to assess whether recovery will be through use or through sale when the asset is measured 
using the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property. The amendment provides a practical solution to the problem by introducing a presumption that 
recovery of the carrying amount will, normally be , be through sale. As a result of the amendments, SIC-21 Income Taxes—Recovery of Revalued Non-
Depreciable Assets would no longer apply to investment properties carried at fair value. The amendments also incorporate into IAS 12 the remaining 
guidance previously contained in SIC-21, which is accordingly withdrawn. The amended standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
The impact will be further analysed in the future and cannot be measured at the moment. 
IAS 19 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (AMENDED) 
The amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits were issued in December 2010 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
The amendments especially relate to:  
 eliminating an option to defer the recognition of gains and losses, known as the ‘corridor method’, improving comparability and faithfulness of 
presentation.  
 streamlining the presentation of changes in assets and liabilities arising from defined benefit plans, including requiring remeasurements to be 
presented in other comprehensive income (OCI), thereby separating those changes from changes that many perceive to be the result of an entity’s 
day-to-day operations.  
 enhancing the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans, providing better information about the characteristics of defined benefit plans 
and the risks that entities are exposed to through participation in those plans.  
Since the group does not operate any defined benefit plan, the Group does not expect a material effect on its financial statements resulting from this 
amendment.

IAS 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: PRESENTATION (AMENDED) 
The amended IAS 32 was issued in October 2009 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010. The amendment addresses the 
accounting for rights issues (rights, options or warrants) that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. Previously 
such rights issues were accounted for as derivative liabilities. However, the amendment requires that, provided certain conditions are met, such rights 
issues are classified as equity regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated. 
In addition, the following interpretations and amendments to interpretations have been issued: 
   
Interpretation  Title Effective date
IFRIC 14 Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement  1 January 2011
IFRIC 19  Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments 1 July 2010
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (The Interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the 
EU) 
1 January 2013
   
 
The Group does not intend to make early application of the amended or revised Standards and Interpretation listed above. 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES 
The consolidated financial statements include Dialog Semiconductor Plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year: 
  
Name Registered office Participation
Dialog Semiconductor GmbH Kirchheim/Teck, Germany 100%
Dialog Semiconductor B.V. ’s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands 100%
Dialog Semiconductor (UK) Limited  Swindon, UK 100%
Dialog Semiconductor Inc. Wilmington, Delaware, USA 100%
Dialog Semiconductor KK Tokyo, Japan 100%
  
 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which Dialog obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until 
the date such control ceases. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. 
All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full. 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction for changes incurred since 
1 January 2010. No changes in ownership interest of a subsidiary incurred prior to 2010. If Dialog loses control over a subsidiary, it: 
 Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary 
 Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest 
 Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity 
 Recognises the fair value of the consideration received

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
 Recognises the fair value of any investment retained 
 Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss 
 Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as  
appropriate. 
The above-mentioned requirements were applied on a prospective basis.  
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the 
Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance 
with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded 
derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.  
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.  
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as 
a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled 
within equity. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling 
interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-
generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the 
carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured 
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
The functional currency for the Group entities is generally the currency in which they primarily generate and expend cash. Each entity in the Group 
determines its own functional currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of companies whose functional currency is other than the US dollar are 
included in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities into the presentation currency (US$) at the exchange rates applicable at the end of 
the reporting period. Equity accounts are measured at historical rates. The statements of income and cash flows are translated at the average exchange 
rates during the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation are directly recognised in equity (other reserves). 
  
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
 
   
 
 53
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to 
profit and loss with the exception of differences on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation as well as differences on 
foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the 
net investment at which time they are recognised in profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items 
and borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are disclosed separately in the income 
statement, at each reporting period. Key exchange rates against US dollars used in preparing the consolidated financial statements were:

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument in another. Financial 
assets include, in particular, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and derivative 
and non-derivative financial assets accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, as well as investments available for sale.  
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset. In particular, this includes trade payables, liabilities to 
banks and derivative financial liabilities.  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the entity currently has a   
legal right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as being at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables 
or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are first recognised, they are measured at fair value, plus, in case of 
investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.  
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on first recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at 
each financial year end.  
All regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date that the Group receives the asset. Regular 
purchases or sales are classified as purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by 
regulation or convention of the market place.  
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair 
value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near 
term. This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge 
relationships as defined by IAS 39. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are 
designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognised in finance income or finance costs in the income statement. 
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are 
not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not held for trading or designated at fair value though profit or loss. These 
embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. Reassessment only occurs if there is a 
change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required. 
The Group has not entered into trading actions nor designated financial asset as financial asset through profit or loss in 2011 and 2010. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS HELD TO MATURITY 
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held to maturity when the Group has the 
positive intention and ability to do so. After initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The effective interest method takes into account any premium or discount on acquisition and includes transaction costs and fees that 
are an integral part of the effective interest rate. 
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the investments are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. The 
carrying amount of financial assets held-to-maturity are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective, material evidence of 
impairment as outlined in IAS 39.59. Any impairment losses caused by the fair value being lower than the carrying amount are recognised in profit or 
loss. The Group does not use allowance accounts in order to record the impairment in the statement of financial position but credits the impairment loss 
directly against the book value of the financial assets.  
If in a subsequent period the fair value increases and this increase can be related objectively to events occurring after the impairment was recognised, 
the impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. The fair value 
which is required for impairment testing corresponds to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective 
interest rate. 
The Group has not entered into trading actions nor designated financial asset as financial asset held to maturity in 2011 and 2010. 
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market, such as trade 
accounts receivable. Loans and receivables are recorded initially at fair value and do not bear interest. As of 31 December 2011 as well as 31 December 
2010, loans and receivables of the Group comprise trade accounts receivable from customers, cash and cash equivalents (except for deposits designated 
as hedging instruments). After initial recognition, loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any allowance for impairment, if necessary. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired. Interest income and expense on 
the application of the effective interest method are also recognised in profit or loss.  
  
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED

The Group continuously reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts. Management considers the collectability of a trade account receivable to be 
impaired when it is probable that the Group will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the sales terms, based on current information and 
events regarding the customers’ ability to meet their obligations. The amount of the impairment loss on loans and receivables is measured as the 
difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the financial asset. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
If, in a subsequent reporting period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can objectively be related to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed and recognised in profit or loss. 
When a trade receivable is considered to be impaired, any credit losses are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to bad 
debt expenses. Account balances are set off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is 
considered remote. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written-off are recorded as other income when received. Reversals of impairment losses are 
recognised in profit and loss. The Group does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 
Receivables from work in process for customer specific development projects according to IAS 11 are recorded in the balance sheet line “trade accounts 
receivable and other receivables” and are disclosed in the notes respectively. 
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified as loans and 
receivables, held-to-maturity investments or as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.  
After initial measurement available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on 
available-for-sale financial assets are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of other reserves until realised, or the investment is 
determined as being impaired. 
At each reporting date, the carrying amounts of available-for-sale assets are assessed to determine whether there is objective, significant evidence of 
impairment as outlined in IAS 39.59. Any impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are charged to profit or loss. The Group does not use 
allowance accounts in order to record the impairment in the statement of financial position but credits the impairment loss directly against the book 
value of the financial assets. If this impairment relates to losses previously recognised in equity then the impairment loss is transferred from equity to the 
income statement. Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments or investment funds that are classified as available-for-sale are not 
recognised in profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the 
instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss. 
The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices 
at the close of business on the reporting date. 
For investments in which there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques, including recent arm’s length market 
transactions; reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis; or other 
valuation models. If the fair value of unquoted equity instruments cannot be measured with sufficient reliability, these instruments are measured at cost 
(less any impairment losses, if applicable).

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
The Group has not entered into trading actions nor designated financial asset as available-for-sale financial asset in 2011 and 2010. 
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 
A financial asset is derecognised when: 
 the right to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; 
 the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third 
party under a “pass through agreement”; or 
 the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in it. 
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Financial liabilities primarily include trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, derivative financial liabilities and other liabilities. 
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED AT AMORTISED COSTS 
After initial recognition at fair value, less directly attributable transaction costs, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. 
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Gains and losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss. 
During the financial years 2011 and 2010 the Group did not classify any financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward contracts, mainly for the purposes of hedging currency risks that arise from its 
operating activities. Beside the derivative financial instruments the Group designated certain deposits as hedging instruments in order to hedge foreign 
currency risks as well. Such derivative financial instruments and deposits were initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract 
was entered into or the cash deposit was designated as a hedging instrument and was subsequently remeasured at fair value on each subsequent 
reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value on derivatives and the deposits  (only in 2010) during the year that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are taken directly to profit or loss. 
The fair value of derivatives is equal to their positive or negative market value. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to 
current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of the deposits in 2010 was measured based on foreign 
currency market rates at each reporting date. 
  
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
 
   
 
 57
 
If the requirements for hedge accounting set out in IAS 39 are met, the Group designates and documents the hedge relationship from the date a 
derivative contract is entered into or the cash deposit (only in 2010) is designated as a hedging instrument, either as a fair value hedge or a cash flow 
hedge. 
The Group did not enter into fair value hedges in 2011 and 2010. 
In a cash flow hedge, the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, 
or a firm commitment (in case of currency risks) is hedged. To hedge a currency risk of an unrecognised firm commitment, the Group makes use of the 
option to recognise this as a cash flow hedge. The documentation of the hedge relationship includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged 
item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure 
to changes in the hedged cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in 
cash flows, and are assessed on an on-going basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods 
for which they were designated. 
For cash flow hedges, fair value changes of the effective portion of the hedging instrument are recognised in other reserves, net of applicable taxes, 
while any ineffective portion of the fair value changes are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the 
income statement when the hedged transaction affects the income statement, such as when the forecast or committed expenses occur. If the forecast 
transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. 
If the hedging instrument does not, or no longer, qualifies for hedge accounting because the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are not, or are no 
longer met, the derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading and the deposits are classified as loans and receivables. Amounts 
previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts 
previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or the firm commitment occurs. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. The financial position cash and cash equivalents in 2010 also included deposits designated as hedging instruments. 
INVENTORIES 
Inventories include assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods), in the process of production (work in process) or in the form 
of materials to be consumed in the production process (raw materials). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost, which 
includes direct materials, labour and overhead, plus indirect overhead, is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs to make the sale.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. These include the cost of replacing 
part of the plant and equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 
 
Equipment Useful life 
Test equipment Three to eight years 
Leasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or lease term 
Office and other equipment 18 months to 13 years 
 
 
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end. 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets acquired separately (primarily licences, software and patents) are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets 
acquired in a business combination (primarily customer based intangible assets, technology) is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets 
with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The amortisation period and the 
amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation 
period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:  
Intangible asset Useful life 
Customer relationships and order backlog  1.5 years 
Brand / base technology 2 to 4.5 years 
Particular software 10 years 
Other intangible assets 3 to 5 years 
 
 
Amortisation expenses are allocated to the cost of goods sold, selling expenses, research and development expenses, or general administration 
expenses. The Group has no intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. 
Self-developed intangible assets are recorded on a cost basis. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated usefulness of 12-60 months. 
The costs of internally generated intangible assets comprise all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be 
capable of operating in a manner intended by management, e.g. costs of materials and services used or consumed in generating the intangible asset, 
costs of employee benefits or fees to register a legal right. Reference is also made to the accounting policy regarding research and development costs in 
this section. 
Patents have been granted by the relevant government agency for a certain period, depending on the specific country, with the option of renewal at the 
end of this period. In most cases the maximum lifetime of the patents is 20 years. They are amortised over the shorter period of expected future benefit, 
which is principally ten years. Acquisition costs for patents are based on the cost of patent registration.

IMPAIRMENT OF NON-MONETARY ASSETS 
In accordance with IAS 36, at each reporting date an assessment is made as to whether there is an indication that a non-monetary asset, such as 
property, plant and equipment or purchased intangibles, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, an estimate is made of the asset’s recoverable 
amount: the higher of an asset’s fair value, less cost to sell and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining the fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. For assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date as 
to whether any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, an 
estimation of the recoverable amount is made. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is 
increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount, however, cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss. 
LEASES 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date of whether the 
fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Where the Group is lessee, finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, 
are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in profit and loss.  
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that Dialog will obtain ownership by the end of 
the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty. The Group 
assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is 
acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: 
SALE OF GOODS 
Revenue from the sale of goods is derived from the sale of products, application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) and application specific standard 
product (“ASSP”) to end customers. These products are manufactured and tested in accordance with customers’ technical specifications prior to delivery.  
Revenue is recognised when title passes, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the fee is fixed or determinable, and 
collection of the related receivable is probable. Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes and customer discounts, if any. 
The Group has insurance for product claims and also records a provision for warranty costs as a charge in cost of sales, based on historical trends of 
warranty costs incurred as a percentage of sales, which management has determined to be a reasonable estimate of the probable costs to be incurred 
for warranty claims in a period.  
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
   
 
60  Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 4 | Consolidated financial statements and notes 
 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
Customer returns are permitted only for quality-related reasons within the applicable warranty period and any potential warranty claims are subject to 
the Group’s determination that it is at fault for damages. Such claims must usually be submitted within a short period of the date of sale. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Revenue from customer-specific research and development contracts involving the development of new customer-specific technology is recognised on 
the percentage of completion basis when the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably. A contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably when 
total contract revenue can equally be estimated, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the Group, and the stage 
of contract completion can be measured reliably. When the Group is not able to meet those conditions, the policy is to recognise revenues only to the 
extent the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered. Completion is measured by reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated 
total project costs. The percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs, as well as the dependable 
measurement of the progress made towards completing the particular project. Losses on projects in progress are recognised in the period they become 
likely and can be estimated. 
 
GOVERNMENT GRANTS 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied 
with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the 
costs that it is intended to compensate. Grants are deducted in reporting the related expense. The Group does not receive grants that relate to assets.  
COST OF SALES 
Cost of sales consists of the costs of outsourced production, assembly and test, personnel costs and applicable overheads and depreciation of 
equipment. Provisions for estimated product warranties are recorded in cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognised. 
SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES 
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, travel expenses, sales commissions, bad debt expenses and costs associated with advertising 
and other marketing activities. 
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs for finance, human resources, ERP system and other management 
departments which are not attributable to development, production or sales functions.  
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS 
Costs identified as research costs are expensed as incurred, whereas development costs on an individual project are capitalised as an intangible asset and 
amortised over the period of expected future benefit if the Group can demonstrate the following: 
 
 The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; 
 Its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 
 Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset; 
 How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the Group can demonstrate the existence of a 
market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset; 
 The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and use or sell the intangible asset; and 
 Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE 
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues. Interest income includes interest income from investments in securities, cash and cash equivalents. 
Income and expense resulting from the allocation of premiums and discounts is also included. Interest expense is generally expensed as incurred. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get 
ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they 
occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. The Group capitalises 
borrowing costs for all eligible assets where construction was commenced on or after 1 January 2009.  
FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES 
The foreign currency exchange gains and losses mainly result from foreign currency cash transactions and period end revaluation of foreign currency 
denominated cash into US dollars. It is the Group’s view that these gains and losses are driven by the financing activities of the Group and are therefore 
shown as non-operating results.  
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS 
Contributions to defined contribution and state-funded pension plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred. 
INCOME TAXES 
Current income taxes for current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The 
tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for using the liability method and are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to 
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, and their respective tax bases, as well as on the carry-forward of 
unused tax losses that can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the reporting date and which are 
expected to apply to taxable income in the years, in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change 
in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed 
at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent, that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets being reduced in the past are presented in the notes gross less respective provisions. If in future periods it becomes 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized, it is assumed that tax losses incurred first will be 
utilized first and the respective provision will be reversed. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists, to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
SALES TAX 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except: 
 Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is 
recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable. 
 Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.  
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of 
financial position. 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense in the period. 
STOCK OPTIONS 
The Group has established an equity-settled share option scheme under which employees and Directors may be granted stock options to acquire shares 
of Dialog. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the service period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which 
the options were granted. Expectations of early exercise are accounted for within the average life of the options. The Group applies IFRS 2 to all options 
granted after 7 November 2002 that had not been vested as of 1 January 2005. 
EXECUTIVES’ LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
The Group operates an equity settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Under this plan, key executives are eligible to share in a percentage of the value 
created for Shareholders in excess of an annual return hurdle measured over a four year performance period.  
Each participant in the LTIP is awarded a number of units which convert into Company shares according to the level of outperformance of the 
Company’s share price over the annual return hurdle. If this hurdle is not reached no units convert into Company shares.  
The fair value of the awards is recognised as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date, 
using a Monte Carlo Model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which awards are granted and is spread over the service period during 
which the key executives become unconditionally entitled to the awards.  
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST – TREASURY SHARES 
The Group has established an employee benefit trust. The employee benefit trust is separately administrated and is funded by the Group, which 
consolidates the assets, liabilities, income and expenses in its own accounts. The shares held by the trust are recorded at cost and are shown under 
“Employee stock purchase plan shares” in the statement of changes in Shareholders’ equity.

EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit (loss) for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of Dialog by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of Dialog by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued if all the securities or 
other contracts to issue ordinary shares were exercised. 
The weighted average number of shares outstanding is as follows: 
  
  2011
000
2010

Basic number of shares 62,873 60,313
Effect of dilutive options outstanding 3,838 4,528
Dilutive number of shares 66,711 64,841
  
 
The number of anti-dilutive share options outstanding was 615,744 (2010: 288,114). 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
The significant accounting estimates and assumptions are outlined below: 
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS 
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. In case of such an indicator, an 
impairment test is made. This requires the determination of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell respectively of the assets. Estimating the 
value in use requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the asset and also to choose a suitable discount rate in 
order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of such assets at 31 December 2011 was US$156,760,000 (2010: 
US$65,709,000). 
ESTIMATION OF USEFUL LIVES 
Although the estimates of the useful lives of certain assets, assumptions concerning the macroeconomic environment and developments in the industry 
in which the Group operate, and estimates of the discounted future cash flows are believed to be appropriate, changes in assumptions or circumstances 
could require changes in the analysis. This could lead to impairment losses in the future or – except in the case of goodwill – to reversals of impairment 
losses.   
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the 
fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, 
especially with respect to intangible assets.  
Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and 
information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from the sale of products, and engineering service sales, the acquired 
company’s brand awareness and discount rate. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such 
assumptions, estimates or actual results. Subject to these estimates are the fair values recorded as shown in Note 4 (Business Combinations).

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses 
can be utilised.  
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing of 
future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies. At yearend 2011, net deferred tax assets amounting to US$17,382,000 were 
recognised (2010: US$10,829,000). Impaired deferred tax assets at 31 December 2011 were nil (2010: US$2,079,000). 
Further information regarding the assessment of future taxable income is disclosed in note 5. 
SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AWARDS 
 Stock options 
Share-based payment transactions for stock options are measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair 
value of share-based payments is determined using the Black-Scholes model, which involves making assumptions about interest rates, volatilities, 
market conditions, dividend yield, expected life and fluctuation. Due to the nature of these assumptions, such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty. In 2011, the expense related to stock options was US$5,279,000 (2010: US$2,823,000). For further information on stock options 
please refer to note 20a and 20c. 
 Executives’ Long Term Incentive Plan 
The fair value of the awards is recognised as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date, using a Monte Carlo Model, based on standard inputs such as the Company’s share price, interest rate, and volatility of the Company’s share 
price, dividend yield and expected life. Due to the nature of these assumptions, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In 2011, an 
expense of US$1,050,000 was booked (2010: US$1,404,000). Further information regarding LTIP is provided in note 20b and 20c. 
CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
For the determination of revenue and costs for customer-specific research and development contracts, management judgement is required. It is, 
therefore, necessary to determine the stage of completion based on the progress made towards completing the particular project, as well as the 
contract revenue and the contract costs. Besides an advance payment received from one customer, at 31 December 2011 no receivables or liabilities 
from constructions contracts were outstanding (2010: nil). 
SELF-DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy mentioned above, i.e. they are recorded on a cost basis. However, initial 
capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product 
development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. In determining the probable future 
economic benefits of the self-developed intangible asset, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, 
discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits. At 31 December 2011, the carrying amount of capitalised development costs was 
US$16,041,000 (2010: US$3,235,000). 
Actual results may differ from all of the above judgements and estimates.

4. BUSINESS COMBINATION 
ACQUISITIONS IN 2011 
On 10 February 2011, Dialog Semiconductor Plc acquired 100% of the voting shares of SiTel Semiconductor B.V. (“SiTel”) (now Dialog Semiconductor 
B.V.), an unlisted company headquartered and incorporated in the Netherlands and a leader in short-range wireless, digital cordless and VoIP technology. 
Dialog acquired SiTel in order to expand its product portfolio with short-range wireless and VoIP based internet connectivity products. This will allow 
Dialog to develop new products for these markets as well as to cross-sell Dialog’s existing Power Management technology to SiTel’s customer base. The 
acquisition significantly expands Dialog’s addressable market targeting high growth wireless personal devices.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
   
 
68  Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 4 | Consolidated financial statements and notes 
 
The goodwill of US$27,358,000 comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition. Furthermore, we expect additional value from 
the acquisition in respect of entry to new markets, internationalisation, cross-selling opportunities and customer diversification. We were not able to 
allocate the goodwill to our Cash Generating Units which consists of our four operating segments as the synergies and other effects described above 
cannot be measured yet, as due to the timing and volatile business environment no reliable and sufficient information was available at year end 2011. 
As a result, no goodwill impairment test was prepared for the year ended 31 December 2011. No indications of goodwill impairment were apparent at 
year end.  
The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  
From the date of the acquisition, SiTel has contributed US$108,780,000 of revenue and US$8,997,000 of net profit after tax to the Group. If the 
combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenues would have been US$120,197,000 and the profit after tax would have been 
US$6,550,000.

Although Dialog is a UK company, its principal operations are located in Germany. Accordingly, the following information is based on German corporate 
tax law. 
The tax rate for its German subsidiary is 15%; considering the impact of the solidarity surcharge of 5.5%, the federal corporate tax rate amounts to 
15.825%. Combining the federal corporate tax rate with the trade tax rate of 12.551%, the combined statutory tax rate of the German subsidiary is 
28.376%.

[1] Including an amount of US$2,910,000 (2010: US$3,126,000) for state tax loss carryforwards 
[2] The amount consists of US$10,829,000) recognised deferred tax assets and US$2,079,000 deferred tax assets impaired in 2005 
The amount of deductible temporary differences and unused tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet is 
US$95,382,000 (2010: US$155,434,000). 
In assessing whether the deferred tax assets can be used, management considers the probability that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be 
realised. The utilization of deferred tax assets depends upon generating taxable profit during the periods in which those temporary differences become 
deductible or tax-loss carryforwards can be utilised. Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, 
benefits that could be realised from available tax planning strategies and other positive and negative factors in making this assessment. 
The Group recorded the fourth consecutive year of positive net income in 2011. Therefore, based on the expected positive net result for the near future, 
the management concluded to recognise deferred tax assets in an amount of US$17,382,000 (2010: US$10,829,000). The assessment was based on 
the business plan for 2012 and beyond.  
The utilization of further tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences is subject to the achievement of positive income in periods which are beyond 
the company’s current business plan and therefore this utilization is uncertain. Consequently no deferred tax assets were recognised for these losses and 
temporary differences.  
The state tax loss carryforwards in the US will expire between 2012 and 2024; other tax loss carryforwards have no expiration date. 
Included in impaired deferred tax assets is an amount of US$1,105,000 (2010: US$1,156,000) (the increase results from foreign currency adjustments 
and the change of the corporation tax rate in the UK) in relation to tax credits in the UK. This asset may be recovered against future taxable profits 
derived from certain overseas dividends for the company concerned. 
The amount shown under “income tax receivables” in the statement of financial position includes a corporation tax refund claim of the Group’s German 
subsidiary. The total amount the German subsidiary is entitled to receive amounts to €414,000 to be paid out in ten equal amounts during 2008 to 
2017. The amount shown within the non-current assets represents the discounted part of the claim that is due after 2012. The amount that will be paid 
in 2012 is shown within the current assets.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-60-day terms. 
As described in note 24, in 2007 the Group entered into a selective factoring agreement. The amount shown as receivables from the factoring 
agreement represents a 15% retainer kept by the factoring bank against sold receivables. The retainer is released only once the receivable is fully paid by 
the customer, at the latest, 120 days after the receivable becomes due or if the insurance event occurs. The amounts are non-interest bearing and are 
generally on 30-60-day terms. 
The recorded trade accounts receivable for which an impairment has been recognised, was US$1,180,000 and US$1,410,000 at 31 December 2011 and 
2010, respectively. The related allowance for doubtful accounts was US$1,180,000 and US$1,410,000 at 31 December 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The deposits for hedging contracts are an advance settlement for hedging instruments with a negative fair value. The deposits are interest bearing with 
1% below the current base rate and are offset with amounts due when the hedge is settled.  
The amount shown under hedging instruments includes the fair value of derivative financial instruments used for cash flow hedges. The Group is 
exposed to currency risks in the course of its operating activities. These risks are reduced by the use of forward currency exchange contracts. 
The Group has clear guidelines as to the use of those derivatives, and compliance is constantly monitored. For further information on the Group’s 
hedging policy please see note 24.

A key element of the additions in 2010 was the purchase of power management technology through an asset transaction from Diodes Zetex GmbH. As 
part of this transaction, Dialog has acquired specific Diodes intellectual property rights. The expected weighted average useful life of the acquired 
intangible assets is four years. A key element of the 2011 additions was the acquisition of SiTel Semiconductor B.V. In connection with this acquisition 
the company acquired goodwill, internally developed intangible assets, patents and customer related intangible assets, such customer relationship and 
order backlog. For further information, please refer to Note 4.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES 
The employee stock purchase plan shares contain the acquisition cost of the shares held by the employee benefit trust (the “Trust”). Please refer to note 
20. At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the Trust held 1,267,322 and 3,995,031 shares respectively. These shares are legally issued and 
outstanding for accounting purposes and accordingly have been reported in the caption “employee stock purchase plan shares” as a reduction of 
shareholders’ equity. 
19. PENSION SCHEME 
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The pension cost charge for the year represents contributions payable by the Group to the 
funds and amounted to US$3,686,000 (2010: US$1,360,000). At 31 December 2011, contributions amounting to US$78,000 (2010: US$52,000) were 
payable to the funds and are included in other current liabilities. Pension costs also include payments to the state funded pension plan in Germany in 
the amount of US$1,999,000 (2010: US$1,640,000). 
20. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
A) STOCK OPTION PLANS 
On 7 August 1998, the Group adopted a stock option plan (the “Plan”) under which employees, the executive management and the Executive Directors 
may be granted from time to time, at the discretion of the Board, stock options to acquire up to 3,840,990 shares of the Group’s authorised but 
unissued ordinary shares. On 16 May 2002 the Shareholders of the Group approved a resolution increasing the maximum amount of unexercised stock 
options which may be granted by the Group at any time, to 15% of Dialog’s issued share capital, from time to time on a diluted basis. At 31 December 
2011, 11,482,752 shares could be issued. 
Unless otherwise determined by the board, stock options granted to employees are granted with an exercise price not less than the quoted price at the 
date of grant, and vest during the service period of the employee without any further vesting conditions. Stock options granted before 31 October 2006 
have terms of ten years and vest over periods of one or five years from the grant date. On 19 June 2006 the Board amended the stock option plan 
under which stock options now have a seven-year life and vest monthly over a period of one to 48 months. The new stock options may not be exercised 
until they have been held for one calendar year from the grant date. The new rules were implemented on grants made on or after 31 October 2006. 
The stock option plan was extended by the Board in 2008 to expire 6 August 2018.  
At the 2006 Annual General Meeting, Shareholders approved a stock option plan for Non-Executive Directors. Each Non-Executive Director was entitled 
to an initial grant of 50,000 options vesting over four years and each year thereafter, soon after each Annual Shareholder Meeting, a further 20,000 
options vesting over 12 months were granted. Options are exercisable at the market price prevailing at the date of grant. At the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting the Shareholders voted against the continuance of this share option plan. Consequently, no share options were granted to the Non-Executive 
Directors in 2010.  
  
18. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND OTHER RESERVES CONTINUED  
 
 
   
 
 81
 
At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, Shareholders approved a change of the fee structure for Non-Executive Directors. According to the new structure 
2/3 of the total fees will be delivered in cash with 1/3 of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ annual total fees will be delivered in Company 
equity. The number of shares will be calculated using the average 30 day share price preceding the date of allocation. Shares will be delivered in the 
form of conditional shares or options (an exercise price has been attached at Euro 15 cents). Each individual shall be entitled to sell their shares, or 
exercise their options, if any, no earlier than the day preceding the third AGM following the grant (unless specific circumstances such as a change of 
control apply).  
The fair value of all grants in the two-year period ended 31 December 2011 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expectations 
of early exercise are considered in the determination of the expected life of the options. The Group does not have adequate historical development of 
the share price, particularly as a result of material unusual effects in the stock market in recent years. Furthermore, implicit volatility cannot be 
determined since none of the Group’s options are actively traded. The Group has therefore based its calculation of expected volatility on an average the 
volatility of the Dialog Semiconductor Plc share and the historical development of other companies in its business segment. 
The following assumptions were used for stock option grants for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010: 
  
  2011 2010
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
Expected volatility 39% - 46% 41% - 49%
Risk free interest rate 4.0% 2.3%
Expected life (in years) 2.0 - 6.0 2.0 - 6.0
Weighted average share price during the year (in €) 14.36 10.87
Weighted average share price for Option grants (in €) 13.71 9.06
Weighted average exercise price (in €) 13.55 9.06
Weighted-average fair value (in €) 4.80 3.39

B) EXECUTIVES’ LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) 
The Group also operates the Dialog Semiconductor Plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in April 2008. Under the LTIP , key executives are eligible to share in a percentage of the value created for shareholders in excess of an annual 
return hurdle measured over a four-year performance period (this was originally a three-year period, extended by one year at the Annual General 
Meeting in April 2009). This value is delivered to a participant in the form of a series of nil-cost options which can be exercised within five years of the 
date of grant. The first award under the LTIP was made on 8 May 2008. 
In 2010 a new award under LTIP was made to selected new and existing members of the executive management. These awards are shown under 
“Second award” in the table below. In 2011, no further awards under the LTIP plan were made. 
The fair value of the LTIP , where the number of nil-cost options granted to an individual is contingent upon the returns to Shareholders, was calculated 
using a Monte Carlo simulation model. As a portion of each award is capable of vesting at three separate measurement dates each tranche has been 
valued separately in accordance with IFRS2. 
The fair values used in the calculations are as follows: 
    
  First award Second award 
Inputs Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 LTIP extension Tranche 1 Tranche 2
Share price at grant date €1.40 €1.40 €1.40 €4.08 €10.51 €10.51
Exercise price £0.10 £0.10 £0.10 £0.10 £0.10 £0.10
Expected life (years) 0.64 1.64 2.64 2.35 0.54 1.54
Expected volatility 40% 40% 40% 42% 42% 42%
Risk-free-interest-rate 4.8202% 4.8202% 4.8202% 1.4900% 0.4820% 0.7040%
    
 
Expected volatility has been determined on the same basis as the input into the fair value calculation for share options granted during the year. 
MEASUREMENT DATE 31 JANUARY 2010 
The measurement share price at 31 January 2010 (average share price over the prior 30 days) was €9.8942. As this price was above the return hurdle 
for January 2010 of €1.82 (prior year return hurdle of €1.62+12.5%), 3,055,064 nil cost option grants were approved by the board on 4th February 
2010, with 25% exercisable from 22 February 2010 and the remaining 75% exercisable for 4 years from 21 February 2011.  
MEASUREMENT DATE 31 JANUARY 2011  
The measurement share price at 31 January 2011 (average share price over the prior 30 days) was €17.6632. As this price was above the return hurdle 
for January 2010 of €11.1310 (prior year measurement share price of €9.8942+12.5%), 1,575,327 nil cost option grants were approved by the board 
on 18 February 2011, all exercisable for 5 years from 18 February 2011.

23. SEGMENTAL REPORTING  
Following the provisions of IFRS 8, reportable operating segments are identified based on the “management approach”. The management approach 
requires external segment reporting based on the Group’s internal organisational and management structure and on internal financial reporting to the 
chief operating decision maker, which considered the Group as being the Board of Management. 
The Group reports on four operating segments, which are independently managed by bodies responsible for the respective segments depending on the 
nature of products offered. The identification of Company components as operating segments is based in particular on the existence of business unit 
managers who report directly to the Board of Management of Dialog and who are responsible for the performance of the segment under their charge. 
Following the change in IFRS 8.23, the Group does no longer report assets and liabilities as only inventories are reported to the chief operating decision 
maker. Prior-year figures have been adjusted accordingly. 
A) OPERATING SEGMENTS 
The Group’s operating segments are: 
AUDIO AND POWER MANAGEMENT 
This segment includes our power management and audio chips especially designed to meet the needs of the wireless systems markets.  
DISPLAY SYSTEMS 
The products in this segment include a range of advanced driver technologies for low power display applications – from PMOLEDs, to electronic paper 
and MEMS displays. 
AUTOMOTIVE AND INDUSTRIAL  
In the automotive and industrial market our products address the safety, management and control of electronic systems in cars and for industrial 
applications. 
CONNECTIVITY 
The activities of this segment include short-range wireless, digital cordless and VoIP technology. The new Connectivity segment includes the operating 
segment of our newly acquired subsidiary SiTel Semiconductor B.V. SiTel was acquired on 10 February 2011; therefore its results are consolidated from 
this date.

The operating losses recorded in the reconciliation column for the year ended 31 December 2011of US$12,112,000 (2010: US$9,519,000) are primarily 
resulting from stock option expenses, bonus payments for employees, expenses in relation to the Long Term Incentive Plan introduced in 2008, sales 
discounts for early payments and the costs of the holding company. Additionally in 2011 the BenQ cash settlement in the amount of US$2.1 million was 
included.  
Investments comprise additions to property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. 
In 2011 and 2010 the Group had no inter-segment sales, income, expenses, receivables, payables or provisions. 
There are no differences between the measurements of the reportable segments profits and losses, assets and liabilities and the entity’s profit and losses, 
assets and liabilities.

24. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTS AND POLICIES 
VULNERABILITY DUE TO CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT RISK CONCENTRATIONS 
The Group’s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Group’s future operating results and 
cause actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not limited to, the highly cyclical nature of both the semiconductor and 
wireless communications industries, dependence on certain customers and the ability to obtain an adequate supply of sub-micron wafers. 
The Group's products are generally utilised in the wireless and automotive industries. The Group generates a substantial portion of its revenue from the 
wireless communications market, which accounted for 70% and 83% of its total revenue for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, 
respectively. 
The Group’s revenue base is diversified by geographic region and by individual customer. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates influence the 
Group’s results of operations. The Group’s sales, purchases of raw materials and manufacturing services are primarily denominated in US$. The Group 
also has foreign currency exchange risks with respect to its net investments in foreign subsidiaries and branches in the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore. Fluctuations in the currencies of these countries could have a significant impact on the Group’s reported results from 
operations. 
The Group depends on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues, and the loss of one or more of these customers 
may result in a significant decline in future revenue.  
During 2011, one customer individually accounted for more than 10% of the Group's revenues. Total revenues from this customer were 
US$321,367,000. Net receivables from this customer were US$28,311,000 at 31 December 2011. This customer is part of the Audio & Power 
Management Segment. 
During 2010, three customers individually accounted for more than 10% of the Group's revenues. Total revenues from these three customers were 
US$222,550,000. Net receivables from these three customers were US$7,051,000 at 31 December 2010. The three customers are part of the Audio & 
Power Management Segment (for further information please see Section 2 – Principal customers). 
The Group is performing on-going credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition. 
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term deposits. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments which mainly comprise 
trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations. 
The Group also entered into derivative transactions (forward currency contracts). The purpose is to manage the currency risks arising from the Group’s 
operations. 
It is, and has been throughout 2011 and 2010, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken. 
    
 
 
   
 
 91
 
Exposure to currency, interest rate and credit risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies 
for managing each of these risks which are summarised below: 
MARKET RISK 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices 
comprise three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include 
loans and borrowings, deposits, available-for-sale investments, and derivative financial instruments. 
INTEREST RISK 
The Group earns interest from deposits and uses money market deposits with highly rated financial institutions. During the year, the Group has held 
cash on deposit with a range of maturities from one week to one month. This can vary in view of changes in the underlying currency’s interest rates and 
the Group’s cash requirements. 
The Group pays interest on amounts received in connection with the factoring agreement as prescribed below. 
The Group has no long-term debt outstanding under short-term credit facilities as at 31 December 2011 (2010: nil). 
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest income using a mix of fixed and variable interest rate debts. In order to achieve this policy, the Group invests 
in highly liquid funds having a matching investment strategy. Once the operating business has been financed, short-term excess funds are invested in 
floating interest rate securities. Only short-term deposits bear fixed interest rates. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s 
profit before tax as well as the Group’s equity:

2010     
  65 881 881
  (65) (881) (881)
  
 
CURRENCY RISK 
The main functional currency within the Group and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements is the US$. Accordingly, foreign 
exchange risks arise from transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities, the functional currency of which is not the US$. The currencies giving rise to 
these exposure risks are primarily the Euro and Pound Sterling. The majority of the Group’s revenue and material expenses are denominated in US$. The 
majority of other operating expenses are denominated in Euros and Pounds Sterling. The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure 
arises from the sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. In 2011 and 2010 nearly all the Group’s 
sales were denominated in US$. 
The Group uses forward currency contracts as well as certain deposits (together referred to as the “hedging instruments”) to eliminate the currency 
exposure of recurring expected payments, such as salaries, wages and office rents non-US$ denominated. The hedging instruments must be the same 
currency as the hedged item. 
It is the Group’s policy not to enter into forward contracts nor classify deposits as non-derivative hedging instruments until a firm commitment is in place 
and to maximise hedge effectiveness by negotiating the terms of hedge instruments to match the terms of the hedged item. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of 
the Group’s profit before tax (resulting from changes in the fair value of monetary assets, excluding securities, and liabilities) and the Group’s equity 
(resulting from changes in the fair value of deposits designated as cash flow hedges).

A risk analysis for the Group’s securities was done separately, based on the inherent historic volatility of the specific securities, see below. 
CREDIT RISK 
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and certain financing activities. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third 
parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable 
balances are monitored on an on-going basis, with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Regarding the risk concentration 
please see above, “vulnerability due to certain significant considerations”. 
In order to finance its growth the Group entered into two factoring agreements with reputable financial institutions. The maximum amount of cash that 
can be received under these agreements is US$42,000,000 (2010: US$25,000,000), the increase represents a newly signed agreement for Dialog B.V., 
the company acquired in 2011. The agreements, which comprise receivables from selective customers, significantly reduce the underlying credit risk 
because the financial institutions assume all credit risks associated with the collection of the receivables financed under the programmes. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash, cash equivalents and restricted, would arise 
from default by counterparty. 
LIQUIDITY RISK 
The Group uses quarterly cash flow forecasts to monitor its liquidity risk. It takes financial investments and financial assets (e.g. trade accounts receivable 
and other financial assets) into consideration, as well as projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s objective is to minimise interest expense by 
avoiding the use of short-term bank liabilities or bank overdrafts within the Group. 
At 31 December 2011, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$113,590,000 (2010: US$158,200,000). 
  
   
 
 
   
 
 93
 
The Group’s policy is to structure its maturities of current financial assets within the Group to meet 100% of the respective maturities of the liabilities. 
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2011, based on contractual undiscounted payments:

At 31 December 2011, the Group had unused short-term credit lines of US$5 million (2010: US$5 million) and a multi-currency revolving credit line 
facility of £10 million (2010: £10 million) There were no amounts outstanding under these credit lines at 31 December 2011 (2010: nil). 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy and strong capital ratios in order to support its business 
and strategies for growth. The company is considering its total equity as capital. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust its capital 
structure, the Group may generally issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ending 31 
December 2011 and 31 December 2010. 
The Group monitors capital using an equity ratio (total equity divided by total assets). The equity ratio as of 31 December 2011 was 76.4% (2010: 
81.1%). Capital includes net Shareholders’ equity. The Group’s policy is to finance business development and growth if at all possible with equity rather 
than long-term liabilities. It is, therefore, also its policy to keep a strong equity ratio. This policy will be reconsidered as soon as sustainable profits are 
earned in order to achieve leverage.

For the year ended 31 December 2011 
HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
At 31 December 2011, the Group held deposits (referred to as the “hedging instruments”) designated as hedges of firm commitments in Euros. At 31 
December 2010, the Group held deposits (referred to as the “hedging instruments”) designated as hedges of firm commitments and forecast 
transactions in Euros and Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. 
The hedging instruments are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of contractual cash flows, principally resulting from wages and salaries, and 
rental payments with the aim of eliminating the currency risk by transforming these cash flows from Euros or Pounds Sterling or Japanese Yen into US 
dollars. The fair values of the forward exchange contracts which equal the book values are as follows:

Deposits 2,199 – 7,630 –
  
 
The critical terms of the deposits have been set to match the terms of the hedged cash flows. 
The cash flow hedges of the expected future cash flows in each month from January 2012 to December 2012 and January 2011 to December 2011 
respectively were assessed to be highly effective and, at 31 December 2011, a net unrealised loss of US$6,372,000 was included in other comprehensive 
income in respect of these cash flows (2010: gain of US$69,000). During the financial year 2011 a net loss of US$3,768,000 (2010: loss of 
US$2,390,000) was recognised in other comprehensive income and a net gain of US$3,058,000 (2010: loss of US$2,831,000) was reclassified from 
other comprehensive income and recognised in profit and loss. The months of occurrence of the cash flows are the same as the month when the 
income statement is affected. 
The following tables show the contractual maturities of the payments for which deposits are used as hedging instruments, i.e., when the hedged item 
will be recognised in profit or loss.

25. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 
For the relationship between the parent company, Dialog Semiconductor Plc, and its subsidiaries please see note 2. 
Related parties are comprised of seven (2010: seven) non-executive members of the Board of Directors and ten (2010: ten) members of the executive 
management which are named in the management and governance section. These are the only related parties of the Group.  
All transactions with related parties are carried out at arm´s length. 
COMPENSATION OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL OF THE GROUP 
For the composition of our key management please see management and governance beginning on page 29. Compensation of key management 
personnel of the Group is as follows: 
  
  2011
US$000
2010
US$000
Short term employee benefits 4,129 4,319
Post-employment benefits

Share based payments 1,180 1,439
  5,479 5,923
  
[1] The amounts include payments for defined contribution plans. 
 
COMPENSATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS  
The compensation of Non-Executive Directors was US$645,080 (2010: US$521,000). As at 31 December 2011 the amount of US$67,000 for Board 
member fees was outstanding (2010: US$23,000). For further information please see the Directors’ remuneration report within the management and 
governance section on pages 35 to 37. 
OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
In 2011 and 2010 there were no other transactions with related parties. None of the related parties has a major influence in one of the Group’s major 
suppliers or customers.  
26. BENQ SETTLEMENT 
In the second quarter of 2011, the company received an unexpected cash settlement of US$2.1 million. As the allocation of the payment was not 
confirmed by the paying party, we were only able to allocate it in Q3 to receivables which had been previously written down and revenues that had not 
been recognised in 2006 as a result of the insolvency of BenQ Mobile. The amount represents 30% of the original claim to BenQ Mobile. Of this 
amount, US$1.8 million were classified as revenue and US$0.3 million were classified as other operating income. The amount shown as revenue 
represents prior period revenue. As one of the criteria for revenue recognition under IFRS was not met, for this amount the related revenue was not 
accounted for in 2006. The amount shown as other operating income was previously recognised as revenue in the periods preceding the insolvency but 
the underlying receivables were written down against other operating expenses. 
27. SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
There are no known events after the date of the Statement of Financial Position that require disclosure.

FINANCIAL GLOSSARY
AGM Annual General Meeting.
CAGR Compound Annual Growth Rate: a method of assessing the 
average growth of a value over time.
Cash flow The primary purpose of a statement of cash flow is to provide 
relevant information about the cash receipts and cash payments of an 
enterprise during a period. It helps to assess the enterprise’s ability to 
generate positive future net cash flows. A statement of cash flows shall 
explain the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period by 
classifying cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem 
from operating, investing or financing activities.
Cash flow from operating activities includes all transactions and other 
events that are not defined as investing or financing activities in paragraphs. 
Operating activities generally involve producing and delivering goods and 
providing services. Cash flows from operating activities are generally the 
cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the 
determination of net income.
Comprehensive income The purpose of reporting comprehensive income 
is to report a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise that results 
from recognised transactions and other economic events of the period 
other than transactions with owners such as capital increases or dividends. 
An example of items affecting comprehensive income is foreign currency 
translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating an entity’s 
financial statements in a foreign currency into the reporting currency.
Corporate Governance is the system by which business corporations are 
directed and controlled. The Corporate Governance structure specifies the 
distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in 
the corporation, such as the Board, managers, shareholders and other 
stakeholders, and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions 
on corporate affairs. By doing this, it also provides the structure through 
which the company’s objectives are set, and the means of attaining those 
objectives and monitoring performance.
Deferred taxes Deferred tax assets or liabilities are temporary differences 
between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the 
financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future 
years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or 
settled, respectively.
Derivative financial instruments A financial instrument that derives its 
value from the price or expected price of an underlying asset (e.g. a security, 
currency or bond).
Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders. When  
a company earns a profit, that money can be put to two uses: it can either 
be reinvested in the business (called retained earnings) or it can be paid  
to the shareholders of the company as a dividend.
